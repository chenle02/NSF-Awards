The Johns Hopkins University will be connected to the Suranet by a 56 kilobit
per second dedicated communication line. The connection will be implemented by
the Suranet management using the TCP/IP communication protocols suite. This will
provide Johns Hopkins University with a medium speed connection to the NSF
Backbone network allowing potential access to all six supercomputer centers
supported by the foundation. It will also provide an interconnection to other
researcher nationwide which will greatly increase the ability of dispered
scientific researchers to collaborate on large, multidiscipline research
projects.
