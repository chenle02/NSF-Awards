This project addresses the problem of determining the best way to map the
larger-alphabet Reed-Solomon codes into binary codes, thus generating binary
codes with important algebraic properties. Vector expansions with various bases
will be evaluated, especially those which produce self-orthogonal binary codes.
The burst-error correcting capabilities of the codes and complexity of decoders
will be examined.
