The research to be performed under this grant involves searching for new
physics effects at the highest energies available to experiments. The ultimate
goal of this work is to find the Higgs particle. This particle, which has not
yet been detected experimentally, is thought to be responsible for the
generation of mass. The experimenters also seek to discover the limitations of
present theories in particle physics.
