9529047 Zeikus This project is on research to study aspects of biocatalysis and
thermostability for extremely thermophlic xylose (glucose) isomerases (GIs). The
research will focus on GIs from the thermophilic and the hyperthermophilic
eubacterial genera Thermoanaerobacterium and Thermotoga, and will attempt to
identify the structural bases for thermal stability and differing catalytic
activities for this family of enzymes. In addition, these enzymes will be model
systems for studying substrate binding and the role of metal ions in the enzymes
structure and function. The sequences and crystal structures of these enzymes
will be compared to the less thermostable GIs. ***
