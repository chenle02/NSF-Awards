The proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants
in the research program "Operator Algebras: Dynamics and Interactions" that will
be held at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain from March
1 - July 21, 2017. Additional information is available on the CRM website
http://www.crm.cat/en/Activities/Curs_2016-2017/Pages/IRP-OAL.aspx

The CRM program is motivated by an important and recent complete classification,
in K-theoretic data, of a broad class of C*-algebras with finite noncommutative
topological dimension. The program will capitalize on this development by
concentrating efforts on those nuclear C*-algebras arising from and with
applications to topological dynamical systems and related areas such as
topological groupoids. It is important that the next generation of U.S.
researchers be informed of the state-of-the art and future of this field. This
award will enable the participation of graduate students, junior researchers,
underrepresented groups and other U.S. based researchers without support to
participate in this meeting. This program will have significant impact in the
field of C*-algebras and the future careers of junior investigators.
