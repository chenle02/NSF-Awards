0320898&lt;br/&gt;Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI) Program grant supports the acquisition and of a low-vacuum scanning
electron microscope (SEM) or environmental SEM (ESEM) that will form the basis
for a regional center for electron beam microscopy in the Department of Geology
at the University of Akron. The facility will support broad research efforts in
the geosciences, cell biology, chemistry, invertebrate paleontology and zoology,
and materials science and engineering by Akron faculty and students as well as
off campus faculty and students from regional institutions including Kent State,
Case Western Reserve and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. A new FEI
(formerly Philips) Quanta 200 ESEM will supercede an existing but aging JEOL SEM
(vintage 1985) at the University of Akron. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
