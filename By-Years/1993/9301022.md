9301022 Stahara The specific modules of our Progressive Modular Model (PMM) to
be developed include a coupled solar wind-magnetosheath-magnetosphere module
that incorporates: (1) several recently-developed MHD computational models for
predicting the global solar wind- magnetosheath plasma flow past the terrestrial
magnetosphere and, (2) a powerful new computational magnetospheric boundary
element model that is capable of determining the shape and location of the
first-order, force-balanced magnetopause surface that consistently couples the
magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma and magnetic fields. Such a capability
is crucial to beginning a rational study of the transport process associated
with entry of solar wind mass, momentum, energy and magnetic and electric fluxes
into the magnetosphere. The proposed model represents an important first step in
trying to explore and quantify to what form the microscopic transport processes,
which are not determinable by MHD theory, locally alter the ideal MHD plasma and
field boundary conditions at the magnetospause to set the rates and the overall
physics of the processes that couple the magnetosheath plasma and magnetic
fields to the magnetosphere. The model achieves this by providing the capability
for determining the coupled global mangetosheath- magnetospheric solutions in
which boundary-normal magnetic field and plasma velocity components are
systematically imposed locally at the mangetopause and then examining: (1) how
both the local and global magnetosheath and mangetospheric solutions on either
side of the magnetopause change, (2) how these effects vary with changing
upstream solar wind conditions and, (3) how the magnetosphere responds globally
to these variations. ***
