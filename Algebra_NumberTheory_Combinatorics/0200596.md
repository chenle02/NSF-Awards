The investigator studies problems in enumerative combinatorics related to
permutations, symmetric functions, and lattice paths. One of the investigator's
approaches is to apply Richard Stanley's theory of P-partitions and its
generalizations to the study of descent algebras of symmetric and related
groups. Several other problems related to the enumeration of permutations by
descents are also studied. The investigator also studies a generalization of
two-stack-sortable permutations leading to a symmetric-function refinement of
the formula of West (proved by Zeilberger) for counting these permutations, and
several problems involving the enumeration of lattice paths.

Enumerative combinatorics involves counting mathematical objects with given
properties. It has applications to computer science, physics, and chemistry, as
well as to other areas of mathematics, such as algebra, probability and
statistics, topology, analysis, and number theory. The investigator's long-range
goal is to develop, extend, and systematize the methods of enumerative
combinatorics, and the problems studied will contribute towards this goal.
