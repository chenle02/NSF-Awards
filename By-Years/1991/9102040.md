This project will design and experiment with a new generation operating system
that supports the construction of distributed applications from a collection of
building block pieces. The approach is based on the observation that
communication objects are the key to accessing services and resources in a
distributed environment. In such an environment, users specify what services and
resources they want to access, and the operating system dynamically loads the
communication objects necessary to access those services and resources. At the
heart of the system is an object infrastructure. This infrastructure has two
important features. First, it is independent of the user/kernel boundary. That
is, the component objects can reside in either the kernel or in one or more user
address spaces, and objects can easily be migrated between address spaces. Thus,
new objects can be built and tested in user address spaces for protection
reasons, and later migrated into the kernel for performance reasons. Second, the
kernel itself is dynamically configurable. That is, objects can be loaded into
(and deleted from) the kernel at runtime as required by the active applications.
This feature means that kernel size is not a dominant factor--all trusted
communication objects can reside in the kernel while they are being used. Within
this context, the proposal has two major themes: -Designing operating system
support for dynamically composable communication services, including
implementation techniques that support fast communication on shared-memory
multiprocessors -Investigating various decompositions of distributed systems
into primitive building blocks, and understanding the principles that govern how
those building blocks are composed to provide higher- level services.
