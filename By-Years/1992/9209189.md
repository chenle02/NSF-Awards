Dr. Boehmer will generate the first electron-positron plasma ever produced in
the laboratory. Plasma parameters are expected to be qualitatively different
from conventional electron-ion plasmas, in particular electromagnetic wave
propagation should carry a polarization signature distinctly different from
ordinary plasmas.
