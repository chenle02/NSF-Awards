HRD-9622321 This information dissemination award project, Visualizing Women in
Mathematics, the Physical Sciences, and Technology: The Role of Personal Choice
and Inspiration in a Scientist's Life, targets young women, particularly at the
high school level. The project is to result in a series of gallery-quality
posters of women in SEM, a study guide targeted at high school girls with
biographical information about those depicted, along with educational hands-on
activities related to their respective fields of expertise, and other
educational resources. Information in the study guide is to be part of what is
to available on the World Wide Web. Short videotape interviews with the women
also are to be produced. The project seeks to humanize the image of science and
the scientist to encourage young women students to see science and research as
possible careers for them. The use of high quality, attractive and accessible
contemporary art and graphics, along with the use of other media, is expected to
further the perception of science and technology as inviting, exciting,
rewarding career choices for women.
