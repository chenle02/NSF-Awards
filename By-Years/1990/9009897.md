Conventional database systems process all the data (related to a query) before
providing a response. This project develops new query processing methods
suitable for the database management systems (DBMS) when they are to respond to
estimation, error- constrained and time-constrained queries, or when there is no
need or there is not enough time to process all the data related to the query.
This approach incorporates sampling and sample size determination mechanisms
into DBMS so that, with a given user's requirement (e.g., timing or error
constraints), the DBMS can determine an appropriate amount of sample tuples that
need to be processed in order to produce acceptable estimations for aggregate
relational queries. The goal of this research is to provide efficient methods
for DBMS that will be able to effectively support time- and error- constrained
environments, and serve for other statistical purposes. Furthermore, these
facilities will also provide ordinary users with convenient working environments
enabling the users to get statistical information about the database as soon (or
as precise) as they wish by specifying the timing constraints, sampling
fractions or error constraints. Such statistically enhanced DBMSs will find a
wide variety of applications.
