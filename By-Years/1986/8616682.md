This project is an introduction to research in the area on amphiphilic
association structures and deals specifically with a recent discovered
(micellar) amphiphilic polymer structure. The expected structures combine the
micro-compartmentalization of normal and inverse micelles with the high
stability of polymerized systems. These new structures provide a potential for
new catalytic systems similar to enzymes, for new membrane systems for
separation of products from catalytic water splitting reactions, and for
initiators for polymerization systems. The basis for combination structures in
this project is the hexalkyl (1st generation) starburst polyethyleneimine tris
quarternary ammonium iodide (HAAI), a compound which will be synthesized using
the known methods for hexamethyl (1st generation) starburst polyethyleneimine.
The compound HAAI is, per se, a polymerized inverse micelle and its
solutilization capacity as well as its catalytic action on ester hydrolysis are
essential information.
