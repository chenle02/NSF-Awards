This project involves the integration of computer-aided design methods and
computer-aided manufacturing for the production of parts with complex contoured
surface shapes. Piecewise continuous rational polynomials will be investigated
as suitable functions for both design and manufacture of radial plate cams. The
objectives of this research are to design cam contours with high order surface
continuity, maintain this continuity during the manufacturing phase, and test
the dynamic performance of the cams. The test cams will be compared to control
samples prepared using conventional design and manufacturing techniques. This
research will determine whether typical production cams can benefit from
improvements in geometric design combined with improved manufacturing methods.
Interpolation or approximation of part contours between the design and
manufacturing phases will be eliminated, using polynomial control algorithms
which discretize the shape function to limits within the resolution of the
machine tool during the manufacturing phase. Similar techniques may be applied
to a wide range of parts with complex surface shapes.
