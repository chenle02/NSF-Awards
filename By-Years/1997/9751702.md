The Department of Mathematics is completing the implementation of a program to
provide computer-laboratory-enhanced Calculus I and II to all of its science and
mathematics students. The program is fully operational for Calculus II. This
project provides the additional computer laboratory capacity to implement the
Calculus I component. In doing so, the project demonstrates a means of expanding
networked, instructional computing laboratory capacity which is an alternative
to the conversion of general instructional space. This expansion is done through
a portable system that extends extant, fixed laboratories through a wireless
Ethernet technology. The system permits networked instructional laboratory
environments to be set up on an hourly basis in general classroom settings
without renovation or cabling.
