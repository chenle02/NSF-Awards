PI will perform U-Pb (uranium-lead) dating of single-crystals and small
multigrain fractions of phenocrystic zircon from well- characterized
K-bentonites (ancient volcanic ash beds) in the Ordovician and Silurian
stratotypes of Sweden, Britain and the central United States for the purpose of
precise time-scale calibration and biostratigraphic correlation. The proposed
research will produce an internally consistent and accurate absolute chronology
of the Middle Ordovician through Upper Silurian stratotypes of Britain,and
permit direct comparison of coeval but different fauna in North America,
Scandinavia and the United Kingdom.
