This research is to perform a series of forward modelling experiments to study
the effect of rough and anisotropic upper mantle structure on long-period
seismic waveforms, and data experiments to infer the size and extent of such
structure. This includes the synthesis of seismic anisotropy models derived from
simple convective flows using the theory for lattice-preferred orientation. This
will be combined with finite amplitude thermal convection models and free
oscillation calculations to generate synthetic seismograms for anisotropic
aspherical models derived from physical first principles. Objectives of the
study include an understanding of the tradeoff between rough lateral structure
and anelasticity in long-period surface-wave data, the tradeoff between
isotropic and anisotropic mantle structure, and the bias introduced into smooth
tomographic inversions by rough and/or anisotropic velocity structure.
