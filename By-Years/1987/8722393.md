Concurrent computing or parallel processing lies at the heart of contemporary
research activities in algorithm development for large- scale problems in
mechanics. The Texas Institute for Computational Mechanics (TICOM) is initiating
research in parallel computing and in the development of smart highly
specialized parallel algorithms for adaptive computational methods. Partial
support is being provided by the Foundation with the University of Texas
matching funds towards the purchase of an eight-processor Alliant ring. The
vendor has agreed to a substantial discount.
