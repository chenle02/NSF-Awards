This research seeks to find efficient methods for evaluation of multivariate
polynomials as an improvement in signal processing. The proposed method builds
on the recursion very recently developed for the fast computation of the
Bernstein form of a bivariate polynomial on the unit square. First, the
bivariate work will be extended to the multivariate case for evaluation at
equispaced points. Then an attempt will be made to further extend the procedure
to evaluation on the unit circle, that is, unequispaced points. If successful,
the latter task would provide a significant improvement in many signal
processing tasks.
