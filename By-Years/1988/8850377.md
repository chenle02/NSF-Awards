"Developing and Evaluating an Indicator System to Monitor Mathematics and
Science Education" This project, conducted by the RAND Corporation, involves the
collection and integration of large national data bases to design and develop
indicators of the status and condition of precollege science and mathematics
education. Four areas of science and mathematics education will be included in
the indicator system: teachers and teaching quality; curriculum and instruction;
participation (especially, that of women and minorities); and, achievement and
outcomes. The methods to be used to develop the indicator system will be to: 1)
synthesize data from an array of national data bases to obtain additional
information on the condition of science and mathematics education; 2) evaluate
the results to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the existing data and
the indicators that can be built from them; and, 3) use a wider variety of data
--including data that are not nationally representative--to explore the
potential of components of measures that might be useful for future data
collection efforts. Because this is an exploratory project (over a proposed two-
year period) a review will be conducted of it near the end of the first year's
effort to decide whether to continue funding for the full duration.
