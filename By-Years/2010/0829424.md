This research program integrates ion trap and cavity-QED technologies with the
primary objective of coherently coupling individual atoms and individual
photons. The project aims at implementing several protocols for entangling
atomic qubit memories with photonic quantum bits, mapping quantum information
between these systems, and networking atomic qubits over remote distances.
