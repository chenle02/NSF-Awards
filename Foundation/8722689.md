In general terms this project is devoted to simplifying and making more usable
several powerful, complicated, and subtle algebraic techniques of topology. In
the 1960's, Daniel Quillen described how to define the homology of simplical
objects over many different categories, including sets, algebras over a ring,
and unstable algebras over the Steenrod algebra. Many of the calculations in
homology theory can be cast in this light, among them the computation of the
E2-term of certain "unstable Adams spectral sequences" such as the Bousfield-Kan
spectral sequence. Past experience has indicated the strength of this approach;
the purpose of this project is to explore this idea in depth. A particular
ramification would be the exploration of the homology of function complexes
using tools of Jean Lannes and A.K. Bousfield.
