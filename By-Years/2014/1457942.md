The United States faces a national need to increase significantly the number of
American scientists and engineers. This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Solano Community College (SCC)
will address this need and contribute to the national effort to produce more
STEM graduates by providing financial, academic, and personal support to
academically-talented and financially needy students across all STEM disciplines
at SCC. This project will pursue an innovative and promising 2+1 program for
which students at SCC majoring in a STEM area will receive two years of support
if they maintain a 3.0 grade point average (GPA). In turn, they will be awarded
an additional year of support to continue their study, if they transfer to a
four-year institution to be a STEM major. SCC will award twenty-five (25) to
thirty-five (35) scholarships per year. Likewise, the project will build on
existing student support services and develop new ones for the scholars.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2+1 STEM Scholarship Program at SCC will take a
comprehensive approach and will have multiple interesting and creative
components, which should not only be effective at SCC, but also have significant
potential to serve as models for other institutions, especially community
colleges. These components will include, but not be limited to: (i) offering
S-STEM scholarships at high school graduations to recruit students who plan to
major in a STEM discipline; (ii) providing multi-stage mentoring from peers to
faculty members, with a particular approach to pairing first-generation college
students with more advanced first-generation students; (iii) building
partnerships with industry to provide more learning, internship, and career
awareness opportunities for students, as well as to help improve curricula and
meet industry needs; and (iv) providing financial and other support to S-STEM
scholars who transfer as STEM majors to a four year institution. These
initiatives will work in concert with existing support services at SCC. The
investigators will explore and assess the effectiveness of the various
components of the project, taken individually and in combination with each
other. Their findings will add to the overall knowledge base of STEM education
by providing a roadmap leading to successful student intervention strategies,
especially related to understanding and improving the pipeline of students from
high school through community colleges to four year institutions, many or whom
are underrepresented minorities and/or rural and/or low income.
