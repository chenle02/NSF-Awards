Solid electrolyte potentiometry (SEP) is an in situ electrochemical technique
used to monitor the thermodynamic activity of oxygen adsorbed on catalytic
surfaces. To this end the catalytic reaction is studied in an oxygen
concentration solid electrolyte cell. One electrode of the cell is exposed to
the ambient air (reference) and the other serves as the catalyst under study.
SEP is used in conjunction with kinetic measurements in order to study the
catalytic oxidation of hydrogen over palladium and silver catalysts. By
operating the solid-electrolyte cell in the fuel-cell mode and at temperatures
above 700oC useful oxidation products can be obtained with simultaneous
generation of electrical energy. The cogeneration of electricity and hydrogen
cyanide by oxidizing methane-ammonia mixtures in a stabilized zirconia cell with
platinum-rhodium alloy electrodes will be examined. In a similar manner the
product selectivity and power output characteristics of a solid-state fuel cell
in which methane will be converted to oxidative dimerization products (ethane
and ethylene) is studied.
