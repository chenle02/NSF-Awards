9404420 Wojtkowski The plan of research includes a number of topics in
Hamiltonian dynamical systems relating to billiard dynamics and their
geometries. Ergodicity of flows within these systems will be investigated. The
research has potential applications to areas relating to chaotic phenomena
arising in dynamical systems and mathematical physics.
