Nontechnical Abstract: A Scientific Symposium entitled Convergence Research at
High Magnetic Fields will be organized by the National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory (NHMFL). A number of scientists, including at least one Nobel
Laureate, will present high-level, technical science talks in the areas relevant
to the mission of NHMFL. The meeting will expose students to high level research
and will encourage participants to discuss the convergence of multiple
disciplines and areas of research enabled by NHMFL.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: Modern research in quantum materials,
including materials growth, novel measurements, and theory, depends on
availability of high magnetic fields provided by NHMFL. A collection of high
level speakers creates an excellent opportunity to summarize the research done
at NHMFL and expose students to current topics in research. Students will
benefit from participating in the lectures and discussions of unsolved problems,
and access to speakers and other participants will enable networking.
&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the meeting participants will be encouraged to consider
new questions that can be addressed across the many areas presented, by
identifying convergent research directions. A summary of the conference will be
prepared, focusing on areas where collaborations and convergence research seeds
have been planted. Timing of the conference is aligned with the MagLab Theory
Winter School on Quantum Matter, which will enable broad student participation
in the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
