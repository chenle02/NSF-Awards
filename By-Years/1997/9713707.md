This grant funds research on geometric metrology. Geometric metrology is an
approach to the dimensioning and tolerancing of mechanical parts. The goal of
this research is to extend the methodology of geometric metrology to a larger
class of applications, develop the theoretical structure of geometric metrology,
incorporate scientific visualization elements within a unified geometric
metrology toolbox, and explore areas within metrology that can benefit from this
research. If successful, this research will contribute to the ability of
designers to specify geometric tolerances on parts that will lead to improved
quality control and lower product cost.
