The objective of this project is to study both logical and implementation
aspects of sensor based robot planning. A major goal of the project is to
develop a formal model of perception, knowledge, and planning, and a
representation language defined over the model. This formal theory will serve as
a basis for the implementation of a domain independent planner. The application
of the theory to the planning of routes through partially known territory will
be studied. For a robot to operate autonomously in a partially known world, it
must be able to construct plans that rely on its gaining necessary information
through its perceptions during the execution of the plan. The proposed planner
must understand the power and scope of its sensors. It must also understand how
perceptions relate to the physical world, and how they increase the robot's
knowledge. It must be able to reason about plans that are only partially defined
when first constructed, and become gradually more elaborated during execution.
