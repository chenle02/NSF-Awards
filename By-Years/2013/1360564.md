This project will investigate several key problems in algebraic geometry and
related areas of mathematics. Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions to
polynomial equations; it has many applications in other areas of mathematics and
other sciences. The project will focus on algebraic transformations over
arbitrary fields, which has potential for practical application in computer
science. The research involves graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at
the University of Missouri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is research in the
areas of commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, valuation theory, and
singularity theory. The problems that are being investigated are in four basic
areas: Asymptotic multiplicities and Hilbert polynomials of graded families of
ideals in a local ring, understanding better the cone of effective divisors
modulo numerical equivalence (inradius, outradius and volume), toroidalization
of morphisms (after blowing up nonsingular subvarieties make a morphism locally
have a monomial like structure) and ramification, the defect and local
uniformization. This last part involves better understanding ramification along
a valuation in positive characteristic, with a view towards resolution of
singularities.
