This Science in Developing Countries award will support research collaboration
between Torgny Gustafsson of Rutgers University and Patricio Haberle of the
Universidad Technica Federico Santa Maria (UTFSM) in Valparaiso, Chile. The
project aims to examine fundamental questions of surface science, including how
and why atoms rearrange themselves and how such movements can be induced. The
researchers will (1) determine the geometric structure of surfaces, especially
reconstructed ones, to better understand factors that affect atomic positions at
an interface, and (2) use this knowledge to construct surfaces with interesting
and potentially useful properties. Their main experimental technique will be
medium energy ion scattering, a powerful but not widely available method for
determining surface structural parameters. Rutgers' capabilities in this regard
are largely unique. By widening the group of collaborators, Rutgers will promote
more widening the group of collaborators, Rutgers will promote more efficient
use of its costly equipment. The Chileans will prepare and characterize alkali
metal overlayers at UTFSM, where Chile's first program in experimental surface
science is being set up. The laboratory will include facilities for scanning
tunneling microscopy, an important complement to Rutgers' experimental
capabilities. Through this collaboration, both sides will be able to immediately
work on problems of international interest.
