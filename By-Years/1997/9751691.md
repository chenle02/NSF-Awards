The 300 MHz Fourier transform NMR spectrometer is used in a wide range of
courses to improve the quality of education for students majoring in chemistry,
biology, human nutrition, and medical technology. the objectives of this project
are: to excite students about chemistry by exposing them to this powerful tool
for structure determination, to train them in the theory, methods, and
application of modern NMR spectroscopy, and to combine this structural tool with
molecular modeling to give them a broader perspective of chemical science. The
NMR spectrometer is first introduced to students in the General Chemistry
cooperative laboratory program. Sophomore organic students use the instrument to
obtain proton and C-13 spectra for product analysis and are also introduced to
two-dimensional NMR through a COSY experiment. Students then use variable
temperature NMR in the inorganic laboratory to explore the structural and
fluxional behavior of inorganic systems. In the physical chemistry laboratory,
students use variable temperature NMR to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic data
for the internal rotations in N,N-dimethylacetamides. In instrumental analysis,
students use the instrument to study the relationships between time and
frequency domain spectra as well as signal averaging and digital filtering.
Emphasis is placed on using the NMR in conjunction with molecular modeling to
provide the opportunity for students to explore the relationship between
structure and spectra. *
