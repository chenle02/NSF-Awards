This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research ways to increase accessibility
and utilization of microdata from censuses of the U.S. and other countries in
secondary school and college courses in mathematics. A seamless, XML-driven
interface to a web server at the Minnesota Population Center will make it
possible for teachers and students to specify, request, and import this
microdata into Fathom Dynamic Statistics software. Enhancements to Fathom
software will increase its already considerable ease and power for working with
census microdata; curriculum materials in mathematics will provide teachers with
effective ways to begin working with this highly motivating data--both to teach
existing content and to teach data literacy. Phase I research suggested strong
similarities between census microdata and school census microdata data that is
gathered by K-12 schools about student demographics and performance, course
offerings, and classroom practice. Accordingly, Phase II leverages this overlap
to produce greatly needed interfaces for easily accessing school census
microdata, survey tools for producing it, and extensions to Fathom for analyzing
it. KCP Technologies' census microdata project exploits the merging web
connectivity in American schools, thus symbiotically fitting a larger pattern of
evolution of school technologies. The project offers a product that supports
analysis of complex data through an easy-to-use interface which will contribute
to data anlysis and learning from data analysis. U.S. education is very much in
need of the kinds of software and curriculum resources to be produced under this
project
