This award supports cooperative research on ammonia synthesis catalysts to be
conducted by Dr. Michel Boudart of Stanford University and Prof. Daniel Loffler
of the University of Mar del Plata, Argentina. Ammonia is synthesized on
reduced-iron catalysts. Even a small improvement in the process would have
considerable economic impact as the need for nitrogen fertilizers grows with the
need to feed a growing world population. In this work, commercial catalysts will
be characterized using an array of modern techniques including Auger and
Mossbauer spectroscopies, and electron microscopy. X-ray absorption (XAS) will
be used to study the structure of the catalysts in situ while the reaction is
taking place. A better understanding of the catalyst will help the formulation
of better catalysts. The ex-situ (Auger, SEM and Mossbauer) characterization
will take place in Argentina and the XAS work will be done at Stanford. In this
way the facilities of each laboratory will complement those of the other. Both
of the researchers have had extensive research experience in catalysis: Dr.
Boudart particularly in ammonia synthesis and XAS techniques and Prof. Loffler
in the other techniques and in ammonia synthesis, as well. Therefore, they will
benefit from each other's expertise and from the shared laboratory capabilities.
