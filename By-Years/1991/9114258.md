Manufacturing operations like rolling, forging, and extrusion are characterized
by interrupted, non-isothermal, large deformations at high strain rates
(104sec-1) and high homologous temperatures (0.5 to 0.9). There is very little
test data available to validate and/or refine constitutive relations proposed to
describe the material behavior under these loading conditions. The purpose of
this research is to perform experiments on Fe-2% Si and Ti6A1-4V in a split
Hopkinson torsion bar at different strain-rates and various values of the
homologous temperature. These test data and others available in the literature
will be used to delimit the functional forms of constitutive relations, and also
to find values of material parameters. The predictive capability of these
constitutive equations will be ascertained by comparing analytical/computed
results with experimental findings under loading conditions different from those
used to establish them, including dynamic loading of specimens pre-strained
quasistatically in a direction different from that of dynamic loading. The
developed constitutive relations will be used to analyze extrusion and hot
forging processes, and the effect of loading rate and initial specimen
temperature upon the initiation and growth of shear bands in forging, torsion,
and combined loading. The study will combine a thorough theoretical/numerical
effort with careful and accurate experimental investigation. The close
collaboration and integration between the experimental and theoretical work
should help formulate reliable constitutive relations that can be used to
analyze other high strain-rate processes such as machining and penetration of
metallic targets by fast moving penetrators.
