9312533 Augustine This effort examines an approach to the design of
enantioselective heterogeneous catalysts that combines fundamental principles of
catalyst systems and surface chemistry with synthetic organic chemistry. It uses
a working hypothesis developed from previous work on chiral hydrogenation of
pyruvate esters catalyzed by platinum modified with cinchona alkaloids. In this
hypothesis, the substrate must be adsorbed on a corner site with the modifier
adsorbed on adjacent sites; the distance of the chiral center from the surface
is a key factor in determining the enantiomeric selectivity. Chiral modifiers
with various spacing between the chiral center and the electron-rich site (which
can adsorb to a metal surface) are synthesized and tested in the platinum-
catalyzed hydrogenation of pyruvate. Cinchona-induced chirality in the
palladium-catalyzed allylation of malates is also studied. Chiral selectivity or
enantioselectivity (the production of on "optical " isomer to the exclusion to
its mirror image) is of critical importance when producing chemicals intended to
produce a biological response such as drugs, pesticides, and perfumes. It is of
thus of great value to the pharmaceutical, agrichemical, and fine chemical
industries. Although biocatalysts (enzymes) are more often enantioselective that
not, they are so substrate-discriminating as to be of limited value in the
production of chemicals not occurring naturally. Homogeneous chiral catalysts,
on the other hand, are less selective chemically (but more selective chirally)
and harder (read more expensive) to use than heterogeneous catalysts. This work
will elaborate principles that can be used to improve enantioselectivity in
heterogeneous catalysts.
