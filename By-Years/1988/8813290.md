This grant will facilitate increased University participation in the 32nd
International Symposium on Electron, Ion and Photon Beams, to be held May 31
-June 3, 1988 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This is the outstanding conference on
microfabrication; it is a cross-disciplinary conference that focuses in a way
that few other conferences do on the complement of high resolution lithography,
dry etch transfer, materials science, surface chemistry and innovative devices
of reduced dimension. There are other conferences that address each of the
subject areas separately, and to some extent, but not with the emphasis on
microfabrication for the advancement of the science of microstructures. An
important feature that distinguishes this conference is the archival publication
of all accepted papers in the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology; we may
thus disseminate the important results of this conference to a wide audience.
