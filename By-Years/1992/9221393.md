The project proposes connecting the computer network at the University of
Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) to Internet, a worldwide computer network based
on the TCP/IP communications protocol. Included in Internet are the numerous
NSF-assisted institutions that comprise NSFNET. The connection will allow
collaborations between faculty, researchers, librarians, staff, hospitals, and
research centers. This is of special importance to UCHC's library because the
National Library of Medicine has designated it the New England Regional Library
in the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. The linkage will rely on a
regional network, the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARnet), that
presently serves several nearby sites in Hartford. A 56-kbit-per-second leased
phone line will connect UCHC to NEARnet's present termination at the University
of Hartford. NEARnet will operate Cisco IGS/R routers at each end of the line.
At UCHC, the router will connect to our existing copper and fiber Ethernet
system. Simultaneously, UCHC will fund major fiber-optic improvements to its
local network. Apart from assisting clinical and research collaboration, the
connection will allow UCHC to develop servers for public domain software and to
make its library catalog searchable from remote sites.
