Professors Dye and Reich will study several question about the convergence of
products of nonexpansive mappings. One of the main questions will be whether the
von Neumann algorithm admits a nonlinear extension. Also of fundamental
importance is whether von Neumann's conclusion of strong convergence persists
when the maps are drawn randomly from more than two projections. Operator theory
is that part of mathematics that studies the infinite dimensional
generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted to finite
dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties, and thus can
be represented by a matrix. The central problem in operator theory is to
classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of associated
operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space. Operator
theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
