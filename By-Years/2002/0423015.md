The purpose of this project is to identify the organizational processes that
will permit multinational organizations to more successfully transfer
innovations from R&D laboratories to subsidiaries on other continents. In
partnership with the Institute for Global Innovation Management at Northeastern
University and Charles River Laboratories, a global supplier to pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies, the research will analyze cases of global
innovation in which the organization attempted to transfer R&D to subsidiaries
in France and Japan. The analysis focuses on the impact of organizational change
interventions designed to facilitate innovation transfers. This research has
important potential for better understanding transfer of innovations and thus a
bearing on outsourcing, multinational R&D, and other forms of organizational
decentralization and organizing activities.
