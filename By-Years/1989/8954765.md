The Children's Museum proposes a three-year project to develop a set of
curriculum materials in physical science to increase the effectiveness of
science education in middle schools, grades 6 to 8. This project will be
undertaken in collaboration with the Massachusetts Pre- Engineering Program
(MassPEP) and Boston Public Schools. The Children's Museum, with classroom
teachers, will develop curriculum topics using an integrated approach in which
curriculum, teacher training, and use of outside resources will complement and
reinforce each other. Cuisenaire Company will publish and distribute a core
group of 6 to 8 topic investigations. These investigations can be used as
extensions to encourage students to comprehend and appreciate topics of their
regular science curriculum or they can be used for a more in depth explanation
of a phenomenon. Each of the topics is an alternative way of teaching basic
concepts that are part of existing science curricula for middle school. There
will be several products of the proposed program, and an overall model. The
products will include teacher guides and kits for each curriculum topic
distributed by Cuisenaire; documents that describe the process of community-
based organization and the local school system can utilize the curriculum topics
to effect changes in attitudes of middle school minority and female students
toward science as a course of study and career possibility. This model of
collaboration between a science center, community - based organization, and a
school system will be replicable in cities throughout the country.
