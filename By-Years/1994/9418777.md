9418777 Li This award supports a 12-month Science and Technology Agency of Japan
Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Li Li, Department of Ocean Engineering,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at the Public Works Research Institute,
Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Li will work with Dr. Hiroshi Sato of the Structure Division
on a research project entitled, "Japan STA Program: Structural Dynamics and
Vibration Reduction of Long-Span Bridges." Through a combined experimental and
analytical approach, Dr. Li and Dr. Sato will develop a method and apparatus for
reducing the vibration of super-long-span bridges in high winds. During its
lifespan, a super-long-span bridge is constantly subjected to winds and vibrates
primarily in its torsional and bending modes. Cross-flow vibration and in- line
fluctuating drag force are often close to natural frequency, resulting in large
dynamic responses and bridge failure. Utilizing a boundary vibration absorber
developed by Li, the team will develop a structural model for a super- long-span
bridge system to predict dynamic responses. They will use Dr. Sato s laboratory
model of a long-span bridge to validate the theoretical model and predictions.
