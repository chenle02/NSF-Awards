Arizona State University is exploring the role of visual representations in
student learning in undergraduate geology courses. This study investigates how
students interact with, and learn from, three different types of
representations: textbook figures, 3D virtual environments, and annotated
sketches of geologic systems. The first part of the research involves how
students interact with figures in introductory geology textbooks, focusing on
how the interaction varies for different types of figures, for the degree of
integration of figures and text, and for differences in the background and
abilities of the student. A second component investigates student interactions
with 2D and 3D virtual environments, such as static portrayals of 3D terrains on
maps, various types of interactive animations, and immersive 3D environments,
such as the GeoWall. A third component explores the role of annotated sketches
(concept sketches) in geoscience learning and teaching, especially the use of
sketches as a conceptual bridge between the other two types of visual
representations and a deeper understanding of geoscience concepts and processes.
The results from this research is expected to help instructors examine the role
of visual representations in geoscience learning and develop strategies for more
effective geoscience teaching. The project team is developing exemplary
curricular materials that explicitly help students and instructors implement
these strategies.
