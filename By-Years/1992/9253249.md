This three year project, sponsored by the Education Committee of the
Mississippi section of the American Chemical Society and managed through the
University of Southern Mississippi, will provide in-service training to all
Mississippi high school chemistry teachers. Fifteen topics will be developed,
tested and then taught in a mini- workshop format. Each module will be taught at
eight places throughout the state and each year three modules will be covered.
The in-service program will be supported by a resource center, which will
provide telephone support, a lending library and a newsletter. More than 400
teachers will be served. In the third year of the grant the program will be
tested in West Virginia to assess the possibility of dissemination. The grant is
being matched by funds from the University and the school districts by an amount
equal to 44% of the NSF award.
