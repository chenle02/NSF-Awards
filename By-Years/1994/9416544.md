9416544 The award is for research to develop a novel manufacturing process for
producing spherical metal particles of uniform diameter, composition, and
microstructure. Available techniques of producing metal particles either do not
produce particles of uniform size or, if they do, offer a narrow range of
particles size for a given apparatus. A time-invariant axial magnetic field of
moderate intensity will be used to stabilize a liquid metal jet issuing from a
nozzle. To destabilize this jet, a time-varying intense magnetic field will be
applied transverse to the jet axis, pinching the droplets at uniform time
intervals. The droplets will be allowed to spheroidize and solidify resulting in
particles of uniform shape, composition, and microstructure. A benchtop-type
experimental verification of the process is proposed, along with development of
a simple model of the process. the ability to produce uniform metal particles
would benefit a variety of applications that require uniformity of properties at
the micro-scale. These includes rolling elements for miniature instrument ball
bearings, thin uniform corrosion and oxidation prevention coatings, and
microsievers, filters, and porous bearings of well-controlled porosity.
