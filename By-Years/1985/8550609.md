Boston College will offer an opportunity for 50 chemistry teachers from southern
New England to upgrade and update their knowledge and teaching skills in order
to improve chemistry education in the classrooms. This in-service Institute for
Teachers of Chemistry will be conducted on one Wednesday and two Saturdays each
month during the academic year and will include instruction in basic chemistry,
microcomputers, testing and evaluation, and methods and materials of chemistry
education. This proposal is based on the successful implementation of a model
program piloted during the 1983-84 academic year for physics teachers within a
narrowly restricted geographic area.
