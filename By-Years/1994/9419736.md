Funds for the purchase of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
instrumentation are sought. Detectors (photodiode array, electrochemical,
conductivity and refractive index), associate modules, a computer, software, and
a printer would be used with existing HPLC pumps and autosampler. The combined
instruments would be shared by eight researchers. Their applications are (1)
sugars and water soluble vitamins in glandular secretions produced by honey
bees; chemical residues in honey bee products; (2) plant nonstructural
carbohydrates, proline, ions and annonaceous acetogenins in pawpaw tissue; (3)
azadirachtin residues in stored corn; (4) 17-methyltestosterone in paddlefish
tissues; (5) inorganic ions in water and wastewater; (6) pesticide residues in
turnips and other crop plants; (7) plant growth hormones in pine seedlings, and
the relationship of flavor-producing chemicals to spectra of light reflected
onto horticultural crops; and (8) vitamins in fish feed. High school,
undergraduate, and graduate school students are active in the laboratories of
the researchers involved with this proposal. Kentucky State University is a
historically black institution with a large enrollment of minority students.
