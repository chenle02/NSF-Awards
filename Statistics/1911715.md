Summer Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics, sponsored by
the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS), is held at General Butler
State Resort Park in Carrolton, Kentucky on June 2-5, 2019. The 2019 SRC is the
55th anniversary of that conference. Its purpose is to encourage the interchange
and mutual understanding of current research ideas in statistics and
biostatistics, and to give motivation and direction to further research
progress. The project focuses on young researchers, placing them in close
proximity to leaders in the field for person-to-person interactions in a manner
not possible at most other meetings. Speakers will present formal research talks
with adequate time allowed for clarification, amplification, and further
informal discussions in small groups. To enhance the recruitment and retention
of under-represented groups in STEM fields, SRCOS has added an undergraduate
component, Statistical Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE). The SURE
encourages involvement of under-represented minorities, presents career
opportunities in Statistics, provides a Real Data Analytics Workshop, as well as
a graduate school information session. Under the travel support provided by this
award graduate students attended and presented their research in posters which
are reviewed by more experienced researchers, while undergraduate students have
been exposed to data analytics, graduate school opportunities in statistics and
biostatistics, and career opportunities available.

The Summer Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics is an
annual conference sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics
(SRCOS). The SRCOS is a consortium of statistics and biostatistics programs in
the South, stretching as far west as Texas and as far north as Maryland. This
project is funding student participation in the 2019 Summer Research Conference
(SRC) sponsored by SRCOS. The meeting is particularly valuable for students and
faculty from smaller regional schools at drivable distances, affording them the
opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known
leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant national or
international venues. This conference is strengthening the research of the
statistics and biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly focuses on
reaching under-represented undergraduate students with Statistics Undergraduate
Research Experience (SURE 2019). For all details, please consult the conference

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
