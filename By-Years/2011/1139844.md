The workshop gathers developers and users of lexical resources, corpus and
computational linguists and researchers in natural language processing to
discuss a targeted restructuring of the adjectives in the lexical database
WordNet. Specific proposals for replacing a subset of the current clustering of
adjectives around antonyms with ordered scales reflecting the relative intensity
of dimensional adjectives, such as "big", "huge" and "gigantic", are presented
along with preliminary work demonstrating the feasibility of corpus-based
construction of scales by means of lexical-semantic patterns and their potential
benefits for NLP. Discussion topics include (1) the principal benefits of
encoding scalar properties for applications including word sense disambiguation,
textual entailment and language pedagogy; (2) suitable corpora for extracting
data for scale construction; (3) limitations of the recently-developed AdjScales
method and alternative or complementary methods for extracting scalar
properties; and (4) modeling of scalar adjectives in WordNet. Participants
evaluate the proposed restructuring of adjectives for its feasibility, value and
relevance to their own work and its potential for future research and
applications. A report including the presentations, discussions and
recommendations of the group will be prepared and freely disseminated via the
WordNet website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The directions for targeted future
developments of the widely used WordNet database as spelled out and agreed upon
by representatives from a broad expert community assure significant consequences
for research and applications in language technology and pedagogy. For a post-
doctoral fellow and a graduate student the workshop provides a unique
opportunity to interact with experts in the field.
