In a dusty plasma, the usual ion-electron-neutral plasma is modified by the
presence of a third charged species, charged microparticles or "dust". These
microparticles can range in size from tens of nanometers to a few millimeters in
diameter and can become very highly charged and form two- and three-dimensional
clouds that can modify the bulk properties of the surrounding plasma. This
research addresses two aspects of plasma dust clouds, the particle cloud-plasma
interface and the thermodynamics of the microparticles. These will be explored
using novel microparticle control techniques and a combination of two- and
three-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) diagnostic systems
