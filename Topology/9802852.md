9802852 Mitchell This project addresses problems in three distinct but closely
related areas of homotopy theory: (1) homotopy fixed point spectra arising from
the action of closed subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group on the Landweber
exact spectrum whose coefficient ring is the functions on the Lubin-Tate moduli
space of lifts (Devinatz); (2) multiplicative stable homotopy theory, the
homotopy theory of operads, Andre-Quillen homology of algebras over simplicial
operads (Goerss); and (3) etale homotopy type of rings of algebraic integers,
with a view to applications in Iwasawa theory and algebraic K-theory (Mitchell).
The broader goal of the project is to further our understanding of homotopy
theory, the branch of topology concerned with those properties of higher-
dimensional surfaces and other geometric objects that remain invariant under
deformation. There are some surprising and rather mysterious connections between
homotopy theory and seemingly unrelated fields such as number theory and
algebraic geometry, and it is these connections that the investigators hope to
elucidate. ***
