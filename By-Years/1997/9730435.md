9730435 Liu The project is a modeling study of the thermocline variability in
the extratropics. The thermocline variability will be studied in terms of
various planetary wave modes along with their interaction with mean thermocline
flow. A concurrent study of analytical and numerical modeling will be used to
highlight the essential physics. Idealized and realistic Pacific studies will be
performed, and the results will be compared with observations.
