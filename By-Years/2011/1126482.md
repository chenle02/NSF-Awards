With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Jennifer Whiles Lillig from Sonoma State University and colleagues Carmen Works,
Steven Farmer and Jon Fukuto will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award
will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas
such as (a) characterization of the structure/function relationship of
antimicrobial bacteriocins, (b) synthetic methodologies that allow preparation
of biologically active derivatives containing the carbazole ring structure, (c)
synthesis, characterization, and potential biological applications of HNO
donors, and (d) characterization of small chromium(III) binding peptides and
functional mimics in chromium biochemistry.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research.
