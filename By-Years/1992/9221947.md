9221947 Breitbart Transaction Management in a Heterogeneous Database
Environment This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. A
multidatabase system (MDBS) consists of a number of sites which run distinct
commercial database management systems (DBMSs). The goal of an MDBS is to
integrate the DBMSs, allowing applications to access data from, without
requiring modifications to, the individual DBMSs. The autonomous user
organizations in a multidatabase system generally have invested substantial
capital in the DBMS and may, rightly, be unwilling to modify or lose control
over their DBMSs. Therefore, it is imperative to develop multidatabase
transaction processing methods that allow a high degree of local autonomy, but
support users' data in a consistent and reliable manner. This research
investigates how to manage and guarantee consistency of data residing in
heterogeneous DBMSs, while adhering to the autonomy requirements of the
participant DBMSs. The MDBS transaction management schemes developed in this
research have the following characteristics: (1) adapt to MDBS environments,
existing techniques for ensuring database consistency based on preserving
transaction atomicity and serializability; (2) utilize alternate correctness
criteria that relax the serializability and atomicity requirements. Pilot
systems developed for both the serializability and the relaxed serializability
models are used to conduct performance evaluation to ascertain that the
developed schemes permit a high degree of concurrency. The results of the
research will provide the basic transaction management mechanisms necessary for
the development of a complete multidatabase management system. ***
