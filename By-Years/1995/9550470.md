9550470 Gangolli The University of Washington's Mathematics Department and
College of Education, in collaboration with four school districts in the state
of Washington, will develop a teacher enhancement proposal for Creating a
Community of Mathematics Learners. The one-year planning grant establishes teams
of K-12 teachers to create "portraits" of current practices in mathematics
education within their schools, identify teacher leadership roles for addressing
the discrepancies between current practices and the districts' visions for
mathematics education, and develop five-year plans for using the envisioned
leadership in their districts. The planning grant further recognizes the
desirability of and provides for the development of more than one plan to
address leadership needs in large school districts. The project being developed
includes a component that develops exemplary partner schools for the preparation
of prospective teachers, and thus targets teacher enhancement/preparation for
the full spectrum of K-16.
