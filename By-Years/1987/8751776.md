School in The Exploratorium Leader Teacher Program is a two tiered program
consisting of a series of ten-day introductory workshops designed to introduce
300 teachers to a basic approach to hands-on science instruction and a two-year
leader teacher internship program designed to develop a cadre of 78 well-trained
leadership teachers working in the same districts who understand the principles
of inquiry- based learning and can support the activities of their colleagues.
The three year program is based physically and philosophically at the
Exploratorium, taking advantage of its exhibits and other facilities to create a
rich atmosphere for learning content and process. The program will make it
possible for 378 elementary teachers to have support in the classroom by
Exploratorium staff and artists and use a Lending Library of materials as they
learn an integrated science-and-art approach to the investigations of nature and
the everyday world.
