The notion of linear dependence is fundamental to linear algebra, which in turn
lies at the core of all branches of mathematics. The theory of matroids is an
abstraction of this notion. While linear algebra provides many rich examples of
matroids, one can prove that almost all examples of matroids are not realizable
via linear algebra. The main purpose of this project to show that two major
theorems about realizable matroids in fact hold for all matroids. In addition
the project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.

The first of these theorems is the Top-Heavy Conjecture of Dowling and Wilson,
which states that, given a matroid along with a natural number k that is at most
half the rank, then the number of flats of rank k is less than or equal to the
number of flats of corank k. The second says that the coefficients of the
Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial of a matroid are all non-negative. Both of these
statements were proved for realizable matroids in the past five years by
applying Hodge theory to the intersection cohomology groups of a certain
algebraic variety associated with the realization. The goal of this project is
to show that, even though it is impossible to construct an analogous algebraic
variety for a general matroid, one can still define analogues of its
intersection cohomology groups and prove that they have enough nice properties
to imply these two results.
