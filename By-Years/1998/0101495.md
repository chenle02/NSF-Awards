&lt;br/&gt;This project is instituting a Biotechnology Technician A.A.S. degree
in response to state needs. More than 116 biotechnology firms are located in
Utah with 57 moving in during the last eighteen months. These firms employ
individuals focused on work in genetic engineering, bioinfomatics, molecular
biology, and pharmaceutical development. Partners include the community college,
local industries, universities in Utah, and 5 public school districts. Prior to
this program, no two-year biotechnology programs were available in Utah or
neighboring states. Industry representatives are involved in outlining skills
competencies, delivering instruction and facilitating instructor professional
development. Outcomes for this project include: (1) establishing reciprocal
partnerships with local industry; (2) identifying, adapting and implementing
secondary and college curriculum; (3) preparing college and secondary
instructional staff; (4) supporting industry internships for faculty and
students; (5) developing a state of the art instructional laboratory.
