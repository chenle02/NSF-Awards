Chemistry (12)

The project utilizes interdisciplinary case studies in two sequential analytical
chemistry courses and incorporates the use of an atomic absorption spectrometer
into the laboratory. The case study topics include environmental water testing,
vitamin and mineral analysis, forensic science, and food science. The project
builds on the foundation created by the interdisciplinary case study pedagogy
from two National Science Foundation supported initiatives: Chemcases at
Kennesaw State University and Case Studies in Science at State University of
Buffalo at New York. Most case studies in chemistry are designed for students in
an introductory course and only a few of the chemistry case studies include a
laboratory component. The adaptation in this project comprises interdisciplinary
case studies with an incorporated laboratory component for the Quantitative
Analysis and Advanced Analytical Chemistry courses. The analytical chemistry
undergraduate curriculum, particularly the analytical chemistry laboratory
experience, has been redesigned.

The case studies meet the following objectives:

1. Engage students by allowing them to gain experience with scientific inquiry.
2. Provide students with an opportunity to develop critical reading and thinking
skills. 3. Allow students to develop effective communication skills on current
and relevant scientific subjects. 4. Enhance ability of students to work in
groups.
