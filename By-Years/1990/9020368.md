The need to identify cemented sand deposits and evaluate their engineering
characteristics together with the difficulty in sampling such deposits require
the use of insitu testing schemes. Among different insitu testing schemes, cone
penetration testing is gaining wide acceptance and use in the nation. This study
will investigate the effect of cementation on cone penetration testing.
Piezocone penetration tests will be conducted in a calibration chamber on
saturated specimens of artificially cemented sands. The results obtained from
the calibration chamber (experimental model) will be compared with the
predictions of available theoretical models and a new theoretical model that
incorporates dilation. Using the predictions of these experimental and
theoretical models, a methodology will be formalized to identify cemented sand
deposits and evaluate their engineering characteristics. The accuracy and
reliability of the developed scheme will be investigated by piezocone
penetration testing at a site with well-documented naturally cemented sand
deposits.
