This proposal is to improve the quality of polymeric extrudates and to
characterize their mechanical properties, particularly those intended for high
strength and profile applications. To achieve this goal the principles of
streamlined die design as developed for solid state extrusion of metals will be
explored and applied to polymers. Finite element techniques will be used to
analyze both the flowing material and the die deformation. Characterization of
polymers for conventional extrusion and melt transformation coextrusion will be
conducted, with the results confirmed or altered by observation in a side
viewing die designed to accommodate sculptured surface inserts. This work should
lead to a die design methodology for these types of polymeric materials. This
research should result in an improved extrusion process for polymers and a
scientific understanding of the melt transformation coextrusion process.
Application of these materials is expected in aerospace, medical, automotive,
and other applications requiring high strength to weight characteristics.
