In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Kenneth B. Eisenthal of Columbia University will
conduct research to study the chemical and physical properties of interfacial
water molecules and molecules adsorbed to interfacial water surfaces. The
ultimate goal of this work is to develop a deeper understanding of these
important and ubiquitous interfaces which are important in many broader areas of
science, spanning the range from biological to geological systems.

Besides the applications of the present work towards developing a deeper
understanding of interfacial water, the work supported through this award
provides an opportunity for training of graduate and undergraduate researchers
in state-of-the-art physical. Prof. Eisenthal will continue to work with
researchers from diverse groups, as well as continuing his participation in
outreach towards a wider audience.
