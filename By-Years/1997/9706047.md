9706047 Brearley Geoscientists concerned with crustal evolution are currently
debating the rates of melt segregation, the nature of the pathways for melt
transport, and the role of tectonic environment. In particular, focus has been
placed on magma chemistry because these processes determine the extent to which
the extracted melts are in equilibrium with their source rocks. Thus,
determining how the mechanics of melt segregation influences melt chemistry
would greatly enhance our understanding of the range in compositions observed in
anatectic granitic terranes and of the evolution of the crust in general. In
this project, we will experimentally test the hypothesis that the physical
process of melt segregation leaves a distinct chemical signature that can be
observed and quantified in anatectic melts. Experiments performed under both
static and deformation conditions will allow us to determine melt compositions
when 1) migration occurs along melt-filled cracks in quiescent environments and
2) when migration is focused along shear zones in dynamic environments.
Together, these experimental results will provide an important link between
tectonic environment, segregation rates active during anatexis and the magma
compositions themselves.
