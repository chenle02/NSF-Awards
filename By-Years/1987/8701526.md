Polymer Interactions at the Solution Surface: This award recommendation is made
under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists
and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research proposal will address
the experimental determination of the surface density profile and transverse
radius of gyration for a polymer in solution. The methods to be used are x-ray
fluorescence and in-plane small angle x-ray scattering under conditions of total
external reflection. The project is under the direction of Dr. Scott William
Barton, Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago IL 60637,
U.S.A., and Professors F. Rondelez and J.P. Badiali, CNRS, Groupe de Recherche
Macelin-Berthelot, 75231, Paris, France. This award recommendation provides
funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,
stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, language training, if required,
and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
