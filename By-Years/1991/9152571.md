The goal of the project is to improve the quality of engineering education by
introducing comprehensive laboratory experience in order to complement the
existing theoretically based courses in design and manufacturing at the
undergraduate mechanical engineering level. The major equipment includes an
integrated computer-aided design/manufacturing software system and a numerically
controlled vertical machining center. The project gives the students an
understanding of how integration is a main component of successful design and
production.
