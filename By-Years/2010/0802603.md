This award is to fund a critical workshop highly relevant to the future of
astronomical adaptive optics in the US over the next decade. This is a timely
follow-up to two previous workshops held in 2000 and 2004. The charge of this
workshop is to 1) Evaluate technical progress against the AO Roadmap goals (as
updated in 2004); 2) Assess the competitive international environment for
adaptive optics investment; 3) Integrate AO development goals for telescopes of
apertures from 1 to 30 meters; and 4) Recommend priority areas for the next
round of Adaptive Optics Development Program proposal
solicitation(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This roadmap will 1) Provide a summary of
the state of adaptive optics technology that will guide the educational and
research areas of newly enrolling astronomy graduate students interested in
high-angular-resolution science topics; 2) Provide a resource for educators,
both graduate level and undergraduate, conducting seminar-level courses on
current outstanding questions in astronomy; and 3) Give clear community guidance
to educational, commercial, and governmental research organizations by
describing the technologies of critical interest to astronomers.&lt;br/&gt;
