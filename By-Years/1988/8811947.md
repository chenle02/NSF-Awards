During late oogenesis in Drosophila, ovarian follicle cells synthesize and
secrete several proteins that assemble to form the vitelline membrane and
chorion sublayers that comprise the eggshell. Our research is directed towards
understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie developmental regulation of
eggshell protein synthesis and morphogenesis. towards this end, Dr. Waring has
been studying the molecular basis of mutations that affect eggshell production
and assembly. This proposal is directed towards extending our analyses of the
dec-1 locus, an eggshell structural gene locus that is exceptional in terms of
its size, mutability, and ability to encode multiple products via
developmentally regulated alternative RNA processing and proteolytic cleavage
events. Studies in three areas are proposed to elucidate the functional
significance of these processing events. First, domain-specific antibodies will
be raised and used to identify and localize protein products of the locus during
different stages of eggshell assembly. Second, the use of different RNA
maturation pathways will be defined with regards to both time and space, and
insight into factors involved in splice site selection will be sought through
the analysis of processing mutants. Third, the functional genetic unit will be
defined by DNA transformation experiments utilizing null mutants. In vitro
mutagenesis methods will ben be employed to identify functional regions encoded
within these DNA sequences. These studies are expected to provide molecular
insights into a morphogenetic pathway in a genetically accessible metazoan
organism. %%% This proposal is to continue a molecular genetic analysis of the
expression of eggshell proteins in the fruitfly, Drosophila. These genes have to
be expressed at the correct precise time and is the correct tissues to ensure
the successful development of the eggs for the future generation. The fruitfly
provides a good model system for studying these important developmental events
because both molecular and genetic studies are possible with this organism.
