ABSTRACT The research focuses on whether some phonological features are left
unspecified in the lexical representations of lexical items, as is standardly
assumed in recent phonological theory. For example, /t/ might have only the
feture ı-syllabic!, while /v/ is specified as
ı-syllabic,Labial,+continuant,+voiced!. The Principal Investigator's current
research provides psycholinguis- tic support for underspecification by examining
phonological errors that occur in language production using an experimental
technique to induce errors. For specified-underspecified contrasts there are two
biases: segments underspecified for a feature tend to be replaced by segments
specified for that feature, and there is a high proportion of exchange errors.
Neither bias is true for specified-specified contrasts. The forthcoming
experiments will extend the research to liquids, glides, and vowels. Together
with the data already gathered, the work should produce a reasonably complete
picture of underspecification in language production in English. The results
should bear on issues in phonological theory (whether all segments are specified
for the feature ısonorant! and which vowel is maximally underspecified in
English), and on the nature of phonological access in language production. This
work is significant in extending a much-needed bridge between research in
phonetics, which deals with the physical realities of speech, and phonology,
which deals with the abstract underlying properties of the sound systems of
language. The Principal Investigator is one of a very few researchers who have
acquired the background and taken the initiative to undertake a serious research
program at this disciplinary interface. The results of the research should help
lead toward a unified, comprehensive model of the human capacity for speech.
