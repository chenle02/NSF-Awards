This research involves analytical and numerical study of the stability of modons
and other coherent structures in geophysical fluids. Modons are uniformly-
translating, form preserving solutions of the quasigeostrophic equations on the
beta-plane. These coherent structures imbedded in a turbulent flow are a
potential model for long-lived structures observed in nature such as atmospheric
blocks and oceanic eddies.
