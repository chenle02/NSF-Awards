This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium 2014" that will be held from May 27-31,
2014, on the campus of Kansas State University.

This conference is the thirty-fourth installment of the Great Plains Operator
Theory Symposium (GPOTS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group
of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator theory or
operator algebras. The main foci of the 2014 event are the following: the
Kadison-Singer conjecture; classification of C*-algebras; applications of set
theory to operator algebras; graph algebras; von Neumann algebras. The
conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs,
and other young scientists to present their work.
