Complex digital systems are typically prototyped using large arrays of PWB/rack
mounted field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a lengthy and costly task. This
project will utilize a 3D IC stack containing 32 to 128 FPGAs on an active
substrate that occupies approximately 1 cubic centimeter and provides all the
logic, interconnect and I/O necessary to prototype a complex computational
system. Due to the close proximity of the ICs to each other and to the active
substrate, significant power, speed and reliability improvements over
conventional prototyping boards are possible. Existing FPGA programming tools
can be extended to provide quick turn-around design/programming of this system.
Using this concept, prototyping time can be significantly reduced. This is
especially useful in: redesign/re-prototyping situations where the design must
be rapidly modified; hardware based simulation accelerators; shared resource
situations where one prototype system must (could) be shared among several
programs; and low-quantity custom systems where the "prototype" could become the
"product". The Rapid Prototyping Module (RPM) will provide significant
advantages in development cost and time-to-market for those companies having
access to this technology.
