This research deals with polymer colloids and conducting polymers in solution.
Studies on the block copoly(oxy- ethylene/oxypropylene/oxyethylene) will be
carried out in the more difficult experimental range where multiple scattering
could become a serious problem. The idea is to use very thin (0.1-0.5 mm) light-
scattering cells and longer wavelength (ca. 0.8 micron), as well as small-angle
x-ray scattering (SAXS) by means of a Bonse-Hart apparatus and possibly with the
aid of synchrotron radiation. The purposes of the polymer colloid studies are
several-fold, including methodology for characterization of micro-emulsions or
micelles with specific interacting groups. For conducting polymers, the
interesting phenomenon of charged rod aggregation in dilute solution is to be
studied. Electrophoretic separation coupled with kinetic studies on the color
change and the aggregation process may lead toward a better understanding on how
color change and aggregation are related.
