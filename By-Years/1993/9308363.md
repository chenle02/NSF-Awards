This research will establish the basic relationships arising in composite and
other multiphase materials with sharp-corner inclusions in the temperature and
stress fields. In the process of deformation and heating of multiphase
materials, contacting bodies may not necessarily remain in full contact. They
may locally separate or have imperfect contact as heat is conducted through the
interface. Moreover, microcracks can emerge from a sharp corner of the
inclusions.
