9309229 Mastrangelo The object of this research is the development of analytical
methods and computer tools for the automatic synthesis of VLSI and
micromechanical fabrication processes. These tools take a geometrical
description of a proposed device as input, decompose it into layers, and
generate a description of the fabrication sequence and mask set using a
systematic procedure. This research develops: (a) topological decomposition and
reconstruction methods for two- and three-dimensional structures and (b) a
computer program that implements the algorithms and interfaces to simulators and
semiconductor equipment. The analytical methods use multilevel and
multidimensional logic and determine fundamental questions of sequence
uniqueness and minimality. These tools allow designers to practice concept-to
manufacturing without knowledge of intermediate fabrication steps yet using
fabrication sequences much more complex that those existent today. ***
