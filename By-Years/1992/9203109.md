A fundamental question in the silicon- germanium heterostructure field is the
possibility of strong electrically-pumped light emission for light-emitting
devices. Based on promising initial results, we propose to use the Rapid Thermal
Chemical Vapor Deposition (RTCVD) growth technique to develop novel quantum
material structures to increase the light-emission intensities in the silicon-
germanium system. This RTCVD technique at Princeton has already demonstrated the
first well-resolved bandedge light-emission from strained Si1-xGex quantum wells
and superlattices, and also the first 1.3-um room- temperature electro-
luminescence (LED's) in the Si1-xGex system. It is proposed to increase the
quantum efficiencies of these initial results by examining the properties of
carriers in ultra- thin quantum wells (&lt; = 1 nm) and monolayer-scale
superlattices grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This work will focus on
the growth and opto-electronic characterization of such structures, which have
not previously been grown by CVD. Such growth will require an understanding of
the initial stages of heteroepitaxy in column IV CVD, which will be studied
through the use of Auger electron spectroscopy in the rapid thermal CVD reactor
at Princeton. The ultimate goal will be a self-limiting atomic layer epitaxy
process.
