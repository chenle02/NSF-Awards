9512817 Maltzman The broad discretion exercised by U.S. Supreme Court justices
has led scientific students of the Court to recognize that the justice who write
a majority opinion had a disproportionate ability to shape outcomes and
establish precedents. In particular, the Chief Justice's ability to assign the
majority opinion is considered one of the Chief's most important sources of
power. Previous research has demonstrated that the each justice's assignments
depend on such factors as the experience of the justice, the ideological
relationship between the justice and the Chief Justice, and the size of the
majority coalition. The P.I.s previous work is to date the only study to model
the relative influence of these factors. This research will extend the previous
work by capturing variation over time. The study will examine the extent to
which assignments made by the Chief Justice reflect personal policy preferences
and organizational needs of the Court. It will use original conference data on
assignments from 1953-1009. %%%% The broad discretion exercised by U.S. Supreme
