ABSTRACT 0229339 Erik Rosenthal U of New Haven

The problem SAT determining whether a formula in propositional logic is
satisfiable has a long history in computer science. It is important in
complexity theory and has myriad applications in fields such as robotics,
optical character recognition, database systems, computer architecture, circuit
design, and verification, to name but a few. The traditional view of much of the
mechanical theorem proving community has been that interesting applications of
automated deduction require first-order rather than propositional logic. That
view has begun to change in light of recent successes with propositional logic.
Propositional logic is of course intractiable (unless NP = P). One approach to
this problem with knowledge representaion and database systems is knowledge
compilation preprocessing the underlying propositional theory. The idea is to do
as much computation as possible in an offline phase. Then queries in the online
phase can be handled quickly. Horn clauses, ordered binary decision diagrams,
sets of prime implicates/implicants, and decomposable negation normal form
(DNNF) have all been proposed as targets of such compilation. Path dissolution
is an inference mechanism that works naturally with formulas in NNF. It is
strongly complete in the sense that any sequence of link activations will
eventually terminate, producing a linkless formula called the full dissolvent.
The paths that remain are models of the original formula. Full dissolvents have
been used effectively for computing the prime implicants and implicates of a
formula. Decomposable negation normal form was first introduced in 1998 and is
currently being studied for application to knowledge representation and database
systems. A formula in DNNF is a full dissolvent, and it appears that many of the
advantages of DNNF exist with full dissolvents. It also appears that a full
dissolvent of a formula can be obtained more effciently than a DNNF
representation of the formula. The main thrust of this project will be to
examine the relationship of DNNF and full dissolvents.
