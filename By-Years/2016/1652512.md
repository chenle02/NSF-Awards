DNA encodes the blueprint for all of life's forms and functions and must be
coiled, bundled and compacted into different packages, depending on the nature
of the cell where it resides. Understanding how DNA changes shape in space and
time is the next great hurdle in discovering how genes are regulated and passed
down through generations. The work encompassed in this research program is aimed
at innovating technologies to reveal the three-dimensional dynamics of DNA over
time in living, dividing cells. Results from this project will serve and enrich
society due to the critical nature of cell division to predicting, diagnosing
and treating diseases, improving food crop yield and hardiness, and conserving
ecological biodiversity. These broader goals will be realized by training
students at multiple levels (undergraduate, graduate, Ph.D.) to work as a team
and creatively employ cutting edge light microscopy and data analysis. Finally,
through public meetings and displays (both permanent and travelling), the
outreach program will teach the general public the history and impact of light
microscopy on the study of DNA and cell
division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chromosomes (single DNA strands) compact several
orders of magnitude upon entry into mitosis via a yet unknown mechanism. One
hundred years of research has culminated in a model wherein this compaction is
achieved by the organization of chromatin (nucleosomal DNA) into regularly
spaced loops. Evidence from as long as 50 years ago, however, concluded that
mitotic chromosomes do not adopt a "static" regular conformation. The proposed
work utilizes the C. elegans early embryo as a model cell type to discover the
basic biophysical properties governing mitotic chromosome condensation. The
research project will employ a newly invented light sheet modality, wherein
chromosomes in living developing embryos are imaged with high temporal and
spatial resolution (by using high numerical aperture (1.4 or greater) objective
lenses). Fulfillment of this project will define how subresolution chromatin
dynamics change during condensation, the molecules responsible for these
changes, and how these dynamics are modulated through development. Correlation
of dynamic, single-cell data generated here with static, population-based
genomic bio-informatics data will be synthesized to provide fundamental
understanding of how chromosomes maintain their shape, and quickly transform, to
meet the demands of their cellular functions.
