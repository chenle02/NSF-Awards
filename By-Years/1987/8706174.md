Zones of Holocene age carbonate deposits from immediately offshore of Al
Jubayl, Saudi Arabia (in the Arabian Gulf), have been neomorphosed to low-
magnesian calcite within a "freshwater" aquifer. Beneath the low-magnesian
calcites are Pleistocene sabkha-type dolomites which are well-ordered, close to
ideal stoichiometry, and have a "relatively" light 18O signature (i.e., these
dolomites are intermediate between modern and ancient sabkha-type dolomites).
Detailed microscopic (binocular, petrographic, cathodo- luminescent
petrographic, and SEM) and geochemical (A.A. and stable isotopic) analyses will
be employed to determine (1) trends due to differential elemental partitioning
associated with diagenesis of the low-magnesian calcites in the downflow direc-
tion within the freshwater aquifer, and (2) diagenesis of the dolomites. Three
major contributions anticipated as a result of this investigation will be (1)
the establishment of the validity of downflow trends in trace element abundances
to determine ancient paleoflow directions of diagenetic fluids, and (2) a better
understanding of the diagenetic evolution of sabkha dolomites and (3)
contribution of new ideas related to mineral resource management.
