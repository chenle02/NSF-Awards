This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will support an annual workshop in organometallic chemistry. The participants in
the workshop will be organometallic chemists from industry and academic
institutions, as well as from private and government research organizations. The
goals of the workshop are to facilitate communication among researchers in the
different kinds of organizations and to foster the exchange of new ideas much
earlier than is possible through formal publications. The format of the workshop
is designed to encourage maximum participation by all attendees, and the plan
for choosing attendees will ensure broadly based participation. The topics to be
discussed at the workshop will span a broad range from synthesis of new
organometallic compounds to the utilization of such compounds as catalysts or as
precursors for making new materials.
