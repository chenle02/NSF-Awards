Professor Cowen will study the structure of certain bounded linear operators on
the Hardy space of the unit disk, looking at concretely presented operators in
order to gain insight into more general problems. He will continue his
investigations of composition operators and Toeplitz operators, the main issues
being to identify commutants and decide sub- and hyponormality. The research
envisioned here is about analytic functions, a central preoccupation of
mathematics for well over a century. They can be defined variously as solutions
of a certain simple system of partial differential equations, as maps which take
planar regions to other planar regions in a way that preserves angles except at
isolated singularities, or as limits of polynomials in a suitably precise sense.
Corresponding to the diverse ways of describing them, analytic functions can be
studied in a variety of ways. The approach favored in this project is operator-
theoretic, building up Hilbert spaces of functions by taking polynomials and
their limits in a particular fashion, then studying operators on the spaces that
arise naturally from the functions, e.g. by multiplication or by composition.
Conversely, these function-theoretic operators often turn out to be quite
general in operator theory, so by studying the functions one can learn a great
deal about operators in the abstract.
