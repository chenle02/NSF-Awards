Nostoc commune is a nitrogen-fixing photosynthetic cyanobacterium with the
capacity for desiccation-tolerance. This microorganism grows freely as single
filaments (seriate growth) or in aggregates where filamentous organization of
the cells is indistinct (aseriate growth). Cells of the aseriate type express a
pronounced tolerance to extremes of water stress and accumulate massive amounts
of a class of soluble acidic proteins when they are subjected to repeated cycles
of drying and rehydration. One of these water stress (Wsp) proteins is a
glycoprotein, two others are intimately associated with carbohydrate(s). The
aims of this project are to purify and characterize biochemically the Wsp
proteins and associated carbohydrates, understand how the synthesis of the
proteins is controlled by water stress, and to discover the role of Wsp proteins
in desiccation tolerance. Techniques used in this study involve semi-continuous
and synchronized growth of cells in a fermenter, immobilization and growth of
cells on inert solid supports, protein purification, protein A-gold
immunolabelling, and assays for nitrogen fixation including the detection of
nifH mRNA in cells subjected to water stress. There is no consensus of opinion
on the sequence of events that leads to the suppression of plant growth by
waterstress. The objective of this work is to contribute to our understanidng of
desiccation tolerance. Consequently, the work is significant in view of the
extent to which water deficits impinge upon the success of managed agriculture
as well as the fundamental importance of water in gene expression.
