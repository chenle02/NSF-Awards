9513186 Baker The award will support the travel of Dr. Ian Baker, Thayer School
of Engineering at Dartmouth College, to enable him to conduct collaborative
research with Dr. Paul Munroe of the School of Materials Science and Engineering
at the University of New South Wales. The proposed work aims to further an
understanding of the relationship between grain boundary structure and chemistry
and the occurrence of intergranular fracture in FeAl, a material of some
potential commercial importance. Poor ductility and brittle fracture are
important drawbacks of intermetallic compounds. The focus of this study is on
grain boundaries (GBs) in bicrystals. The effects of boundary character and
constitutional disorder, changing the ration of Fe to Al, will be examined with
a view to determining why some GBs fracture and others do not. The effect of
ternary alloying additions will also be examined to determine why some alloying
elements suppress grain boundary fracture. The work proposed will use a field
emission gun scanning transmission electron microscope, FEG STEM, which is
jointly operated by the University of New South Wales and the University of
Sydney. The project brings together the complementary research interests of the
investigators with access to specialized equipment.
