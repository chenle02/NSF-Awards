In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Saykally of the University of California at
Berkeley will continue his experimental and theoretical research program on the
properties of water and water clusters. Detailed studies of the translational
and librational vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) bands of water clusters will
be undertaken by means of terahertz and infrared cavity ring-down
spectroscopies. The new data, which will include translational and librational
VRT bands, will be used to generate improved water dimer potential surfaces.
These, in turn, will be used to construct potentials for larger water clusters
and liquid water, which will be tested against experiment with Quantum Monte
Carlo and molecular dynamics methods. A similar approach will be used for the
study of protonated water clusters, using terahertz velocity modulation
spectroscopy and supersonic discharge plasmas. The goal here is to elucidate
details of the proton transfer dynamics, such as the dependence of proton
tunneling rates on intermolecular distances and orientation.

Water is the most fundamental substance on our planet, and enhancing our
understanding of its nature will impact many areas of science and technology.
Water clusters have recently been detected in the earth's atmosphere, and are
predicted to have important effects on its chemistry.

Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral research associates
will participate in this research. They will thereby gain valuable experience in
a forefront area of contemporary physical chemistry. Professor Saykally will
continue to be active in an outreach program through overview lectures, the
popular press, and other media, as opportunities arise, to bring new
developments in science to the public at large.
