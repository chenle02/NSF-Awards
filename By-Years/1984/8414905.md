This project is to conduct research and further development work to upgrade the
existing computer program DRAIN 2DZ (Dynamic Response Analysis Inelastic). The
study includes the following tasks: performing static nonlinear analysis with P
delta and instability effects, developing improved fine step selection
techniques, investigating energy balance, damage measures, and alterations to
detailed dynamic analysis, and developing interactive procedures. The effort
will result in an upgraded program which will become a valuable tool for other
research studies. The upgraded program will have a finite element library of
over 20 element types, and will be released for general use through the National
Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE).
