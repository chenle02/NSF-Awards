CAREER: Optical Forces in Integrated Microphotonic Devices&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Michelle L. Povinelli, University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microphotonic devices, such as photonic crystals
and microresonators, control light on the sub-wavelength scale. Large-scale
integration on semiconductor chips will enable all-optical circuits capable of
complex information processing. To achieve this goal, mechanisms for tuning,
adapting, and reconfiguring individual devices are needed. The proposed work
will use optical forces for this purpose. Preliminary results have shown that
light can be used to pull two parallel cantilevers together or push them apart.
This effect will be used to envision new optical devices whose properties can be
controlled all-optically. Electromagnetic simulations will be used to calculate
optical forces in lithographically-fabricated structures such as coupled
waveguide cantilevers and photonic crystal
slabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will
establish a new mechanism for positioning and control on the nanoscale. The
results are expected to have broad impact in microphotonics, integrated optics,
quantum optomechanics, and optical trapping. The work will benefit from cross-
fertilization of ideas with the MEMS community: optical forces provide an
alternative actuation mechanism to traditional electrostatic approaches and will
result in unique application niches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
proposed work includes integrated research and educational activities that will
impact the scientific research, USC, and Los Angeles communities. The PI will
give lectures on engineering careers to groups of female and minority students.
The PI and her research group will also work with the USC Center for Engineering
Diversity to develop two programs for educationally-disadvantaged K-12 students:
interactive optics demos and classroom talks by USC undergraduates that relate
electrical engineering to everyday life. &lt;br/&gt;
