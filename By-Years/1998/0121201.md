EIA-0121201 &lt;br/&gt;Kintsch, Walter&lt;br/&gt;University of Colorado
Boulder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR/PE: Latent Semantic Analysis: Theory and
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program is designed to
motivate, create and evaluate a new theory and methodology of learning, in which
computer analysis of writing and speech is used to teach students to process and
comprehend information more effectively. This work will inform educators on
instructional and assessment strategies for improved reading comprehension to a
degree not yet present in schools today. The methodology will teach students to
read more effectively and to comprehend and learn more from what they read.
Since the methodology can be applied to any text, it can be incorporated into
reading programs to improve reading achievement, and be used as an effective
tool to improve achievement in science and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
work is intended to achieve both theoretical and research breakthroughs in four
areas: (1) extend LSA to incorporate syntactic as well as semantic information;
(2) extend the power and scope of LSA by advancing its conceptual and
mathematical framework to include other psychological process models that handle
phenomena such as metaphor and causal inferences; and (3) extend LSA to process
transcriptions of natural continuous speech, enabling LSA to be used to teach
comprehension of both read and spoken text by children who cannot write or type
well enough to produce textual responses; and (4) demonstrate that these
theoretical advances improve comprehension of speech and text by students in
different grades, ethic backgrounds, and in different
subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
