The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Southwest Missouri State University
is instituting a required undergraduate research component for its majors in
physics and engineering physics. The new project course sequence, in addition to
an ongoing Honors Project course, means all majors are undertaking experimental
projects. This project is adding equipment which enables students to do projects
involving the thermal and optical properties of thin films and surfaces, and the
properties of optical images. The University is matching the award with an equal
amount of funds.
