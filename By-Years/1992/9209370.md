For many years, economists have speculated on the potential cost savings that
could accrue from applying market-based approaches, such as emissions taxes and
marketable emission rights, to controlling environmental risks. Only recently,
however, have regulatory agencies in developed countries begun to experiment
with these approaches. Most new applications are aimed at limiting a particular
set of environmental hazards, such as air or water pollution. The implementation
of these regulatory reforms provides a unique opportunity to examine how
different market-based institutions perform in practice. The research has three
main objectives: (1) to examine the evolution and performance of new market-
based approaches for managing environmental risk critically; (2) to provide a
more realistic framework for comparing alternative instruments for controlling
environmental risk; and (3) to develop rules that would help increase efficiency
in environmental markets. The research effort collects new data on the
performance of environmental markets and uses these data to understand factors
affecting the performance of these markets better. More realistic models of the
impact of different regulatory approaches on environmental quality and control
costs are expected to result from this analysis.
