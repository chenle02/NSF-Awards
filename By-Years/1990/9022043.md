Through this award to the American Institute of Physics, partial support is
provided for a conference on the recruitment and retention of women in physics
to be held in November 1990 in the Washington, D.C. area. The conference will
focus on recruitment and retention of women at the undergraduate and graduate
student levels. One of the important goals of the conference is to identify the
attributes of departments that have been successful in attracting and keeping
women in physics programs. The invitees will include representatives of
professional societies, physics faculty members, and female faculty from smaller
institutions and women minority students will be especially encouraged.
Conference proceedings will be published and results of the conference will be
discussed at the annual joint meeting of AAPT and APS in winter, 1991.
