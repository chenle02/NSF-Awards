Gas hydrates are important as a potential resource, and also because of their
possible influence on climate and the global carbon cycle. Their formation is
well understood, but their source(s) is not. Pore waters associated with gas
hydrates have elevated halogen content, making dating by 129I (AMS) feasible, as
has been shown by a pilot study. The idea of this proposal is to date the pore
waters and to use their chemistry and that of the sediments to begin to unravel
the origin of methane hydrates. Japanese collaborators will provide samples and
data relevant to the study. In this proposal, the PI requests support for the
sample preparation (Rochester) and AMS dating to be done at Purdue
Univ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
