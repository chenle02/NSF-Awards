PIs plus US and Russian collaborators will conduct field and laboratory research
on Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian paleontology (ammonites, fusulinids,
conodonts), stratigraphy and sedimentolgy of strata in the southern Urals, which
are among candidates for stratotypes. This study will contribute significantly
to global correlation and to understanding events associated with the
construction and nature of the supercontinent of Pangaea.
