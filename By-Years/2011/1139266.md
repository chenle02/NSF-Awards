This is a workshop on virtual repositories for archaeological science, data
sharing, and research collaboration. The PI points out that geography, multi-
agency ownership, borrowing restrictions, restrictions on access to collections
and the issue of transporting fragile objects are issues creating a growing need
for virtual repositories or cyberinfrastructure that will allow for researchers
to access, integrate, and mine diverse collections and data assemblages at
scales not currently possible within existing frameworks. This workshop will
bring together museum curators, archaeologists, and computer scientists to
create a model for virtual repositories of arctic collections that could be a
pilot for much larger project that ultimately would serve as a virtual
representation of a museum's entire inventory or complete archaeological
collections and archives. The proposed workshop would be held at Idaho State
University in the Fall of 2011 and will include key actors from academia,
federal agencies and Alaska Native communities.
