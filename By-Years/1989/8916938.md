The cardiovascular system is the first organ system to function in vertebrate
embryos, and as such is critical to the development of all subsequent tissues
and organs. Yet, the development of embryonic cardiovascular physiology remains
very poorly understood for any vertebrate, including birds and mammals. This
project will investigate the development of cardiovascular physiology in
amphibian larvae, which are highly appropriate as a model for vertebrate embryos
in general. Measurements will be made of heart rate, cardiac output, blood
pressure and peripheral resistance. The experiments will be designed to
determine the onset of, and subsequent developmental changes in, the basic heart
functions (heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, peripheral
resistance) of the immediate post-hatch anuran larva. Once basic hemodynamics
have been measured, then the development of the ability of the heart to regulate
its own function will be described. This study will be the first comprehensive
investigation of the development of cardiovascular function in any lower
vertebrate. Amphibian development traditionally has served as a general model
for vertebrate development, and consequently the physiological studies will have
broad applicability to both vertebrate physiology and developmental biology,
particular in the absence of substantial published data on either bird or mammal
embryos.
