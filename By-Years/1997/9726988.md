ABSTRACT OPP-9726988 CROSS, MATTHEW UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO This project
continues support for the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Data Coordination Center
at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Data collected by ARCSS researchers
studying all aspects of global change in the Arctic are accumulated in a central
data storage facility for dissemination to other ARCSS researchers and, after
1-2 years, are made available to the entire scientific community. Dissemination
of data is accomplished through publication on CD ROMs or by direct access
through a World Wide Web site. The ARCSS Center works closely with individual
and coordinated groups of researchers to facilitate transfer of new data into
the archive and to tailor data products relevant to researcher needs. The Data
Center is an important component in the integration of multidisciplinary
research efforts to study the complex interactions and feedbacks of global
climate with the Arctic system.
