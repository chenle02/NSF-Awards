Propose the construction of Multiple Application X-ray Imaging Undulator
Microscope (MAXIMUM), a unique experimental system suitable for the
implementation of photoemission microscopy with undulator synchrotron radiation
and of a variety of other ad- vanced x-ray microscopy techniques. The system
uses synchrotron radiation emitted by a 60-pole undulator installed on the
storage ring at the Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Cener. Its unique
characteristics will be exploited for a variety of studies in biology,
biomedicine, physics, chemistry and materials science. This project will
transform several synchrotron-radiation experimental techniques into novel
microscopies. The principal mode of operation of MAXIMUM will be as a
photoemission micro- scope. This will make it possible to obtain detailed
"chemical Maps" of the specimen, with information on its chemical components and
on their chemical status. The latter capability enhances the possible
applications of photoemission microscopy with respect to other microscopies.
Such a capability is very interesting, for example, in the study of
semiconductor inter- faces and of cancer cells, and in the characterization of
integrated circuits.
