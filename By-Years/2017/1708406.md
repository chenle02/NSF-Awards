Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The control of electronic degrees of freedom in
nanomaterials is essential for the emergence of new phenomena. Recently, many
atomically thin materials have been realized that each offer unique properties
ranging from superconductors to semiconductors and insulators. By combining
these atomically thin materials in vertical heterostructures, new electronic
properties are expected to emerge. Spatially resolved probes offer a unique
opportunity for precision measurement and control of the electronic properties
of these two dimensional materials. These probes have the ability to measure the
orientation of the materials and the interactions between them. These quantities
ultimately determine the type of states that can be created in the
heterostructures. The results obtained in this proposal will lead to the
development of novel electronic devices, such as transistors, photodetectors and
sensors. The proposed program will provide training for graduate students as
well as enable undergraduate students from underserved groups to participate in
research through the Arizona Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholars
(ASEMS) Program, and will aim to increase the retention of these students in
STEM majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
will create and study novel correlated states in graphene heterostructures using
a combination of scanning probe microscopy and electrical transport
measurements. In addition, this project will train graduate and undergraduate
students in the field of nanoscience. While graphene is a topologically trivial
semi-metal, there are a wide range of other two-dimensional materials which are
expected to exhibit more exotic behavior such as superconductors and topological
insulators. By creating vertical heterostructures between graphene and these
other materials, unique states will be created in graphene devices. In
particular, three different types of devices will be fabricated and studied: (1)
graphene on hexagonal boron nitride to create a commensurate stacking and
therefore open a band gap in graphene. (2) Graphene on superconductors to study
the proximity effect and the effect of a periodic magnetic field from vortices.
(3) Graphene on topological insulators and heavy metal transition metal
dichalcogenides to enhance the spin-orbit interaction in graphene. The key to an
understanding of all these induced states in graphene is the ability to map
their behavior on the atomic scale that the combination of scanning probe
microscopy and electrical transport measurements will provide.
