9602576 Scholin This objectives of this collaborative research project between
Christopher A. Scholin of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and
Lesley L. Rhodes of the Cawthorn Institute in Nelson, New Zealand are (1) to
determine whether the dipstick assay incorporating large-subunit ribosomal RNA
(LSU rRNA)- targeted probes is a viable method for identifying and quantifying
toxigenic species of Pseudo-nitzschia associated with the production of domoic
acid (DA), a neurotoxic substance linked to illness of humans and wildlife
(amnesic shellfish poisoning) and to economic losses, (2) to compare the
performance of the dipstick assay to a microscopy-based whole cell fluorescence
assay, and (3) to assess the utility of the method for routine analyses of
samples collected as part of the New Zealand shellfish biotoxin monitoring
program. The results will serve as a model for how one might detect other
aquatic-borne toxic micro organisms in near real-time using DNA probes.
