Recent studies, including important contributions by Dr. Meredith Blackwell of
Louisiana State University, suggest that dispersal of fungal spores by insects
and other arthropods is more common than previously thought. With the
ascomycetes studied by Blackwell, beetles (including pine bark beetles) and
mites have been shown to be critical vectors of spore transport. This
information and new knowledge about the complete life histories of these fungi
have led to new hypotheses about the evolutionary relationships of arthropod-
associated fungi. Because morphological features have not always been helpful in
evaluating the taxonomic relationships and phylogeny of these fungi, in large
part because of their very small size, Blackwell will incorporate data from
molecular analyses of ribosomal gene sequences in her study of evolution. Two
general hypotheses about the evolution of these fungi will be investigated. (l)
The perithecial ascomycetes associated with arthropods are not a single natural
group but represent an assemblage of different evolutionary lines that have
converged upon an "insect-transport" system of spore dispersal. (2) The
evolution of fungi that are obligate parasites of arthropods has proceeded from
ancestors that relied on insects for spore dispersal. The study represents a
pioneering combination of traditional mycological techniques of morphology and
life-history investigation along with modern molecular methods of genome
analysis.
