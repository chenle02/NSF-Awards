The goal of this four-year project is to develop video case studies on
scientific sense-making, these materials can then serve as catalysts and models
for moving teachers in middle grades (4-8) toward a sense-making perspective in
science and for linking that perspective to new teaching and assessment
practices. The project will integrate research based on intensive work with
teachers from diverse backgrounds, video case study development, inservice
delivery, and evaluation. The aim is to first build, through collaborative
research involving teachers, science educators, scientists, and educational
researchers, a knowledge base an critical sense-making practices for teacher
development in science. The project will then use what has been learned to
create a corpus of ten video case studies in scientific sense-making and an
accompanying handbook for use in a range of inservice contexts. The project
final phase will be a documentation of the effectiveness of the video case
studies in promoting a sense-making perspective among teachers in field tests
during three contexts: single session workshops, and long term sustained
development. The cost sharing will be 11% of the NSF portion.
