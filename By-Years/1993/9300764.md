The underlying objective of the GEM program is a understand the structure and
dynamics of the terrestrial plasma environment to such a degree that a global
model of this environment with predictive capabilities can be constructive. This
objective is to be accomplished through a series of focussed campaigns, the
first of which concentrated on the coupling of the solar wind to the
magnetopause, its boundary layers and the ionosphere. The proposed effort is to
coordinate this campaign through workshops, newsletters and various
collaborative studies. At the present level of support the efforts of about 70
researchers are being coordinated with the assistance of two other coordinators.
As a result of these efforts, we will reach a significantly improved
understanding of how the solar wind supplies energy to the magnetosphere. This
improved understanding is important for the operations of our increasingly
sophisticated technological systems which much operate in this environment.
