This research is directed toward gaining a better understanding of wintertime
air pollution in the United States. Chemical modeling will be used to analyze
data from a recent field study, the NSF-funded Wintertime INvestigation of
Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) campaign conducted during February
and March of 2015. The results of this research will be relevant for policy
decisions regarding improvements in air quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three
research objectives of this project are to: (1) improve the constraints on
wintertime pollutant emissions; (2) elucidate the origin of oxidants during
winter; and (3) examine the seasonal response of particulate matter less than
2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations to past and future
changes in emissions. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model will be used to
interpret the observations from the WINTER field campaign. Because emissions of
ammonia (NH3) from livestock operations and fertilized fields are highly
uncertain, this project includes an examination of the ability of different NH3
emissions inventories in the model to capture the observed winter concentrations
of ammonium (NH4+) and NH4+ wet deposition fluxes over the US. Primary and
secondary organic aerosol precursor emissions will be constrained in order to
improve the representation of organic aerosol in the model. Wintertime ground-
based and aircraft observations of HCHO and ClNO2 will be used to investigate
their sources during winter. Finally, the model will be used together with
surface observations to further understand the seasonal sensitivity of surface
PM2.5 composition to emission changes over the entire US. This project will
support a postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
