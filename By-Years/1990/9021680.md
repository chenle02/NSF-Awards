Measurements of optical activity have long played an essential role in the
development of organic chemistry and biochemistry. The study of optical rotatory
dispersion (ORD) or circular dichroism (CD) provides important information about
the electronic states or structures of individual molecules or ions. These
techniques are used when studying absolute configurations of molecules, reaction
mechanisms and kinetics, asymmetric or stereospecific syntheses, thermodynamic
properties of dissolved species, and many other stereochemical problems. This
award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program to the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder will help them acquire a
Circular Dichrograph. The acquisition will enhance chemical research in the
following areas: 1. Circular Dichroism as a Method for Probing Ribozyme
Conformation and Substrate Binding. 2. Applications of Circular Dichroism in
Studies of Protein Structural Dynamics. 3. Solution Structures of Antimicrobial
Peptides. 4. Analysis of Protein Circular Dichroism by Theory and Experiment. 5.
Magnetic Circular Dichroism.
