NeTS - NR: Ad hoc Congestion Control for Mobile Ad Hoc

0435320&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
developing ad hoc end-to-end congestion control techniques particularly adapted
to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). In mobile ad hoc networks, frequent link
failures and other random losses unrelated to congestion disqualify packet loss
as a reliable congestion indicator and require ad hoc congestion control
algorithms that must (1) accurately diagnose the real cause of a loss and (2)
appropriately react to each type of loss. The research team is investigating an
innovative direction to develop an accurate loss discriminator and an implicit
continuous congestion measure that is based on packet loss and yields better
performance. The key to solving these problems is to "de-randomize" congestion
losses. This is achieved by marking packets with different discard priorities
and enabling biased queue management at all intermediate nodes so that they may
target and drop packets with the highest discard priority when congestion
occurs. A judicious marking allows senders to implicitly estimate congestion.
This project attacks theoretical and systems challenges and will enable the
practical deployment of MANETs. In addition, such challenges will help attract
and educate talented graduate students and retain the brightest undergraduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
