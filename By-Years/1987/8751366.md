This project will disseminate model programs directed at increasing the pool of
minority students who pursue engineering, science and mathematics based college
study. The basis of this dissemination will be the programs that have been
developed by the members of the National Association of Precollege Directors
(NAPD). This organization includes twenty-one independent programs which have
been successful at guiding minority students into engineering and other
technical areas and helping to assure that they have the mathematics and science
skills necessary to succeed. In order to bring these techniques and the NAPD
type program model to a new and much wider audience, NAPD will produce a series
of comprehensive manuals to serve as resources for communities interested in
adapting such models to their areas. In addition, a three tiered system of
training seminars will be implemented which will include: Interactive National
Training Seminars for school system policy makers, Regional Training Seminars
for Administrators and other education and community leaders, and Local
Implementation Workshops for individual school system personnel and others who
will be adapting the model to their own area.
