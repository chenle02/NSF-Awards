The REU in the Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MIL) in the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Florida (UF) will focus
on the design and construction of autonomous robots and machine learning. The
student activity builds on the success of our previous REU sites, our NSF-ILI
sponsored Intelligent Machines Design Laboratory (IMDL), and the research
activities of the MIL. Our undergraduate activities have resulted in large
numbers of undergraduate-authored research papers, future graduate thesis
topics, and concepts for potential consumer-friendly robotic products. Each of
the twelve undergraduate participants will design and construct two autonomous
robot platforms: one personal robot (which the participant can take back to
their home institution) and a larger autonomous platform as a part of a group
project. Participants will study, research, develop and test machine learning
algorithms by implementing them in their two autonomous agents. REU participants
will be carefully guided by two faculty members and a graduate teaching
assistant in the process of development and testing of novel machine learning
paradigms, propelling them into the midst of state-of-the-art research in
autonomous robots and machine learning.
