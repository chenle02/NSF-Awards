Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1404282, Principal Investigator: Brian
White&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A minimal surface is the mathematical counterpart to
a soap film spanning a curved wire. The elegant appearance of a film of soap is
associated to the soap film's property of spanning the wire in the most
efficient way possible, where efficiency here means using as little surface area
as possible. The physical elegance of the soap film is reflected in the
mathematical description of its efficiency, which was discovered in the 18th
century and continues to motivate progress in geometry and differential
equations. Among the topics to be pursued under the support of this grant are
the properties of helicoid-like minimal surfaces, which spiral in space like the
surface of a screw or a multi-story parking ramp; the classical helicoid was
discovered in the 1770s to be a minimal surfaces, but a number of other examples
that closely resemble helicoids in the large but are more complicated near the
origin were discovered only in the last ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
principal investigator plans to study helicoid-like minimal surfaces, densities
of minimal cones, the dependence of a minimal surface on the total curvature of
its boundary, the branching behavior of minimal surfaces, and properties of mean
curvature flow, particularly singularity formation and the non-uniqueness known
as "fattening." The methods to be employed are a combination of classical
minimal surface theory, geometric measure theory, and partial differential
equations.
