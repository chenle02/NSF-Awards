Fundamental research will be conducted on the process of optical modulation.
Geometries in LiNbO3 (Lithium Niobate) which appear particularly favorable and
new materials which could perform this important function with greater
efficiency and less power will be investigated. A scheme which involves the
interference of light beams directed along two separate paths is also
investigated.
