This research addresses three key issues pertaining to the clustering of large,
complex datasets. First, a unifying view of model-based clustering will be
developed to form a theoretical basis for understanding and comparing a wide
range of existing clustering algorithms for complex data. This view will be
systematically explored to develop improved algorithms for specific
applications. Second, complexity arising from domain constraints on balancing
and dealing with incrementally acquired non-stationary data, such as newsfeeds,
is addressed via adaptive clustering techniques. Finally, methods for obtaining
a single consensus solution given multiple clustering results are investigated.
Such methods will facilitate distributed data mining under severe restrictions
on data sharing due to privacy and other constraints. Benchmarks for the
proposed research areas will be developed and made available to the research
community. Further information about the project is available on the project web
site http://www.lans.ece.utexas.edu/scalclust.html. Broader impacts of this
project also include outreach activities to high school students and freshmen
students. Demonstration modules that illustrate data analysis issues will be
designed for students and enable them to use case studies resulting from this
work and gain understanding of clustering techniques.
