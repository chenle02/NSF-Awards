Abstract Schumaker This proposal is to support the ninth international
conference on Approximation Theory and Related Topics in Nashville, January 3-6.
These meeting have been the main general international conferences on
approximation theory for the last 25 years. The objective of the conference is
to provide a triennial forum for researchers in the field to discuss current
work. It also will provide a forum for the awarding of the Second Vasil A. Popov
Prize in Approximation Theory. There meeting will feature 7 one-hour survey
lectures in addition to the one-hour lecture by the winner of the Popov Prize.
Approximation is the defining feature of mathematical analysis. Compact
expressions of solutions of problems arising in the physical universe rarely
occur. More often, the solutions must be approximated by known quantities which
have desirable properties and are easily computed. This research contributes to
the dual goals of understanding the special functions of analysis and
discovering their approximation properties.
