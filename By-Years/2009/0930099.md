This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop a
multifunctional graphene-platinum composite for hydrogen fuel cells. High
performance fuel cells currently have inefficient catalyst utilization due to
limited contact between Pt nanoparticles and the solid proton conductor. This
difficulty can be ameliorated by the use of high-Pt-content catalysts supported
on high-surface-area supports. Graphene, a one-atom-thick, conductive allotrope
of carbon, is an ideal catalyst support with a rare combination of extremely
high specific surface area, remarkable thermal/electrical conductivity, and good
thermal stability. Graphene catalyst supports will increase the efficacy of the
Pt catalyst, retard the sintering/agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, and provide
electronic continuity for electron transport. Allotropica Technologies, in
collaboration with the University of North Carolina, will exploit its newly
discovered route to graphene for fuel cell applications. The combination of high
surface area and low-porosity in the proposed graphene-Pt composite constitutes
a new type of electrocatalyst, one that will achieve higher catalyst utilization
and result in enhanced fuel cell performance.

Fuel cells continue to attract attention worldwide; the European Union and Japan
are spending more than $100 million annually on fuel cell research. The heart of
a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cell is a membrane electrolyte sandwiched
between two layers of catalyst, typically in the form of platinum or alloyed
platinum nanoparticles dispersed onto a high surface area form of carbon. We
propose to use the ultra-high surface area of graphene to support Pt
nanoparticles catalysts in hydrogen fuel cells. Our novel graphene-Pt composite
should lead to an improvement in performance efficiency, mechanical strength,
and the thermal management in this important component of a comprehensive energy
strategy.
