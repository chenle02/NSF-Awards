9734496 Good This career program has two goals: (1) to further the development
of the study of biomedical engineering within the chemical engineering
discipline; and (2) to form a partnership with secondary schools in the region
to both enhance the science skills of the teachers within those schools and to
increase the awareness by teachers of career possibilities in engineering. To
meet the first goal, one research project is to investigate the role of protein
aggregation in the mechanism of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. An
undergraduate and graduate course under development is to use material obtained
from this project as well as other ongoing research projects. To meet the second
goal, a four year project is to bring 24 secondary school science teachers to
Texas A&amp;M for an annual five week teacher enhancement program. Teachers are
to visit several manufacturing facilities and remediation sites within Texas
where engineering is practiced and attended seminars on engineering career
opportunities and engineering research programs. ***
