This award supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
Northwestern University. The project will study return migration from Lusaka,
Zambia's capital city, to a rural province. The student will examine the gender
division of labor within the migrant economy as well as the influence of
government policies on migrant strategies. This research is important as a
counter-example to the simplistic model of rural-to-urban migration that most
commentators on this subject adopt. In reality migration has always contained
counter-flows, and this case study will provide valuable information on migrant
strategies and values that will be useful to policy makers in dealing with
problems of migration.
