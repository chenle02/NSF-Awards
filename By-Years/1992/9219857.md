The goal of this proposal is to obtain a picture of a protein and its solvent at
atomic resolution and to test how well the average position and mobility of
atoms in the structure are modeled by molecular dynamics calculations. This can
be accomplished experimentally by determining the protein's vibration and
equilibrium structure using diffraction methods and theoretically by using
empirical force fields. Crambin is a hydrophobic, plant protein (MW = 4720) that
is unique because it diffracts beyond 0.83 A and has 99% of its diffraction data
observed at this resolution limit. This means its structure can be determined
free of the usual restraints of protein refinement. Although crambin's function
is not yet known, it has activity as a local anesthetic. The above goal will be
addressed using crambin by the following specific means: unrestrained refinement
of the crambin model against the 0.83 A, 130 K and the 0.945 A, 300 K X-ray
data; corefinement of neutron and X-ray data at 300 K; refinement of crambin
X-ray data at multiple temperatures; full-crystal molecular dynamics simulations
and comparison with the X-ray structure; and analysis of the methods to predict
protein water structure. %%% This project provides a unique opportunity to
obtain an experimental picture of a protein molecule, its surrounding solvent,
and its dynamic movement in extremely sharp detail using single crystal X-ray
diffraction. The fine features that are revealed can be tested against theories
that are currently being used to predict and refine the architecture of
proteins. The fact that crystals of crambin are extremely well ordered make
possible the determination and testing of these details.
