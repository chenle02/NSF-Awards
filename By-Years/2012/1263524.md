The cerebral cortex is characterized by convex and concave neural folding
structures of gyri and sulci. Recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high
angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) studies have shown that the fibers
connected to gyri are significantly denser, than those connected to sulci. That
is, in human cortices, a dominant fraction of fibers are connected to gyri.
Inspired by this result, the objective of this project is to dissect the
functional interactions between gyri and sulci and establish a fundamental
theoretic framework that can consistently explain the intrinsic relationships
amongst cortical fold patterns, structural connections, and functional
interactions between gyri and sulci. By using resting state fMRI, task-based
fMRI and natural stimulus fMRI datasets, this project will investigate the
hypothesis that functional interaction strength is strong between gyral-gyral
regions, moderate between gyral-sulcal regions, and weak between sulcal-sulcal
regions. Altogether, these studies aim to establish a novel gyri-centric
representation of functional cortical architecture.

The discovery and representation of common functional architecture of gyri and
sulci will fundamentally advance scientific understanding of the brain. The
dissection and differentiation of functional roles of cortical gyri and sulci
will transform numerous neuroimaging applications that rely on accurate
definition and localization of structural substrates for structural,
connectivity and functional brain mappings. A variety of basic brain science
research and neural engineering studies will significantly benefit from the
offered novel insights of the relationships between cortical structure and
function. This project will produce both theoretic understanding and concrete
representation of functional architectures of gyri and sulci, which will lay
down solid foundations to study numerous brain disorders in the future. The
novel educational approaches and materials generated from this project will
contribute to cultivate the next generation of scientists and engineers who are
able to face real-world problems.
