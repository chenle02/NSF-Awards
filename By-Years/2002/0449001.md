&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0449001 Daniel
Reichart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Daniel Reichart, at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, will undertake a research and educational program to
study gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. Recent work indicates that GRBs result
from the deaths of massive stars, during their transition to black holes. They
are the greatest explosions seen since the Big Bang, surpassing even supernovae
explosions. Using a variety of telescopes, the PI will obtain well-sampled data
at both early and intermediate times after the explosions, in both the optical
and near-infrared wavelengths. The purpose of the research is to use GRBs to
probe the early universe, and improve our understanding of GRB physics, their
environments, and establish how diverse or uniform these events are. The PI will
utilize much of the time on project telescopes for educational activities, in
conjunction with the "NC PROMPT COLLABORATION", a collection of ten
undergraduate institutions (including historically African-American and Native-
American ones), and Morehead Planetarium and Science Center. &lt;br/&gt;
