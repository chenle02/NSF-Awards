The objective of this project is to characterize genetic control of the
transition, termed "phase change", from juvenile to adult vegetative growth
habit in maize. This attempt to dissect genetic regulation of the temporal gene
expression program will be accomplished via analysis of mutations (Tp1, Tp2 and
Tp3) that prolong the juvenile growth phase. The function of these mutations
will be investigated by study of the autonomy of their expression, and their
effect on maize leaf growth, morphology and cell lineage. The phenotypes and
genetic interactions of putative loss.of.function derivatives of the primary
mutations will be characterized as an additional approach to definition of their
function. Information from these studies will be used to evaluate growth
transition models which involve: 1) overlapping juvenile and adult programs; and
2) sequential, mutually exclusive juvenile and adult programs. This study has
the potential to advance fundamental knowledge of the genetic control of maize
development, and possible pathways of its evolution.
