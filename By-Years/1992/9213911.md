The objective of this research program is to use multiphoton excitation to
study the spectroscopy, ionization and dissociation dynamics of small molecules.
Resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) will be used to study the
spectroscopy of excited molecular states that cannot be reached by single photon
excitation.
