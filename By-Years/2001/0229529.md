Carlson &lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229529&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compositional gradients at
the rims of partially resorbed garnet crystals from Texas and Labrador will be
analyzed by electron microprobe and laser-ablation inductively coupled mass
spectrometry. Computer simulations of the origin of these stranded diffusion
profiles will be used to place limits on the relative and absolute rates of
intracrystalline diffusion of both major elements (Mg, Fe, Mn, Ca) and trace
elements (e.g., Y, Yb, Dy, Sm, Ce, Nd). The project will enlarge and enrich the
existing dataset on diffusion in garnet, extending it to the temperatures and
pressures relevant to crustal metamorphic processes, expanding it to a greater
number of elements of interest, and broadening it to encompass a wider range of
geologically important garnet compositions. Applications of the new data are
foreseen in the areas of geothermobarometry, geochronometry, assessment of
heating and cooling histories in metamorphic terranes, and quantification of
rates of tectonic uplift, among others. During the project, undergraduate and
graduate students en route to professional scientific careers will acquire
state-of-the-art analytical skills in electron-probe microanalysis, laser-
ablation technology and quadrapole mass spectrometry, and high-resolution X-ray
computed tomography.&lt;br/&gt;
