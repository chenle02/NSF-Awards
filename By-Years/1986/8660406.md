The serviceability limit state associated with occupant comfort under wind
induced lateral and torsional motion is becoming an increasingly important
consideration in the design of tall buildings. In some instances, structural
modifications required to produce acceptable predicted response characteristics
can cost hundreds for thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars. With
these kinds of cost at stake it is imperative that predicted response levels be
as accurate and reliable as possible. Aeroelastic model tests and high-frequency
force-balance tests provide two means of estimating building response to winds.
In most instances, aeroelastic model tests are impractical because of the time
required to design and construct the models. Results obtained after completion
of the normal design process cn produce cotly modificaiton or lively buildings
where occupants must endure numerous instance of disturbing motion. Current
high-frequency force-balance test can provide results in a fraction of the time
required for aeroelastic model tests but incorporate linear mode shapes for sway
and a uniform mode shape for torsion. Force-balance tests also do not provide
information on possible aeroelastic effects which may increase or decrease
loading and response. Research is proposed on second generation high-frequency
force-balances and associated instrumentation which would overcome the model
shape inaccuracies by allowing modal forces to be determined for various mode
shapes. Badic research is also proposed on the influence of building motion on
modal forces. The Principal Investigator is well qualified to conduct the
research. The research will lead to improved force balance for use by commercial
wind tunnel testing laboratories. Use of the improved balances will allow more
accurate prediction of wind-induced response for complex structures where
torsion is an important consideration and where mode shapes are not linear.
Better understanding of aeroelastic effects will provide valuable information on
limits to the application and force balance test
