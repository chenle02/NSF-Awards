The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to track potential
environmental impact in a tamper-proof fashion. This database can be used for
outreach, benchmarking, and other applications. The forecasts developed can be
used to inform strategic resource allocation decisions and other discussions
regarding environmental sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
integrates traditional carbon analysis methods, such as Life Cycle Assessment,
with distributed ledgers and the internet of things to create a global carbon
emission tracking system. This system will incorporate data from a sensor
network measuring air quality, water quality, atmospheric carbon levels, and
other variables. This project will conduct design and development of a dynamic
system of carbon tracking using blockchain to verify records over time, creating
a centralized, tamper-proof record for global carbon emissions. The project will
also develop improved models and forecasts on various regional, industrial, and
temporal scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
