This proposal will provide partial travel support for graduate students,
postdocs, and junior faculty members from the US to attend the Conference on the
Geophysics of Slab Dynamics to be held in the Jeju Island, South Korea, from
August 19 to August 22nd, 2012. All participants receiving support are required
to present a talk or a poster.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Conference is aimed to
provide a holistic examination of subduction processes by discussing megathrust
earthquakes and tsunami modeling, subduction dynamics and mantle convection,
fluids in subduction systems, rheology and slab dynamics, seismic imaging of
subducting slabs and induced mantle flow, and subduction and tectonics. The
program includes a field trip aimed to provide a brief introduction of the Jeju
Island geology. The Jeju island is a volcanic island recognized as a UNESCO
World Heritage site for its spectacular lava tubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal will contribute to the development of the emerging scientists of the
field by providing them with the opportunity to meet and interact with leading
national and international researchers, gaining deeper understanding and broader
perspective of the field, and forming the basis for future collaborations.
