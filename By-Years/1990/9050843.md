This project develops a modern, up-to-date power laboratory that provides
realistic instruction in actual power systems operation. Digital simulation
software is being acquired for transient, load flow and harmonic analysis. An
analog power system simulator is being assembled, using control devices and
instruments found in actual power systems. The equipment being purchased
includes two 5 KW generators with speed controls, a switched capacitor power
factor correction unit and a harmonic monitor. These items, together with an
existing 34 KW generator allow experiments in power electronics and analyses of
present day problems such as harmonics and ground system voltages. The project
addresses the need for more emphasis on power technology education. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
