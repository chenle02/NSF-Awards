9412672 This renewal proposal will focus on transport properties of type II
superconductors using generalized semiclassical methods and will develop
bosonization approach to study strongly correlated systems. The motivation for
the study of transport properties is to understand the anomalous resistive
characteristics in high temperature superconductors. The bosonization approach
is a nonperturbative way to study exotic properties of non-Fermi liquid ground
states. The method is applicable to dimensions greater than one. %%% The
proposed work will be to study strongly correlated systems using generalized
semiclassical methods and bosonization approach. Semiclassical methods will be
used to study transport properties of type II superconductors in magnetic field
with the motivation to explain anomalous resistive characteristics. Bosonization
method will provide better understanding of the complicated ground state
properties of strongly correlated systems.
