This research investigates the fundamental phenomena of wave propagation effects
for acoustical non-destructive testing methods and determines the behavior of a
Gaussian beam propagating across a curved fluid solid interface, evaluates the
wave field produced near the transducer and in regions far from the transducer,
and establishes the non-linear interaction with focused beams. The results of
this research will improve the understanding of the complex interaction
occurring as the waves encounter the fluid-solid interface. The development of a
Rayleigh wave on the surface which may develop for certain impingement angles is
an important event, if surface flaws are to be detected. If interior flaws are
to be examined, the development of Rayleigh waves must be avoided because they
detract from the energy of the beam used to probe interior regions of the
specimen. The acoustic beam method is an effective non-destructive technique for
defining the size and shape of both surface and internal flaws.
