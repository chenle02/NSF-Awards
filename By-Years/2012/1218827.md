Computer programmers must create software that produces a correct answer while
making effective use of the computer hardware. This challenge of combining
correctness and efficient hardware use is particularly difficult in scientific
research, which often requires novel computing hardware for complex
calculations. Different software "tuning" techniques are needed for shared-
memory multi-core computers, distributed systems such as clusters of
workstations, and high-speed graphics processors. Thus, scientific research with
a computational element often requires great programming effort, which must be
done with care, as performance tuning can introduce errors into a working
program. The traditional alternative to manual performance tuning is the use of
an automatic optimizing compiler. Such systems have largely replaced human
beings for many tuning steps for single-core microprocessors (such as
instruction selection and register allocation). More recently, research
compilers such as Pluto have shown significant success in organizing the sharing
of work within multi-core processors. Programmers using these systems are spared
the work of tuning, but lose the ability to explore approaches that were not
foreseen or chosen by the designer of the compiler. The AlphaZ system puts the
mathematical foundation of the Pluto compiler (the "polyhedral framework") under
control of the programmer, allowing manual tuning without needless effort or
error. Like Pluto, AlphaZ can tune software for single- or multi-core systems.
Pluto and AlphaZ are each the subject of ongoing research to support distributed
computing by automatically transforming programs to distribute work across a
cluster of computers with the MPI library. However, neither research project
allows the programmer to explore novel ways to organize the motion of data among
the constituent computers of a cluster. This RUI project is exploring extensions
to the AlphaZ system to allow programmer-directed data transfer with MPI
focusing both on the high-level design of these extensions and on anticipating
implementation challenges. The envisioned extensions to AlphaZ will facilitate
exploration, by both compiler writers and programmers, of strategies for moving
data in a distributed computing environment. Furthermore, these extensions will
validate a program tuning strategy that could be applied to other new
architectures such as graphics processors.
