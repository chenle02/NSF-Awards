Alexey I. Ovchinnikov proposes to develop efficient algorithms
that&lt;br/&gt;determine the differential, difference, and algebraic structure
of&lt;br/&gt;solutions of difference equations using methods of
differential,&lt;br/&gt;difference, and computer algebra. The investigator has
successfully&lt;br/&gt;contributed to the development of computational
differential ideal &lt;br/&gt;theory and the Galois theory of linear
differential equations. He will&lt;br/&gt;apply these results and methods to
give efficient algorithms that compute&lt;br/&gt;properties of systems of
difference equations. These properties are&lt;br/&gt;reflected in characteristic
sets and Galois groups of the equations. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, the
investigator will develop algorithms to reduce systems&lt;br/&gt;of non-linear
difference equations to simpler systems. These algorithms&lt;br/&gt;test
consistency of the input system and eliminate variables from
the&lt;br/&gt;equations of the system. He will also give a Galois theory of
linear&lt;br/&gt;difference equations with difference parameters to study
difference&lt;br/&gt;algebraic dependences among solutions of difference
equations.
