0243896 Schwartz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a five-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Colorado Boulder
for fifteen students each summer for research opportunities in the area of
functional materials. The principal objective of this program will be to
encourage promising students, particularly those from population groups
underrepresented in research fields in engineering and those from primarily
undergraduate institutions, to pursue graduate studies in preparation for a
career in engineering research. The program will include (1) a student poster
competition to encourage students to present their research at subsequent
technical meetings; (2) a provision to pay travel expenses related to making
presentations; (3) a recruiting strategy to improve student diversity that
involves a partnership with CU-Boulder's Multicultural Engineering Program; (4)
a seminar program that focuses on preparing students to do research; (5) a
meaningful program of social and cultural activities designed to complement
research activities; and (6) a program evaluation and follow-up survey to gauge
the program's effectiveness. Students will conduct research targeted at the
synthesis and characterization of novel materials with specified properties. The
materials of interest will be aligned with the expertise of participating
faculty and will include nanomaterials, biomaterials, catalysts, polymers, gels,
ceramics, thin films, and membranes. &lt;br/&gt;
