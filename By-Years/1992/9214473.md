This award provides support for a research conference in differential
equations. It combines the activities of two conference series which were held
for many years in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the country. They
provide an opportunity for exchanges among the many investigators of the regions
who are otherwise not funded. In addition, funds are directed primarily for
subsistence and travel for graduate students and young researchers. A smaller
fraction is directed toward expenses of principal speakers, some of whom must
travel considerable distances. There is appreciable support provided by the
University of Kentucky and the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications.
Combining these funds with those of the Foundation, it is expected that a
conference attracting over 175 participants with100-120 scheduled talks will be
possible. In all, this amounts to an excellent investment of public funds.
