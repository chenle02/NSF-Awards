This award supports an isotopic study of the Dufek layered ultramafic intrusion.
The objectives of the research are a better understanding of igneous processes
in large mafic magma chambers, an accurate determination of the age of the Dufek
intrusion, and an assessment of the origin of sulfide and chromite
mineralization in the intrusion. The Dufek intrusion is part of the Karoo-Ferrar
tholeiitic province, one of the largest such provinces known on Earth. This
research will involve high precision mass spectrometric analysis of neodymium,
strontium, lead, and osmium isotopes from ultrapure fractions of minerals
separated from rock samples. These analyses will be used to trace compositional
changes of both the liquid and cumulus (solid) phases during crystallization and
crystal segregation processes. Lead and osmium isotopes will be used to tracers
to ascertain whether sulfide mineralization resulted from increased silica
activity associated with crustal contamination or whether sulfide mineralization
was caused only by changes of temperature and oxygen fugacity. This research
will help to elucidate processes of magma differentiation and mineralization
associated with large ultramafic intrusions in general. Such intrusions are
important sources of platinum group elements.
