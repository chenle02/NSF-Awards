Developing reliable software systems is a key challenge for
our&lt;br/&gt;society. Despite many years of effort, software systems still
suffer&lt;br/&gt;from catastrophic failures. All too often, software failures
are&lt;br/&gt;caused by the propagation of errors through critical components of
the&lt;br/&gt;system. Unfortunately, current software development tools
and&lt;br/&gt;practices actually encourage the introduction of
unnecessary&lt;br/&gt;dependencies that serve to propagate errors between
conceptually&lt;br/&gt;unrelated components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this research is to explore a new approach for creating&lt;br/&gt;software
systems that are robust against failures. The approach&lt;br/&gt;exposes the
high-level structure of a software system to the compiler&lt;br/&gt;and run-time
environment to enable the automatic application of techniques
that&lt;br/&gt;appropriately manage error propagation to make software systems
more&lt;br/&gt;resilient. The foundation of this approach is a
specification&lt;br/&gt;language that allows the developer to identify tasks and
describe when&lt;br/&gt;tasks should be invoked and how each task changes the
conceptual&lt;br/&gt;states of objects. A set of techniques use this information
to&lt;br/&gt;monitor and analyze task execution to eliminate
unnecessary&lt;br/&gt;dependencies. The broader impact of this research is the
potential to&lt;br/&gt;mitigate the effects of software faults.
