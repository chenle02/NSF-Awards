The focus of this research proposal is to develop tool support to provide the
ability for scientific programmers to inquire about scalability problems and
correlate this information back to source code. Furthermore, we believe that
tools should be able to suggest and evaluate optimizing transformations to
alleviate these problems. This would constitute a significant improvement over
current performance analysis practice.

The key intellectual merit is in providing an automatic framework for detecting
scalability problems and correlating them back to source code. We will
experiment with our framework on the ASCI codes, which is intended to stress
high-performance clusters.

The broader impact of this work is in three main areas. First, both PIs are
working to create an interdisciplinary educational and research program. Second,
students will be educated in high-performance computing. Finally, the proposed
work allows for technology transfer to a wide arena of emerging fields, such as
cluster computing as well as the established areas of SMPs and massively
parallel computing. The developed framework and tools will be made generally
available to the research community and high-performance computing labs.
