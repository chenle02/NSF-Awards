This project is concerned with research in commutative algebra and invariant
theory. The principal investigator intends to find the equations of nilpotent
orbits for classical groups and examine Green's conjecture for general canonical
curves. In the area of binary forms, he plans to apply his techniques to attack
Dixmier's conjecture on systems of parameters for rings of invariants of binary
forms. This project involves research on the interface of commutative algebra
and algebraic geometry. Given a curve, a commutative algebra can be associated
with it. Information derived from studying the commutative algebra supplies
information about the curve. This is a rapidly developing area which impacts
many areas of mathematics.
