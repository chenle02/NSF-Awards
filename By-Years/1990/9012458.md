In 1986, the National Research Council (NCR) established the Computer Science
and Technology Board in recognition of the importance of computer science as an
academic discipline and an intellectual domain, and of the increasingly critical
role played by information technology in virtually all facets of life. The
Board's charter is a broad one: to ensure that the U.S. makes every effort to
develop and use the major new national resource represented in computer science
and technology. The computer's contributions to innovation and economic growth,
to national security, to the quality of life, and to scientific progress are
pervasive and affect the programs of a number of federal agencies, as well as
domestic industries. Until now, however, no organization has been suitably
positioned to address or influence the overall condition of this important
field. The Computer Science and Technology Board is intended to be a central
asset for identifying the implications of new technologies, assessing current
and proposed policies that affect computer science and technology, and
anticipating challenges to the strength of the U.S. computer science posture.
Over the next 24 months, the Computer Science and Technology Board will assess
how best to organize the conduct of research and teaching in the computer field,
in light of emerging and anticipated conditions. The study will be performed by
a committee drawn from a variety of subdisciplines, with representation and
input from administrators who control key resource pools, and will build on past
studies as relevant.//
