This research will attempt to synthesize chalcogenide cluster or condensed
cluster compounds of early transition metals in which carbon, nitrogen or boron
atoms act as interstitials. The properties and chemistry of metal-metal bonded
clusters with rich extended solid state compounds will be related. The cluster
size and electron count will be varied and the clusters condensed to form
extended metal-metal bonded networks. Because of their discrete nature the PI
should be able to probe in a fundamental way the relationships between crystal
structure, electronic structure and magnetic properties. This experience should
find wider application in the study of magnetic interactions occurring in rare-
earth intermetallics. This is of particular significance in view of the
importance of such materials in permanent magnets.
