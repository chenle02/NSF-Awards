With the increasing outsourcing of integrated circuit fabrication, hardware
Intellectual Property protection has become a critical issue for the
semiconductor industry. This project develops efficient logic encryption
techniques and tools to protect circuits from piracy. Logic encryption is a
technique that modifies a circuit with added extra inputs such that only users
with the correct key can get the correct results. The fact that an attacker has
the access to a working chip and the structure of the circuit makes the problem
very challenging. The project will develop efficient algorithms and programs for
logic encryption that are provably secure using mathematical and cryptographic
foundations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To protect a circuit, logic encryption needs
to insert errors when the key is incorrect, and also needs to prevent the
attacker from gathering information from the circuit structure. The former is
called locking, and the latter is called obfuscation. The project separates
these two tasks and develops solutions for both of them. It also investigates
the contention between the number of errors and hardness of key discovery.
Trade-offs among the locking, obfuscation, and key lengths are thoroughly
investigated. For obfuscation, universal circuit based solutions will be
developed, and efficient designs with small key lengths need to be discovered.
In order to apply the techniques in the integrated circuit design flow, design
automation algorithms and tools need to be developed and
tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual property protection has become a key
enabler for the survival of the semiconductor industry. The techniques and tools
developed in the project can help the industry to reduce and even prevent
hardware piracy. Industrial test cases will be used in the evaluation of the
project. The project will also provide training and educational opportunities
for next-generation hardware designers, to help them understand and improve the
security of their designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The logic encryption algorithms,
programs, and testing data, and their analyses will be collected as the data set
for the project. This data set, with explanation notes and README, and the
publications generated from the project will be maintained in a permanent
repositories at Northwestern website and on the GitHub. The URL is:
