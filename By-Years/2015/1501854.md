Western Maryland, along with the neighboring portions of West Virginia and
Pennsylvania, are rural communities with strong ties to Appalachia. Many of the
youths in this area lack the confidence to envision paths for themselves outside
of lower-skill jobs with which they are familiar. In addition, many are aware of
the negative stereotypes associated with rural and/or Appalachian communities in
which they live, and research has shown that awareness of stereotypes such as
these impact students' ability to envision themselves on a particular path in
addition to impacting their performance. The western Maryland region served by
Hagerstown Community College (HCC) has a strong tradition of manufacturing
excellence that has been threatened by the shift from "old world" to "new world"
manufacturing jobs, with "new world" jobs requiring more technical skills, as
well as the ability to perform root cause analysis. In order to address these
needs, HCC is developing a new advanced manufacturing technology degree program,
an industrial technology certificate program, and a basic electronics
certificate program. These programs include new courses regarding circuits,
schematics, and test equipment; lean manufacturing; and principles of quality
assurance and teamwork, as well as revised curriculum to address high-technology
manufacturing topics.

HCC is also offering educational events for local schools and regional partners.
HCC's project includes increased opportunities for women and underrepresented
minorities through an emphasis on girls in College for Kids classes and a goal
to enroll 33% women/minority students. In addition, Summer Institute activities
will target early college students, and HCC has set a goal that 50% of these
students are to be first-generation college students and 25% will be low-income.
HCC is served by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the project also fits
with the Appalachian region's goal to end its distinction as one of the most
impoverished and least-educated areas of the nation.
