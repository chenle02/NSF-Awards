The University of Wyoming Mathematics Department will be host to a Summer School
entitled "Summer School on Computational Number Theory and Applications to
Cryptography". This workshop will follow the successful style of the summer
schools of the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium that has been running
successful summer conferences for twenty-four years. The conference is scheduled
to last 19 days, from Monday June 19, 2005 to Friday July 7, 2006. Lectures will
only take place during weekdays. Weekends and Friday afternoons are planned to
be free for social activities. Each day of the meeting will begin with two
plenary lectures by the main lecturers. It is planned to have two main lecturers
per week. Each afternoon will also include 1-2 hours of talks of invited
lecturers and presentations from the participants. In addition to the lectures,
the conference will consist of student projects, group discussions, question and
answer times, problem sessions and workshop periods. The objective of the summer
school is to educate graduate students and faculty about the most recent
developments in computational number theory and mathematical cryptography. The
summer school will provide participants a cutting-edge survey of computational
number theory and the consequences in modern day cryptography. Topics to be
covered include: Primality and Integer Factorization, Arithmetic of Algebraic
Number Fields and Algebraic Function Fields, the Discrete Logarithm Problem and
related algorithms, Public Key Cryptography, Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve
Cryptography, Pairings, and Multivariate Cryptography. Plenary lecturers include
Eric Bach, Dan Bernstein, Renate Scheidler, Joseph H. Silverman, and Hugh C.
Williams.

The impact of the program and further goals are to enhance the general
population's understanding of the important role that mathematics plays in their
lives through information security in practice, and to help middle school and
high school teachers develop lessons for their classrooms. This will help
students begin to understand and enjoy some of the basic mathematical and
computational issues that arise in cryptography. The summer school will be a
ideal for graduate students and junior faculty who intend to participate in
future thematic programs such as the one at IPAM in Fall 2006 or at the Fields
Institute in Fall 2006.
