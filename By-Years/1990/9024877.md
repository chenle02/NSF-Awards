This is a renewal of grant IRI-9045939. This project aims at the development of
neural network architectures to explain how behaving individuals adapt
successfully in real-time to constraints imposed by changing environments. These
architectures are capable of automatically adjusting in such a way that high
level goals and plans continue to be realized despite changing circumstances.
Projects include an analysis of how representations of 3-D space are
autonomously learned in real-time. It will address how such spatial
representations can be used in a larger system capable of learning to perform
skilled arm movement sequences, such as handwriting and visually-guided object
manipulation. The project will examine how planned action sequences can be
performed with a tool of variable length and mass, such as a pen or hook,
without any further learning. It will also study how a working memory can
accomplish variable- rate, real-time short term memory storage of temporal order
codes, such as codes for rapid speech, typewriting, and eye movement sequences.
This project will examine how a self- organizing hierarchy of temporal planning
networks can compress the control of complex action sequences. This will lead
into how a neural network architecture can learn to control approach toward a
valued goal. Finally, the research will address how complementary designs for
sensory-cognitive learning systems and cognitive-motor learning systems can be
combined into a neural architecture that achieves the benefits of each type of
design, without their individual limitations. All of the projects will test the
biological relevance of their neural architectures by computer simulations
involving large behavioral and neural data bases. They will also provide
mathematical and computational analyses of these architectures to characterize
circuit designs for adaptive, intelligent machines with new real-time processing
capabilities. This project will provide basic insights into various levels of
modeling of a user during human-computer interactions.
