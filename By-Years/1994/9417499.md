9417499 Hillig The Principal Investigator wanted to build a special furnace to
test out the conceived concept of the Reactive Vapor Infiltration Process.
Molybdnum Silicide materials are to be used as the matrix materials and to be
reinforced by fibers such as silicide as high temperature composite materials.
Molybdnum Silicide is to be made from activities. A rapid heating high
temperature furnace which can have controlled gaseous or vacuum environments and
a working temperature of 1800oC, is needed for the Reactive vapor Infiltration
Process. %%% The proposed work consisted of building a rapid heating furnace,
capable of reaching 1800oC and maintaining controlled gaseous or vacuum
environments. It will be used to test out the concept of reactive Vapor
Infiltration Process can be very significant in many important industrial
developments. ***
