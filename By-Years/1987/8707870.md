This research will investigate a novel robot hand which utilizes rubber fingers
which bend to grasp an object when their internal pressure is elevated. The
bending of the fingers is accomplished by employing non-uniform wall thickness
in the fingers, and the bending mechanism is controlled by a single variable
(the internal pressure). Using rubber actuators (fingers) drastically reduces
the number of control variables of the artificial fingers without restricting
its maneuverability. The novel robot hand should be capable of gripping objects
of various shapes and sizes, applying various grasping modes, modifying the
compliance of the grip, and performing limited object manipulations. The
research will investigate a design to enable the base angle of each finger to be
controlled independently which should significantly enhance the object
manipulation capabilities of the hand. The incorporation of tactile sensing to
control the contact forces and gripping compliance will also be investigated.
