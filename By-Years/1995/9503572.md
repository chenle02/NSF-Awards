9503572 Swager This research program will address the synthesis and
characterization of achiral ferroelectric liquid crystals, with an emphasis on
the electrical characterization (dielectric, triangular wave polarization and
piezoelectric measurements) of materials which form hexagonal columnar phases.
In addition, new research themes centered around the use of self-assembled
monolayers to align the liquid crystals and create polar films will be
initiated. %%% Scientific interest in liquid crystal research is receiving
considerable emphasis. The inherent scientific interest in new, highly optimized
liquid crystal systems is high because of their uses in flat panel displays,
light shutters, optical signs, and even (possibly) optical computers. ***
