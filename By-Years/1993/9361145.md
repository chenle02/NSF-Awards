9361145 Worthington In response to customer demand for accurate temperature
measurement of Si and GaAs, Thermionics propose; to use a new temperature sensor
to measure the temperature Si and GaAs wafers above 800 C and as high as 1100 C.
The technique uses a system called (DRS) Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy. The
principal behind DRS is that it measures the changing band gap energy as a
function of temperature. The sensor uses a light source located out of the
growth camber that is modulated so that it can be detected in the presence of
other light sources, such as the heater source. Preliminary measurements of Ga
using DRS show smooth variation of the optical wavelengths associated with the
absorption threshold between 4K and 1000K. The laws of Physics and
thermodynamics suggest that band gap measurements can be made above these
temperatures. In Phase I, Thermionics expects to develop techniques and
improvements to the DRS sensor technology to measure temperature above 1100 C.
