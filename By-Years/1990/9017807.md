Marine snow is ubiquitous and abundant in coastal waters, sinks faster than its
constituent particles, and is similar in composition to the flocculent layer of
the benthos. An initial study suggests that meiofauna and competent larvae of
benthic macrofauna, when in the water column, are associated with marine snow.
This project will build on the initial study by testing the following
hypotheses: 1) The association between benthic meiofauna/larvae and marine snow
is dependent on the pelagic abundance, composition and developmental stage of
meiofauna/larvae, the time of day, and height of the bottom. 2) Benthic
meiofauna/larvae actively enter marine snow upon contact. 3) Meiofauna/larvae
affect the formation and breakdown of marine snow. This research will contribute
to our understanding of the biology and adaptive value of the planktonic
existence of benthic organisms, processes affecting sinking and deposition of
these organisms, and benthic-pelagic exchange.
