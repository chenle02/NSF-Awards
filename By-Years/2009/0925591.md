Intellectual merit: The goal of the proposed research is to develop a nonlinear
nanoprobe for nano-femto scale spatiotemporal characterization of ultrafast
optical near fields. The proposed nanoprobe consists of a nonlinear nanoparticle
attached to a nanowire, which is in turn attached to a silica fiber taper. The
nonlinearity of the nanoparticle enables temporal characterization through
autocorrelation or frequency resolved optical gating measurements while the
nanoscale spatial resolution is achieved through near field scanning of the
nonlinear nanoparticle. We will develop two-photon fluorescent and second
harmonic nanoprobes, develop and optimize nanoprobe based spatiotemporal
characterization technique, and investigate the precision of the proposed
nanoprobe based method. With the unique capabilities of the proposed nonlinear
nanoprobes, we also plan to investigate their applications to probing several
interesting ultrafast optical near fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact:
The proposed nanoprobe can significantly advance the state of the art of nano
&amp; ultrafast technology, which can in turn create far-reaching impacts in
many scientific disciplines in which they play a central role. With its unique
capability in providing nano-femto scale spatiotemporal mappings, the proposed
nonlinear nanoprobe can find many important applications. Fundamental questions
with regard to light-matter interaction in the ultrafast regime, ultrafast
dynamics of complex nanostructures, and nonlinear optics in nanoscale plasmonic
structures, can all benefit from the development of the proposed nanoprobe. As a
result, the proposed research can have considerable impact on areas such as
nonlinear optical microscopy and nanophotonics. The proposed research is highly
interdisciplinary and can also provide excellent education opportunities for
students.
