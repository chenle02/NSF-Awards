HRD 0317722&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CREST Center for Photonic Materials
Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norfolk State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Carl E. Bonner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norfolk State University (NSU) will continue
to build the research competitiveness of the physical sciences faculty and
national recognition in the area of photonic materials through the CREST Center
for Photonic Materials Research (CPMR). This renewal award will strengthen
competitive activity in the areas of photonics, spintronics, and nanotechnology.
Research efforts will focus on integrated micro- and nano-structured materials
with organic/inorganic and dielectric/metal phases, and their unique nonlinear
optical, photovoltaic, and spin-related properties. These efforts build upon
NSU's established research strengths in the design, synthesis, processing, and
characterization of inorganic and organic optical and magnetic
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research subprojects include: (1) study and
engineering of basic physical and spectroscopic properties of random lasers and
nano-composite photonic materials; (2) novel nano-structured organic materials
for opto-electronics; and (3) study of electron-nuclear spin dynamics in high-
spin systems for new spintronic and photonic applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational goals of the Center are to increase the number
of underrepresented minority students trained in the field of photonics and
nanotechnology and to prepare them for positions of leadership in emerging areas
of science and technology. NSU will build upon the strengths of the existing MS
Program in Materials Science to develop a MS program in Optical Engineering and
Electronics Engineering and to initiate a Ph.D. Program in Materials Science and
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
