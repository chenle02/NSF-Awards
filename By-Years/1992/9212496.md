This study is part of a joint NSF/EPRI Program on Advanced Polymeric Materials.
The tribological properties of novel fluorinated ultra-thin films will be
investigated. The films are composed of molecules which are designed to
spontaneously absorb to solid surfaces, self-assemble, and anchor as monolayers.
The polymer architectures combine amphilic structures which self- organic as
monomers, produce highly ordered polymeric Langmuir- Blodgett films, and
incorporate mobility and assembly via flexible linkages. Thin film chemistry
will use a flexible, low surface energy siloxane backbone, which has been
derivatized with self-assembling, terminally functionalized, long hydrocarbon
alkyl chains for surface chemisorption, as well as mobile perfluoroalky side
chains for enhanced friction properties.
