Scientific and engineering disciplines ranging from structural biology to
computer vision rely on data collection and analysis to guide scientific
discovery. Critically, in such applications, the systems under study constrain
and govern the structure of information in collected data. The goal of this
research project is to develop a family of statistical models that enables a
systematic extraction of relevant statistical information from these datasets by
bringing together interdisciplinary concepts from statistics and optimization.
The approach under development aims to provide a new set of statistical tools
that is adapted to this class of problems and that could have a transformative
impact on several scientific disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
articulated around a core set of techniques to analyze datasets in the context
of a latent algebraic structure, often arising from the physical laws underlying
the data collection processes. Unlike more traditional statistical problems
where a linear underlying structure is often built into the model, data-driven
science generates problems with algebraic but often non-linear structure. The
project focuses on problems of central importance in a variety of scientific and
engineering disciplines, including signal processing, structural biology, and
computer vision, that share a similar feature: the need to leverage algebraic
structure in order to extract information from data. The project aims at
developing a systematic approach to analyze this family of problems, together
with a general procedure to construct computationally efficient algorithms using
low-rank tensor decomposition. Importantly, these methods can be proved to be
statistically optimal and therefore make the most efficient use of collected
data.
