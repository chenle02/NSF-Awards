PROPOSAL NO.: 0823755&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of
Delaware&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY ? PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS, NUCLEAR
ASTROPHYSICS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Todor S
Stanev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: International School for Cosmic Ray
Astrophysics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
requests support for United States participants in the 16th course of the
International School of Cosmic Ray Astrophysics (ISCRA) which will take place on
5th-12th July 2008 in Erice, Sicily, Italy. ISCRA is a biannual event that
attracts a large number of young scientists and has proven to be the most
respected summer school for high energy astrophysics. The title of this year?s
school is ?Gamma Ray and Cosmic Ray Astrophysics: From below GeV to beyond EeV
Energies.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Broader Impacts, the School will address
the field of very high energy cosmic ray phenomena and is aimed at advanced
graduate students and young postdoctoral associates. The Proceedings of the
school will be published so that many others can take advantage of the
lectures.&lt;br/&gt;
