To bridge the gap between the background and level of college undergraduates
taking introductory level sociology courses and the rapid advancement of
empirically-based sociology, we will develop a series of curricular materials,
including demonstrations and laboratory exercises for introductory level
undergraduate level courses. We will design a computer based, data analysis,
report generation, and graphical presentation engine, that will serve as the
base for our initiative. We will use it to develop a series of interactive
curriculum modules which will convey the findings of recent empirical social
research, through demonstrations, guided exercises and other experiences. We
will rigorously evaluate the materials, in terms of their ease of adoption by
faculty, their stimulation of interest by students, and their effectiveness in
conveying the findings of empirical research to introductory level students.
