A mathematical model will be developed for obtaining statistical data on
combined loads of snow and other forces on structures. A Poisson square wave
random process will use ground snow load water equivalent records from across
the contiguous United States. Within the load process the dependencies that will
be considered are: occurrence dependence or clustering; dependence between
intensity and duration; and dependence between load intensities. The results
from this work will be useful to structural engineers building structures in
cold regions and for the development of pertinent design codes and standards.
