A conference, "Invariants in Low Dimensional Geometry," will be held on August
10-14, 2015, at Gazi University in Ankara, Turkey. Geometric structures on
3-manifolds have been a central focus of topology since the seminal work of
Thurston in the 1970s. Significant advances, such as Perelman's proof of
Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture and the recent proof of the Virtual
Fibering Conjecture, have generated enormous interest in geometric topology.
Separately, a new research area called quantum topology was ushered in by
discoveries in the 1980s of many new quantum topological invariants. The major
aims of this conference, like the major research aims of geometric and quantum
topology, are to advance our understanding of how geometric structures on
surfaces and 3-manifolds, and the geometric, topological and quantum invariants
are related to each other. Conference speakers from institutions from the United
States, Turkey and other countries will describe the leading current
developments and trends in the active mathematical fields surrounding geometric
and quantum topology. Another important goal is to provide graduate students and
young researchers with a coherent view of this wide-ranging and active research
area. The week before the conference will be dedicated to introductory seminars
and workshops for graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s and researchers who are new
to this area.

Research on various topics in geometric topology, geometry of surfaces and
quantum topology has proceeded at a remarkable pace, in a multitude of
directions, and using diverse methods of study and application. This conference
will gather a group of the world's leading researchers in these fields, many of
whom have pioneered these approaches. Topics will include: Quantum hyperbolic
geometry, triangulations and angle structures on 3-manifolds, geometry of
surfaces and mapping class groups, character varieties and arithmetic
invariants, colored Jones polynomials and quantum invariants of 3-manifolds.
Many important open problems in these fields relate these different points of
view, and require techniques from distinct research areas. This conference will
focus on new developments that highlight connections between these fields, and
help create new avenues for collaboration.
