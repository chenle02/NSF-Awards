This research is concerned with developing computationally very efficient
methods for solving inverse problems for elliptic and mixed type differential
equations, in particular the equations of compressible fluid flow around an
unknown body. The unknown body is to be recovered from specific pressure
distribution along the unknown body. An appropriate formulation of the problem
reduces it to solving a single nonlinear boundary value problem. For generating
supercritical airfoils the scheme uses an iterative method based on the solution
of the elliptic and the hyperbolic problems in their respective domains.
