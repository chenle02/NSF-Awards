MQW SLMs utilizing heterostructure acoustic charge transport (HACT), enhanced
birefringence, and Bragg diffraction based SLMs. The emphasis will be on their
relative suitability to the industrial production environment. In the case of
HACT SLMs, the project involves the merger of HACT technology, developed at
United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) for micorelectronics signal
processing applications, with the novel MQW SLM designs conceived at the
University of Connecticut. The demonstration of technical feasibility will be
followed by the production of proposed devices by industries in Connecticut.
