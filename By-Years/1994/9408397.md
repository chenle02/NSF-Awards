9408397 Werner In this project the investigators are studying the consequnces of
phenotypic plasticity to ecological performance of larval anurans. They will
identify the the factors that trigger the phenotypic change that occurs in the
presence of predators and measure the dose response to inducing cues. They will
determine the mechanisms by which the morphological and behavioral shifts
influence competitive ability and defense against predators. They will also
study how interactions with predators, leading to phenotypic shifts, can
influence the competitive interactions between species at the same trophic
level. This research will yield new insights into the relationship between
phenotypic plasticity, ecological performance, and ecological community
structure. This relationship is of great potential importance but has received
very little study. These studies should result in the development of mechanistic
models that predict the interactions between organisms and the optimal
combinations of phenotypic traits in different environments. The results should
have applications in conservation biology, management of biodiversity, and
natural resource management.
