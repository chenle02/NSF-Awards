This project is an extension and expansion of a current CSEMS project scheduled
to end in the summer of 2004, and expands the scholarships to two programs in
Engineering while continuing to support students in Computer Science, Computer
Technology, and Mathematics. It provides twenty-five scholarships per year at
Norfolk State University and ten awards to students in their final year at
Tidewater Community College, with an understanding that they will receive
continued support at the University if they successfully transfer. The major
goal of the project is to make awards available to needy and academically strong
students, giving them opportunities to be admitted to graduate schools or placed
in jobs related to the disciplines as unencumbered as possible. The project also
encourages full-time academic study among community college students,
encouraging them to transfer into the corresponding University
programs.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project encourages more student
concentration on academics, higher acceptances to graduate schools, and better
placements into appropriate professions, especially among African-American
students. Students are encouraged to do research with faculty advisors and
present their work publicly at School and departmental events.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: This project has significant academic and job placement successes among
African-Americans and women. It gets their commitments to study full-time and
set up professional relationships, and gives them pride and self-esteem as
scholarship recipients.
