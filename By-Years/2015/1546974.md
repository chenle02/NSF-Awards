This award provided funding for the conference Analytic and Probabilistic
Techniques in Modern Convex Geometry, to be held at the University of Missouri
from November 7-9, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent
developments in Analysis, especially the fields of random matrices, probability,
and convex analysis. The confirmed participant list includes a number of leading
researchers in the fields covered by this conference. The organizing committee
will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through
mailing lists and advertisements in media maintained by professional
organizations. More information will be available at
