"Graduate Research Assistantships for the Study of Dynamics of Atmospheres and
Oceans" This award provides support for Graduate Research Assistantships in the
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program at Princeton University. The
Program is the academic component of a collaboration between the Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) of NOAA and the Geological and Geophysical
Sciences Department at Princeton University. GFDL scientists serve as advisors
and adjunct faculty for students in the AOS Program. Research covers a broad
range of topics aimed at improving our understanding of motion in atmospheres
and oceans on all geophysical scales. In addition, under this award, support
will be provided for a student from the Applied and Computational Mathematics
Program to investigate some of the mathematical aspects of geophysical fluid
dynamics. The program, which has been in existence since 1968, is well known for
its excellence and the high quality of independent research carried out by the
students. Its graduates are among the best researchers in the country today. For
NSF, this award represents an investment in the future.
