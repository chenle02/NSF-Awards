The St. Louis region is experiencing a boom in agriculture related industries.
However, students in the St. Charles Community College service area do not have
access to higher education programs in agricultural studies, which forces them
to either travel long distances or abandon their academic and career goals. This
project will be a critical step in addressing the urgent need for agriculture
skills education programs locally, to meet the demand for a qualified, prepared
agriculture workforce in the regions of St. Charles and St. Louis Counties. If
students receive a high-quality education and make strong connections with local
industry professionals, it is expected that these students will choose to remain
in the local area to fill positions as highly skilled technicians in the robust
agriculture industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project implements two newly
designed programs, an Associate of Science Degree in Plant Science and an
Associate of Science Degree in Natural Resources. In addition, the project aims
to recruit and retain students to complete the degree programs, provide pre-
professional activities to enhance the academic and career experiences for
project participants, and work collaboratively with high school and
baccalaureate institution partners. St. Charles Community College is committed
to creating programs in agriculture to address the shortage of technicians in
the local workforce and prepare students to be successful at the university
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
