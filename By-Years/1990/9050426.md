The project is concerned with computer design tools (CAD/CAE/CASE) to support
the total integration of "systems engineering" techniques into the electrical
and computer engineering undergraduate curriculum beginning at the sophomore
level. It is an innovative approach that directly addresses the need to improve
the effectiveness of teaching design skills. The new tools provided a thread
through eight undergraduate courses to link hardware and software, to connect
classroom theory with laboratory experiences, and to emphasize the modeling
aspect of design. The courses affected extend from the sophomore through the
senior years. The equipment selected will provide high technology tools, both
hardware and software, that use the state- of-the-art modelling techniques. The
use of these tools will enable students to create through simulation and
emulation, relevant and accurate models of real-world problems. With the use of
these educational tools we will be able to train effective and productive
engineers to cope with the quality and time-to- market issues that are major
concerns in U.S. industry today.
