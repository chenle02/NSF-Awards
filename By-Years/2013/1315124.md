This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a novel
surgical closure system for closing internal incisions in endoscopy. The initial
application is closing the vaginal cuff in laparoscopic hysterectomy. Sutures
are typically used to close internal incisions in laparoscopic surgery. Throwing
loops and tying knots are among the most difficult parts of laparoscopic
procedures; these difficulties have slowed the adoption of minimally-invasive
procedures, including laparoscopic hysterectomy. The system is a series of
surgical clips that are designed to enable easy closure for difficult-to-access
tissue, improving ease of use, speed, and quality of incision closure. The clips
do not pierce tissue, but apply continuous compression to close the incision.
The applicator tool pulls tissue into apposition for clip application, while
reducing tissue handling, necrosis, ischemia, and the risk of infection.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project is to develop, validate, and market the device across a broad spectrum
of surgeries involving internal incisions (a total of 10 million procedures
annually in the U.S. alone). This device has particular value in the rapidly-
growing minimally-invasive surgery market, in which internal closure is made
difficult by the small size of superficial incisions. These markets represent
more than 6 million surgeries per year in the U.S., creating a domestic market
potential of more than $2.5 billion for the device platform of closure devices.
The closure device is designed to be simple and intuitive to use, which is
critical in laparoscopic procedures. Initially, the closure device directly
addresses a specific unmet clinical need: reducing both the technical demands of
vaginal cuff closure during laparoscopic hysterectomy and the significant
complications associated with the use of sutures in this procedure. There are
approximately 300,000 laparoscopic hysterectomies performed in the U.S.
annually. This number is growing at an estimated rate of 20% per year, and will
represent a total annual addressable domestic market size at peak sales of $200
MM ($600 MM globally) for laparoscopic hysterectomy alone.
