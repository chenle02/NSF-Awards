Although building codes and practices in the United States and Japan have been
developed to the point where they provide a large measure of protection of life
safety, the recent 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquake have demonstrated
that near-field ground motions present severe challenges even to structures
designed according to current codes. While the response spectrum provides the
basis for the specification of design ground motions in all current design
guidelines and code provisions, there is a growing recognition that the response
spectrum alone does not provide an adequate characterization of near-fault
ground motions. This indicates the importance of developing an improved
representation of near-fault ground motions using time domain parameters such as
the amplitude, period and number of cycles of the near fault pulse, and its
energy characteristics, in addition to the response spectrum, for use in
analysis and design of structures. The objectives of this project is to develop
methods for characterizing near-fault ground motion for use in engineering
design and evaluation. The project will be done in collaboration with Professor
Iwata of Kyoto University, and colleagues from several other Japanese research
organizations, with whom the Principal Investigators have a long term
collaborative relationship.
