9714154 Fritsch The U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP) is an interagency
activity designed to perform and implement the research necessary to improve the
delivery of weather services to the nation. Under this Program, the National
Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Office of Naval Research
are jointly evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP. It
is well documented that the utility of raw observations and numerical model
output can be greatly enhanced by statistical post-processing. Recent advances
in numerical modeling and the installation of new observing systems have created
an opportunity and a need to redesign existing post-processing techniques and to
develop new techniques. The Principal Investigator will design, construct, and
test new statistical post-processing procedures that will capitalize on the
emerging ensemble technology and will minimize the effects of changes in
operational numerical models on statistical post-processing procedures. He will
also construct an advanced observations-based statistical forecasting system for
providing reliable probabilistic short-term guidance on high-impact weather. The
observations- based system will capitalize on high-frequency observing platforms
such as WSR-88D Doppler radars and satellite information. A primary tool of the
proposed work will be the application of general additive models that allow for
certain non- linearities in statistical regression relationships. It is expected
that the resulting techniques will yield significant lead time advances in
forecasts of sensible weather parameters and provide much-needed probabilistic
guidance for short-term decision making during high-impact weather events. ***
