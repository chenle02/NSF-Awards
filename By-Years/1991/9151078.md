The objective of this proposal is to strengthen the laboratory component of
upper division courses in Vertebrate Physiology and Mammalogy. A computer-
interfaced metabolic system, the Eco-0xymax, allows the evaluation of V02, C02
and respiratory quotient as critical metabolic factors for studying the
principles and adaptive mechanisms of metabolism in small mammals at the
individual, population, and comparative levels. Animals collected from
northwestern Wisconsin are studied to monitor their seasonal metabolic
adjustments throughout the year. The local environment, with its dramatic
seasonal changes, serve as an "outdoor facility" that complements the laboratory
aspects of the total exercise. Students become directly involved with the use of
computers and the role they play in the reduction, analysis, storage and
retrieval of data.
