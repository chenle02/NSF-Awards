This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of electroanalytical chemistry. Professor deLevie will study the
fundamental aspects of film formation on electrode surfaces using a variety of
electrochemical methods. This research will use interfacial capacitance as the
major tool for the study of the formation and growth of monolayer salt films.
The long term impact of this research will be in the elucidation of metal-
oxidation and passivation phenomena. These are extremely important processes in
the field of metal corrosion.
