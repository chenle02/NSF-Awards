The research proposed here comprises an integrated study of metamorphic and
associated felsic plutonic rocks in the multiply deformed and polymetamorphosed
southwestern New England terrane. The goal of this project is to use this
classic Appalachian terrane to characterize the petrologic and thermal processes
resulting from the tectonic overthickening that accompanied the Taconian
(Ordovician) collisional event described in tectonic models of western New
England. The study will also provide a detailed picture of Acadian (Devonian)
thermal evolution in the eastern portion of the southwestern New England
highlands. Most important, our efforts will also be concentrated on examining
the exact nature of the overprinting of later on earlier metamorphisms in the
zone of overlap between the Taconian and Acadian events. The techniques we
intend to use include: quantitative geothermobarmometry based on mineral
chemical analyses by electron microprobe, to determine fluid-rock inter- action
histories and to help constrain uplift histories; argon isotopic analysis of key
minerals to deduce temperature-time evolution of key areas. Because our emphasis
in applying our results is in determining the evolution of an orogenic belt, the
study is focussed on three geographic areas: southwestern Connecticut and
adjacent southeastern New York where we can document predominantly Taconian
metamorphic effects; the central and eastern belt of the western highlands where
the polymetamoprhic overlap is best displayed.
