The isotopic composition of seawater boron (11B/10B) is highly enriched (~40
per mil) relative to fresh mantle derived rocks. Initial work indicates that
this enrichment is primarily the result of large isotopic fractionations
associated with the alteration of the oceanic crust. In addition, the boron
isotopic composition of the altered crust is dominated by seawater boron that
appears to be distinct from the mantle and may be composed of compositionally
distinct domains. As a result, it appears that boron isotopes have a great
potential for elucidating a number of geochemical and geophysical problems
associated with the alteration of the oceanic crust. These include the role of
subducted volatiles in island-arc and ocean island volcanism, the evolution of
hydrothermal fluids and secular changes in seawater/crust exchange. This study
of seawater/oceanic crust boron isotope exchange has the following specific
goals: 1) to determine the distribution of boron and boron isotopes within the
altered crust, 2) to quantify the net flux and isotopic composition of boron
extracted from seawater into the oceanic crust and 3) to develop the essential
background data that are required for the future exploitation of boron isotopes
as a diagnostic tool in the study of hydrothermal systems.
