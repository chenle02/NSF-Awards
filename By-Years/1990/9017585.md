Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and quantum field theory
will focus on predicting the higher -order effects of the weak interaction, and
on the question of why quarks and gluons are always confined within larger
particles. New experimental facilities at the European Laboratory for Particle
Physics (CERN), the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, have made possible incisive tests of our theory of
the weak interaction which center on the higher - order effects predicted by
this theory. These tests are a major thrust of current efforts in particle
physics. The question of why quarks and gluons are confined is a long - standing
one which is difficult to answer because it concerns phenomena in which the
strong nuclear force cannot be treated as a small perturbation. Progress on the
answer to this question is important if we are to fully comprehend the strong
force.
