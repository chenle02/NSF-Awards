9725096 Hughes This grant continues U.S. partial support of the International
Seismological Centre (ISC) based in England. The proportion of the ISC budget
provided by this grant is approximately 20 percent. The role of the ISC is to
collect some two million readings each year from over two thousand seismic
stations and locate about sixty thousand events. The data are published bi-
monthly in the Bulletin of the ISC and the semi-annual Regional Catalogue of
Earthquakes approximately two years after the occurrence of the events. A
thirty-year database has thus been developed. The data are also made available
on CD-ROM, diskette and magnetic tape. The data published by the ISC are
arguably the most complete earthquake catalog source in the world. The data are
used extensively in research on the structure of the earth, calculation of
seismic hazard throughout the world, and as a source of information for the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty monitoring organizations. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
