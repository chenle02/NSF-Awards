This project involves purchase of eight scanning tunneling microscopes and two
atomic force microscopes to establish an advanced microscopy laboratory for
surface characterization. The laboratory is interdisciplinary in nature,
utilized by two colleges (Science and Engineering) and seven departments
(Chemistry, Physics, and Biological Sciences, as well as Materials, Chemical,
Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering). These microscopes can be included in
present lower- and upper-division undergraduate laboratory courses, as well as
graduate courses, and are an integral part of newly developed interdisciplinary
courses and curricula.
