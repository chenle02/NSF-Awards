Little is presently known about the conditions under which dissolved organic
carbon (DOC) is produced or destroyed in modern oceans or about the role of DOC
in the structure and dynamics of aquatic marine microbial ecosystems. The
objective in this research is to develop a mass spectrometric method for
shipboard determination of carbon-isotopic compositions of DOC and shorebased
determination of carbon-isotopic compositions of DOC and shorebased
determination of carbon-isotopic compositions of organisms constituting the
marine microbial food web. Availability of such techniques should facilitate
large-scale studies of the origin and recycling of DOC. DOC is the largest
organic carbon reservoir in seawater and, accordingly, is particularly important
in the global carbon cycle. Techniques for study include light stable mass
spectrometry for carbon isotopes, high-temperature catalytic combustion
techniques for the determination of the abundance of DOC, flow cytometry for the
separation of individual cell types and experimental growth of mixed bacterial
populations.
