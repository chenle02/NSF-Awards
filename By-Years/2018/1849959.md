The Emory Research Experiences for Undergraduates is an intense research
activity for undergraduate students. The project provides research experiences
for undergraduates interested in arithmetic geometry, combinatorics, and number
theory. Organized by the principal investigator with assistance from rotating
colleagues, the program plans to train approximately 10 undergraduates annually
in the summers of 2019, 2020, and 2021. The participants will be chosen after a
nationwide search. Recruitment will target participants from underrepresented
groups as well as participants from institutions that do not offer similar STEM
research activities for undergraduates. The REU program will enable
undergraduate students to enjoy an enhanced learning experience, including
research projects and seminars. The overall goal of the Emory REU program is to
attract talented undergraduate students to careers in the mathematical sciences,
which in turn helps promote progress in science and national security by
addressing critical issues in the preparation of the next generation of
researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research topics will be accessible to
students but will go beyond traditional mathematics coursework, involving
cutting-edge studies related to analytic number theory, elliptic curves, Galois
representations, modular forms, partitions, and quantum modular forms. These
fields have applications to internet security, modeling in physics, and other
physical sciences. In addition to pursuing original research, participants will
be mentored in various aspects of the mathematics profession. Sessions on grant
proposal preparation, graduate school preparation, and careers in industry will
be held to help prepare the participants for the "real world" of the
mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
