This proposal is for an Engineering Initiation Award that outlines an
investigation into the use of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedure
for determining the directions of signals impinging on an array of sensors in a
dispersive medium. The particular application of interest deals with the
tracking of a radar target in the low-angle regime when a diffuse multipath
component is present. The use of the ML estimator is targeted in light of its
ability to contend with a small number of array date snapshots and because of
recent algorithmic developments that significantly reduce the associated
computational burden. The goal of this work is to define and develop an ML-based
estimation procedure suitable for continuous sources as well as for point
sources. Present ML-based methods assume the sources of emission to be point-
like in nature and are only strictly applicable in a specular multipath
environment. If successful, the resulting ML algorithm will be generalized for
use in more complex diffuse signal source scenarios such as those encountered in
tomography, radio astronomy, and sonar.
