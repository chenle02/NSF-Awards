Portland State University of the Oregon State System of Higher Education, is
ideally suited to conduct a field and laboratory project in the Lake Owyhee
volcanics in eastern Oregon. Students will conduct geologic mapping and topic-
specific research on volcanic, volcaniclastic, clastic, and hydrothermally
altered rocks. The studies will focus on relations among volcanism,
sedimentation in fault-controlled basins, and hydrothermal activity in a Miocene
continental rift environment. Students will participate for 10 weeks during the
summer. The first six and one-half weeks will be spent on the field portion, the
next two on laboratory studies, and the final weeks will be spent in writing and
revising reports already partially prepared in the field. The reports will
summarize the research topic, field data, and will discuss the findings in light
of available literature. Follow up activities will focus on revision of the
student reports in preparation for presentation of the findings in a seminar in
the student's home department and as a paper/poster at a scientific meeting.
Students with particularly interesting findings will be encouraged to prepare
jointly authored papers for publication.
