Mathematical Biology Through Computer-aided Instruction This project involves a
new course in Mathematical Biology that is designed to teach students to think
mathematically and be able to solve problems within the context of the
biological sciences. A key point in realizing this goal is that mathematical
understanding and problem solving ability are different from the skills of
mathematical computation. Mathematical Biology also teaches students to
formulate the description of quantitative problems in terms of mathematical
operations. Accordingly, an interactive program is being implemented by use of
the computer program Mathematica running on a network of workstation computers.
The course emphasizes four important themes. During laboratory sessions data are
simulated on the computer and flow into a computer aided analysis system.
Experiments, the laboratory notebook, the calculator and worksheets, and final
reports are integrated into one system. Mathematical Biology is taught as a
sophomore course, and is expected to build on biological principles learned in
general biology and prepare students for the use of mathematics in upper
division biology courses.
