The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twelve month research fellowship within a duration of
36 months by Dr. Cynthia Robin to work with Brian Woodye, Director of Research,
Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Belize Department of Archaeology in Belmopan,
Belize.

During this fellowship, the Pis will undertake a program of archaeological
excavations and artifact analysis which will examine the 1800 year history, rise
and demise of the ancient Maya farming village of Chan in Belize. Maya
archaeological research traditionally looks at the higher end of society. This
study will focus on the lower strata, the farmers. Robin will explore and test
two models, the traditional primitive peasant model and the small holding farmer
model. This project will provide new insights into the roles and relations of
the inhabitants of a pre-Columbian farming village. This will help us refine our
models of the organization of complex societies.

In addition to the importance of this research, the project will involve
training of young Belizean and U.S. archaeologists, introducing them to an
international research experience.
