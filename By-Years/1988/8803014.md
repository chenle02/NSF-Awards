The Biotechnology Process Engineering Center (BPEC) at M.I.T. has been renewed
for a period of five years. This Center was one of the six Centers established
by NSF in 1985. The vision and the strategic plan of BPEC is to develop advanced
concepts for the manufacturing of complex proteins and to train a new breed of
professionals with cross-disciplinary skills needed to support the U.S.
biotechnological industry. Three thrust areas for research have been established
to meet the critical future needs of the manufacturers of biotechnological
products. These are: (1) Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemical Principles
in Protein Production, (2) Engineering Principles of Protein Production, and (3)
Downstream Processing in Biotechnology. A strong industrial collaboration
program with 46 companies has been established. Five departments at M.I.T. and
one department in the Harvard University will participate in research and
teaching. Educational programs are directed towards undergraduate, graduate,
post-doctoral and industrial personnel. Two new undergraduate and three new
graduate courses with cross- disciplinary focus will be offered by BPEC.
