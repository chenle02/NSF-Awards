University of Florida (UF) is seeking to join the existing multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled the "Center
for Advanced Forestry Systems" (CAFS) which was established in 2007, and now
includes the following institutions: North Carolina State University (lead
university), Oregon State University, Purdue University, Virginia Tech,
University of Maine, University of Washington, and the University of Georgia.

UF's expertise, resources and proposed projects will complement and expand upon
those represented by current CAFS institutions. UF will build upon and expand
the CAFS efforts by providing additional and specialized expertise in the areas
of genetics, physiology, silviculture, soils, and modeling. The proposed
projects from UF will augment and complement current CAFS projects in the broad
areas of production ecology and scaling important genotypic and phenotypic
growth traits from the molecular to the whole plant and stand level.
Collectively, UF will contribute to the overall goals and needs of the US
forestry sector by providing scientific and technological advances to enhance
their competitiveness.

The effort at UF has the potential to improve the competitiveness of the forest
products industry and forest landowners through advances in technology
development, through dissemination of research results in scientific, peer
reviewed journals, and enhanced technology transfer between Center scientists,
industry members and the US citizenry. UF plans to recruit graduate students
from under-represented groups, and enhance the interaction between research and
teaching activities. UF is also committed to the principle of diversity in the
projects and the various activities under this program.
