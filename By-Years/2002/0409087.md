This Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Minority Post-Doctoral Research
Fellowship supports research and training on the neural mechanisms of hearing.
The research is under the sponsorship and mentoring of Dr. Ann Eddins of the
University of Buffalo, SUNY. Auditory learning is a dynamic process that can be
profoundly influenced by learning and experience. Recent evidence indicates that
this adaptability arises from the brain's capacity to adaptively modify its
cortical representations of sensory stimuli; however the mechanisms underlying
this process, especially as it pertains to complex features of sound, are poorly
understood. The present proposal is aimed at using non-invasive measures of
neural activity to investigate how learning involving complex spectrotemporal
features of sound affects the neural representation of those features, and how
those changes influence perceptual sensitivities. Two specific experiments are
proposed, in which perceptual and neural sensitivities to complex features of
sound will be measured before and after training in both humans (Exp. 1) and
rats (Exp.2). Auditory evoked potentials will be used to evaluate neural
sensitivities, thus providing a non-invasive electrophysiological technique that
can be used in both species. To the extent possible, psychophysical measures and
training will also be made comparable for both species. The comparative approach
proposed here can facilitate the identification of basic neural mechanisms
underlying perceptual and plasticity processes in the mammalian brain. The
training activities proposed for this fellowship will enhance the applicant's
technical skills by expanding her repertoire of electrophysiological techniques
to include non-invasive methods, and by providing training on experiments
involving humans as participants. This Fellowship will also train an
underrepresented minority scientist in behavioral science.
