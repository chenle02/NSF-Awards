This is an award to support research on the characterization and removal from
water of organic pollutants that are recalcitrant to being removed by
conventional water treatment processes used to treat water destined for human
consumption. Research being conducted in this project involves the chemical
characterization of organic matter not removed by coagulation, sedimentation and
filtration with and without the use of ozone and determination of the best
physical/chemical process-system for removal of the residual organic matter
including possible intermediate treatment with ozone, advanced oxidation, ion
exchange and adsorption processes. Research being initiated by this Presidential
Young Investigator addresses a problem associated with the processes of treating
polluted surface and groundwaters to make them acceptable for human consumption.
Conventional physical and chemical treatment processes may not remove organic
substances that may be converted into harmful substances by chemical
disinfection. Results of this research are likely to be utilized in engineering
design of systems to produce water of more acceptable quality than is now
possible.
