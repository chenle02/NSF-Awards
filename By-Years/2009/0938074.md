Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be useful, a digital library must
provide its patrons with easy access to materials that are relevant to their
needs. Tools are being developed under this award to help users retrieve data
that is pertinent to interest of the specific user. To accomplish this end, the
project is developing a Community Navigation Service (CNS) based on data
collected by an Interest Profile Manger (IPM) while continuing to personalize
resource presentation by way of the IPM to preserve privacy. The project's
innovative feature is that it uses an IPM combined with the collaborative
filtering and content analysis provided by a CNS to infer the value of a
resource to the user.&lt;br/&gt;
