This award provides support to the Department of Sociology at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln to continue their Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE.
The program is designed to give undergraduate sociology and social science
majors attending academic institutions in the Northern Great Plains region a
ten- week research experience in sociology. The primary objective of this
program is to provide a high-quality research environment for students who have
limited access to research facilities and training at the schools they are
attending and for students who are under-represented in science careers (women,
minorities, and the disabled). Using the research facilities of the Bureau of
Sociological Research and under the close guidance of faculty supervisors,
students will initiate and carry out research projects from formulating a
problem to writing a final report. Students will participate in morning seminars
where they will learn research methods and share their ongoing research with
each other. Afternoons will be spent engaging in individual projects and
learning to use appropriate research technologies. The students' papers will be
presented at the Nebraska Undergraduate Sociology Symposium held each fall and
submitted for presentation at the Midwest Sociological Society meeting.
