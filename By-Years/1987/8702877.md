Narrative: The project involves designing and building a machine that will
simulate human "soft" mechanical sensing tissues (such as the tongue or fingers
which normally come in contact with food) by cushioning machine parts. This
device would perform textural evaluations of foods and using a computer, the
results could be correlated to determine optimum rheological food
characteristics for future food fabrication technology. In the past such
machines have consisted of hard parts and the PI's novel concept is to redesign
these machines to better reflect real sensing tissues.
