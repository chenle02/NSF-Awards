This research project is concerned with the development of symbolic methods to
be used in the simulation of large-scale nonlinear circuits. Over the past two
decades, although symbolic network analysis has been addressed, its use has been
limited because the analysis has been applied to linear, small-size networks. To
utilize the advantages of symbolic analysis in the environment of large-scale
circuit simulation, some radically new approaches must be taken. The goal of
this research project is to investigate such new approaches that are useful for
the simulation of large-scale circuits. With the new approach taken in this
effort and using the known decomposition methods for large-scale circuits,
symbolic techniques can be applied to large-scale circuits to enhance
computational efficiency.
