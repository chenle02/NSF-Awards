Technological advances over the past few years have produced some remarkable
changes in laboratory instrumentation. It is essential that undergraduate
science students develop a thorough understanding of both the theoretical and
practical aspects of modern computer- controlled/computer-interfaced
instrumentation. One of the most powerful instrumental methods for separating
and identifying the components of a complicated mixture is Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Students of chemistry, biology and
other sciences are being educated in the theory, operation, practices and
capabilities of this powerful technique. GC/MS is being introduced into
analytical and organic chemistry during the sophomore year. Six upper-level
courses are being improved to give the student ample opportunity to gain
proficiency in the technique. The infrastructure of science is being
strengthened when young scientists no longer have to remove, in graduate schools
and in industrial laboratories, deficiencies accumulated as undergraduates
because of the lack of the state-of-the-art instructional scientific equipment.
