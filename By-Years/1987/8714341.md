The subject of this conference, Arrangements of Hyperplanes, draws on a number
of difficult topics in algebra and geometry. Professor Orlik of the University
of Wisconsin-Madison will serve as principal lecturer, delivering a series of
ten lectures, and several eminent researchers in the field will be invited
participants. The lectures will include an historical survey, and discourses on
combinatorial, algebraic, and topological methods in the theory of arrangements,
properties of arrangements associated with reflection groups, the K(pi,1)
problem, and other current research in the area. There will also be several
informal problem sessions.
