9526873 Nabelek This research is to use the stacking of globe-circling surface
waves from very large earthquakes to eliminate the effects of varying velocity
structure along the path and isolate the source time history of the earthquake.
This technique is most effective in the surface-wave periods of 140 to 550
seconds. These low- frequency estimates can be combined with high-frequency
estimates from body wave modeling to produce a broadband description of the
earthquake source. The technique will be applied to very large earthquakes
recorded digitially since 1977, and a select number of earlier events of special
interest including the 1989 Macquarie Ridge earthquake which has been difficult
to understand as yet. Special emphasis will be on the search for long-period
precursory fault slip prior to the earthquake onset. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
