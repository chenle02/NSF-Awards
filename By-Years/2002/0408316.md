Social Cognitive Neuroscience (SCN) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that
integrates the theories and methods of social psychology and cognitive
neuroscience. As such, it represents a new means for social psychologists to
build and test theories of the psychological and neural mechanisms that underpin
phenomena of long standing interest to the field, including person perception,
motivation, self perception, and self regulation. Although interest in SCN is
growing rapidly, there have been few forums for social psychologists to learn
about the proper and effective use of neuroscience techniques to answer social
psychological questions, and to participate in discussion about the promise of
this field with individuals who already have gained SCN expertise. To address
this concern, a SCN preconference has been organized to serve both as a forum
for current researchers to discuss central issues, and as a platform for new
researchers to learn about effective ways in which SCN research can be
conducted. To meet these goals, presentations will 1) examine the proper
interpretation of functional imaging and neuropsychological data, 2) present
current research that illustrates the proper use of neuroscience methods, and 3)
consider the current and future promise of SCN. This preconference will precede
the January 2004 meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology,
the field's largest meeting, which will enable interested researchers from all
areas of social psychology and all careers stages to attend. This grant provides
support for initial an inaugural SCN preconference, which may help establish
support for a self-sustaining preconference in the future.
