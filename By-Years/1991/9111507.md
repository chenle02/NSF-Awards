During software development, programmers employ a range of different program
representations, including pseudocode, data flow diagrams, finite-state
automata, control flow charts, and many others. Programmers may also create
their own custom representations or languages to express their particular
approach to a problem. Conventional development environments force programmers
to translate these different paradigms into a single textual representation that
the computer can understand, and to translate between this representation and
their conceptualizations during coding, debugging, and maintenance.
Multiparadigm development environments offer the opportunity for programmers to
work directly with their conceptualizations, to work with a program using
whatever representation is most natural; such environments eliminate the need to
perform mental translations between programmer concepts and executable code. The
proposed research is to test the validity of multiparadigm programming by
designing experiments to answer the following kinds of questions: Does it make
programs easier to design or code? Does it make programs or designs easier to
understand? Does it simplify the process of enhancing existing programs to
increase their functionality or their performance? Does it make it easier for
programmers to track down and eliminate bugs? Do software developers prefer it?
