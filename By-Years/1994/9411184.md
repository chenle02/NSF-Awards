Understanding the mechanism of the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol on
platinum electrodes is important to the development of improved methanol
oxidation catalysts for use in fuel cells. In this research project, supported
by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, submonolayer amounts of
ruthenium deposited on a platinum electrode have been found to significantly
enhance the rate of electrocatalytic methanol oxidation. A combination of ultra
high vacuum electron spectroscopic methods and radio-labelling techniques will
be used to investigate the role of the structure of these ruthenium deposits in
the methanol oxidation catalysis. A basic understanding of the mechanism of this
important catalytic system is likely to result from this work. The correlation
between the structure of submonolayer ruthenium deposits on platinum electrodes,
and their activity for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol will be
explored in this research project. Structures and compositions of these
submonolayer deposits will be obtained by electron spectroscopic and
radiochemical methods. A more detailed understanding of this technologically
important catalytic reaction should ensue.
