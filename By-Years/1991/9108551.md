Standard models of auctions need enrichment in order to be applied in realistic
contexts. Many common but neglected factors invalidate the advice that current
auction theory offers to bid- takers and to bidders. This research will augment
bidding theory in several realistic directions and isolate sources of divergence
between theoretical predictions and laboratory observations. One thrust of the
research replaces the usual assumption of a fixed number of bidders with
endogeneous determination of bidder participation based upon the probability of
competing. We indicate when the usual revenue comparisons are confirmed and when
they are reversed. Another thrust will include several realistic models of
cheating and rule bending in auction models. One model allows bidders to submit
multiple bids and withdraw a `winning' bid when it is advantageous to do so. A
third thrust will examine various formats for the sequential or simultaneous
sale of multiple assets examining how auction form may influence bidders'
strategies and the values of the assets. A fourth thrust examines information
flows between bidders during the course of an English auction and how those
flows affect strategies and the values of the assets. A fifth thrust reconsiders
the standard assumption of symmetric bidders to see which comparative static
predictions are robust to asymmetries.
