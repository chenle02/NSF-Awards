The Keystone Initiative for Network Based Education and Research (KINBER), a
statewide nonprofit organization, is implementing a program of coordinated
leadership and mentoring activities that improve the ability of Pennsylvania
colleges and universities to understand and utilize their network infrastructure
to support cyberinfrastructure-based scientific applications and research on
their campuses. These leadership activities focus on the understanding,
deployment, integration and support of campus cyberinfrastructure technologies,
such as perfSONAR, campus science DMZ, end-to-end performance monitoring and
campus cybersecurity. This program establishes a collaborative
cyberinfrastructure community in Pennsylvania through the use of facilitated
workshops, campus visits, regional monitoring, follow-up visits and technical
assistance including deploying perfSONAR equipment. The program's expanded
deployment of perfSONAR platforms within the state provides a rich set of
performance measurement and diagnostic tools to campus IT staff and
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gained through this program
enables campuses within Pennsylvania to support a broad set of
cyberinfrastructure-based applications, including those that rely on the
seamless integration of computing, storage and network resources, including the
ability to support large data transfers. The program provides benefits over the
longer term as additional Pennsylvania colleges and universities deploy science
DMZs and expand their campus infrastructure capabilities, utilizing the
program's online knowledge base for solving and identifying common
cyberinfrastructure problems.
