This award supports research on several problems of finite p-groups, pro-p-
groups, and infinite dimensional Lie algebras. All these problems are related to
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras satisfying a polynomial identity and to Lie
algebras with Engel's condition. This research is concerned with a mathematical
object called a Lie algebra. Lie algebras arise from another object called a Lie
group. An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a sphere where one rotation
is followed by another. Lie groups and Lie algebras are important in areas
involving analysis of spherical motion.
