This project establishes a regional coalition of two-year colleges for the
purpose of faculty enhancement in physics and physical science teaching.Twenty
teachers from two-year colleges in this region are studying computational
physics, classroom methods, and communication during a one-week workshop at
Henderson State University. The materials used in the workshop were developed by
the project director with partial support from the National Science Foundation.
These materials have been the subject of two textbooks published by major
publishing companies.Following the initial workshop, participants complete
individual investigations in computational physics and report the results of
these activities during a two-day follow-up session. Participants gain both
useful teaching methods and an opportunity to remain intellectually vigorous
within their discipline.
