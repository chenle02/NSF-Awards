It has been shown that large topographic features can have a significant effect
on atmospheric processes and hence the prediction of weather. The Principal
Investigators will perform theoretical/numerical studies of atmospheric flows
past three-dimensional topographical features. Previous work will be extended by
allowing non-uniformity in the upstream stratification and airflow. The research
should lead to indications of critical atmospheric factors responsible for
various flow features around mountains including flow-splitting, formation of
shearlines and generation of lee vortices.
