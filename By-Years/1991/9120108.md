The aim of this research is to explore the mechanisms of strengthening in
single-crystal nitride superlattices. The shape, amplitude, direction, and
lattice mismatch of the composition modulation are variables. Superlattices are
grown by sputter deposition and characterized using X-ray diffraction,
transmission electron microscopy, and Auger spectroscopy. Nanoindentation is
used to measure hardness, and models are developed for hardening based on
dislocation motion through the layered structures. %%% The understanding gained
from this research could be used for controlling process variables to tailor
mechanical properties in thin films.
