This award provides travel funds for five U.S. members of the Krafla Magma
Drilling&lt;br/&gt;Project (KMDP) to attend the project?s second workshop. The
meeting is scheduled for&lt;br/&gt;17 and 18 September this year at Landsvirkjun
Power Co.?s (LV) facilities at
Burfell,&lt;br/&gt;Iceland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KMDP is a project of the
International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP)&lt;br/&gt;that
seeks to probe, with coring, borehole measurements, and coupled
surface&lt;br/&gt;observations, the rhyolite magma body under Krafla Caldera.
Magma was unexpectedly&lt;br/&gt;encountered by the Iceland Deep Drilling
Program (IDDP) through their record-breaking&lt;br/&gt;well IDDP-1. IDDP moved
on in search of supercritical fluids, their primary goal. KMDP&lt;br/&gt;arose
as a new project with a largely new team to target the magma itself. ICDP funded
a&lt;br/&gt;first KMDP workshop of some 50 scientists and engineers from 8
countries in September&lt;br/&gt;2014 to discuss using IDDP-1 as a ?hole of
opportunity? through which coring could take&lt;br/&gt;place. Subsequently, it
was determined that the hole of opportunity needed to be a new well drilled by
LV. ICDP provisionally accepted the KMDP proposal, setting aside $1million for
coring operations, with the caveat that a satisfactory proposal addendum
detailing aspects of the coring and science be submitted by 28 September this
year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus there has arisen a need for a second, smaller,
tightly focused workshop concentrating on operational planning. LV has
generously offered to provide food, lodging, and meeting facilities for the
group. There will be about 30 participants from up to eight countries. All
participants will be supported by their respective institutions or national
science agencies. There will also be participation by USGS and DOE (National
Laboratory) scientists.
