9622309 Farson This research equipment grant supports the purchase of high speed
video equipment for research and teaching in manufacturing processes and
materials. The system has a laser strobe capable of 20-40 nanosecond pulses, and
a charge-coupled device camera capable of digitizing from five thousand full
frames to thirty thousand partial frames per second. The team of researchers
will use this system for several new and ongoing research projects like:
laser/material interaction, die-casting mold filling, plasma arc dynamics,
ultrasonic weld modeling, composite material damage characterization, and
ultrasonic joining. The performance of this research equipment will provide
quantitative data on high speed events, permitting advances in modeling and
simulation. To support the education programs at Ohio State University, this
equipment will provide unique instructional materials that clearly illustrate
process mechanisms.
