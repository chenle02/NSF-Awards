A major objective of the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference is to
bring together every two years leading members of the scientific community,
graduate students, and post docs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects
in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In 2009, the Chemical
Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 2-7, 2009 at the
Tilton School in New Hampshire. The theme for this year?s conference will be
?Process, dynamics and change in the Anthropocene ocean? and will emphasize the
pressing need to comprehend the response of the ocean to anthropogenic forcing
within the context of a mechanistic understanding of the underlying basic
processes and an historical perspective. Presentations and discussions at the
2009 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) Open
Ocean Carbon Cycling and Fluxes; (2) Ocean Acidification, Carbonates, and
Biogeochemical Responses; (3) Biomineralization and Ocean Process/State Proxies;
(4) Metals, Volatiles: Inputs, Outputs, and Interior Ocean Processing; (5)
Biogeochemical Mechanisms of Elemental Cycling in the Water Column; (6) Organic
Tracers of Biogeochemical and Oceanic Processes; (7) Physical
Structure/Dynamics-Biogeochemical Coupling; (8) Benthic Systems; and (9) Coastal
Ocean Biogeochemical Processing and Exchange. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon
Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange
ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new
scientific alliances. For this reason, the National Science Foundation, along
with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 17
graduate student/post docs and 33 invited speakers/discussion leaders in the
2009 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.
