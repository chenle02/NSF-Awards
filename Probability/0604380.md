This proposal is partly about large deviations in different contexts. In
studying the scaling limits of interacting particle limits, one usually proves
laws of large numbers. They arise in different contexts and have corresponding
large deviation results that are related. Random walks and diffusions in a
random environment are also expected, under suitable conditions, to satisfy law
of large numbers, central limit theorem and large deviations. The large
deviation theory has close connection to the theory of homogenization of random
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with vanishing viscosity. We expect to
continue with our investigation in these areas.

In complex interactive systems, noise often acts as a stabilizing force and
guides the system along a predictable deterministic path. Deviations from this
behavior are rare. One goal of this project is to quantify and measure how rare
a given deviation is and if such a deviation should occur what is most likely to
have caused it?
