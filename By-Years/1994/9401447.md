Professor Morrison will work on research on the border between theoretical
physics and algebraic geometry. He will use algebraic geometric techniques to
study conformal field theory. In particular he intends to further study the
recently discovered phenomenon of mirror symmetry. This is research in the field
of algebraic geometry, yet it directly connects to two of the great advances in
theoretical physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general relativity.
Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but
one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
