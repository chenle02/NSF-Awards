This project will provide a complete asymptotic analysis of the propagation of
wave packets with narrow spectra through finite slabs of periodic layered media
and periodic quantum graphs. The work will identify conditions under which small
group velocity is accompanied by near transparency. This analysis will be
complemented by a study of the effects due to compact and random perturbations
of the media; in particular, the transition from models with absolutely
continuous spectrum to complete localization will be investigated. Effective
statistical estimates will be given for physical characteristics of the pulses
in terms of the noise in the media.

The project will furnish the mathematical background for a fundamental problem
that has been very actively discussed in physical literature during the last
several years: construction of efficient optical devices for slowing down of
optical signals. These devices can find many applications, for example in
synchronizing the work of very fast optical elements with much slower
electronics.
