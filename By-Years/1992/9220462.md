9220462 THOMPSON This award supports the U.S. portion of a joint U.S. - New
Zealand seismic investigation of the sediment stratigraphy beneath the East
Antarctic Ice Sheet from the Transantarctic Mountains into the Wilkes Subglacial
Basin. The scientific objectives are: 1) to test, and provide constraints for,
uplift models of the Transantarctic Mountains by imaging the stratigraphic
structure of the west side of the Transantarctic Mountains, 2) to constrain
models of the origin of Ferrar magmas by determining the geographic extent of
this unit under the East Antarctic Ice Sheet so that models of magmatism,
involving mantle plume activity versus melting in response to regional rifting,
can be evaluated, and 3) to help resolve the debate about the climatic
conditions and size of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in the late Cenozoic by
determining if the Wilkes Basin contains marine sediments that could have been a
source of material for the Sirius Formation, a till containing Pliocene diatoms
which is located at many high altitude locations in the Transantarctic
Mountains. ***
