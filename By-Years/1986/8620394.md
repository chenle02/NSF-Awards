This proposal emphasizes research on the mechanisms of formation of amorphous
structure during mechanical alloying of crystalline intermetallic alloys. Three
nickel-base intermetallic alloys will be employed based on the nickel- aluminum
alloy system. A-15 structure compounds niobium-tin and niobium-germanium will be
mechanically alloyed, and their state of structural disorder followed through
superconducting property measurements. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron
microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry will be employed to follow the
structural changes in these materials. The concept of a critical defect density
needed to reach the amorphous structural state will be examined in the
experimental program
