The purpose of this project is to find a new class of solvents with similar
thermodynamic properties to those of fluids at their gas-liquid critical point.
The goal of the present effort is to confirm the theoretical predictions that
binary mixtures have enhanced selectivity for dissolving various compounds.
Supercritical extraction processes are receiving wide interest; however, the
number of liquids which have critical points at both low temperatures and
pressures is limited. It is intended to use Thin Layer Chromatographic plates
(TLC) as the stationary phase and to use various immiscible solvent mixtures
showing a CST point as a mobile phase. The difference in the rates of mobility
of various compounds, near and far away from the CST point, will be used as a
measure of solubility. It is especially intended to check if binary mixtures of
optically active compounds have enhanced selectivity near the CST for the
components of a racemic mixture.
