This conference will assist minority students in achieving excellence in the
computing field and related science and technology areas. There is very little
activity in the publishing of technical papers by high school students. American
University has recognized this deficiency and will be collaborating with the
Joint Educational Facility on a Computer Science Conference for high school
students. This conference is to be held May 30, 1992. Students will develop
projects, prepare papers, and conduct demonstrations to show the results of
their work.
