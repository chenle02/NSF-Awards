The primary objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in theoretical nuclear physics between Ivo Slaus of the Rudjer Boskovic
Institute and R.L. Walters, Duke University, Bernard Nefkens, UCLA, is to
continue collaboration on variety of pheneomena addressing nuclear interactions
and structure of atomic nuclei. The reseachers will study: (1) nuclear
interactions and three nucleon (atomic particles) force; (2) symmetries and
charge symmetry violation; (3) mechanism of nuclear processes; and (4) quark
degrees of freedom through studying dibaryon resonances. Past collaboration has
been quite successful. Most of the experimental work will be pursued in the U.S.
laboratories. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on
Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds
are involved. Grants are made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Dollar funds
are included for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav
scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
