This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants at three
mini-conferences in harmonic analysis and related areas that will take place in
Fall 2008, 2009, and 2010 at Auburn University. These mini-conferences represent
the continuation of a longstanding series of meetings (thirty-six at last
count), most of which have been held at Auburn.

At the Fall 2008 meeting, 40-50 participants from about thirty regional
universities as well as from other institutions are expected. The program will
feature three principal speakers, who will deliver one-hour lectures, and a
number of twenty-minute talks. Significant participation by graduate students
from both Auburn University and other institutions typifies this conference
series. The programs for the later meetings, still in the planning stages, will
have a similar structure.
