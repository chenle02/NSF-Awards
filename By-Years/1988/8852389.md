The aim of this project is to integrate in a significant way the design and
research component of engineering into the undergraduate education of students.
Without sacrificing any of the present programs which have served so well in the
past, it is desired to improve our students' practical experiences and
engineering insight by providing interaction with state-of-the-art design
methodology and tools. A design laboratory with facilities for computer-sided
design, simulation, prototype construction and testing of electronic systems is
being established. Students presently employ personal computers and
instrumentation for data acquisition, control, analysis, design and display in a
junior- level laboratory. Our senior-level design and research courses offer
some capability for computer-aided design and simulation, but nothing for
construction and testing of the resulting design. The new senior-level design
laboratory would provide facilities for student design teams to carry out a term
project from conception through construction and verification. The goal of this
laboratory is to provide an engineering environment in which seniors can fully
exercise their creative abilities and engineering background in the development
of a physical electronic system.
