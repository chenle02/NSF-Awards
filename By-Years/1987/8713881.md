This grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program supports
studies of the electronic structure of neutral and charged molecules. In
particular, negative ion clusters, the interaction of anions with inert gas
atoms, the trapping of electrons by clusters of polar molecules, the
interactions of small molecules with aluminum clusters, and the potential energy
surfaces of excited electronic states of ozone and of substituted ethylenes will
all be examined. These studies will elucidate the microscopic dynamics of many
chemical processes of current interest.
