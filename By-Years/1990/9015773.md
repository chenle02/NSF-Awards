The research objective of this project is to develop a body of knowledge in
methodology and analytical tools for estimating the synchronous machine
stability parameters from the standpoint of system identification. Furthermore,
the significance of the research is that synchronous machine manufacturers can
use the technique proposed here to independently validate their proprietary
design model during design and factory testing. Power system engineers at
utility companies can use the estimation procedure to identify the machine
parameters for stability studies, using the operating data. Furthermore, the
power system engineers can use the validated machine models to correctly predict
the developing stability problems of America's bulk power transmission systems.
Finally, power system control engineers can use the identified machine models to
accurately predict the dynamic performance of electronically controlled future
power systems.
