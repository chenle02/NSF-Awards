Shape-memory alloys and microfluidic bulks with surfactants are examples of so-
called novel materials, which are composites of multi-phase bulks connected by
single-molecule-thick interfacial layers. In epitaxial growth manufacturing
processes, material defects such as dislocations and grain boundaries are
interfacial layers, whose migration may lead to fatal plastic deformation. This
project will focus on the mathematical analysis of migration patterns of
interfacial layers and microfluidic flows in novel materials to understand their
mechanisms and predict their patterns. Providing accurate theoretical
predictions of their evolution will advance, for instance, the design of
microfluidic devices and lower manufacturing costs. The training of
undergraduate students and high school students will be integrated into this
interdisciplinary research project.

The first scientific goal of this project is to develop a novel decomposition
for bulk-interface interactive dynamics and use it to predict the pattern
formation of a multilayer transition profile. Using quantitative estimates based
on the global stability of partial differential equations with dynamic boundary
conditions and a reduced invariant manifold for the slow-motion persistence of
the multilayer pattern, the main intent is to show that the coupled bulk
dynamics does not destroy the slow-motion pattern of material defects at the
leading order. The second goal is to systematically generalize Onsagerâ€™s linear
response principle to obstacle problems for interactive dynamics with
topological changes. The investigator aims to derive a new phase field model for
geometric motions of microfluidic flows, which automatically builds in migration
mechanisms of interfacial layers whenever topological changes happen. This new
model, together with mathematical validations, will unveil the hidden
variational principle and a selection criterion. This variational principle will
incorporate solid-fluid, solid-solid interactive mechanisms, and coherent micro-
macro structures for general complex systems.
