9626819 Askin Abstract This award supports the design, development, testing and
implementation of a computer database for Antarctic geological collections, and
to rescue Antarctic geologic data and samples. There is an increasing sense of
urgency within the US Antarctic geologic community over the safe curation and
accessibility of rock and fossil collections and data acquired during research
in Antarctica. There is concern over the loss of samples obtained at great
expense, including samples which are likely to be valuable for new lines of
investigation. There is also concern over minimizing negative environmental
impacts of earth science research in Antarctica, and over the availability of
funding for proper curation of samples in the future. At present the lack of a
centralized curation facility for Antarctic samples greatly inhibits potential
use of existing samples for new projects. Unpublished information about samples
exists with individual investigators but there has been no attempt to organize
this for the betterment of the science. Development of a database is the logical
first step that must be taken toward more responsible management of Antarctic
rock and fossil materials. The Antarctic Geologic Database will be a user-
friendly system accessible to the geologic community on Macintosh and IBM-based
personal computers via the World-Wide-Web. It will allow easy search, retrieval
and loading of geologic information collected by US geologists in Antarctica.
The design will be based on the on-line archiving and cataloging system for the
Synthetic Aperture Radar images and data in the Remote Sensing Laboratory at
Byrd Polar Research Center, but will be specifically designed to handle
Antarctic and geologic requirements and information. It will incorporate the
best ideas of museum collections management systems and rock repository
databases currently used in the Orton Geological Museum at the Ohio State
University and elsewhere in the USA and ove rseas.
