This award to Professor Kubiak of the University of California, San Diego funded
by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division
of Chemistry focuses on ultrafast chemical reactions; those that occur in one-
trillionth of a second (1 picosecond) over large supramolecular structures.
These reactions involve the transfer of electrons over reasonably long
distances, from 1 to 4 nanometers. The project builds on (1) the observation
that exchanging electrons across hydrogen bonds can increase the strength of
typically weak interactions; and (2) the observation of mixed valence
nanoclusters. The latter are complex molecular structures composed of ruthenium
clusters which transfer charge through attached metallic and semiconducting
nanoparticles. The research will be extended to more complex systems in order to
elucidate how electrons and electron transfer rates respond to different types
of pathways through new supramolecular materials. Given the ability to easily
manipulate the chemical compositions of these complex systems synthetically,
Professor Kubiak and his team are able to custom design these assemblies for a
variety of applications. In order to explore these intricate structures, the
researchers first aim to stabilize the complexes by increasing the strength of
their weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) and to then analyze the
ultrafast electron transfer properties in these newly stabilized complexes via
spectroscopic methods designed for this purpose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research is relevant to both the scientific and engineering communities in their
quest to develop new generations of molecular electronic devices. The future of
such devices is dependent on the development of molecular complexes with two or
more stable states, which can be switched between these states with extremely
fast reaction times.
