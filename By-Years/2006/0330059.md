ABSTRACT 0330059 Sergio Servetto Cornell University

the most pressing need after a major urban disaster---earthquakes, fires,
(accidental or induced) infrastructure collapse---is for information needed to
deal with the situation. Such information includes, for example, the presence of
toxic chemicals, the location and condition of survivors trapped by debris, or
stress forces acting on an unstable damaged structure that may lead to further
collapse. A similar need takes place when the goal is to prevent such disasters:
in this case information needed includes, for example, time evolution of the
concentration per unit-area of pollutant/toxic agents, of the temperatures in a
forest, or of damage to the ozone layer.

In all the examples in which we envision the use of sensors to measure and then
act upon the state of some physical process, there are two well defined stages.
In an initial stage there is a distributed signal acquisition problem, in which
each sensor gets to observe a spatially localized function of the process. Each
one of these sensors will have autonomous computation, communication, and power
generation capabilities. In a second stage, after processing the raw sensor
measurements, some representation of all the data collected needs to be relayed
to a collection point, where this data is to be analyzed and acted upon. (These
actions could consist of, for example, direct rescue efforts to appropriate
places, evacuate unstable structures, direct fire fighters to appropriate forest
locations at the onset of a fire, etc.) These collection points can take the
form of fixed and mobile receivers placed outside of the sensor coverage (and
thus out of the way of potential harm). Collection points may be permanently
dedicated facilities, as with monitoring points for the critical infrastructure.
They may also be mobile, as with aircraft overflying the site of a disaster.
This research program focuses on the engineering and, primarily, on the
information-theoretic issues of the *sensor reachback* problem, i.e., the
problem of establishing reliable communication between the sensor array and the
collection point.
