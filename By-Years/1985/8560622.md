The production of oxygen by the distillation of air is an established commercial
industry. Because cryogenic distillation is very energy intensive, the product
cost is relatively high. Research is underway to develop a more effective
membrane with a selectivity an order of magnitude higher than any material
proven thus far. Preliminary calculations indicate a strong incentive for the
improved membrane.
