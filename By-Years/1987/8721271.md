This is a project to continue investigating the temporal Pb isotope variation in
the Tertiary plateau basalts and central volcanic complexes from Iceland, the
prototype of a ridge- centered hot spot. This study is aimed towards
interpreting the geological history of the Iceland plume, as well as the
relationship between hotspots, mantle heterogeneity and mantle geodynamics in
general. The study of temporal geochemical variations associated with plume
volcanism can constrain plume dynamics and interaction between the plume and the
surrounding mantle. The Pb isotope variation so far established for the Tertiary
plateau basalts requires 3-component mixing, and the relative contributions of
these three components are not random but change regularly and systematically
with time. The proposed research will focus on establishing how processes of
magma formation, migration and storage at shallow depths affect isotope
variations during a limited period of time in the geologic past.
