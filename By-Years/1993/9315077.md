9315077 Hawkridge This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Fred Hawkridge, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth
University, Richmond, VA, and Professor Isao Taniguchi, Department of Applied
Chemistry, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. The joint research involves
studies of the interfacial characteristics of electrode surfaces and the
properties of metalloproteins that control electron transfer reactions of
proteins in general at electrode surfaces. Although much has been established in
this field in many different research groups, work to be done in this project
would bring together electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and surface
characterization methods to probe these interfacial reactions. These
investigations should strengthen the investigators' efforts to elucidate
heterogeneous ET kinetics of proteins and enzymes at electrode surfaces.
Professor Taniguchi's expertise in spectroelectrochemistry will be invaluable to
the identification of the ligated species at the electrode surface and will
prove the underpinning to Professor Hawkridge's assessment of the effects of
ligand binding on the electrochemical properties of biomolecules. ***
