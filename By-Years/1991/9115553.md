This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in solid
mechanics between Xanthippi Markenscoff of the University of California in San
Diego and Helmut Kirchner of the Institute of Materials Science at the
University of Paris (South). The objective of their research is to develop a
mathematical model which addresses dislocation effects in fracture mechanics.
Dr. Markenscoff brings to this cooperation innovative approaches to problems
involving the dynamics of dislocations in structures and the elasticity of
structural materials. This is complemented by the French investigator's
extensive experience in dislocation theory and numerical approaches to
elasticity problems. The investigators are dealing with important issues in
mechanics which are often stumbling blocks to effective evaluation of
construction materials. Their joint effort will result in a unified theory and
mathematical model which will advance our understanding of the mechanical
behavior of structures and the effects of dislocation on fractured solids.
