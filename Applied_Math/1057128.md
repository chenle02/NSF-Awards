The investigator will develop and apply mathematical and computational methods
to predict compensatory, rescue perturbations that can mitigate the propagation
of failures in perturbed complex networks. The research is motivated by the
increasing availability of information about the component parts of large
biological and physical networks, which is creating an unprecedented opportunity
to address pressing problems determined by large-scale network dynamics. The
project will use nonlinear dynamics and complex network techniques and will be
implemented through five complementary components of broad significance: the
development of (1) deterministic and (2) stochastic methods to identify rescues;
the application of these methods to (3) mitigate extinction cascades in
perturbed food-web networks, (4) recover lost cellular function in defective
metabolic networks, and (5) control cascading failures in power-grid networks.
This research will lead to the identification of physically implementable
compensatory perturbations, thereby enabling control of the network's large-
scale dynamics. An overarching objective of the project is to integrate
underlying principles of this research into the development of teaching and
outreach innovations in three different frameworks: (i) summer internship
activities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups; (ii)
computer-based interactive tools for undergraduate and graduate complex systems
education; and (iii) on-line exhibits in partnership with Chicago's Museum of
Science and Industry, which will further integrate the research and educational
outcomes of this project.

The proposed mathematical development will create methods that can be used to
rescue and control complex networks in a wide range of domains. This will allow
the discovery and characterization of new phenomena that are likely to foster
breakthroughs in various contexts. In particular, it will enable new ecosystems
management approaches to halt the loss of biodiversity, yield new methods to
recover lost cellular function, with implications for medical research, and lead
to novel methods to mitigate cascading failures in electrical power grids. The
planned activities are interdisciplinary and will provide a unique training
ground for graduate and undergraduate students (including students from
underrepresented groups) in a way that traditional disciplinary research
programs cannot. The educational and outreach activities will help create
infrastructure for complex systems education at Northwestern and will
disseminate the research results and methodologies to a large and diverse
audience.
