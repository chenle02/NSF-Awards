We require funds to purchase state of the art Olympus AX70TRF research
microscope platform which supports superior optical elements, differential
interference contrast (Nomarski DIC) prisms and an epifluorescence system. In
addition we request an accompanying image analysis system consisting of two
cooled, charge - coupled device (CCD) cameras, computer, monitor and image
analysis software. This platform will allow optimization of image information
and interpretation which would greatly enhance the research capabilities of
BBSR. The purchase of this instrumentation would immediately benefit a variety
of research activities including studies of the microbial community's size, and
trophic structure of the Northwestern Sargasso Sea, investigations of inherent
optical properties in the Sargasso Sea, and studies of biodiversity
morphological and phylogenetic studies of invertebrates
