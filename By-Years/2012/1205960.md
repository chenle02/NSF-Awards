The physics program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva,
Switzerland is in full operation, now delivering proton-proton collisions at 8
TeV collision energy. The SUNY at Buffalo group is a member of the CMS
experiment which is currently in an intense data-taking phase for 2012, and
which will segue into an analysis and upgrade phase during the period 2014-1015.
While the Fermilab Tevatron has ceased operations, nevertheless significant data
remains to be analyzed from the experiments. The SUNY at Buffalo group continues
to play an important role in the analysis of data from the D0 experiment.

The proposed program concentrates on finding answers to fundamental questions
about the Electroweak symmetry breaking and on searches for physics beyond the
Standard Model (SM). One aspect of the research is to search directly for Higgs
particles at the CMS and D0 experiments, and to search for evidence of new heavy
vector bosons at CMS. Another aspect involves the study of SM processes such as
the associated production of vector bosons with bottom and charm quarks which
constitute backgrounds to Higgs boson searches in various decay channels. The
discovery of the Higgs boson or a new heavy vector boson would be a major
breakthrough in our understanding of fundamental properties of matter, while any
deviation from the SM prediction could manifest presence of New Physics.

The SUNY at Buffalo group is also making important technical contributions to
the CMS Experiment, particularly the operations and upgrade of the Forward Pixel
Detector project. The proposed research program building upon the group's
success and expertise in Forward Pixel Detector commissioning and operation, in
jet calibration techniques at hadron colliders, and in software and physics
analysis.

The broader impact of the proposal fosters collaboration between the SUNY
Buffalo group members and high school teachers and their students through the
group's QuarkNet Center and through Masterclasses. These open up possibilities
for non-traditional participants to come in close contact with fundamental
research at the energy frontier in science.
