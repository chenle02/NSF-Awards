The Oregon State University will study the feasibility of printing efficient,
easy-to-read tactile equations for blind people. They will use the normal
equation format with fonts redefined to something resembling Braille symbols.
The equations will be printed with a raised image printer and will be tested for
readability by blind scientists and engineers. The investigator will try to find
more efficient characters than the standard 2x3 Braille raised dot cell.
