In recent years evidence has been accumulating that many enzymes proceed through
radical mechanisms. Most reactions involve redox cofactors for which radical
intermediates are plausible based on model studies of cofactor chemistry. New
types of mechanisms have been proposed recently involving radicals on amino acid
side chains. Although there has been much compelling indirect evidence
consistent with H-atom abstraction from substrates by protein-derived radicals,
to date there has been no direct evidence. Galactose oxidase from the fungus
Dactylium dendroides catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols with O2,
producing aldehydes and H2O2. Based on recent EPR, resonance Raman, and X-ray
crystallographic structural information and on extensive preliminary studies
with mechanism-based inactivating substrate analogs, a new mechanism for
galactose oxidase catalysis is proposed featuring rate-determining H-atom
abstraction by a tyrosine radical from the alcohol CH2. The reaction mechanism
of galactose oxidase catalysis will be studied in the proposal research. The
resulting detailed reaction mechanism should become a paradigm for substrate
activation using protein-centered radicals for H- atom abstraction from
substrates. Such fundamental information will be useful in understanding more
biomedically relevant enzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductases, which are more
difficult to study due to stringent substrate specificities.
