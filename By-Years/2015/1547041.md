Demand for nitrogen fertilizers is increasing in response to growing human
population, improving diets, and expanding biofuel crop production.
Unfortunately, only about half of the applied nitrogen is used by crops, and the
rest is unintentionally released to groundwater, rivers, and to the air, where
it presents problems for human health and ecosystem health. Burning fossil fuels
for industry and transportation also releases nitrogen into the air, which falls
on soils and water bodies. The objective of this research coordination network
is to engage a community of researchers from many disciplines, including
atmospheric chemistry, agronomy, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, social
science, and human and wildlife health, who individually study aspects of this
issue, but whose collective, inter-disciplinary synthesis is needed to define
integrative potential solutions. A series of workshops will be convened on
topics such as impacts of excess nitrogen on climate, air pollution, water
pollution, and agricultural production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Framing the
scientific issues of excess nitrogen in the environment in a context relevant to
human and ecosystem health will increase understanding for both scientific and
non-scientific audiences of the extent of the health and pollution problems
associated with excess nitrogen, as well as options and trade-offs for finding
solutions.
