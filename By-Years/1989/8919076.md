Maternal aggression, which has been observed in a variety of mammals in both
naturalistic and laboratory settings, functions to protect the home and young as
well as to disperse adults and juveniles. While much is known about the
physiological determinants of other aspects of parental behavior and other forms
of aggressive behavior, comparatively little is known concerning the biological
basis of maternal aggression. Yet, females mammals exhibit dramatic changes in
their aggressive behavior toward conspecifics during pregnancy, postpartum
estrus, and lactation. Dr. Svare has shown that females are aggressive during
pregnancy, become docile during postpartum estrus, and then become intensively
aggressive during lactation. He will determine the role of steroid hormones in
the stimulation and inhibition of these behavioral changes. Dr. Svare will
systematically examine aggressive behavior and steroid hormone (estradiol,
progesterone, testosterone) concentrations throughout pregnancy and early
postpartum period. He will then use this information to construct a schedule of
exogenous hormones to reproduce the specific behaviors. The results will enhance
our knowledge of the biological basis of female aggressive behavior and may
ultimately prove important for understanding the behavioral changes that
frequently occur in human peripartum females.
