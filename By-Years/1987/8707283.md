Recent research has demonstrated that pressure affects the structure of liquids
in ways that have significant geological consequences. Perhaps the most
significant result is that certain silicate liquids may become denser than the
surrounding mantle solids at pressures below 30 GPa. The PI will investigate the
effect of pressure on the structurfe and compressibility of SiO2 liquids and
glasses, and other simple silicate liquids. The proposed research includes Monte
Carlo simulations of liquids with covalent and other many body pair potentials,
and more efficient liquid models based on coupled integral equations. By using
many body pair-potentials of several kinds will show how pressure affects loca
coordination, compressibility, thermal expansivity, specific heat, etc. Emphasis
will be on the identification of structural mechanisms, and their relationship
to elasticity and other thermodynamic parameters; quantitatiave results may also
be obtained in some cases.
