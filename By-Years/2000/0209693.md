The main objective of the Gordon Research Conference on
Nuclear&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry is to provide the international community of
nuclear&lt;br/&gt;scientists with a unique forum in which the newest
developments at&lt;br/&gt;the forefront of this science can be presented and
subjected to&lt;br/&gt;detailed and extended discussions and criticism. The
purpose of the&lt;br/&gt;conference is to encourage communication and the
discussions to be&lt;br/&gt;conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open
interactions between&lt;br/&gt;the scientists, provoking new and even
speculative ideas for future&lt;br/&gt;research. To accomplish these goals
requires the participation in&lt;br/&gt;all of the conference activities of a
significant number of leaders&lt;br/&gt;in the field. The participation of
younger scientists is essential&lt;br/&gt;to address the future manpower needs
of this rapidly changing field.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, bright and promising
postdoctoral researchers and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students have been specially
selected for participation in&lt;br/&gt;this conference and encouraged to
present their ideas. Their&lt;br/&gt;participation in this conference provides
them with unique and&lt;br/&gt;extensive access to the leaders in their field,
exposes them to new&lt;br/&gt;research opportunities and techniques and helps
prepare them for the&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles they will assume in the future.
This award will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate participation from these junior
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
