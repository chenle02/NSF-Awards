With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Maryland in College
Park will acquire instrumentation for time correlated single photon counting.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: a) single-molecule studies of protein-induced DNA conformational
populations; b) measurement of fluorescence lifetimes from short-lived low
quantum yield species; c) studies of complex fluorescence kinetics and
reorientation of new molecular surfactants adsorbed to liquid/liquid interfaces;
and d) investigations of radical chemistry in environmental systems.
&lt;br/&gt;Measuring time resolved fluorescence affords researchers direct
insight into the local environment and dynamics around a probe. Techniques
developed to monitor time resolved fluorescence have been broadly applied to
established fields such as photobiology as well as newly emerging areas in
materials chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
