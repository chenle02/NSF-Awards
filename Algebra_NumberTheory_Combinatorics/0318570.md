The investigator and his colleagues are going to study operations on deformation
complexes of various algebraic structures: in particular, operations on
Hochschild cochains and chains of an associative algebra, and the deformation
complex of d-algebras.

The knowledge of operations on Hochschild (co) chains should be useful for Index
theory on a (degenerate) Poisson manifold, which is of great importance for
Poisson geometry. Also, the investigator is trying to find a general simple
construction of an operad acting on a deformation complex of a general algebraic
structure. This can be helpful in studying deformations of such objects as Hopf
algebras.
