Professor Yu will work in two areas of graph theory. He will study contractible
edges and their applications, as well as cycles, cycle covers, and cycle
decompositions. Graph Theory began more than two hundred years ago with the work
of L. Euler, but it is only in the last half-century that the field has
flourished. It is now one of the most active, fertile branches of mathematics. A
graph is a network of lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), so that graph
theory becomes a natural tool for studying interrelationships among separated
entities. Graph Theory is used not only in Communications Theory but in
surprisingly many parts of pure and applied mathematics, as well as in
Theoretical Computer Science.
