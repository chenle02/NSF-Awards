How is morphospace filled during a radiation and are there rules for
diversification? We compare patterns of morphospace occupation and species
longevity between three radiations of planktonic foraminifera to determine the
predictability of these patterns. First we ask whether shape groups are discrete
entities in foraminifera. Then we examine the extent to which shape membership
predicts species longevity in each of the major radiations of this group.
Finally, we investigate how morphospace is filled during the radiations and
compare each cycle of diversification with the others to detect common patterns.
The strengths of this study lie in our ability to compare macroevolutionary
patterns between radiations to determine the stability and objectivity of these
patterns. In so doing, we can determine whether bauplan diversity is regulated
more by events particular to each radiation or by long-term processes that
change little between evolutionary cycles.
