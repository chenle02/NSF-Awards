O'Connell 9526882 The PI proposes to model and study the development of
subduction zones in the mantle. Fluid dynamical models of the sinking of
subducted lithosphere in the mantle will be developed, and applied to several
subduction zones including South America, Tonga-Fiji, Izu Bonin-Marianas and
Indonesia. The object is to relate the dynamical, time dependent development of
a subduction zone to the morphology and seismicity of the subducted slab and to
the observed variations of seismic velocities in subduction zones (as revealed
by seismic topography). The work will also address whether significant amounts
of subducted material penetrate into the lower mantle. The work will develop and
use three-dimensional dynamical models of the sinking of lithosphere at a
subduction zone. The models will include the effects of lithospheric plates,
including realistic plate geometries that evolve with time. Different types of
models will be used in order to most efficiently address various problems.
