This Special Minority Award provides a year of support for Mr. Arthur Mateos,
who is beginning graduate studies at MIT. The award will allow the incumbent to
finish his course work expeditiously and reach the research participation phase
of his studies sooner. This award is an integral part of the strategy of the
National Science Foundation to strengthen and increase minority participation in
the field of physics.
