This research is on various mathematical problems arising in the modeling and
analysis of industrial processes, such as electrophotography, channel flow, film
growth and oxidization of alloys. The mathematics of these problems involve
nonstandard partial differential equations, free-boundary problems, fixed-
points, a priori estimates, variational inequalities and their regularity
properties. The research in this direction will lead to a better understanding
of the industrial mathematical models and provide explanations and insight for
the physical phenomena behind the models.
