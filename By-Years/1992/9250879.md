A new physical chemistry laboratory course in quantum mechanics and statistical
mechanics is using a laser and molecular beam apparatus to develop an intuitive
understanding of concepts usually presented in the abstract. Experiments
performed on ultracold molecules under the collisionless conditions present in a
molecular beam allows students to more clearly see the applicability of
pertinent models and theories. More conventional experiments are pedagogically
less effective because the phenomena of interest are obscured by intermolecular
interactions and the wide range of states occupied by molecules in the sample.
The new equipment is also be used in an advanced spectroscopy and quantum
mechanics laboratory course.
