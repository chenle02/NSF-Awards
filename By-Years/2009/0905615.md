This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project determines the fundamental
limits of network secrecy from a network coding perspective, and then applies
this theory to improve security guarantees in peer-to-peer and wireless
networks. As network coding gains prominence as an important strategy for both
wired and wireless networks, the project identifies both the advantages and
vulnerabilities from using network coding. Subsequently, the effort develops a
design methodology that exploits the advantages while carefully compensating for
the vulnerabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes networks under
both outsider and insider attacks. Specifically, coding mechanisms are developed
to combat an external eavesdropper. Also, a combination of cryptographic and
information-theoretic tools are used to combat internal modification attacks on
the network. The results are then used in two case studies: eavesdropper attacks
on wireless mesh networks and pollution attacks on P2P content distribution
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secure network coded systems, once well
understood, can greatly impact how networks are designed and deployed. Nearly
every network setting (wireless, wired or heterogeneous) can benefit in terms of
improved resilience (in addition to other performance benefits such as
throughput) in its design. Case studies in this effort are designed to help
transition the theoretical principles developed into practical algorithms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team includes an industry member which will
aid in transitioning our research ideas from theory to practice. The team will
disseminate its findings through traditional scholarly venues, through the web
and to the local community at each partner institution.
