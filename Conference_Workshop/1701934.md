The subject of noncommutative geometry is being pursued by many leading
researchers in various locations around the globe. The field of is presently
going through a stage of critical development to the point where a conference
bringing together the international community of researchers in the field is
most timely. The conference will provide a unique opportunity for these
researchers to obtain a good sense of the current state of the subject and to
understand the future challenges in the area of noncommutative geometry. The
conference will have broad scope and international participation. It is
important that the next generation of U.S. researchers be informed of the state-
of-the art and future of this field. This award will enable the participation of
graduate students, junior researchers, underrepresented groups and other U.S.
based researchers without support to travel to this meeting and be in on the
ground-floor of future developments.
