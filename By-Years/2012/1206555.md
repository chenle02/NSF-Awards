This project will utilize precision frequency comb spectroscopy in the vacuum-
ultraviolet (VUV) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) to investigate atomic and
molecular transitions that have significant value in increasing our
understanding of fundamental physics. A new method utilizing two phase-coherent
XUV femtosecond frequency combs will be investigated as a promising path towards
high-resolution spectroscopy with unprecedented accuracy in this difficult to
reach spectral region. The physics to be explored in this project will come from
two distinct objectives: (1) to elucidate how the physics underlying intracavity
high harmonic generation affects the conversion efficiency and noise
characteristics of the XUV femtosecond frequency comb, and (2) to utilize the
dual-XUV frequency comb approach to provide an improved measurement of high-n
Rydberg states (n~50-60) in molecular hydrogen, thereby providing an improved
value for the ionization and dissociation energy of this physically important
molecular system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will provide a unique
research-based education for graduate students in the fundamentals of light-
matter interaction, advanced laser systems, and their use to probe and better
understand the most basic and common molecule: molecular hydrogen. Some of the
most basic atomic and molecular systems have their first resonance in the
vacuum-ultraviolet portion of the light spectrum. This is a region where few
laser sources exist, making it difficult to precisely study the structure of
atoms and molecules needed for testing our understanding of current physical
models. This program will utilize recently developed sources and techniques to
study molecular hydrogen with much greater precision, and open the door to
further studies in this difficult to reach spectral region. Such research
provides a solid foundation to prepare the next generation of scientists to
serve in our national, academic, and industrial research laboratories.
