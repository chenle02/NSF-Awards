The primary focus of the project will be the study of stochastic models for
epidemics and related random processes in which infection, information, or some
other transmissible quantity is passed randomly among the nodes of a network.
The dominant theme of the research will be the effect of the network geometry on
the behavior of the epidemic processes, especially near critical values of the
transmission rate parameter(s). Two large classes of network geometries,
Euclidean and hyperbolic, will be studied. Euclidean geometries are appropriate
for models of geographically structured populations, such as plants along a
river bed; here, for instance, the network might consist of individual nodes
arranged in communities placed at the vertices of a regular lattice, with
interactions restricted to nodes in the same or neighboring communities.
Hyperbolic geometries (such as those arising in expander graphs or ?small
worlds? models) are in many instances more appropriate for human populations and
computer networks, where interactions do not follow a regular geographic
pattern. Both finite and infinite networks will be studied. The primary
objective will be the description of large-population and/or large network
limiting behavior.

Stochastic epidemic models are closely related to a number of other large
classes of stochastic processes, and these will play a large role in the
research project. Epidemics of SIR type (susceptible, infected, removed) are at
least in simple cases equivalent to bond percolation on the network. Epidemics
of SIS type are contact processes. In Euclidean geometries, many of these
processes have measure-valued scaling limits that obey stochastic partial
differential equations of reaction-diffusion type. A secondary objective of the
research will be to understand the threshold phenomena and phase transitions
that occur in some of these related processes, and to explore how these are
mirrored in epidemic models.



Epidemics -- in human and animal populations, but also in computer and
communications networks -- arise from chance events. These are, in many cases,
simple but uncontrollable events: A passenger on a bus might or might not touch
a guard rail that has been contaminated by MIRSA bacteria; a computer user might
or might not click on an attachment to an email message informing him that a
wealthy businessman in Nigeria is asking for his help in transferring 30 million
dollars out of the country. These chance encounters are, however, repeated in
large numbers, by thousands of people, hundreds of times, and so they occur with
statistically predictable frequencies. This makes it possible -- at least in
principle -- to predict the course of an epidemic in a large population.

This research project is concerned with the study of simple mathematical models
of epidemic processes. The particular emphasis of the study will be on
understanding how the underlying geometry of the network of individuals or
communications nodes through which the epidemic propagates affects its course.
