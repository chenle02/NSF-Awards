The purpose of this research is to study the physical phenomena controlling the
dynamic constitutive and failure behavior of rate sensitive metals alloys. A
combined axial/torsional split Hopkinson bar will be developed and used to
investigate the thermomechanical constitutive and localization behavior of such
alloys when they are subjected to multi-axial dynamic loading. Emphasis will be
placed on examining the phenomenon of failure mode transition (dynamic cracking
vs. dynamic shear banding) associated with asymmetric impact loading of pre-
notched plate specimens. A variety of high speed optical and thermographic
diagnostic techniques will be used simultaneously to record mechanical and
temperature fields during deformation, localization and failure.
