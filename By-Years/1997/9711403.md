Unreliable failure detection has been gaining acceptance as a fundamental
paradigm for fault-tolerant distributed computing. This paradigm was originally
introduced to circumvent the impossibility of achieving consensus in
asynchronous systems with crash failures. The proposed research aims to extend
the applicability of failure detection in multiple ways: (1) It will seek
solutions that tolerate both process crashes and link failures, and in
particular, solutions that are resilient to network partitioning. (2) It will
consider practical problems besides consensus, e.g., atomic commitment and
various forms of group membership. (3) It will investigate the extension of
failure detection to other models, such as the timed asynchronous model, in
order to solve problems whose specifications involve real-time. (4) It will
explore the use of randomization techniques to enhance the power of failure
detection. This research intends to widen the scope of failure detection and to
firmly establish it as a core component of fault-tolerant distributed systems.
