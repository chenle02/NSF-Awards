The main objective of this project is to develop new methodology and theory for
statistical challenges motivated by integrative genomics, a collection of
quantitative approaches in genomics research that centers around the joint
analysis of multiple datasets. Integrative analysis has tremendous potential to
precipitate the next wave of scientific discoveries in genomics and is also a
crucial component of emerging conceptions of data science in general. This
project aims to develop new analysis procedures for 1) detecting whether two or
more datasets share the same significant genomic features, 2) identifying these
features, and 3) leveraging them to improve genomic prediction models.

This project opens important questions in integrative genomics up to rigorous
methodological and theoretical development by framing them in terms of cutting-
edge statistical issues, including signal detection, multiple testing, and high-
dimensional classification. The proposed methodological research will develop
new nonparametric tests and false discovery rate control procedures for
detecting and identifying shared genomic features, as well as new nonparametric
empirical Bayes approaches for high-dimensional integrative classification and
regression. The proposed theoretical research will explore the fundamental
limits of these problems. The results of this project will lead to more powerful
and rigorous methods and theory for integrative analysis in genomics and
elsewhere.
