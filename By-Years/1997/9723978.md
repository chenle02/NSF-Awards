IBN: 9723978 PI: Greer The chemical senses include not only smell and taste, but
some other chemical senses (the 'burning' or 'coolness' of spices such as pepper
or mint, and the 'tingle' of carbonation). The International Symposium on Smell
and Taste (ISOT) meets only once every four years, for nearly a week, bringing
together researchers from all over the world to discuss current research results
and plan future projects and collaborations. Partial support for this conference
will help defray travel expenses for some of the invited speakers, and for an
outreach program to involve the local San Diego area schools in workshops that
will lead to more understanding chemosensory science. The symposium proceedings
will become a published volume. Given past history, some aspects of this
conference will be important to fields beyond chemosensory work alone, and these
symposia will have an impact on the field for years to come.
