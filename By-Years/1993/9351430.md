This newly designed course in molecular biology features the use of
chemiluminescent and chromogenic techniques, thus eliminating the need for
radioisotopes in probing and sequencing.Also featured is the use of plants for
projects involving eukaryotes, avoiding the problems associated with animals but
allowing exploration of recombinant DNA and molecular evolution in complex,
differentiated organisms. The courses include a basic molecular biology course,
an advanced course in recombinant DNA and molecular evolution, and undergraduate
research projects in molecular and population genetics. Some of these projects
act as pilot runs for developing labs for the advanced molecular biology course.
Some of the exercises included are DNA amplification via polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), transformation of plant tissue with Agrobacterium, isolation of
plant organelles and their DNA and enzymes, DNA sequencing, and developmental
expression of genes.
