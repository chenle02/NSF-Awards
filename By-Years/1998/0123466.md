AST-0123466&lt;br/&gt;Roggemann, Michael C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will
develop and validate a technique to derive long exposure Point Spread Functions
as a function of Field of View using on-axis wavefront statistics measured at
the Advanced Electro-Optical System adaptive optics wavefront sensor. The
technique will use existing models of the well-characterized turbulence profiles
at the Maui site on Haleakela. This approach, if demonstrated successfully, may
lead to a new technique that will be an alternative to the more expensive and
complex Multiple Conjugate Adaptive Optics systems planned for the future. It
promises to be a useful tool for the entire astronomy community studying
extended objects.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
