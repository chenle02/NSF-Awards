Doctoral Dissertation Student: Deborah E. Harkness; Title of Dissertation: "John
Dee's Mathematical Philosophy and the Language of Nature." The "mathematization
of nature" is one of the major factors in the success of modern science. The
ability to use mathematical equations to describe the action of physical forces
has allowed scientists to achieve unprecedented degrees of accuracy in their
predictions. Yet why nature should act in ways that can be described
mathematically is not at all obvious even today. Philosophical arguments
continue about the "reality" of the relationships described in scientific
theories. But whether the mathematical relations are "real" or not, it is clear
that they are incredibly useful for science. Ms. Harkness is examining John
Dee's mathematical philosophy. Dee was one of the first of early modern natural
philosophers who made the case for the use of mathematics in the study of
nature. Her study explores the connections between the mathematical philosophy
of John Dee and the other facets of his natural philosophy to analyze the ways
in which mathematics became the dominant language of science during the 17th
century. Drawing on manuscript and printed materials from 13 libraries in the
United States and Great Britain, Ms. Harkness is examining Dee's intellectual
corpus and is placing Dee's mathematical natural philosophy in the context of
previous and subsequent work on mathematics and the natural world.
