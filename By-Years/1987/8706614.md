This RUI award is for support of studies in quantum field theory. The
objectives of the research are to apply nonlocal regularization methods that
preserve appropriate symmetries to two classes of field theories. One class
consists of discrete field theories known as lattice theories where one
encounters difficulties in maintaining a right-left symmetry known as chiral
symmetry. The other class consists of theories characterized as supersymmetric
where one encounters difficulties in maintaining the underlying symmetry between
two types of particles known as fermions and bosons. This research is directed
to important problems at the frontier of elementary particle theory.
