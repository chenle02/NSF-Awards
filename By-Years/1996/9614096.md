9614096 Chaikin This proposal is for support of an international conference
entitled "Fluctuation mediated Interactions in Soft Condensed Matter " to be
held at Centre de Physique, les Houches, France on October 14-18, 1996. The idea
of this workshop is to bring together world leaders in the emerging field of
soft condensed matter physics to exchange recent advances in theory and
experiment and to introduce this new discipline to young researchers and
students. The invited speakers and scientific committee include many world
leaders in this rapidly developing area. %%% This proposal is for support of an
