This is a Career Advancement Award for a young woman theorist, an expert on the
interface of particle physics and cosmology. She will study models for the
origin of large scale structure in the universe, and compare them with the
observed statistics of galaxy clustering. She will also attempt to put
constraints on some of the characteristics if the phrase transitions believed to
have occurred in the early universe by studying the properties of the neutron
star equation of state as suggested by observations of rapid pulsars.
