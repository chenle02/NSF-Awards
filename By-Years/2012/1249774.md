The National Association of Biology Teachers is holding a Professional
Development Summit meeting for two-year and four-year college faculty at its
annual Professional Development Conference in Dallas in November, 2012. The
topic will be propagating the "change" implicit in the document Vision and
Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action. The day-long Summit
features plenary sessions with noted speakers and leaders in education reform.
It includes an interactive workshop on "Classroom Integration in the
Introductory Biology Classroom," demonstrating practical management of this new
approach to science education. Interested participants then constitute a corps
of faculty activated to transform aspects of their teaching during the following
year, assisted by mentors from among the speakers. This process gives visibility
to the Vision and Change movement and a ripe audience to disseminate its
mandates.
