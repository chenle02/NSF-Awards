This research focusses on the generalization of Professor Terwilliger's recent
classification of the triply-regular graphs to arbitrary P- and Q-polynomial
association schemes, development of the theory of thin distance-regular graphs,
and further development of the Professor Terwilliger's theory of S and T
algebras. Graphs appear throughout mathematics, making graph theory an important
topic of study not only for its intrinsic interest, but for its many
applications in mathematics and related topics. It serves as a tool in modeling
many complex real world systems such as those encountered in computing and
network systems.
