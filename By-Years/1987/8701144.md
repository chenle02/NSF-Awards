Lunar and semilunar cycles of spawning activities have been described in many
species of fish. It is not known whether these cycles are essentially endogenous
in that they might occur in the absence of obvious lunar cues or whether they
are directly dependent on lunar-related stimuli such as tidal changes. Our
initial studies in gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, indicate that the spawning
cycle persists in fish held under controlled laboratory conditions for many
months without any obvious lunar cues (i.e., moonlight or tidal changes).
However, it is probable that the fish receive less obvious (subtle) exogenous
information that adjusts the phase of the cycle. Meier's investigations will
determine whether these persistent cycles are synchronized by an external cue so
that peak spawning activity maintains a specific relation to the tidal cycle in
the Gulf of Mexico where these fish reside. If the cycles are essentially
endogenous but synchronized by subtle external stimuli, he will determine
whether the external stimuli provide daily (tidal) or lunar information. Peak of
spawning activity occurs at different times of the tidal cycle as a function of
site where the fish were obtained. Accordingly, experiments will be carried out
to determine whether site specificity is genetically determined or imprinted on
the fish during development. The tidal cycle in the Gulf of Mexico where gulf
killifish are found has a period near 13.6 days and thus differs from the lunar
cycle of moonlight and from tidal cycles in many other areas (about 29.5 days).
Furthermore, the semilunar cycles occur in natural as well as controlled
laboratory conditions. Experiments will be performed to determine whether such
cycles are maintained in other areas, such as in Canada and along the Atlantic
coast where related teleost fish exhibit similar cycles.
