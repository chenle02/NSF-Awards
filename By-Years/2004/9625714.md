9625714 Melrose The proposed research has to do with various aspects of
symplectic geometry, spectral theory, pseudo-differential operators and index
theory. The investigator plans to study the weight multiplicities of group
representations via symplectic reduction and to examine the K-theory of algebras
of pseudo-differential operators in compact manifolds with boundaries. The link
between equivariant corbodism theory for symplectic manifolds and orbifolds is
to be pursued; the precise structure of the kernel of the solution operator to
Kohn's del-bar-Neumann problem on strictly pseudoconvex domains is to be
examined as well. Many problems in classical mechanics can be formulated in the
mathematical context of symplectic geometry and systems of partial differential
equations. In the course of such a formulation one recurring problem researchers
face is a multitude of different spaces associated with families of partial
differential equations. In index theory, these spaces are distinguished by means
of a discrete set of numbers called indices, giving a coarse but practical
classification of them.
