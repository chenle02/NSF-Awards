John Schmitt and Gary Bertrand are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study binary homogeneous nucleation. In this
project they will investigate the surface formation from effects observed in the
binary homogeneous nucleation of two octane isomers. An expansion cloud chamber
system will be used to make accurate nucleation measurements over a wide range
of temperature, activity and nucleation rate. The data will test current theory
and will be used to extend to the binary case a successful single component
scaled nucleation theory which specifically incorporates the formation of a
droplet surface. An accurate and proven description of the condensation of two
vapors into a liquid droplet, binary homogeneous nucleation, will not only
significantly advance understanding of the vapor-to-liquid phase transition, but
will also find immediate and extensive applications in such diverse areas as
formation of stratospheric aerosol, condensation in turbines, and distillation.
