The research objective of this award is to explore the signal group delay
induced by chromatic dispersion in optical fibers and its application in long-
span, high speed distributed fiber optic sensing. The approach will be to
multiplex a large number of identical weak reflecting fiber Bragg gratings in a
single optical fiber and to interrogate them with a fast spectrum-to-time
conversion method. This dynamic spectrum characterization to a delay-time
measurement circumvents the requirements of heavy averaging and dynamic spectral
analysis as encountered in the current distributed fiber sensor products. The
thermal stability of the ultra-weak gratings used in the system will be
investigated for their improved performance at high temperatures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include
dynamic health monitoring of many civil and industrial structures and systems
and low cost seismological oil and gas exploration. This technology may also be
useful to earth quake detection and volcano activity monitoring. The
multidisciplinary nature of the research will offer balanced training for the
participating students, enrich the current photonics curriculum at Virginia Tech
and promote the involvement of students from underrepresented minority groups in
the scientific and engineering research.
