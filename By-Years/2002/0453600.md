The Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the Colorado School of
Mines (CSM) will establish an International REU Site in Hong Kong. The focus of
this activity will be numerical analysis and scientific computing with
application to problems in applied science and engineering. The program will
involve internationally known Numerical Analysis/Scientific Computing faculty
from four major Hong Kong universities: Hong Kong Baptist University, Chinese
University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong University
of Science and Technology. The primary location of the program will be at Hong
Kong Baptist University. The eight-week program will be offered during each of
the summers of 2005, 2006 and 2007, and will involve ten U.S. student
participants, the majority of whom will be non-CSM students. The participating
students will engage in team research with faculty mentors from the four Hong
Kong universities on topics from areas such as numerical linear algebra,
wavelets, multidimensional integration and approximation, problem solving
environments, and numerical partial differential equations. Each project will
involve original research, blending algorithm development and analysis, both
mathematical and computational.

The program will introduce talented undergraduate students to the joy and
excitement of discovery that comes from participating in a vibrant international
research program. It will also enhance the students' technical expertise by
providing them with the opportunity to see and experience research problems from
a global perspective, and they will gain training and independence in working on
research problems in a multi-cultural setting. It is anticipated that this REU
experience will encourage more students to pursue advanced degrees in the
mathematical sciences with an international perspective.
