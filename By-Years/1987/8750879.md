The use of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer with Data Station
has recently been integrated into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum of the
Chemistry Department at Arkansas College. The instrument is used in Instrumental
Chemistry to teach instrumental operation, techniques of sample preparation, and
Fourier Transform principles together with spectral interpretation and structure
identification. In several courses in organic chemistry, the FTIR is used to
characterize products, to indicate product purity, to elucidate structures and
determine unknowns. Its uses in Physical Chemistry include the study of
vibrational and rotational spectra and the investigation of isotope effects.
