9413323 Smith This project will plan, organize, and conduct research to address
the requirements of the North American Free Trade Agreement as that Agreement
relates to the practice of engineering in the US, Mexico, and Canada. The focus
of the project is on the Development of Professional Standards for Professional
Services set forth in Annex 1210.5 of Chapter 12 of the Agreement, involving
professional conduct and ethics. Its goal is to develop recommendations on
muturally acceptable standards and criteria on professional conduct and ethics
for consideration by the NAFTA Forum on Engineering Practice and other
appropriate groups within the three nations. The recommendations will include
fundamental understandings of the responsibilities of engineers to clients,
governments and public. This effort involves a team of six, two from each
nation, advised by four consultants with expertise in global ethics. The project
involves several meetings and interim research between May and August 1994, in
order to identify major issues on ethics and professional conduct, draft ideas
on how they should be addressed, develop a preliminary report to the NAFTA Forum
on Engineering Practice meeting in June, and a final list and preliminary
outline of recommendations for the next NAFTA meeting which is likely to occur
in the Fall in Canada. After this, a final report will be prepared and
distributed appropriately. Addressing these issues of professional conduct and
ethics is critical to the implementation of a viable Agreement that will be
beneficial to all three nations in our future involvements in professional
engineering practice. ***
