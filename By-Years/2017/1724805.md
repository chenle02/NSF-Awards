This project supports hosting the 25th edition of the GENI Engineering
conference (GEC-25), including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be
held on March 14-15, 2017, on the Florida International University's Miami
campus. The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual
instrument that is emerging as a foundational experimental research platform
across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in
networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research in very large
socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale'
experiments in future internets.

GENI is an instrument designed to address three issues:

1. Science Issues: We cannot currently fully understand or predict the behavior
of complex, large-scale networks.

2. Societal Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can
trust its security, privacy or resilience.

3. Innovation Issues: Substantial barriers exist to at-scale experimentation
with new architectures, services, and technologies.

GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two
kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will
greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale
networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or
connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants.
The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an
opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to
formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand
what is being done with GENI and who among their peers at other institutions
might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members,
including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an
instrument for research. This proposal supports the development and use of the
research instrument.
