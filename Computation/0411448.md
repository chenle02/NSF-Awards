In its broader outlines, this research program aims at the development, analysis
and computer implementation of numerical methods designed to approximate the
solutions of some partial differential equations that have important
applications in the fields of engineering and physics. Indeed, elliptic
equations, the Navier-Stokes equations and nonlinear wave equations despite
having been cultivated for decades, still offer fertile ground for further
exploration, for there are still a plethora of unanswered questions and a
pressing need for more efficient and faster algorithms. The discontinuous
Galerkin method will constitute the core methodology of this effort. While going
back to 1973, major interest did not focus on it until the nineties. Today it
constitutes one of the most active areas within finite elements if not the whole
range of methods for the numerical treatment of partial differential equations.
It has not been as extensively explored as the standard Galerkin version, yet
what is known so far offers a tantalizing glimpse of its potential. The project
will involve various areas at the cutting edge of numerical analysis and
scientific computing, in particular, the development of convergent and efficient
adaptive methods designed to reduce the run time of the algorithms by finding
optimal or quasi-optimal meshes. These adaptive methods will require continuing
the work on the development of sharp a-posteriori error estimators designed to
identify regions where the solution is varying rapidly. Major efforts will be
directed towards pursuing a recently identified strategy for reducing the number
of iterations that current adaptive algorithms require in achieving a prescribed
level of accuracy.

Scientific computing is recognized as crucial to the advancement of science. As
such, the development of state of the art algorithms and codes is important for
the progress of technology. Specifically, improved adaptive codes resulting from
this project will have impact on a wide range of problems and applications
involving fluid flow phenomena, the elucidation of extremely fast chemical
reactions by femtosecond lasers, and numerical simulations of supernova
explosions.
