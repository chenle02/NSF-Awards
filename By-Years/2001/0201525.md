&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Emotional and Cognitive Influences on Responses to the
September 11 Attacks&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jennier Lerner&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0201525
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, the events of September 11 provide a
natural laboratory for advancing emotion and judgment research, as well as
testing the generalizability of the results of previous research. Emotion and
judgment research might inform public policy by identifying measures that
address people's cognitive and emotional needs in relation to the September 11
attacks. This panel study traces the same set of 800 participants (600 adults
and 200 adolescents). The goal is to examine the differential effects of fear,
anger, and sadness on risk perceptions, attributions of causality, preferences
among policy options, intentions to take risk-mitigating actions, and economic
behavior in response to the September 11 attacks. A second goal is to examine
developmental differences in emotional reactions between adolescents and
adults.More specifically, the project will use samples purchased from a firm
that recruits for internet surveys through random-digit-dialing selection
methods. The dataset has measures of health behavior and consumer decision-
making both before and after the attacks. Wave 1 of the proposed survey and
experiment consists of dispositional emotion measures, emotion-priming
manipulations, and outcome measures of risk perceptions, attributions of
causality, expectations of future feelings, consumer decision-making, health
behaviors, and policy preferences. Wave 2 (3 months after the first wave or
immediately after another national event, whichever comes first) will examine
how changes in emotion over time affect the same outcome measures. &lt;br/&gt;
