9315239 Smith The Sixth Biology Symposium, sponsored by the Scientific Committee
for Antarctic Research, will convene in Venice, Italy in late May, 1994. This
meeting, held every six years, will emphasize the species, structure and
survival of Antarcic communities. Topics to be emphasized include Antarctic
Biodiversity, Life History Strategies, and Environmental Change and Human
Impact. Over the years, this symposium has become an excellent forum for the
international community of researchers to share data and new ideas coming from
their research. This award is a Group Travel Award, which will provide partial
travel support to researchers at United States institutions. The ability for
these scientists to participate in the symposium will lead to increased
scientific knowledge and should result in further international cooperation in
Antarctic research. ***
