In his proposed experimental plan, Dr. Faull intends to use the techniques of
in vivo voltammetry and intracerebral microdialysis to test three specific
hypotheses concerning biogenic amine and neuropetide release phenomena. These
hypotheses concern the proposed interactions between dopamine, cholecystokinin
and neurotensin in mesocorticolimibic and basal ganglia brain regions, and the
proposed interactions between dopamine and acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal
pathway. The in vivo techniques will be used in conjunction with microbore high-
performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection and
combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for quantification of biogenic
amines and their metabolites, and radioimmunoassay for quantification of the
neuropeptides. By using sophisticated analytical and radioimmunochemical
techniques, the proposal of the newly developed in vivo techniques will be
extended to important areas of the behavioral and neural sciences and could have
a significant impact on understanding of the integration of neurotransmitter
release in specific brain areas.
