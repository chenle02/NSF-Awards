With equipment procured through this project, new laboratory exercises using
plant cell and tissue culture are being introduced into courses in botany and
cell biology. These exercises expose students to an important area of the plant
sciences which currently is making significant contributions to the field of
biotechnology. Students use techniques such as phase and fluorescence microscopy
to follow the stages of development as isolated, individual plant cells are
induced to produce new tissue, and eventually to give rise to whole new plants.
This process vividly demonstrates to students the excitement of working with
plant systems and stimulates interest in further work in the plant sciences --
an area into which additional women need to be recruited. The project holds
promise for developing into a model that could be adopted widely in other
institutions. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal
sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
