A new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at University of
California Santa Barbara (UCSB) will be established. The program will bring ten
undergraduates to UCSB each summer for three years. Students will spend eight
weeks conducting independent research projects with the support of USCB faculty
mentors and participating in field trips and professional development
activities. They will receive stipends, housing and transportation. Independent
research projects will focus on marine biology topics that integrate the study
of physical and biological concepts. Students will make final presentations of
their research to the community, including local fishermen and policy-
makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCSB REU program is integrative, emphasizing
the biological concepts that are core to marine systems, with a specific focus
on the interaction of physical and biotic processes in coastal marine ecosystems
such as kelp forests and the rocky intertidal zone. Students will have an
opportunity to conduct research on the interaction of multiple abiotic factors
and their effects on organisms.
