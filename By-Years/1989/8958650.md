This is a Presidential Young Investigator award. The research will include
continued development of instrumentation and testing devices in the area of
geotechnical engineering, as well as expansion of involvement in hazardous waste
engineering. Current research dealing with the development of ultrasonic crack
detection for a new in situ stress measurement system will continue. Work in the
hazardous waste area will diverge into two areas. First, development of a cone
penetration device (Envirocone) that allows ground water and vadose zone
sampling, and second, a combined program with several biologists yielding
several projects; including a biosensor for the Envirocone to detect trace
carcinogens, a laboratory model to study biocontamination of geotextiles, and a
potential technique to electro-osmotically move bacteria through soil.
