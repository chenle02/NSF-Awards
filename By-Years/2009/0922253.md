This award funds research using tools from economic theory to analyze how
incentives work in organizations. The toal is to understand what outcomes a
specific organization can achieve, and how internal communication facilitates
the incentives that are necessary to keep each individual organization member
working towards the common goal. The PI focuses specifically on situations where
the organizations use rich communication protocols, and will incorporate
insights from exisiting work in contract theory and mechanism design while
expanded our knowledge in both areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is made
up of two main projects. The first focuses on how monitors are themselves
monitored and evaluated. Starting from a novel answer this question, the PI then
builds and analyzes a new model that predicts the range of outcomes that a
partnership organization can achieve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second project
looks at dynamic mechanism design and is focused on understanding the dynamic
incentives created by the kinds of contracts proposed and analyzed in the first
project. The research characterizes dynamic implementation and optimal dynamic
mechanisms and then goes on to fully describe the equilibrium payoff set of a
class of multi-stage not-necessarily-repeated games with
communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research may provide a tractable
analytic framework for a broad variety of interdisciplinary research about
organizations with rich communication protocols. This framework may be useful in
political science, management science, and organizational behavior.
