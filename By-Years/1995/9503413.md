9503413 O'Brien This proposal requests funds for Indian River Community College
to establish a direct connection between its campus wide network and NSFNET via
SURANET, a regional network. These connections will provide operations
management and information services and it will give the college a 56 thousand
bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
per second) National Backbone network. The benefits of this NSFNET connection
include e-mail between local and remote researchers and educators, file transfer
capability and the ability to use remote computer resources. Also the college
will have the ability to investigate innovation in educational resources and
incorporate them into their curricula.
