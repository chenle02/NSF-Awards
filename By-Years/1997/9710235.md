This research is on design of low-power hardware for digital signal processing
(DSP) and communications applications. The approach incorporates both high-level
(algorithmic) and low-level (circuit) parameters, and includes novel methods for
design exploration, power estimation and low-power circuit synthesis. Key
features of the approach include: a.) joint optimization of algorithmic
performance with power dissipation, b.) integration of high-level algorithmic
and low-level circuit issues via high-level power estimation, and c.) explicit
incorporation of signal statistics at all levels of design.
