Proposal Number: ECS-9732958 Principle Investigator: Donnell Walton Title:
CAREER: Novel diode-pumped fiber laser Abstract The proposed research will
investigate a double-cladding ytterbium-doped silicate fiber lasers at 980 nm
wavelength and an upconversion-pumped thulium-doped fluoride fiber laser near
800 nm. The former fiber laser is an alternative laser source for pump the
Pr:doped fiber amplifiers at 1300 nm whereas the latter upconversion-pumped
laser can cover a wide range of wavelength from UV to IR. This proposal is
recommended for an CAREER award of $200,000 over 48 months.
