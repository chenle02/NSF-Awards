The initial program objective is to develop the modeling and analytical tools
needed to accurately predict the motions and stresses of a very large floating
structure (VLFS). The structure will be assembled from a number (up to 100) of
large stable modules and, in concept, might have a greatest dimension as large
as 5000 feet (an airfield). The analysis will include the effects of intra- and
inter- module hydroelasticity. The second program objective will be to apply
this analysis methodology to determine if such large floating structures are
technically feasible---i.e., capable of relatively small motions and forces in
multi- year storms. The interactions of motions and associated stresses will be
iteratively studied in a search for optimum" module shapes. Initial choices of
buoyancy modes and module shapes will be determined on the bases of expected
civilian uses and user requirements. Shapes which survive the analytical tests
will be examined to determine if they are compatible with the capabilities and
limitations of U.S. shipyards and graving docks. During the two program summers,
workshops will be held in Hawaii to bring together the VLFS community of
probable users, motion- and stress analysts and potential builders. Workshop
Proceedings will be published.
