Abstract 9615073 Rust The Flare Genesis Experiment will use a 80 cm telescope
to make images and magnetograms of unprecedented resolution (0.2 arcsec) of the
solar photosphere and chromosphere while flying from a high altitude, long
duration balloon around the Antarctic continent. The purpose of the experiment
is to further understanding on how the energy stored in the sun's magnetic
fields is converted to energetic events such as flares and coronal mass
ejections. This experiment can only be done from an Antarctic balloon (short of
building a large, special purpose space craft) because continual viewing of the
sun is necessary for periods much exceeding a day, which can only be achieved
from polar sites, and in order to achieve the required resolution the telescope
must be above most of the atmosphere. This project is jointly sponsored by NSF,
NASA and the Air Force. ***
