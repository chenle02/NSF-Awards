The 2.5 million hectare Adirondack Mountains constitute an ecosystem of
enormous value to ecological research. The size of the area, rich diversity of
ecological communities, and unusual protection from human development provide a
region of wilderness character that allows investigation of natural systems and
man's impact upon these systems. Recognizing this potential, in 1981 the SUNY
College of Environmental Science and Forestry began to upgrade an existing field
station to provide a state-of-the-art base for ecological research. Major
improvements were made in support facilities, in computerization of a large
historical database, and in organization of a comprehensive long term ecological
monitoring program. In the past five years, the research conducted through the
Adirondack Ecological Center has grown from 20 to 79 projects, including 17
national and international studies. Currently there are 111 scientists and
graduate students involved in research (24 of the scientists from outside
institutions). This accelerated growth is now limited by the lack of adequate
modern housing/research support facilities. The Center is developing a modern
housing facility to expand its capacity from 37 bunk spaces to 97. The greatest
need at the present time is a cafeteria-style dining facility, complete with
kitchen, restrooms and shower facilities. This project will provide partial
funding for that facility.
