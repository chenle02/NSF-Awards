9510066 Okos This project is on research to establish and verify a general
multiphase-multispecies transport theory for hydrophilic shrinking systems by
combining various independent theories that exist in the literature. A new
thermomechanical theory potentially applicable to most hydrophilic shrinking
systems such as foods, contact lenses, drug delivery polymers, and clays will
lead to novel forms of Darcy's and Fick's laws applicable to saturated shrinking
systems and to novel non-equilibrium definitions of swelling pressure and
capillary pressure. This research proposes to extend the new thermomechanical
theory into an experimentally verifiable form, to develop fundamental property
models, and to verify the theory with experiments. ***
