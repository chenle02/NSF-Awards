This action provides support for a Career Advancement Award to enable a female
scientist to learn the techniques of high resolution electron microscopy (HREM)
and complementary analytical techniques, such as parallel electron energy loss
spectroscopy (PEELS) at the University of Virginia. Initial research examines
the structure of cobalt-tungsten coated graphite fibers, both by themselves and
incorporated into a nickel matrix. %%% The research explores a composite
material that may have synthetic diamond on the fiber surface. Composite
materials are of interest because of their unique tailored properties for use as
structural materials.
