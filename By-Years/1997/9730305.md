9730305 Ait-Sahalia Interest rates have traditionally been modeled in the
economics literature as following continuous-time Markov processes, and more
specifically diffusions. By contract, recent term structure models often imply
non-Markovian continuous-time dynamics. Can discretely sampled interest rate
data help decide which continuous-time models are sensible? Within the Markovian
world, diffusion processes are characterized by the continuity of their sample
paths. It is immediately obvious that this condition cannot be verified from the
observed sample path. By nature, even if the sample path were continuous, the
discretely sampled interest rate data will appear as a sequence of discrete
changes. This is a fundamental and very important problem in financial
economics. This project examines whether the discontinuities observed in the
discrete data are the result of discreteness of sampling, or rather evidence of
genuine non-diffusion dynamics of the continuous-time interest rate process. The
issue is to isolate the observable implications for the data of being an
incomplete discrete sample from a continuous-time diffusion. The project relies
on testing a necessary and sufficient restriction on the condition densities of
diffusions, at the sampling interval of the observed data. This restriction
characterizes the continuity of the unobservable complete sample path. This
project investigates the distribution, consistency and power properties of the
test statistics. The tests will be implemented empirically. ??
