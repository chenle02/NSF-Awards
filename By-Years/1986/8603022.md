Medical practice is rapidly approaching the "age of implants." Already
pacemakers are routinely implanted and in the near future, a host of devices
designed for people with mobility deficits will come into common use. Until now
the electronics have received the large share of thought and experiment but now
designers must consider the less glamorous matter of what will protect implanted
circuits from the hostile environment of the body. These studies will begin by
studying the use of silicone elastomers for corrosion control of implanted
medical electronic devices through accelerated-life testing in conditions
similar to in-vivo experiments; the conditions, however, will be more
controllable than in in-vivo testing.
