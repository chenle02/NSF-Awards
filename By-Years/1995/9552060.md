Edinburg, TX 78539 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Engineering Title: Electrical
Engineering Systems Laboratory The aim of this project is to establish a Systems
Laboratory in the Electrical Engineering area. The growth of new technologies
such as wireless communications (Cellular, Personal Communications Networks,
High Definition Television, Global Positioning Systems) in the communications
and signal processing areas have increased the curriculum and laboratory needs
in the systems area. Additionally, the developing program serves a primarily
Hispanic student body (89%); and improved laboratory experiences is a goal the
faculty is determined to achieve. Objectives include integrating Systems
Laboratory experiences across the Electrical Engineering curriculum. Experiments
are outlined which expose students to the Systems Laboratory equipment and
software early in the curriculum with continued emphasis through the senior
design courses. Ildustrial-quality software such as Matlab, Mathcad and Signal
Processing Workstation (SPW) are used in parallel with measurement equipment.
