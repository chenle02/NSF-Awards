Dr. Mark D. Distefano, Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota - Twin
Cities, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career
Advancement Award to design semi-synthetic enzymes which will catalyze
regioselective transformations of organic molecules, to undertake course and
curriculum development at the graduate and undergraduate level, and to engage in
community outreach programs. By attaching a transition metal catalyst to a fatty
acid binding protein and by introducing a thiazolium heterocycle into the
interior of the same type of protein, catalysts for the regio- and stereo-
selective oxidation of polyolefinic species and for enantioselective carbon-
carbon bond forming reactions will be prepared. To obtain catalysts using
proteins without covalent modification, cofactor binding domains will be
introduced into the protein by mutagenesis or by fusion enzymes. Using current
educational theory a large organic chemistry course and a graduate course in
reaction mechanisms will be redesigned to increase the effectiveness and
intellectual stimulation of these experiences. To communicate the excitement of
science out-reach programs to local schools will be expanded. Many synthetic
chemicals are made using processes that involve toxic materials and the disposal
of the resulting waste products has created enormous environmental problems. One
solution to these difficulties employs enzymes (protein based catalysts) to
catalyze chemical reactions. The goal of this project is to prepare new enzymes
which will accomplish important chemical transformations. Success in this
project would lead to the ability to prepare semi-synthetic enzymes which are
capable of performing very efficient transformations for which no natural
enzymes are know. The educational activities are designed toward increasing
student appreciation of chemistry and will involve school children to graduate
students.
