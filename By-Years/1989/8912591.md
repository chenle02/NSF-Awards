The Committee on Natural Disasters, National Research Council, is establishing a
panel of experts in wind engineering who will represent the private sector,
standard setting organizations, and federal, state and local government
agencies. The purpose is to assess the current status of the field of wind
engineering research and applications, and to develop recommendations for future
activities. The panel will deliberate on issues related to research performed
during the past two decades; the interaction between diverse disciplines, e.g.,
meteorology, structural engineers, designers, economists and others;
undergraduate and graduate education in wind engineering; and international wind
engineering research activities among other concerns. A report will be produced
and disseminated throughout private and public organizations and professional
groups specializing in wind engineering.
