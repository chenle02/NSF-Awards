9500964 Thaddeus Professor Thaddeus will study the topology and geometry of
quotient varieties using his techniques of flips. In particular he will study
configuration spaces of certain projective spaces. He will also study moduli
spaces off vector bundles and curves. he hopes to compute relations in their
cohomology rings and the associated Hilbert polynomials. This is research in the
field of algebraic geometry, yet it directly connects to two of the great
advances in theoretical physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general
relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics. ***
