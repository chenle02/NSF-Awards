This project will develop software architectures capable of supporting user
applications requiring a heterogeneous set of parallel or distributed modules.
The major thrust is to develop a set of tools and techniques to support the
generation of interfaces designed to link parallelized packages. In order to
establish a general methodology, it is necessary to develop a testbed that
utilizes many of the types of packages that must be integrated. The project will
develop a testbed that will act as the substrate for a medical informatics
project and a project in computational aerospace. The distributed packages in
this testbed will include parallel databases, computerized medical records, High
Performance Fortran programs, statistical package, and programs developed with
parallel C++ class libraries such as LAPACK ++ and CHAOS ++. The ultimate goal
of this research is to develop a framework that provides efficient integration
of heterogeneous, parallel/distributed program modules.
