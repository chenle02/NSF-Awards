This award will support the purchase of the 570-node Intel Delta Touchstone
System. This will be the world's fastest computer. The computer will be housed
on the California Institute of Technology's campus, but has been acquired
through the Concurrent Supercomputing Consortium. There are 14 members of the
consortium, ranging from federal agencies, government labs, universities and
Intel. The immediate benefit of the use of this machine will be to solve
problems in areas of neurobiology, chemical physics, fluid dynamics and
astrophysics. The researchers will attack problems in these and other areas that
could not be approached with existing computers. The science, in this research,
is driving the development of computational hardware and software. Experience
gained by this set of researchers on this machine will demonstrate the use of
parallel supercomputers to the nation's scientists. Further, it will help in
developing new parallel architectures.
