The area of nonlinear optical materials is crucial to present and future
development of the lightwave technology area. Institutions tend to specialize in
either a study of the physical phenomena or in the development and study of the
materials which might be important for realization of devices and systems based
upon such phenomena. The present effort represents a unique combination of
people to investigate new materials which might impact the future growth of the
area.
