Equations will be developed and experiments conducted to quantify and identify
local foci of current flow through the skull and scalp. This is a unique
approach to the understanding of the EEG and one which is sorely needed. Others
have worked in EEG analysis for many years, yet an understanding of its origins
and meaning is still elusive. This work is significant in that it brings a new
approach to the issue and has potential for developing a better understanding of
the EEG, thus offering a simple tool through which to identify and locate brain
tissue anomalies.
