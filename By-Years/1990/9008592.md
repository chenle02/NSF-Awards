Three-dimensional manifolds appeal to us at a very basic level, but they are
very difficult to understand. There are many ways to construct examples of
3-manifolds, but the simplest sorts of questions about the constructed manifolds
often cannot be answered. For example, it is very difficult to tell whether two
construction schemes yield the same or different manifolds. What is needed is a
computable collection of invariants which distill the vast amount of information
contained in the three-manifold into a usable form. The standard invariants -
Euler characteristic, homology, fundamental group - either contain almost no
information, or are very difficult to work with. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are the
most important - and most complicated - class of geometric 3-manifolds.
Hyperbolic manifolds have the same metric properties as the non-Euclidean
geometry discovered by Bolyai, Gauss, and Lobachevsky in the 1820's. The metric
can be used to carry out measurements. In particular, such invariants as the
volume (the size of the manifold) and the length spectrum (the set of all
lengths of non- trivial closed geodesics in the manifold) can be used to study
these 3-manifolds. Subtler geometric invariants can be defined as well. Recent
research indicates that these invariants may be very useful in helping us to
understand 3-manifolds. This project involves extensive machine computation in
an approach to understanding these invariants.
