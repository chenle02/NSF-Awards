The objective of this research is the scattering and transfer of radiation
within and through ice crystals typical of cirrus clouds. The choice of crystal
habitat and other physical characteristics, essential for describing scattering
properties, will be guided by various physical samples obtained during the
recent FIRE experiment by Andrew Heymsfield (NCAR). A knowledge of radiative
exchange in cirrus clouds, especially the distribution of heating and cooling,
is essential for an understanding of natural clouds and an informed use of
remote sensing observations, particularly from satellites. //
