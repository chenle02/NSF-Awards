This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Genetic analysis
of spinal cord circuit formation in the zebrafish embryo." Large-scale genetic
screens have revealed zebrafish motility mutants that abnormally contract
muscles on the left and right sides simultaneously, suggesting a disruption of
spinal cord circuits that coordinate motor output. The goal of this research is
to examine these mutants to elucidate the precise cellular and molecular events
required for spinal cord circuit formation.
