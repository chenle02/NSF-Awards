"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI grant will be used to acquire
an X-ray microtomography (XM) system to support diverse research and education
groups at Clarkson University (CU). The equipment will directly support the
research and educational mission of CU through the training and involvement of
graduate and undergraduate students in educational experiences inside and
outside of the classroom. The XM system provides new and unique experimental
research capabilities at CU for the investigation of internal geometric and
material characterization problems. The system adds advanced experimental
capabilities to modernize the CU mechanical characterization and testing
capabilities, which serve several innovative, multidisciplinary research and
education projects. This system will have a very significant impact on the
fundamental understanding of various mechanical, aerospace, bio-mechanical and
biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This X-ray microtomography capability
will enhance collaborative research targeted at improving the human condition,
and will provide state-of-the-art instrumentation for training of CU graduate
and undergraduate students interested in emerging research areas in advanced
materials and engineered biological systems. The XM facilities will enhance
experiential project-based learning in pre-college, undergraduate and graduate
courses and research projects directed by CU.A broad range of fundamental and
applied research programs will utilize the system, including: investigation of
the mechanical and pharmaceutical properties of advanced drug tablets, health
and biological effects of nanoparticles, characterization of nanocomposites and
self-healing materials, and osteoporosis-induced compression fractures in
vertebral bone. The system will play a critical role in enabling the CU
researchers to acquire new knowledge and understanding in these emerging fields
and train next generation technical professionals. &lt;br/&gt;
