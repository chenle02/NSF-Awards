ABSTRACT

The foremost objective of this project is to extend the local representation of
the characteristic classes of noncommutative spaces to the more intricate spaces
described by the spectral triples of type III introduced by Connes and the PI.
The resulting local-global theory will be applied to the transverse geometry of
foliations, to modular forms, Hecke operators and Rankin-Cohen brackets, and to
the refinement of the mathematical formulation of the standard model of particle
physics. In the process, the Hopf cyclic theory of characteristic classes for
foliations will be extended to all classical types of transverse geometries. In
a different direction, the concept of boundary will be incorporated in the
spectral triple approach, and the characteristic classes of the noncommutative
spaces with boundary will be developed by means of relative cyclic cohomology.

In various branches of science, the concepts of local and global form two
markedly different but coexisting facets of a theory, which are often correlated
in an interesting way by a local-global principle. The present project will
develop new tools for the implementation of this principle in the setting of
noncommutative geometry, a modern variant of geometry inspired by quantum
mechanics which allows for non-commuting operator-valued coordinates. Although
this feature precludes ab initio any naive spatial conceptualization based on
points, there is a more subtle interpretation of the notion of locality,
inspired by the Bohr correspondence principle in quantum mechanics, which will
be fully exploited. The proposed work will engender new connections between
several fields of mathematics and physics, thus stimulating their mutually
enriching interaction.
