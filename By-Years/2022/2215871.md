This project will upgrade the existing laser system at the University of
Maryland to increase its output pulse energy by a factor of four, making
possible a wide range of relativistic physics experiments on a tabletop. The
experiments will be run mainly by students and postdocs and will include the
types of experiments typically done at much larger laser facilities. These
experiments are of both fundamental and practical interest for the development
and application of advanced charged particle accelerators, intense laser pulse
propagation, and ultra-high field nonlinear optics and plasma physics. The
hands-on student and postdoc training obtained in running and maintaining the
laser system, and performing and analyzing the experiments, will be invaluable
for the development of a workforce in technical areas of increasing importance
for science, industry and national defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on recent
experiments employing a Maryland-developed laser acceleration scheme at a
petawatt-class laser facility, it is expected that the upgraded laser system at
the University of Maryland will be able to accelerate electrons to over one
billion electron volts (1 GeV), corresponding to nearly the speed of light. This
will make possible tabletop x-ray and gamma ray light sources and their
applications. In parallel efforts, the increased laser energy of the upgraded
system will drive the development of efficient sources of radiation in hard-to-
access wavelength regimes, such as terahertz radiation. It will also make
possible experiments in laboratory astrophysics, including a new class of
magnetic reconnection experiments in the relativistic
regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
