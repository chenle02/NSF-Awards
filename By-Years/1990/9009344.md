The specific goal of this project is the generation of the diasatereomeric
4-substituted phenacyl methylposphonate adducts of chymotrypsin and trypsin-like
enzymes. It includes the synthesis of the 4-nitrophenyl esters of respective
inhibitors (PMNs), the study of phosphonylation by the their enantiomers, and,
in particular of the self-stimulated dephosphonylation reactions. Rational
selection of the substituents in the 4- position of phenancyl will provide
inhibitors that will regenerate enzyme activity on different time scales. The
potential for medical use of these compounds as modifiers of serine hydrolase
activity through controllable inactivation/regeneration cycles is suggested.
Synthesis of the compounds and kinetic measurements will involve conventional
techniques. Non-bonded interactions in the diastereomeric adducts will be
evaluated by molecular graphics and mechanics calculations, in an independent,
complementary research project. Results of all the investigations will then be
used to assess the use of phosphonate esters as active site probes of serine
hydrolases. Acetycholinesterase, for which no structural information is
presently available, will be the target of similar studies in the future.
