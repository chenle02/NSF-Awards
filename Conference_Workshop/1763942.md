This award provides funding for participation in the conference "2018 Shanks
Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Fluid Dynamics" that will be held March
24-25, 2018 at Vanderbilt University.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of partial differential equations and mathematical fluid dynamics. A
number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this
conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
