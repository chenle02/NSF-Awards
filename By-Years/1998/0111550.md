Under the direction of Dr. Eve Danziger, Ms. Patience Epps will collect data for
her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct linguistic research on Hupda, a
little documented language of the Maku family, spoken in the Vaupes region of
the northwestern Brazilian state of Amazonas. The investigation will produce
materials for a grammar, orthography, lexicon, and collection of texts. Most of
the estimated 1500 speakers of Hupda follow a semi-nomadic lifestyle and rely on
hunting, gathering, fishing, and the cultivation of bitter manioc for
subsistence. Given this relatively small population of speakers and the
uncertain future of the cultures and lifestyles of indigenous groups like the
Hupda people, the Hupda language may not be viable for many more
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of this documentation of an
endangered language is twofold. First, such efforts add to our understanding of
what is possible in human language. Second, such efforts contribute to language
preservation. The preservation of the world's linguistic diversity is important
both for the continued richness of human knowledge and for the communities of
speakers themselves, whose cultural knowledge and artistic achievements are
often closely intertwined with their linguistic heritage. The creation of an
orthography is especially desired by the Hupda community, and this will be an
important step toward native-language literacy and the creation of pedagogical
materials, which in turn will encourage the community's language preservation
efforts. This research also addresses questions of language contact and
intergroup relations in the history and prehistory of the region.&lt;br/&gt;
