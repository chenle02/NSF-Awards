The objective of this project is to design a geographic database of the Southern
California wildfire evacuations of 2003. The primary research question is,
"Where and when did wildfire evacuations occur and what were their general
characteristics?" Example characteristics of interest include the time the event
(wildfire) was detected, the timing, medium, and content of the evacuation
order, the area that was evacuated and the decision-making process that led to
the given protective action. The project will be divided into two phases: 1)
information gathering, and 2) geographic database design. The first phase will
focus on collecting information from in the form of articles, photos, video, and
eye-witness accounts. Other secondary data to be collected include air photos,
satellite imagery, land ownership, and roads. Structured interviews of emergency
managers (informants) will be conducted to gather more detailed information on
each of the evacuations and the decision-making process that led to a particular
protective action (e.g. mandatory versus voluntary evacuation). The focus of the
second phase will be assembling the information into a comprehensive geographic
database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will: 1) increase our understanding
of the complex spatial dynamics of wildfire evacuations and associated decision
making for a major event, 2) provide a sampling frame for future behavioral
studies on warning and evacuation, and 3) lead to better evacuation modeling and
prediction for other communities at risk to wildfire.&lt;br/&gt;
