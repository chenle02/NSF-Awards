In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project between Sava
Milosevic, University of Belgrade, and Eugene Stanley, Boston University, the
investigators will continue their theoretical work on the physics of novel
materials and processes. Certain behavioral aspects of materials, in particular
polymers, will be studied: (1) crossover from fractal lattice to Euclidean
lattice; (2) lipid aggregation in model biomembranes; (3) conduction in
disordered materials; and (4) fluid mechanics of dentritic solidification. The
research will advance understanding of the physical laws governing the
morphology, microstructure and processes of novel materials. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S.
contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are
involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia,
but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
