This project aims to address several questions at the interface of combinatorics
and physics. More specifically, it will apply algebraic and combinatorial tools
to questions involving the exclusion process, Macdonald polynomials, cluster
structures in Schubert varieties, mirror symmetry in cluster varieties, and the
amplituhedron.

More concretely, this project concerns several interrelated questions
surrounding the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on both
a lattice with open boundaries, and on a ring. This combinatorial model is
intimately connected to both Koornwinder polynomials and Macdonald polynomials;
and a better understanding of the ASEP should lead to combinatorial formulas for
Koornwinder and Macdonald polynomials. A second direction is to understand the
cluster structure on Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian. This should have
applications to toric degenerations and mirror symmetry on the Grassmannian and
its Schubert varieties. A final direction concerns the amplituhedron, which was
introduced by physicists in the context of scattering amplitudes in N=4 super
Yang Mills theory. Conjecturally, the volume of the amplituhedron computes
certain scattering amplitudes, which measure how massless particles interact.
Understanding this conjecture should lead to a new insights concerning the
positive Grassmannian.
