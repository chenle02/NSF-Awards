This research which makes use of topological methods and insight to obtain
results in combinatorics, is being enhanced by the full-year programs in
combinatorics and low-dimensional topology at Mathematical Sciences Research
Institute (MSRI). Research activities are centered at MSRI, and Dr. Lynne M.
Butler is on the program committee for the workshop on enumeration and partially
ordered sets and is giving a series of lectures on this topic at MSRI's
introductory workshop. Interactive activities engage her with postdoctoral
researchers, graduate students at the University of California - Berkeley, and
local high school teachers. They include teaching a UC-Berkeley graduate course
in Coxeter groups, mentoring and supporting the women mathematicians
(undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) in Berkeley's Noetherian Ring, and
experimenting with outreach to high school teachers during MSRI's introductory
workshop.
