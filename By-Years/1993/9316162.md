9316162 Stuiver This award is for support of a two year program to obtain a
high- resolution time series of cosmogenic Beryllium-10 (10Be) and Chlorine-36
(36Cl) from two shallow firn cores which have been retrieved from Taylor Dome
and upper Taylor Glacier, East Antarctica. The work will complement the ice-core
paleoclimate and glaciological studies already underway at Taylor Dome and
should contribute to a better understanding of the atmospheric transport and
depositional mechanisms of these isotopes. The 10Be and 36Cl time series will
help to determine cosmogenic isotope production rates over annual to millennial
time periods, which will provide information on solar and geomagnetic
variability. ***
