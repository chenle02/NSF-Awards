The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Testing and Assessment proposes a
two-day workshop on assessing 21st century skills building on two previous
workshops. The first workshop explored employer demand for employees who possess
these broad transferable skills, which were defined as adaptability, complex
communication, non-routine problem solving, self-management/self-development and
systems thinking. The second workshop considered the intersection between
science education reform goals and the 21st century skills, examined models of
high quality science instruction that may develop the skills and discussed
teacher readiness to integrate the skills in instruction. Both workshops
expressed the need for assessments that can measure the attainment of 21st
century skills. This workshop is to describe research on assessment of 21st
century skills to inform policies and practices. The workshop is lead by an
expert in assessment and convenes an expert committee of educational measurement
specialists, cognitive psychologists and experts in job analysis and employment
testing along with practitioners in schools. The committee investigates the
types of assessments available and associated technical reports and designs the
workshop to review them. Knowledgeable experts are commissioned to write papers
and speak at the workshop. An individual author writes a summary report to be
disseminated by the NRC. In the second year the NRC reconvenes the leadership of
all three workshops to identify the next steps to provide research-based
guidance to educational leaders seeking to infuse 21st century skills into
instruction.
