This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
a cost-effective, non-vacuum technology to deposit p-type transparent conducting
oxide (TCO) films. The lack of effective p-type TCOs has been a long-standing
problem for the electro-optic industry. It is the crucial component to advance
photovoltaic technology with n-type absorbers. The Phase I project developed
cutting-edge spray pyrolysis technology to deposit wide-gap p-zinc oxide (p-ZnO)
films. The project achieved important breakthroughs, both in terms of the new
deposition system, as well as achieving p-ZnO films with inexpensive spray
pyrolysis. The structural and electro-optical data for the ZnO films validate
the feasibility of the new deposition approach and provide a compelling measure
of project success. The Phase II project will advance the deposition system,
improve the scientific understanding of doping issues, derive process-property
correlations to optimize the electro-optical properties, and integrate
technology into existing technology.

The broader impact/commercial potential for new optoelectronic products is
increasing exponentially, owing to the demand for clean energy and the
microelectronics revolution. The deposition method offers cost and
manufacturability advantages over current vacuum methods; it is remarkably
versatile to deposit a number of other technological semiconductors that are
amenable to spray deposition. The p-ZnO films can be used for short-wavelength
light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, energy efficient windows, flat panel
displays, gas sensors and other opto-electronic applications. It can extend
photovoltaic technology to n-type absorbers and multi-junction flexible solar
cells for higher efficiency. The commercialization of this technology will
provide energy security, avert future power crises and reduce global warming.
