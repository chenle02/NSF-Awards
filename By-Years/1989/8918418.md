With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Ziegler
is developing and using novel Raman spectroscopic techniques to investigate the
dynamics of photodissociation processes in small polyatomic molecules at a
resolution sufficient to examine individual rotational-vibrational levels.
Ziegler's experimental and theoretical work is expanding our detailed
understanding of the photodissociation process and its variation with the energy
and quantum numbers of the initially prepared state. Previously developed
rotational resonance Raman techniques are being used to measure rovibrational
quantum specific lifetimes of short-lived (20 femtoseconds to 5 picoseconds)
quasi-bound excited state levels. Resonance hyper-Raman is extending the work to
dissociative molecular excited states in the vuv accessible via two-photon
processes with near-uv photons. Planned work also includes the use of resonant
Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) to achieve greater rotational
quantum resolution and allow the study of larger molecules.
