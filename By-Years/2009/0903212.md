This project seeks to improve student recruitment into commercial aerospace
education. By partnering with the SpaceTEC consortium, the project adopts their
core of fully developed aerospace courses and inserts them into the new
Associate of Applied Science Degree in Aerospace Technology, with a specialty in
commercial aerospace. The project contributes to meeting the workforce demands
in this field. The local Spaceport America currently under construction in New
Mexico is a potential partner to this project. To enhance recruitment for the
new program, a mobile van is equipped with scientific equipment (such as a Solar
Power Trainer) of the type used in actual classroom instruction. The mobile van
makes scheduled on-site presentations at secondary schools and specific
organizations that provide access to the region's Hispanic community. Trained
faculty members conduct demonstrations and provide students with information
about employment potential and entry level requirements in commercial aerospace.
The project also provides professional development for faculty in key areas such
as composite fabrication techniques. In addition, technical workshops are given
to area K-12 teachers.
