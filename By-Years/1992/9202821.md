The proposed research will address the various mechanisms by which grout
components could be released from the stabilized soil mass, and measure the
resultant concentration of these components in the leachate. These
concentrations will be determined by total organic carbon analysis and
inductively-coupled plasma emission spectrophotometry, respectively. The
toxicity characteristic leaching procedure will also be performed on the most
promising of the formulations identified for each of the grouts investigated.
Leachate characterization tests from soaking and permeation tests on samples
excavated from the prototype grout bulbs and acute toxicity tests will also be
conducted.
