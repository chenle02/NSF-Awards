9623179 Eastman This award supports an international conference on "Mechanical
Properties of Interfacial Materials" held in Hawaii, 14-19 January 1996. The
format offers many opportunities for discussion of scientific issues dealing
with effects of interfacial properties on mechanical behavior. Invited overview
talks include mechanisms of deformation, grain boundary design, interfacial
fracture, bioceramics, nanostructures, interface bonding, composite design and
multilayer composites,, and impurity segregation effects. Support is provided
for young scientists, engineers and graduate students to attend the meeting. ***
