9412125 Newcombe The objective of this workshop is to issue recommendations for
how to facilitate research at the intersection of Cognitive Science and the
teaching and learning of science and mathematics. The Workshop will be attended
by representatives of the cognitive science community who do research on the
description and development of those abilities, concepts, and processes
underlying mathematics and science skills, representatives of the educational
community who are researcher-practitioners, and representatives from Federal
agencies. The workshop will consider how the Cognitive Science and Education
Research communities can more fruitfully interact to provide the research
underpinnings for strengthening mathematics and science education. The final
report will issue recommendations for future research initiatives that promote
such an interaction. Such research will strengthen American economic
competitiveness by educating a workforce better prepared for the technological
demands of the 21st Century. ***
