Revealed preference theory is one of the cornerstones of modern economics and
other social and behavioral sciences. However, it assumes that decision makers
such as households, politicians or firms take all choices into full
consideration, which is unlikely in many situations. This project thus aims to
improve upon revealed preference theory by allowing decision makers to pay
limited attention to their choices. The investigators will combine both theory
and econometrics to develop testable theory and empirical implementations of
decision-making under limited attention. The results from this project will help
policy makers and social scientists to better understand the decision-making
process and further develop better policies or interventions in different
settings such as labor markets, elections, or
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will first develop a random
limited attention model, compatible with a large class of different decision-
making process. This model will generalize classical revealed preference theory
under full attention as well as previously introduced deterministic limited
attention frameworks. Based on this model, this project will obtain concrete
testable implications, and will employ modern econometrics and statistical
techniques to construct inference procedures with good finite samples
properties. Nonparametric identification, estimation and inference methods will
be studied in detail. As part of this project, methods for eliciting unobserved,
heterogeneous preferences in the context of the random limited attention model
will be proposed and implemented using real empirical data.
