Marine snow is important in the vertical flux of marine particulate matter.
Asper will design and construct three complimentary camera systems to study the
abundance, flux and in situ sinking speed of marine snow aggregates. The first
system will photograph a well-defined volume of water for assessment of the
concentration of these aggregates either along a vertical profile or through
time on a stationary or floating mooring. The second and third cameras are
mounted normal to (side-looking) and beneath (upward-looking) a transparent
settling chamber/sediment trap. The side-looking camera will determine the
sinking speed of aggregates within the settling chamber by observing their fall
over a specified time interval. The third camera will measure the flux of
aggregates by observing their successive arrivals on the clear bottom of the
trap. Material collected by the trap will also be compared to the images of
aggregate arrivals for estimation of the composition and mass flux contribution
of these aggregates. Combining these measurements will allow accurate
determination and modeling of the role of these aggregates in the vertical flux
of particulate matter in any oceanic water column.
