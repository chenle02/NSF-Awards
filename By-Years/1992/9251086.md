The main goal of this project is to improve the learning, retention, and
application of physics concepts and principles by students enrolled in physics
classes at Lee College. This is being accomplished by introducing a series of
new experiences in the laboratory utilizing microcomputer-based laboratories,
activities, and new experiments in mechanics. These laboratory experiences are
in the areas of kinematics, forces, rotational motion, energy, and simple
harmonic motion. Using some of the MBL results of Thornton and Laws with some
results done at Lee College, a new laboratory curriculum is being developed that
is integrating new technologies with proven activities and experiments.
Microcomputers are being used to perform data collection, analysis, and
graphing; and are being used to construct, execute, and display physical
simulations in mechanics.The support is provided for software and hardware for
six, networked, color Macintosh IIsi workstations equipped with a Universal Lab
Interface with appropriate sensors and probes. Support is also provided for a
laser printer, CD reader, scanner, and some laboratory equipment.This project is
encouraging students to continue study in physics or to support science by
improving their experiences in physics, to increase science literacy, to help
prepare Lee College's physics courses for the next century, and to stimulate
other two-year and four-year colleges to adapt this approach for their needs.
