The Causeway Postbaccalaureate Program is aimed at increasing the number of
American students from groups traditionally underrepresented in doctoral
programs in the mathematical sciences. Specifically, Causeway is a 12-month
program providing foundational coursework, research advising, community
building, and career mentoring in the context of a strong and supportive
community of participants. Beyond its immediate impact, the Causeway program is
designed to be scalable, replicable, and sustainable, so that the benefit can
extend well beyond mathematics. This project is co-funded by the NSF Research
Traineeship Program, which is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate
students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through
comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and
aligned with changing workforce and research
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underlying Causeway are three hypotheses which, if
true, could inform "best practices" for other institutions and programs, even in
fields beyond mathematics. These testable hypotheses are: 1) a sizable cohort
increases the likelihood of successful graduate study for participants; 2) a
supportive community fosters a sense of identity and inclusion for students in
STEM; 3) a broad consortium of supporting institutions can sustain a program
beyond its initial period of NSF funding. The control group for the sizable-
cohort hypothesis is the population of students in traditional pathways to
graduate study in mathematical sciences. Placement of Causeway students in
graduate programs will be our primary measure of success. In-depth interviews by
a psychology faculty member, focusing on students' progress and evolving
identity through the program, will provide qualitative information and feedback
about the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
