This award will provide partial support for three years for the Southern
California Geometric Analysis Seminar to be held each winter quarter in 2008,
2009, and 2010. Geometric analysis is an important part of the modern
mathematics and is related to many other branches of mathematics. Using analysis
as its main tool and differential geometry, topology and algebraic geometry as
foundations, it has solved a large number of problems in global geometry,
topology, and several complex variables.

These annual conferences are organized by UC San Diego and UC Irvine, and bring
together researchers in geometric analysis and related topics from universities
in the southern California including UCI, UCLA, UCR, USC, UCSD, UCSB, and
CalTech. These Seminars promote interaction among mathematicians in geometric
analysis and related areas and introduce graduate students and post-docs to some
of the most important recent work in geometric analysis. The organizers place a
priority on the participation of graduate students and recent PhDs, especially
members in underrepresented groups. The schedule will be arranged so that there
will be ample time for the participants to have discussions with the speakers
and each other.
