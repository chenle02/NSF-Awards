9634179 Mukherjee, A. The proposed research will study superplastic flow on
different microstructural scales: macro (entire deformed volume), meso (grain
groups) and micro (crystalline defects). The scientific goal is to develop a
multi-axial constitutive law which reflects the occurrence of superplastic
deformation on different microstructural scales. Fundamental understanding of
superplastic behavior at these different microstructural scales will enable
development of quantitative models for superplastic flow. The balance of
experimental work with analytical modeling and the relevance to applied problems
is excellent. The successful performance of this research will have significant
engineering impact on the control of industrial forming parameters, reduction in
forming temperature and the development of new industrial forming processes. ***
