9312723 Dufty Strongly coupled plasmas occur in a number of important
astrophysical and terrestrial systems. The proposed research is a theoretical
and numerical study of dynamical processes in the simplest case of a one-
component, as seen through the probe of a single impurity atom or ion. The
questions of interest are those beyond the domain of linear response and include
important aspects of both radiative and transport phenomena. Among the phenomena
to be studied are the emission, absorption and redistribution of radiation by
the impurity, nonlinear stopping powers, and collision-time distributions.
Theoretical techniques of non equilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic
processes will be closely correlated with computer simulations that ensure
proper control of assumptions used in the theory. ***
