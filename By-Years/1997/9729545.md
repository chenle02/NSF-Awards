LAY ABSTRACT Principal Investigator: Harris-Warrick, Ronald Proposal Number:
IBN-9728553 This international conference on the neural mechanisms for
generating locomotor activity is held under the auspices of the New York Academy
of sciences in New York City on March 21-24, 1998. The primary focus of the
conference is to discuss new research on the neuronal basis for locomotion in
higher vertebrates, including man. As an introductory overview, the best
understood vertebrate and invertebrate preparations are presented , followed by
a session on spinal locomotor networks in higher vertebrates. The second day
highlights sessions on neurotransmitter control of pattern generating networks,
sensory inputs to these generators, modeling of well understood networks, and
molecular biological approaches to understanding neural network function and
modulation. On the final day, the sessions cover various developmental and
comparative approaches to study rhythmic locomotion and clinical applications of
spinal locomotor network analysis in animals and man. A final panel discussion
is charged with generating general principles for rhythmic pattern generation
and discussion of fruitful avenues for future research. LAY ABSTRACT Principal
Investigator: Herron, Paul Proposal Number: IBN-9729545 Effects of Progressive
Periods of Cholinergic Depletion on Brain and Behavior The brain
neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, has been suggested to play a major role in the
adaptive response of the brain to sensory and cognitive experiences. The purpose
of this research is to determine the consequences of selective depletion of
acetylcholine on brain structure, function, and behavior. This research will
enable an understanding of the role of acetylcholine on the underlying brain
circuitry and quantity of synapses in the cortex; the neural activity of single
neurons in the cortex; and the mechanism of learning and memory. Results show
how brain structure, brain function and behavior are degraded when acetylcholine
is not present at certain levels. This work is important for providing a better
understanding of the adaptive and maintenance roles of acetylcholine in sensory
perception as well as learning and memory.
