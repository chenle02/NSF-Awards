This workshop aims to advance knowledge about the causes, consequences, and
potential solutions to severe political and societal polarization. An important
contribution is its focus on issues related to polarization in democracies
around the world. The topic is important, as highly-polarized societies pose
potential threats to political and social stability. Democracy is supposed to
manage competing interests in a society in a peaceful manner, and provide
opportunities for newly-emerging or previously-excluded sectors of the
population to strive for and reach political power. Today, however, a number of
democracies are straining to include these new groups without succumbing to the
negative consequences often associated with political and societal polarization.
The workshop will bring together a diverse group of experts to investigate this
question and to develop an interdisciplinary research network on the
topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop brings together a number of scholars
to examine cases of polarization in democratic governments. It does so by
studying democracies cross-nationally, and that represent states with varying
levels of political and economic development, as well as varying cleavages (i.e.
class, ideology, religion, ethnicity, urban-rural, nationalist-cosmopolitan,
elites - people). This line of inquiry is important, as the conventional wisdom
tends to portray established democratic systems as politically stable. As recent
events show, however, democratic systems are susceptible to destabilizing anti-
democratic pressures. These events are increasingly not limited to new
democracies in the developing world, but are emerging in more established
democracies in the developed west. States have increasingly become divided over
issues of nationalism and globalism/integration which may increase such
instability. In the United States, political polarization is reflected in
government gridlock, in other parts of the world such polarization can
potentially lead to much more destabilizing outcomes.
