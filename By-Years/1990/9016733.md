The Syracuse group will carry out a diverse program of studies in both
classical and quantum gravity theory. On the classical side, they will analyze
properties of solutions to Einstein's equations by canonical methods, by the use
of new dynamical variables, and by twistor methods. On the quantum side, they
will continue to study the quantization of gravitation using their new tools
(loop and connection representations). Other studies will investigate model
systems (such as 2 + 1 gravity), cosmological models, the role and meaning of
time, and measurement theory. The goal of this work will be to extend classical
gravitation theory to the quantum domain, to gain insight on any exact quantum
theory of gravity, and to overcome fundamental conceptual issues in this
endeavor.
