This award provides three-years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the 2015, 2016, and 2017 events in the "Prairie Analysis
Seminar" series. The meeting in the first year of the award will be held on
September 25-26, 2015, on the campus of Kansas State University, with the
conference moving to the University of Kansas in Fall 2016 and returning to
Kansas State in Fall 2017.

The Fall 2015 event will be the thirteenth edition of the Prairie Analysis
Seminar, an annual regional conference serving the Midwest that has over the
years showcased a wide range of topics in analysis. The featured speakers at the
2015 meeting will be David Kinderlehrer and Rob McCann. The format for the
conference provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other
young scientists to present their work
