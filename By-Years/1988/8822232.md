This award will support Dr. George C. Carroll of the University of Oregon to
conduct collaborative research for one year with Dr. Naohiko Sagara at Kyoto
University and Dr. Naliaki Yoshida at the Kyushu Branch of the Forestry and
Forest Products Research Institute in Kumamoto, Japan. They will investigate
conifer - gall midge - fungal endophyte associations to test whether the
presence of symbiotic endophytes is responsible for preventing insect
infestation of the host conifer. Endophytes are a recently discovered group of
fungal symbionts which form inapparent infections in the stems and leaves of
higher plants. In several cases, endophytic fungi have been shown to deter
insect attack or to kill insect larvae within the plant tissues. Study of the
conifer - gall midge - endophyte association may have strong practical
implications in the forestry industry. Likewise, it will impact on studies of
plant-insect interactions in general, including the areas of coevolution,
mutualism, and biocontrol. The strong research groups at Kyoto University and
the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute will complement Dr.
Carroll's expertise on conifer-endophyte systems.
