The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Utah State University will
enhance the capabilities of an existing workstation system by purchasing a CPU
upgrade, network co- processing board, network traffic software, larger disks,
and peripheral video I/O equipment at an estimated cost of $53,014 to allow
researchers to better visualize the results of their work by significantly
increasing the performance of the existing system. The equipment will be used
for the following research projects. 1. Physically Based Stochastic Models of
Fracture and Fluid Flow in Rock (K. Hestir and J. Koebbe) 2. Pore-Dispersion and
Homogenization (J. Koebbe) 3. Dynamical Pulse Behavior at Nonlinear Boundaries
(J. Powell) 4. Newton Iterative Methods for Large Scale Nonlinear Systems (H.
Walker)
