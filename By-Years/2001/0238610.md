This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a low-
cost manufacturing processes for multifunctional composite materials that have
specific air and ground transportation applications. Existing materials designed
to protect against explosions or impacts tend to be heavy and to be appendages
on structural systems. The new materials, which consist of an aluminum foam
surrounded by facing plies of resin-infused glass, carbon, or aramid, will be
light weight and designed to integrate affordability and functionality.
Innovative manufacturing methods, using out-of-autoclave processes that are
derivatives of liquid molding approaches, will be developed to incorporate
automation to improve quality and decrease processing time. A number of fiber-
ply/foam combinations will be fabricated with a focus on manufacturing a
container for explosives transport and on a hardened aircraft door. Prototypes
will be fabricated for customer testing. The improved processing and unique
properties are expected to lead to a variety of other applications. &lt;br/&gt;
These applications of aluminium foam core composites for making protective
structures will meet the national need for materials that provide increased
protection and security. The market for protective materials is expected to
grow, and is already a sizeable $150 - $200 million per year.&lt;br/&gt;
