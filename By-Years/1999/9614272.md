9614272 Bodnar This grant provides $54,408 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading the hydrothermal facility at Virginia Tech. Much of the requested
equipment will be manufactured in-house, such as the re-building of furnaces for
cold-seal bombs and replacing valves and adding transducers to the cold-seal
setups to allow continuous monitoring of pressure during experiments. Upgrade of
this facility will allow on of the top experimental hydrothermal geochemists in
the world and his students to continue their productive research utilizing the
novel technique of introducing synthetic fluid inclusions in geological samples
to be used as indicators of the thermochemical conditions existing in three-
phase systems at elevated pressures. These techniques have application to ore
body petrogenesis and tectonic studies. ***
