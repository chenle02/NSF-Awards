9214905 Kron This three-year award will support U.S.-Italy cooperative research
between Richard Kron, University of Chicago, and Dario Trevese of the University
of Rome, "La Sapienza," Italy, on the optical variability of quasars. This is a
topic in quasar research that is central to the understanding of the power
source. The research collaboration will measure the optical variability of a
statistical sample of quasars based on archival data that span 15 years. Kron
and Trevese will complete a detailed statistical analysis of the quasar light
curves, and will observe spectroscopically a sample of galaxies selected on the
basis of their nuclear variability, which will allow the study of the continuity
between quasars and galaxies with active nuclei, thus constraining models for
the cosmological evolution of quasars. Thorough research on the variability of
quasars will contribute to our understanding of the mechanism by which quasars
attain their enormous luminosity by the infall of material into a black hole.
This work may lead to alternative ways of searching for quasars, through their
variability, which has until now been only partially successful. * * *
