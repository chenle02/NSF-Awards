This award is for the partial support of travel of USA participants to the
Symposium on Geometric Mechanics and Symmetry at the University of Warwick. The
Symposium will focus on the symplectic and differential geometry of symmetric
Hamiltonian systems and applications of geometry and symmetry techniques to the
classical, semi-classical and quantum mechanics.
