This proposal is for a focused research program for the investigation of
efficient parallel iterative methods for the solution of large systems arising
from models with general geometries and other irregularities, where the lack of
regular structure makes it hard to use existing techniques. The methods will be
implemented on advanced parallel architectures, such as CRAY-YMP, Connection
Machine and Intel Hypercube.
