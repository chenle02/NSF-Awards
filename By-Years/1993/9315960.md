9315960 Gill The PIs propose an integrated four year study of: (1) the partition
coefficients of Th, U, and Ra; (2) numerical models of the behavior of
radionuclides during partial melting; and (3) Th, U, Ra, and Pa activities in
volcanic rocks from mid-ocean ridge segments (Siqueros transform, 36oN and 33oS
on the Mid Atlantic Ridge, and a propogating tip of the Galapagos Spreading
Center at 86oW), two continental margin arcs (Japan and Kamchatka) and two
oceanic arc-backarcs (tholeiites in central Izu and shoshonites in the northern
Marianas), and two chemically- zoned continental felsic systems (Inyo-Mono in
California and Baitoushan in China). The objective is to distinguish the effect
of time from the effect of an open system in each case. The key to reaching this
objective, apart from overcoming the difficult analytical problems, is choosing
rock suites well-suited to thematic questions and for which abundant other
geological and geochemical information will be available. Consequently, this
proposal focuses on #3 above.
