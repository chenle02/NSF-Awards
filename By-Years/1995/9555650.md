9555650 Smith Title: Technology and Invention in Elementary Schools (TIES)
Project Description This proposal describes a teacher enhancement project
designed to enhance teams of teachers to teach the integrated science and
technology through active inquiry using the mechanism of technological problem-
solving and invention. The primary delivery site for the summer intensive
workshops will be at the National Inventor's Hall of Fame (Inventure Place) in
Akron, OH. Thirty-two first tier teachers, representing four member teams from
selected schools, will participate annually in the enhancement. A major goal of
the project is to improve teachers' ability to more effectively encourage
underrepresented students, including a cohort of Native Americans from New
Mexico, to participate in active, technology-based scientific inquiry.
Instruction will consist of a series of activity based units focusing on major
inventions including the development of polymers, the electron microscope,
electronic digital memory, air-conditioning, and biotechnology. Participants
will interact with noted inventors, explore the interface of science standards
with technological inventiveness, engage in hands-on inquiry, and participate in
on-site internships at several Fortune 500 corporations.
