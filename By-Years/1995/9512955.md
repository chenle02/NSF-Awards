It is proposed to purchase a multi-processor supercomputing resource capable of
1.8 Gigaflops / 1597 SPECfp92 peak computational performance. The system will
serve a group of six researchers and their students in Biophysics, Chemistry and
Physics departments working in the area of biomacromolecular structure, dynamics
and folding research. The proposed system will enable them to carry out, amongst
other things, ab initio computations to produce more precise biomolecular force
field for use in and RNA structures based on NMR data, to theoretically simulate
the dynamics of proteins, to refine Xray protein structures and to characterize
the geometry of enzymatic transition states. The purchase of the supercomputing
resource will provide for the training of theoretical and computational
biochemists and biophysicists, as well as furnish an introduction to modern
computational methodologies for students interested in experimental biochemistry
and biophysics.
