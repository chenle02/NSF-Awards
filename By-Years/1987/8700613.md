This action provides continuing support for the U.S. Committee on Tunneling
Technology. The major activities of this committee are related to the technical
issues involving the stability of subsurface openings. Previous activities of
the committee have contributed to a national focus on geotechnical engineering
research in the area of earthquake lifeline engineering. During the next year
the Committee will address several key issues in subsurface tunneling, namely
the hazards associated with surface openings, and the effect of tunnels and
underground openings on the earthquake response of nearby building foundations.
The Committee's activities and reports will provide valuable guidance to
geotechnical engineering researchers and especially to researchers involved in
earthquake hazard mitigation in the area of siting and geotechnical systems.
