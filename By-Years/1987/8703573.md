This project is a five-day conference in Algebraic Topology and Homotopy Theory
to be held during August of 1987 at the University of New Hampshire, Durham, New
Hampshire. Rapid and deep developments indicate a definite need for a conference
of this sort in order that researchers meet and exchange ideas. It is expected
that the conference will draw mathematicians from the U.S., Great Britain,
France, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Topics that will be discussed
include applications of simplicial methods, classical homotopy theory,
cohomology of groups, stable homotopy theory, and applications of extraordinary
theories. For example, the work of H. Miller on the Sullivan conjecture and its
offshoots has led to some understanding of maps between classifying spaces. In
addition, related work of Lannes and others has made new breakthroughs in the
cohomological description of spaces of maps. It is very likely that these
results will lead to even more exciting and basic theorems. Other examples
include the work of Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith in the direction of Ravenel's
nilpotence conjectures. The results here indicate a glimmering of some global
understanding of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.
