Knowledge of molecular structure and dynamics and the ability to utilize and
compare structural results are central to contemporary chemical research. In
this arena, it is essential that the modern chemistry department have state-of-
the-art computational facilities in order to enhance the research capabilities
of active faculty. This award, co-funded by the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation
Program and the Biological Instrumentation Program, will aid in the acquisition
of computer equipment that will upgrade existing computational facilities and
add new capabilities in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1)
Structural Inorganic Chemistry of Metal Porphyrin Complexes 2) Structural
Studies of Bioinorganic Systems 3) Stucture and Dynamics of Polymer Systems 4)
Structural Chemistry of Osmium Complexes 5) Calculations of Magnetic Field
Effects and NMR Data Analysis 6) Organic Synthesis and Transition Metal
Catalysis 7) Synthetic Structural Organic Chemistry
