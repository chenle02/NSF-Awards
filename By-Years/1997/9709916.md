This award provides partial support for a conference on `Current Topics in
Survey Sampling,` to be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on 25-26
October 1997. Sample surveys are universally recognized as an efficient method
of gathering information regarding populations of interest. Due to a growing
demand to solve various design and methodological issues of complex surveys,
survey sampling has evolved into an extensive body of theory, methods, and
operations over the past decade. This conference will enable an assessment of
the current state of research on some of the important topics in surveys, pose
many open problems, and foster cooperation among researchers in an effort to
solve these problems. Survey researchers will be given an opportunity to present
and disseminate their research findings in a forum that encourages interaction
among researchers from government, industries, and academia. The conference will
also provide a stimulus to junior researchers and advanced graduate students
working in survey sampling.
