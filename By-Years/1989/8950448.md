Equipment will enable students to study molecular biology in general and DNA
manipulations in particular. Courses to be enhanced include Molecular Biology,
Immunology, Genetics, and Microbiology. Electrophoretic gel apparatus, power
supplies, and photographic equipment will enhance existing experimental work in
Genetics and Microbiology and will, along with a Geiger counter, form the basis
for a new laboratory sequence in the Molecular Biology course. A microtiter
plate reader will upgrade laboratory work also be used by students doing honors
work or independent study. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
