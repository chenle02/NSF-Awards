0305484&lt;br/&gt;Towle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Argentina award will
support Dr. David W. Towle, Mount Desert Island Laboratory (MDIBL) to work with
Dr. Carlos M. Luquet of the University of Buenos Aires in
Argentina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will consist of a state-of-the-art
examination of the sodium pump and its role and regulation during adaptation to
salinity change in crabs. They will study the mechanisms by which two species of
euryhaline crabs, Carcinus maenas from the North Atlantic and Chasmagnathus
granulatus from South America, are able to regulate the osmotic concentration of
their hemolymph in a varying estuarine environment. The proposed studies have
the opportunity to advance our understanding of the ion transport control in
invertebrates with the potential to help fisheries, conservation and
aquaculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Towle has expertise in genomics and
molecular biology, while Dr. Luquet has complementary skills in
electrophysiology and experimental biology. This combination of molecular and
organismal/physiological approach will bring new relevance and insight into both
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
