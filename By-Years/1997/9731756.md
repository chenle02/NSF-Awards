9731756 Glazman Research will be conducted on the theory of correlated electron
transport in confined interacting electron systems with an aim to elucidate the
role of mesoscopic fluctuations. Work will focus on capacitance fluctuations in
quantum dots, mesoscopic fluctuations in double-dot devices, mesoscopic
fluctuations in a normal metal grain connected to superconducting leads, and on
many body effects and mesoscopic fluctuations in coupled 2D-3D electronic
systems that may be realized by vertical tunneling into GaAs heterostructures.
The principal investigator plans an analytic approach using various theoretical
techniques to investigate mesoscopic fluctuations in these systems; these
include methods of bosonization, effective action, renormalization group, as
well as diagrammatic techniques. %%% This theoretical research involves
understanding quantum mechanical processes and phenomena surrounding the
transport of electrons in electronic device-like structures that are constructed
on length scales between the atomic and the macroscopic. This work will have
immediate impact on the interpretation of existing, and design of new,
experiments designed to elucidate the physics of electron transport in
mesoscopic devices. The study of these phenomena on mesoscopic and smaller
length scales is expected to profoundly influence emerging electronic device
technologies of the next century. ***
