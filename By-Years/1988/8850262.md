The American Indian Science &amp; Engineering Society (AISES) will implement a
three-week summer residential math camp for approximately 30 American Indian
high ability and high potential junior high school students entering grades 8, 9
and 10. The goal is to help students strengthen their skills in algebra,
geometry, trigonometry, and pre-calculus in order to facilitate their entry into
math-based disciplines at the collegiate level. The proposed math camp is a
prototype program which will be replicated nationwide in both urban and rural
areas, and will be used to leverage 10 additional multi-tribe summer math camps
during the next three years.
