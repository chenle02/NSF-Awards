9304526 Wolber It is proposed to determine the x-ray crystal structures of a
homeodomain heterodimer, a1/alpha2, bound to DNA and of a mutant alpha2
homeodomain bound to DNA. Obtaining high quality crystals is the essential first
step in determining an atomic structure using x-ray crystallography. Since there
are no previous examples of crystals of multiprotein complexes bound to DNA, the
results of this work are certain to be of relevance to future studies of other
DNA-protein ternary complexes. %%% An important feature of gene regulation in
eukaryotes is the central role played by multiprotein complexes that bind DNA
and control mRNA transcription. The proposed studies will yield an atomic level
picture of one such protein-DNA complex, that involving the a1/alpha2 protein
complex and DNA. The insights gained from the structure of this ternary complex
as well as that of a mutant alpha2 protein bound to DNA, will be of great
significance to an understanding of how all members of the homeodomain family
regulate gene expression. ***
