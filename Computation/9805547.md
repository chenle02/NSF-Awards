DMS 9805547 Matthias K. Gobbert Computational Methods for the Simulation of
Chemical Vapor Deposition on Rough Surfaces Abstract: In chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) processes a mixture of reacting gases is applied to the surface
of a semiconductor wafer in the reaction chamber of a chemical reactor. A thin
film of material is formed on the surface via surface reactions with the surface
material. The wafer surface contains small trenches and holes, collectively
referred to as features, for interconnect lines, transistor gates, etc., thus
making the surface rough. Currently, reactor scale models (RSM) based on the
Navier-Stokes equations capture the flow of the reacting gases throughout the
entire reactor chamber with a typical dimension of 10 centimeters, and feature
scale models (FSM) based on kinetic equations predict the film growth profile
inside a single feature with a typical dimension of 1 micrometer. Due to the
extreme difference of length scales, an integrated process model spanning all
length scales of interest is best obtained by introducing a mesoscopic scale
model (MSM) with typical dimension on the order of 1 millimeter. This project
will develop the mathematical model and computational methods for the
appropriate kinetic equations in the low pressure regime on this scale. This
project is part of an effort at modeling the manufacturing processes of computer
chips. Computers are already and will continue to be one of the most important
tools of our economy and technology. There is a trend towards more specialized
computer chips to be produced in smaller numbers, for instance for specific
applications in space exploration or defense systems. But prototype runs
necessary to test the manufacturing processes use expensive chemicals and
produce hazardous exhaust gases, which need to be treated before releasing them
to the environment. For these reasons, interest in simulating the manufacturing
processes on all scales from individual device to fa ctory floor has been
increasing. This project will contribute to the development of appropriate
models as well as better numerical techniques for the process of chemical vapor
deposition, one of the crucial production steps for computer chips. In this
process, a thin layer of material is deposited to form either the electrical
lines or the electronic devices that make up the computer chip in the final
product.
