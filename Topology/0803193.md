Abstract

Award: DMS-0803193 Principal Investigator: Yongbin Ruan

During the past twenty years, there has been a great deal of interaction between
mathematics and physics. An important area of this interaction involves the
theory of Gromov-Witten invariants. In physics, it counts the instantons
corrections of Calabi-Yau space. In mathematics, it provides important
invariants for algebraic and symplectic geometry. Inspired by both mathematics
and physics, Gromov-Witten theory has been established in a variety of
situations such as relative Gromov-Witten theory and orbifold Gromov-Witten
theory. Each of them is an integral part of the big picture and they have been
essential for a complete understanding of Gromov-Witten theory. This proposal
seeks to advance Gromov-Witten theory in two directions; (i) expanding Gromov-
Witten theory to the Landau-Ginzburg/singularities model and developing it as an
effective computational tool for ordinary Gromov-Witten theory; (ii) applying
Gromov-Witten theory to study symplectic birational geometry.

Mathematics is always an important tool and language in our understanding of the
structure of the universe we live in. In the string theoretic model of the
universe, modern mathematical subjects such as geometry and topology play an
ever bigger role. In particular, Gromov-Witten invariants enter these models as
important physical quantities called instanton corrections. This project will
improve our ability to calculate instanton corrections and hence enhance our
understanding of the possible structure of the universe.
