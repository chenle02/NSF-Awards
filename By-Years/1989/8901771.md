This research concerns mathematical questions relating to models for phase
change, especially phase separation. The existing models for phase separation
are the Cahn-Hilliard equation (for a binary alloy) and the phase field
equations (for a pure material with latent heat). The mathematical issues relate
to the initial phase separation events and the subsequent coarsening of the
material. Also, the research will include a study of the connections between
different stationary states and, in one case, the motion of internal layers,
characteristic of the later stages of coarsening. The research is in the general
area of applied mathematics and in the specific area mathematical models for the
dynamics of phase changes. The project supports a group effort of four
researchers.
