Drs. Givnish and Sytsma of the University of Wisconsin are studying the
evolutionary history of species of the genus Brocchinia of the pineapple family,
Bromeliaceae. This group of plants is of scientific interest because they are
considered primitive members of the family and may be transitional to advanced
epiphytic forms, because they are native to the most ancient part of South
America, the Guyana Shield, and because they have evolved a remarkable range of
means for capturing mineral nutrients including carnivory, symbiotic nitrogen
fixation, and feeding by ants. The investigators will collect specimens of the
estimated 21 species of the genus in Venezuela, Brazil, and Colombia. They will
assess genomic relationships among species through analysis of chloroplast DNA.
Comparison of these results with study of floral and vegetative traits will
permit evaluation of the reliability of traditional anatomical characters in
taxonomic classifications. The goal of the research is to understand how the
species evolved, how they have adpated to conditions of extreme soil
infertility, and how they have dispersed through geological time across the
northern range of South America.
