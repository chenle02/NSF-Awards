This project attacks the problem of how to help those in states and districts
understand and use data accurately and effectively. The project uses a multi-
dimensional approach to achieve three goals. It: (1) targets training for 300
mathematics and science education reform leaders, (2) creates a national cadre
of 50 data facilitators; and (3) provides intensive implementation support in
four sites to build the knowledge base about the conditions that support the
effective and collaborative use of data to guide educational improvement.

The project builds on the publication "Using Data/Getting Results," developed by
TERC, and the materials synthesized in this publication will inform the
workshops that the project implements. Professional development activities will
be carried out by WestEd, and the Goodman Research Group will conduct the
summative evaluation.

There are partnerships with the Eisenhower Consortia, TIMSS-R Benchmarking
jurisdictions, and NSF-funded systemic initiatives, including local systemic
change projects, and dissemination and implementation sites who will work with
this project.
