This Phase II SBIR proposal requests support for the development of a neural
network system and accompanying data analysis software for real.time analysis of
flow cytometer data. The prototype system developed during Phase I is capable of
analyzing data for about 85 cells per second. The system will be able to
recognize various cell types and can be trained to identify new or unknown
cells. Development of such a system is greatly needed in the oceanographic
community and, if successful, may expand the market for flow cytometry analysis
to many other fields. Other potential applications for this system include
monitoring toxic phytoplankton blooms for aquaculture farms and analyzing human
cells for medical purposes.
