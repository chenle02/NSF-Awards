9413935 Readhead This project supports the development and construction of a
research instrument -- the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) -- to study the cosmic
microwave background radiation on angular scales from 2'-20' with sensitivity
Trms/T = 2 x 10-6. The CBI is a four element interferometer operating at 28 GHz
- 36 GHz. Each element has a complement of three primary reflectors, of sizes
0.75 m, 1.5 m and 3 m, which will be selected according to the angular scale to
be imaged. The instrument operates on a 16 m x 16 m "optical bench" on which the
elements can be placed in a wide variety of configurations. The intermediate
frequency and local oscillator signals are distributed via optical fibres. The
CBI will make images of the cosmic microwave background radiation and hence
enable determination of the spectrum of mass fluctuations on scales of 2 x 1012
solar mass to 2 x 1015 solar mass. This will provide foundation for theories of
the formation of structure in the universe, and could provide a link between
quantum fluctuations in the very early universe and the largest structures
known. In addition, the CBI will be capable of making observations of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies, and will allow us to carry
out detailed studies of the hot gas in clusters when used in combination with
high resolution X-ray observations. The CBI will also be a tool for the study of
diffuse galactic foreground emission. ***
