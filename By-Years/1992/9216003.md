This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of organic electrochemistry. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Miller and his students will synthesize various
linear and helical polyacenes containing two or more electrophores, monodisperse
thiophene oligomers, and polyelectrophores. They will then study the redox
chemistry of these entities and the resulting ion radicals and poly-ions. These
radical ion and poly-ion species will be investigated with particular emphasis
on understanding electron localization in conjugated systems and the effects of
local ordering on the aggregate electronic and chiroptical properties of these
substances. This research builds upon accomplishments of the Miller group under
the aegis of NSF grant CHE-8717540. %%% Results from this research project will
extend current understanding of electron delocalization and contribute
significantly to the developing area of molecular materials. Additionally, new
infrared and near-infrared dyes suitable for use in lasers could evolve directly
from this work.
