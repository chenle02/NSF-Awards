ABSTRACT OPP 9629992 Maschner, Hoffman This dissertation grant is for support
of an archaeological project on Unimak Island in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.
The goal is to illuminate the socio-economic organization of a complex hunter-
gatherer village. The site consists of some nine semi-subterranean houses.
Preservation at the site is excellent and this site is ideal for archaeological
study in this little known region. Ethnohistorical and archaeological data
suggest that early contact-period Aleut society was socially and politically
complex. There were numerous ranked societies, permanent communal houses,
intensive warfare and inter-regional exchange networks. The relationships
between rank, economic organization, and the corporate group will be
investigated through the excavation of these multi-family houses and analysis of
artifacts, features and food refuse.
