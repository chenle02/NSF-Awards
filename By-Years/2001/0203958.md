EIA-0203958 Anupam Joshi University of Maryland-Baltimore County Agent Oriented
Approaches to a Ubiquitous Grid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the level of computing
and networking hardware we will see dramatic changes in the next few years.
Computing will become pervasive. These developments will lead to wireless
networks that will scale all the way from ad hoc body area networks to satellite
WANs, and link together supercomputers, "palmstations" and embededded sensors
&amp; controllers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given this scenario, our proposed
research will seek to extend the computational grid by making it ubiquitous and
pervasive. In particular, we will develop agent based runtime systems where each
component is autonomous, articulate, social and adaptive. Such a system will
seamlessly partition computation across elements of the grid ranging from
palmtops to supercomputers. Issues that we will investigate include (i)
Component/Service Discovery, (ii) Dynamic Composition of components, and (iii)
computation partition across highly asymmetric and heterogeneous
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
