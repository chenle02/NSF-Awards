This award provides support for 10 undergraduate students to engage in a summer
research experience at the University of California, Davis Center for
Biophotonics Science and Technology (CBST), an NSF-funded Science and Technology
Center. The students will have a unique opportunity at the Center to engage in
research in bio-imaging, biomaterials, medical devices, and sensors and assays.
Engineering students as well as students from a broad range of other disciplines
will be recruited and shown the advantages of interdisciplinary research.
Students will be trained in laboratory "best practices" including research
notebook documentation, inquiry methods, publication, and intellectual property
rights and responsibilities. Ten students will be recruited to participate in
biophotonics research for twelve weeks in the summer. This program will serve to
encourage undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and thus
impact the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent
residents engaged in research-related careers. It is also anticipated that this
program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to have broader
participation in the research enterprise of citizens and permanent residents
from demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in science and
engineering.
