The glacial-interglacial history of tropical climate is controversial. The
record from marine sediments in the tropics suggests that there has been little
change in atmospheric temperature in these regions. On the other hand the
climate record from tropical highlands documents that snowlines, glaciers and
treelines were all at lower elevation during the last glaciation. These
elevation changes translate into 5 to 6 degree lower surface temperatures in the
glacial tropics. The discrepancies may be resolved with better paleoclimate
proxies for lowland tropical locations. Unfortunately it is difficult to work on
tropical samples because some traditional paleoclimate indices, like tree rings,
are not related to tropical climate in a simple way. This proposal suggests an
alternative methodology which may provide paleoclimate records on the basis of
wood anatomy. The basis for the methodology is that wood porosity will vary as a
function of climate. The proposal requests support to test the theory in a study
area along the western coast of Costa Rica. Although it is a high risk proposal,
it is important because it may provide a new, reliable method for reconstructing
climate in tropical locales.
