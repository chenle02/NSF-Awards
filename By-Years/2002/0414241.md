Maria Szczesniak-Bryant of Oakland University is supported by the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program for work involving ab initio studies of
intermolecular forces in clusters of open-shell moieties. Three classes of
chemically interesting systems are being examined, including pre-reactive
complexes,clusters and complexes of transition metals with He. The work is being
carried out in collaboration with co-PI Grzegorz Chalasinski, of the University
of Warsaw in Poland, who also holds an appointment as Visiting Professor at
Oakland. Broader impacts expected from theis work is expected in the industrial
control of chemical reactions, in nanotechnology through the study of metallic
clusters and, possibly, in long-term effects on the development of quantum
computing devices. Other broader impacts are occurring through the extensive
work of the PI with undergraduates at Oakland University.
