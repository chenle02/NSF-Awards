The Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University will purchase
equipment for Auger Electron Spectroscopy and photoluminescence experiments. The
goal of the research supported by the equipment is to grow new semiconductor
materials which may be useful for integrating light-emitting elements on
conventional integrated circuits. The materials under investigation are alloys
and multiple layer structures of silicon and germanium, the layers of which may
be only one atomic layer thick. The layers will be grown using gas sources and a
rapid heating process that is amenable to large scale manufacturing. A process
to repeatedly grow single atomic layers in a self-limiting fashion will also be
investigated.
