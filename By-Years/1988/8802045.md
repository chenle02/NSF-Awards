Dr. Jackson and his associates plan studies on mechanisms of acid-base, ionic,
and metabolic regulation in reptiles and mammals. The reptile studies derive
from past observations on the extraordinary anoxic tolerance of the freshwater
turtle, Chrysemys picta bellii. Three directions will be pursued. First, the
increase in plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), that have
been recenty observed when turtles are anoxic and/or acidotic, will be further
documented and its functional significance and possible contribution to this
animal's anoxic tolerance will be investigated. Second, the marked increase in
plasma calcium concentration in turtles during anoxia leads us to a broad study
of calcium kinetics and hormonal regulation of calcium metabolism in this
species. He plans to compare the responses of the turtle to another reptile that
lacks the turtle's mineral-rich shell. Third, because his recent results have
failed to reveal a correlation between blood acidosis and anoxic tolerance or
anaerobic metabolism he will investigate intracellular pH and metabolite control
of selected tissues during various types of anoxic and acidotic conditions. The
hypothesis presented in this project, that cellular acidosis depresses energy
metabolism, relates to the final proposed project on the heterothermic bat,
Eptesicus fuscus. Preliminary data suggest a dual pH control strategy in this
species during torpor at 20 degrees centigrade: alphastat in the summer, pH-
stat in the winter. The principal investigator's objective is to verify this
observation in both blood and cells and evaluate its relevance to energy
conservation of torpid bats. Overall, the goal is an understanding of the
mechanisms regulating hypometabolic states.
