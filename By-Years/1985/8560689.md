This research deals with an area of particular importance to lightwave
technology; that of convenient sources of light which can be conveniently tuned
from one color to another. This effort relates to the growth of crystals which
will do this in an efficient manner when illuminated by a laser with only one
possible color. This crystal (urea) has thus far only been successfully grown at
Cornell University and it would be an important development to have such
crystals available at a reasonable price.
