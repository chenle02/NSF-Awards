The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Philip P. Garner, of the
Department of Chemistry of Case Western Reserve University, in his studies of
the development of a new class of recyclable chiral auxiliaries for asymmetric
synthesis with chiral heteroalkyl radicals. Prototype hydroxyalkyl radical
equivalents contain a chiral acetal group derived from either carbohydrates or
terpenes. General methods, including radical translocation, for the formation of
chiral acetaloxyalkyl radicals are under development for the preparation of
these materials. Systematic variation of the auxiliary structure, coupled with
ab initio transition state structure modeling, addresses the nature of the
interactions responsible for asymmetric induction and facilitates their
optimization. Both inter- and intramolecular variants of atom/group transfer
reactions as well as additions to carbon-carbon double bonds are explored, as is
methodology to permit the efficient removal and reuse of the chiral auxiliaries.
Bidirectional and iterative versions of asymmetric `radical aldol` reactions
promise stereocontrolled access to 1,3-polyols. In contrast to the often well-
defined chemistry of compounds containing even numbers of electrons, compounds
containing an unpaired electron (radicals) are often so reactive that their
reaction chemistry is difficult to harness. Lack of reaction control is a
particular problem in the attempted synthesis via radicals of compounds
displaying the property of chirality, wherein a molecule differs from another in
the same way a right hand differs from a left. With the support of the Organic
Synthesis Program, Professor Philip P. Garner, of the Department of Chemistry of
Case Western Reserve University, is developing chemical approaches which allow
the exploitation of the intrinsic reactivity of radicals while maintaining a
high level of control over the chirality of the resulting products. These
approaches offer new routes for the synthesis of biologically active compounds,
which are often chiral.
