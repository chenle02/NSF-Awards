9505615 Chandler There is a long standing need for accurate calculations of
nuclear reaction probabilities for reactions resulting in three or more final
nuclear fragments (breakup reactions). The authors propose analytical and
numerical studies of breakup reactions using, (1) their recently derived
equations, and (2) a proposed extension of the coupled- reactions-channel
method. The Proposed research will also be useful for other fields (such as
atomic, molecular, and surface physics) in which breakup reactions are
important. ***
