9451845 O de Sa This project creates a new course to provide integrated training
in the theory and practice of Molecular Evolution to science majors using a
strong "hands-on" approach. Students select and carry on experiments involving a
wide range of molecular techniques. The class format emphasizes two components:
Inquiry and "Know-how." The first emphasizes exercises to develop communication
and critical thinking skills through evaluation and analysis of data,
experimental designs, and written assignments. The second component focuses on
four key approaches to generate productive and Ph.D. bound science graduates:
Collaborative Inquiry: Student teams learn to use different molecular
methodologies by pursuing their own experiments; Core Molecular Methodologies:
Students learn the applications and advantages of each molecular technique and
acquire the needed technological competence; Critical Thinking: The experimental
data obtained provides an excellent opportunity for students to critically
analyze the experimental designs and to develop their own research questions and
proposals; Communication: Students interpret and explain their experimental
results, which reinforces the development of their communication skills. The new
RC24 Superspeed centrifuge enables the students to carry out many of the steps
necessary for manipulating genes and vectors for cloning purposes.
