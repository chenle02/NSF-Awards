This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro for the renovation and repair of Eberhart Building which houses
animal care facilities and the biological and behavioral sciences research and
research training activities utilizing these facilities. This building was
constructed in 1971 and expanded by means of an addition in 1977. The ARFMP
grant of $285,000 and $286,200 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be
used to modernize these research and research training facilities thus
accommodating a carefully planned increase in the research and research training
activities taking place in Eberhart and helping to achieve the important goal of
centralization of such facilities among the members of the Consolidated
University of North Carolina. This project, addressing the need to improve the
research infrastructure by providing better sanitation and security, will
include upgrading of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), and
modification of the floor plan to add a rack washer, fume hoods, and new animal
housing rooms. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by
providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of graduate and undergraduate students. Students trained in these
laboratories, where high standards of animal care are maintained, will bring to
their research and clinical careers an appreciation for procedures which meet
national standards of practice and accreditation.
