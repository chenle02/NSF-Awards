Previous research has demonstrated a new microwave ring resonator based on
guided magnetostatic surface waves, which are guided around a closed circular
path using a nonuniform in-plane magnetic bias field. This research extends the
investigation to examining a rotation rate sensor, or tachometer. In such an
application, the transducers remain stationary while the ferrite film supporting
the waves is rotated. The rotation rate is determined from the additional phase
shift of the waves caused by the motion of the medium. Such a tachometer could,
in principle, exhibit a response time as short as several hundred nanoseconds.
The ability to make virtually instantaneous rotation rate measurements would
contribute to the stability and speed of many control systems used with
industrial processes and robotics. The research has both the experimental
portion and theoretical studies of magnetostatic waves in moving media.
