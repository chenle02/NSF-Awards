Microbial processing of marine particulate organic carbon

Microbes play important roles in the cycling of carbon through our biosphere and
thus their activity has profound implications for atmospheric carbon dioxide
levels and climate change. The biological pump is a globally significant process
in which atmospheric CO2 is transferred to the deep-sea in the form of
particulate organic carbon (POC). The bulk of deep-sea metabolism is particle-
associated and yet our knowledge of how microbial composition and activity
combine to regulate the transformation of POC is limited. Microbial blooms act
to stimulate pulses of POC export and thus serve as excellent case studies for
examining the roles of free-living and particle-attached microbes in the deep-
sea carbon cycle. This study will be conducted in the North Pacific Subtropical
Gyre, which has recurring summer blooms, using new molecular techniques that
enable the simultaneous examination of taxonomic composition, gene content, and
gene expression (metagenomics and metatranscriptomics).

The scientific training objectives of this study are to receive training in
metatranscriptomic and metagenomic analysis and gain field experience in
oceanographic sampling and deployments. Professional development will be
provided by a Professional Development Training program sponsored by the Center
for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE). The broader impacts
of the proposed research will be facilitated by C-MORE, which will enable the
broad dissemination of scientific findings to the wider community and promote
K-12 education through the translation of scientific findings into age-
appropriate science kits. Finally, this study will broaden participation of
underrepresented ethnic groups by increasing the representation of Hispanic
women in biology.
