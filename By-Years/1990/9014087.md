This project will study qualitative properties of nonlinear dynamical systems,
with an emphasis on the following areas: (1) geometric theory of singularly
perturbed differential equations, both finite and infinite dimensional; (2)
differential delay equations arising in various areas (physiology,
optics,biology) of science; and (3) dynamical systems exhibiting monotone and
gradient-like behavior. In all these areas the focus will be on global
structures such as attractors, periodic orbits, gradient structures and
homo/heteroclinic orbits, and bifurcations of these structures.
