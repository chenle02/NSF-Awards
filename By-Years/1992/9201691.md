This award will support a sidescan sonar and marine geophysical survey of the
western Woodlark Basin to study the structural and volcanic processes, and the
dynamics of the upper mantle that are associated with the splitting of
continents. The lateral variation from continental rifting to seafloor spreading
within the Woodlark Basin makes it an ideal area to investigate the active
process of rifting and spreading center propagation into a continent. Previous
detailed seismic reflection work in the area will provide excellent control on
the deeper expression of the rifting process and will be integrated with results
from the present project. The results of this study will provide necessary site
survey data with which to plan drilling in the Woodlark Basin.
