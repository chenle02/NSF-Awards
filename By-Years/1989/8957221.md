The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is supporting Professor Myers in the
development and application of optical spectroscopic methods for studying a
variety of fast photochemical reactions and for probing molecular dynamics in
condensed phases. This research is supported by a Presidential Young
Investigator Award. Ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy is being used to
measure solvent-induced spectral broadening and extract information on the range
of microscopically different environments that occur in liquids, as well as the
time scales on which these environments interconvert. Information will also be
obtained on the dynamics of activated barrier crossings and electron tranfers.
Complementary pump-probe time-resolved experiments on the picosecond and
subpicosecond time scales will be used to study evolution of excited systems on
time scales longer than is accessible with the resonance Raman probe.
