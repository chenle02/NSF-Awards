The Field Laboratory Air Transportable Systems (FLATS) program consists of
three phases. The first Phase will evaluate the needs (present and future) of
scientists who wish to engage in research in areas remote from existing fixed
science facilities in Antarctica. The second Phase consists of study and
evaluation of existing transpotable modules that could support such scientific
investigations. Such transportable facilities may be presently be in use in
government or private industry or may be described in published information on
proposed structures (for example, in proposals for habitats to support space-
based research and colonization). An option of a third Phase would allow for the
creation of uniquely designed modules for the U.S. Antarctic Program if adequate
existing designs cannot be found. During the course of negotiation with the
contractor, it was determined that Phase I would be funded with FY 1988 funds;
Phase II would come out of FY 1989 funds. Funding of FY III will be contingent
on the results of the initial two Phases.
