This project will continue work on shoshonitic magmas from northernmost Mariana
arc to test hypothesis that the enrichments result from the unroofing of
metasomatically enriched mantle as a consequence of the northward propagation of
the Mariana Trough. The overall objective of this project is to better
understand arc magmatism. In particular, the goals are to determine: (1) the
compositions of parental lavas in shoshonitic province--by examining
representative lavas from selected volcanoes; (2) the spatial distribution of
the source of enriched arc magmatism--by analyses of cross-chain seamount lavas;
(3) the temporal distribution of shoshonites--by studying volcanic rocks from
remnant and frontal arcs. %%% The investigators have obtained a very unusual
suite of samples from a volcanic arc. The analyses that will be carried out in
this project should address a number of question related to arc magmatism. The
most important of these are the composition and early evolution of arc
volcanoes. This question is important because of the possible role of arcs in
the formation of continental crust.
