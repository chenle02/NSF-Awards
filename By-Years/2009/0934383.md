This award id funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The proposal requests a five rear renewal of NSF funding for
the SDSMT, USC and BYU sites of the Center for Friction Stir Processing (CFSP).
The Center, comprised of these three sites, was established in 2204; and
currently has two additional sites (Wichita State University and Missouri
University of Science and Technology) who joined later. The lead institution is
SDSMT. The main vision of CFSP is to provide the forum for industry/university
cooperative research on the development, validation, and industrial
implementation of the emerging solid-state materials joining and processing
technologies known as Friction Stir Welding and Friction Stir Processing.

CFSP continues to perform basic and applied research programs that address the
implementation needs of the Center's industrial and government sponsors. The
specific research areas include: Friction Sir Joining (FSJ), Friction Stir
Processing (FSP), friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW), Friction Stir Post-
Processing, Friction Stir Structural Designs and Analysis, Friction Stir
Intelligent Controllers and Efficient Tooling, and Friction Stir Cost Benefits
Analysis. The Center has numerous publications in archival journals and
conference proceedings, and notable commercial successes have also resulted from
the Center.

The broader impacts on the community are strongly built into the proposal
through university, local, regional, national and international participation in
the center activities. The membership of the Center is derived at a national and
international level. In addition several teaming arrangements have already been
established between the participating universities and local (Native American)
colleges and community technical schools for the purpose of technology transfer
and collaborative educational opportunities. Each CFSP site has supported
outside activities to promote educational opportunities and to increase
awareness of FSW in the world.
