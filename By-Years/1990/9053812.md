The coalition includes seven institutions (the City College of New York, Howard
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Maryland,
Morgan State University, Pennsylvania State University, and University of
Washington) and has a twofold gold: 1) to increase the quality of U.S.
engineering education and to increase the number of engineering graduates at all
levels, especially among women and underrepresented minorities, 2) to increase
the effectiveness of engineering education, fostering a curriculum renewal that
prepares students for life-long productive careers. Central to the realization
of these goals is the integration, throughout the curriculum, of design, broadly
conceived -- that is, of engineering design in all its diversity, from technical
to social dimensions -- and the development of programs to attract and retain
women and underrepresented minorities in engineering. The grantee provides funds
for this project that are more than an equal match for the NSF award.
