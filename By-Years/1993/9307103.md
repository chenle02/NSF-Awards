9307103 Basinska-Lewin This is a proposal to study ionospheric signatures of the
plasma sheet boundary layer and reconnection processes in the distant
magnetotail. The main objective is to advance the understanding of physical
processes occurring in regions of the magnetosphere that map near the poleward
boundary of the evening aurora. The study will be accomplished through a
comparison of model predictions with incoherent scatter radar data measured from
the ground, in conjunction with field and particle measurements from a low
altitude satellite crossing the topside ionosphere above the radar's field of
view. Results of this research will be used to specify optimal instrumental
modes for a future coordinated ground campaign. ***
