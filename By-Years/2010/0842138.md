The ability of an individual to discriminate between self and non/self is called
allorecognition, and is found throughout the animal kingdom. This immunological
recognition process is controlled by incredibly diverse molecules, and
individual animals have nearly unique combinations of these, essentially making
an individual signature. The best example of this is tissue transplantation:
successful transplantation depends on a match of these signatures between donor
and recipient, or the tissue will be rejected as being foreign. The molecules
responsible are also thought to control other processes, for example the ability
to determine the relatedness of another individual. What is not understood is
how these molecules can be so varied: the observed diversity is 10 to 100-fold
higher than what evolutionary mathematical models predict. Equally important is
how this diversity is recognized and acted upon. This proposal focuses on
understanding the evolutionary forces which underlie the ability to create,
maintain and respond to this genetic diversity. Botryllus schlosseri, is a
marine animal whose well studied allorecognition reaction occurs rapidly and can
be easily studied. The investigators have recently identified the molecules
which underlie this process. Given its convenient life-history traits, coupled
with results from other investigators, the investigators can now begin to
characterize the events involved with creating and maintaining this genetic
diversity of this organism. This includes describing the diversity within and
among natural populations, which will lead to a clearer understanding of the
evolutionary processes responsible. B. schlosseri also has behavioral responses
thought to be controlled by these molecules, which will also be directly tested.
&lt;br/&gt;The basic appeal of these studies and the straightforward methodology
attract numerous undergraduate and high school students (many from under-
represented groups), and is incorporated into independent research projects
every spring and summer.&lt;br/&gt;
