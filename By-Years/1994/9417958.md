9417958 Liou This project will study the emplacement mechanisms of ultrahigh-
pressure rocks that have been recently discovered in the Dabie Mountains in
China. These eclogitic rocks contain minerals that indicate extremely deep
burial, and the processes by which they were uplifted to the surface are
unknown. The project will attempt to identify the strain history and deformation
rates along major faults that bound the eclogitic rocks. Thermobarometry,
metamorphic phase relations, and geochronology of the rocks within and on either
side of the deformation zones will be used to assess the temperatures and
pressures during deformation and the magnitude and timing of vertical
displacement. This project will be the first study of the tectonic history of
these ultrahigh-pressure rocks. The results will provide an understanding of the
physical processes operative in the deepest levels of collisional orogens, and
will illuminate the linkage among deep and shallow levels to tectonism.
