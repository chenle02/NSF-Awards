This project concerns a combined theoretical and experimental study of heat
transfer in enclosures. The problem is of fundamental importance in building
energy conservation devices and in manufacturing seminconductor crystals. The
emphasis will be on the characterization of the reoutes to turbulence and the
thre-dimensional fluid motion. Experiments will be conducted with low Prandtl
number fluids. The theoretical study will be carried out by solving the
governing equations by a pseudo-spectral method.
