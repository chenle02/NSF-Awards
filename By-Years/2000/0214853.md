This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to examine
Multi Photon Detection (MPD) of biological warfare agents using a panel of MPD
enhanced immunoassays. MPD based techniques promise to deliver: (1) parallel
detection of all biological warfare agents, (2) improved sensitivity of biotoxin
detection, leading to fewer false positives and negatives, (3) more rapid
results, (4) lower cost per assay, and (5) greater ease of use. This Phase I
project has the following specific objectives : (1) production of recombinant
fragments of biotoxins and development of antibodies, (2) development and
characterization of antibodies for biotoxins, including botulism, tetanus and
anthrax, (3) development of IA/MPD (MPD enhanced immunoassay) for these three
biotoxins and comparison of sensitivity with the prior art, mainly ELISA, and
(4) further assay optimization.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of homeland security.
