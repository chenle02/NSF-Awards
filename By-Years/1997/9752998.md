9752998 Ledley The ENSO cycle is the largest recognized source of interannual
climate variability on a global scale. Recent work has shown that there is a
statistically significant relationship between the ENSO signal observed in the
tropical Pacific Ocean and the sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration
in the Ross Sea of Antarctica. This work will be extended in this program in
which we will develop a true student-scientist partnership between high school
students and the PI to investigate the extent to which the ENSO affects the
climate of the polar oceans. In the first phase of the project students will be
introduced to the various components of the Earth system and the phenomena they
will be investigating. In the second phase students will begin by finding data
about the climate in the polar oceans. They will, with the PI, determine the
quality of the data and its appropriateness for use in the study. Data will be
examined spatially and spatially averaged over the polar oceans to produce time
series. The spatial analysis will be used to look for patterns of change, and
the time series will be compared to the ENSO record to determine the
relationships that exist between the ENSO record and the climate of the polar
ocean regions.
