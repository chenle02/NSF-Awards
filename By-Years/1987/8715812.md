This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of semiconductor surface chemistry. This research program will
investigate the reactivity of selected hydride and alkylmetal molecules with
single crystal surfaces of silicon and gallium arsenide. The goals are to gain
insight into patterns of surface reactivity for this technologically important
class of systems and to obtain quantitative data on the kinetics of elementary
reactions. The research addresses a number of fundamental issues related to the
production of technologically important compound semiconductors such as gallium
arsenide. Semicondutor surface chemistry is an important area from both a
scientific and a technological viewpoint. However, basic information on
chemistry occurring on semiconductor surfaces is severely lacking. The results
of this research will be very useful.
