A plasma consists of a collection of charged particles-and has many properties
not found in the more usual gases of neutral atoms and molecules. In particular,
plasmas are affected directly by electric and magnetic fields, and these
interactions form a basic tool for plasma confinement and study. Usually,
plasmas have equal numbers of charged particles of both signs, and thus are
overall electrically neutral. In the work supported here a unique type of plasma
is formed and studied: one consisting of particles (electrons) all of one sign
of electric charge. Such a plasma is particularly tractable experimentally, and
important aspects of its behavior can be isolated and measured free of
conflicting effects. One unique feature of such pure-electron plasmas is that
when cooled it is predicted to become first a liquid and then a solid. These
novel properties will be investigated.
