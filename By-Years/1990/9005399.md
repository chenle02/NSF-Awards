This project supports a cultural anthropologist examining the nature of the
peasant family in early modern Japan (1600-1868). Using a variety of historic
demographic data, surveys of memorial tablets and other tombstones, the
investigator will try to establish when the "stem" family system became
prevalent in Japan. This research is important because the history of Japan
since the Seventeenth Century has been one of impressive economic and political
growth. This growth has been supported by peasant agriculture, and understanding
just how these sector of society functioned will help us explain the pattern of
Japanese history, and thus perhaps smooth the course of development for other,
less developed nations.
