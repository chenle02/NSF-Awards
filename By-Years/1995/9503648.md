The goals of this research are to design fast, precise parts feeders and to
improve nonprehensile robotic manipulation. The two goals are closely related. A
good architecture for a parts feeder exploits both parallelism and dynamic
contact, by pipelining fast-acting low-degree of freedom manipulators along the
feeder. Nonprehensile manipulation of objects by humans or animals often
involves dynamic contact in which the object undergoes a series of partial
grasps, shuffled back and forth between various contacts. The key to fast
nonprehensilemanipulation of parts is controlling part motions through moving
and accelerating contacts. This research builds a set of analysis tools that
describe how the motions of accelerating constraints affect the effective forces
felt by the parts being manipulated. These analyses take careful account of
contact and friction, plus any forces already acting on the part, such as
gravity. The resulting tools will allow a planner to produce control algorithms
for the feeder, and thus dynamically reconfigure the feeder as part shapes
change or errors appear. In traditional feeder design, much of the mechanics of
the task has been compiled into hardware, in the form of fixed feeder gates and
orienting shapes. At the other extreme, general purpose robots have suffered
from too much generality and too little reliable software. An important
intermediate architecture consists of a sequence of simple manipulators under
software control. This research will explore feeders using the palm manipulation
paradigm. As parts pass through a feeder, a sequence of low-degree of freedom
devices will orient the parts using nonprehensile dynamic contacts. Since the
configurations and motions of the devices are under software control and since
the devices are easy to program by virtue of having low degrees of freedom, the
feeder should be able to accomodate las t-minute part changes with relative
ease.
