Research on the geochemistries of the major biochemicals will continue by: a).
Isolating different particle classes from sediment mixtures and then determining
the major biochemical components, their microenvironments, and potential
reactivities toward chemical and biological agents. b). Studying the
distribution and bonding of ester-bound phenolic acids in a taxonomic cross
section of nonwoody vascular plant tissues and relating this information to the
diverse compositions and diagenetic patterns typical of these biochemically
complex materials. c). Investigating the growing evidence for a major
polysaccharide component of vascular plant tissues that is not accounted for by
conventional molecular- level analyses.
