In 2005 the investigator, jointly with Janos Pintz and Cem Yildirim introduced a
method that proved for the first time that there exist infinitely often pairs of
prime numbers whose difference is smaller than any fraction of the average
spacing between primes. The method is especially interesting because it
demonstrates that the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions contains
more information on the behavior of primes than had previously been recognized.
In particular, if the primes are well distributed in "thin" arithmetic
progressions then one can prove that there are always pairs of primes with
difference 16 or less. This conditional result shows that the twin prime
conjecture - that there are infinitely many primes differing by 2, is
approachable with this type of information. More recently the PI in joint work
with Yildirim and Pintz and Sid Graham have been working on applying our method
to numbers with a specific number of prime factors, especially numbers which
have exactly two prime factors. The main goal of this project is to further
develop our method to extract the best possible quantitative information on
small gaps between primes, and in addition to investigate applications to other
problems in number theory. The investigator is also interested in questions
related to the use of explicit formulas to study zeros of the Riemann zeta-
function.

This project is concerned with prime numbers, an ancient subject extending back
to the Greeks and up to the present with many important applications in computer
science and cryptography. Despite the simplicity of how they arise, prime
numbers offer some of the most challenging and difficult problems in
mathematics. Many if not most mathematicians judge the most famous and important
unsolved problem in mathematics to be the Riemann Hypothesis, and this is
equivalent to the primes being distributed in a fairly regular distribution.
More generally, the field of number theory has applications throughout
mathematics and fields that make use of mathematics.
