9720485 Haegel The goal of this project is to combine microanalysis optical and
electrical techniques with specially designed planar contact structures to image
transport near contacts and on small semiconductor structures. Quantitative
electron beam induced current (EBIC) and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements
will be made in a scanning electron microscope. These measurements are expected
to reflect spatial distributions and changes under bias of local electric fields
and carrier profiles near the contacts. %%% This is a research enhancement grant
made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
(POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge
at a fundamental level. An important feature of the program is the integration
of research and education through undergraduate student participation in
research. ***
