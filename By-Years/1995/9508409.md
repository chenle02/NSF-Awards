ABSTRACT CTS-9508409 J. W. Hoyt The extension of the traditional dye streak
visualization technique by using a "continous" string composed of shear
thickening and drag reducing constituents will be investigated. The proposed
visualization method has applications in various flows where previous methods
have limitations, such as unsteady flows, multiphase flow, large flow domain
visualizations, turbulent diffusion and mixing. The method will be calibrated
for typical flow situations. Then, various coherent turbulent structures and
flow macrostructures will be investigated, such as flow through multiple
cylinders, flow around a single cylinder near critical Reynolds number, and flow
structures in turbulent boundary layer. The project will be completed in
collaboration and with the help of the University of Bristol, where suitable
experimental facilities are available to the P. I. A special niche of
application of the new method is in the complex flows where the streaklines have
to be visualized. The proposed method provides an alternative to much more
sophisticated and expensive techniques, and has unique features which can be
exploited in various situations. ***
