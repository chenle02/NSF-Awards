This 3-year project is designed to enhance the physical science knowledge base
of 4-9 teachers in South Carolina. The plan is to develop science teacher
leaders by using master science teachers for instruction and mentoring. The
target population will consist of teams of lead teachers from the same school
and school district in order to strengthen communication and cooperation for the
improvement of science education. This proposal is an outgrowth of a previous
NSF grant and a smaller trial project, and seeks to extend them. Some of the
groups co-sponsoring this proposal are an outgrowth of the previous grant, as
are the co- directors. This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement
Program because of its plan to enhance the science teaching of a large number of
upper elementary and middle school teachers Non-NSF cost-sharing is
approximately 38% of the amount requested from NSF.
