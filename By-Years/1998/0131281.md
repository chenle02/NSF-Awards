Structure for Biodiversity Informatics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project
Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mapping for biodiversity informatics requires
information on habitat so that known species&lt;br/&gt;occurrences may be
extrapolated to maps of potential species occurrences. That is, given the
conversion&lt;br/&gt;of known specimen locations into maps, how can we best
predict where additional individuals or&lt;br/&gt;populations of that species
may occur? In the context of landscape ecology, landscape structure -
its&lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional components - is a primary basis for habitat
preferences of bird species. Vegetation&lt;br/&gt;spatial composition,
heterogeneity, variability, and scale are among the variables contributing to
the&lt;br/&gt;horizontal structure, while vegetation height, layering, and
biomass are examples of variables in the&lt;br/&gt;volumetric dimension.
Combined together these variables, and others, describe the real multi-
dimensional&lt;br/&gt;structure of habitat. &lt;br/&gt;
