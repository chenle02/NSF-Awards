Through the use of survey and ethnographic case study methods, and using a
comparative case study approach with two immigrant populations the proposed
research will examine how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) aid
in the attainment of literacy and should result in insights in to how to best
educate these populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train graduate
and undergraduate students and the results will be disseminated in practitioner-
oriented articles, conferences, and a website.
