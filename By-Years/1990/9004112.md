This research is to determine the velocity structure at points along the TACT
(Trans-Alaska Crustal Transect) reflection/ refraction profile, using the
technique of time domain inversion of teleseismic receiver functions. The first
stage will be to use existing data from DWWSSN station COL to determine the
velocity structure beneath the Fairbanks area, which lies in the Tanana-Yukon
terrane and near the transect line. The next stage will be to establish at least
5 seismic stations along the TACT line between Fairbanks and Valdez, Alaska.
These stations, which will utilize State of Alaska microwave facilities, will
collect teleseismic data through the winter of 1990-91 (6-7 months) which can
then be inverted for the velocity structure beneath the individual stations.
