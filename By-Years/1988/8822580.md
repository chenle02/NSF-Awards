Hybrid zones are geographic areas where recently diverged species or subspecies
come into secondary contact and interbreed with varying success. In doing so,
hybrid organisms are produced by the combination of genes that have diverged
evolutionarily, and may therefore function less well than the matings between
members of the same species or subspecies. One important aspect of this genetic
incompatibility is the disruption of development (the growth of an individual
from embryo to adult). This disruption can be manifest by left-right asymmetry
of an individual. Dr. Robert Owen proposes to gather morphological data on left-
right asymmetry of mammals in four different well- studied hybrid zones in order
to determine the correlation between genetic divergence and developmental
disruption. He proposes to use a microcomputer-based image analysis system to
gather skeletal measurements from specimens from which a variety of genetic data
have been gathered in earlier studies. The proposed project will add an
unprecedented body of detailed morphological data to our existing knowledge of
hybrid zones, thereby opening a new window onto the questions of evolutionary
divergence, and the genetic control of development.
