This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of equipment for the
Paleomagnetics Laboratory at the Michigan Technological University. The
University is committed to providing matching funds for the purchase of the
equipment, which includes a spinner magnetometer, alternating field
demagnetizer, and Curie balance. It will be installed in the Department of
Geological Engineering, Geology and Geophysics, and will be used by members of
the Department in research projects to determine the geologic history of
magnetic pole wandering and the effect of low- temperature oxidation on the
magnetization of rocks.
