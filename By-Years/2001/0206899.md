The project is adapting assessment material to improve the design of courses and
to provide formative feedback to students. Using an existing course-based
assessment system, the project is identifying students in need of remediation
based on their performance on specific questions on exams in previous courses.
Each of these questions is linked to specific learning outcomes so that the
remediation becomes very specific. The projects is developing a remediation
program for several Electrical Engineering courses to provide targeted
instruction for these specific needs using approaches matched to the student's
individual learning style. The team also is developing a secure web site to
enable students and advisors to monitor the student's progress. In evaluating
their program, the investigators will compare improvements in the performance of
the students who use the remediation material to a matched control group who do
not. They plan to evaluate the utilization of and the user's reaction to the
web-base remedial material. They plan to describe their results of their study
at appropriate engineering education conferences and to make the material
available on a website and on a CD ROM.
