In order to develop Submerged Floating Tunnel (SFT) Technology within the United
States, a workshop on the topic is planned in conjunction with the North
American Tunneling 2002 Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFT's are structurally
self-contained tunnels, anchored beneath the surface of a deep body of water. In
contrast to conventional tunnels, SFT's are surrounded by water on all sides. By
"floating" the tunnels in location, a number of advantages over conventional
tunnels can be realized. This technology can also provide advantages over
surface methods (e.g. bridges, ferries) of crossing deep water bodies. The
potential locations within the U.S. alone that could benefit from development of
an SFT are numerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other countries have already directed
substantial research efforts toward specific applications of SFT technology. No
similar efforts, however, are underway in the U.S. Recognizing the advantages of
this new technology, and that such tunnels will ultimately be built, it is
important for U.S. researchers and practitioners to develop comparable
expertise. It is also important to begin the process of public education, which
is the first step in generating public support for a new technology such as
this. The proposed workshop will serve as a necessary and significant step in
advancement of this new technology. It will serve as the first U.S. forum to
facilitate exchange of ideas between international experts, the U.S. academic
community and other professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
