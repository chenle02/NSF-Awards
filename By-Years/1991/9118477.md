In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Marsha Lester of the University of Pennsylvania will use various spectroscopic
techniques to characterize the intermolecular potentials of van der Waals
molecules. Stimulated emission pumping and other laser-based techniques will be
used to probe highly excited energy levels of these complexes in order to obtain
a fuller experimental description of the potential energy surface describing
interacting species. The spectroscopy of complexes containing an open-shell
molecule will also be studied for information about collisional processes
involving free radicals. %%% Cluster molecules are the intermediate species
formed when gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or solids. The study of
the structure and properties of clusters is useful in understanding such diverse
phenomena as the processes involved in chemically reactive molecular encounters,
protein folding, or catalytic activity on surfaces. This project aims at more
fully characterizing the forces which govern these sorts of chemical and
physical processes.
