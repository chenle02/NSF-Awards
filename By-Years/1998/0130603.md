This project will support a conference on research on learning technologies and
technology-supported education in Tampa/St. Pete on May 4-6, 2002 and will
support the participation of US researchers at a related Tuebingen conference to
be held in Germany in October 2001. The conference is organized to pair senior
researchers with early career researchers on actual research projects that will
be discussed and refined at the two conferences. The work of the Tampa
conference in 2002 will be a direct extension of the work completed at the
Tuebingen conference. The research will result in papers published in two
special issues of the International Journal of Educational Policy, Research, and
Practice.
