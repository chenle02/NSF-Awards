This research uses methods of mathematics and statistics, in conjunction with
experimental work in two cell biology laboratories, to clarify the first
responses of cells to extracellular "signaling" molecules. Hormones, cytokines,
immune complexes and antigens all initiate cellular responses through
interactions with specific cell surface "receptors." Diverse systems have in
common the two initial events in cell signaling that this project addresses, the
aggregation of cell surface receptors, followed by the phosphorylation of
tyrosine on receptors and non-receptor proteins. The first collaboration
investigates mechanisms and effects of receptor aggregation through the analysis
of molecular point patterns on electron microscope images. The second
collaboration focusses on mechanisms by which aggregated receptors mediate
tyrosine phosphorylation. A proposed model appears to be consistent with
previously obtained data and makes additional testable predictions. Interactive
activities include: teaching a graduate course on "Stochastic Models in Biology
and Chemistry," and organizing special visits of women with active research
programs in Mathematical Biology, Biostatistics, Biophysics, and related
sciences. Activities aimed at fostering interactions of students with the
visitors include preparatory seminars preceding the visits, a student-oriented
talk as part of each visit, and organized discussions between students and
visitors.
