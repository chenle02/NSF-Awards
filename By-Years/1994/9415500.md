9415500 Riedel Funds are provided for the continued operation of the deep- sea
core and dredge samples' repository at Scripps Institution of Oceanography for
three years. These samples are vital to our understanding of the past and
present oceans, climates and events on the continent. Newly acquired cores will
be integrated into the curatorial system and the old cores and dredges will be
continued to be curated and distributed to scientists requesting samples. Data
of cores will be bank with the National Geophysical Data Center where computer
searches will facilitate sample selection by investigators. ***
