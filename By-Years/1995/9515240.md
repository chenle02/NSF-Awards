The focus of this research is the amplification and shaping of quantum
initiation noise by spontaneously initiated Stokes Raman scattering (SRS) in an
optical fiber. Both experimental measurements and numerical modeling will be
performed. Attention will be directed to determining how the initially large
scale fluctuations evolve as well as to the temporal formation and shaping of
the first Stokes pulse by the nonlinear gain. The conditions of sustained
nonlinear interactions. The educational component of this program will provide
the students at this undergraduate institution with both basic knowledge through
their research as well as practical training because of the importance of SRS in
optical signal processing.
