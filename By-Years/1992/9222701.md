Ms. Ann S. Oliver's dissertation research is a comparative field study of
behavioral endocrinology in two species of fish that are simultaneous
hermaphrodites. Spawning behavior depends upon size in one species, which is
serially monogamous, and upon social status in the other species, which is
permanently monogamous. The objective of this project is to complete hormone
analysis necessary to test three hypotheses about the relationships between
behaviors and the absolute levels and relative concentrations of circulating
steroid hormones. Comparison of hormonal correlates of behavior in two species
will allow generalizations about the influence of steroid hormones on
hermaphrodite mating behavior. Analysis of the relationship among aggression,
androgens, and size or social status will clarify the complex interaction of
social and physiological factors regulating hermaphrodite mating systems. Timing
and duration of hormone surges will be compared between species to examine
physiological influences on the daily pattern of egg maturation and time of
spawning. Ms. Oliver's physiological data will provide the basis for future
hormone manipulations critical for testing theoretical concepts about the
evolution and maintenance of hermaphroditism as a stable reproductive strategy.
