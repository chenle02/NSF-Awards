The Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Plant Metabolic
Engineering provides a unique setting for developing multidisciplinary
collaborations needed to unravel the chemical and biochemical diversity of plant
metabolism and advance basic and applied research in plant metabolic
engineering. The 2015 conference will be held July 18-24, 2015 at the Waterville
Valley conference center in New Hampshire. The conference will focus on three
critical areas: new areas of understanding of plant metabolic pathway and their
control; new technologies for modifying metabolism and gene expression in
plants; development of plant metabolic engineering from concept to the field and
marketplace, as exemplified by case studies from industry and academia. The list
of speakers includes leaders in the field of Plant Systems and Synthetic
Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Conference and Seminar is known for its
inclusion of graduate students and postdocs that in the past accounted for 44%
of participants. These junior researchers have many opportunities to interact
with the leading investigators in the field. The Gordon Conference and Seminar
is mindful of the need to be inclusive. Ten female participants (6 as speakers,
4 as discussion leaders) have been confirmed. Additional female participants and
scientists from underrepresented groups will be invited for additional regula
and short talk presentations based on their submitted abstracts. The conference
is widely advertised at organizations such as: the National Organization for
Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers; SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of
Chicanos and Native Americans in Science); American Chemical Society; AAAS
Minority Scientists Network. The meeting location has facilities to provide
access to persons with disabilities and provides for child-care.
