This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Do fungal endosymbionts of grasses
structure community diversity and modify food web dynamics?" Endophytic fungi
form symbioses with grasses and produce toxic alkaloids that reduce herbivory to
their hosts. This research evaluates how grass endophytes modify the diversity
and dynamics of plant, pathogen, and arthropod assemblages and asks how fungal
alkaloid chemistry influences these effects. This investigation will expand our
understanding of how plant-microbe mutualisms influence community dynamics and
biodiversity.
