Abstract The U.S. - Japan Workshop on Bridge Engineering is an annual meeting
between American and Japanese bridge engineers, which is conducted under the
auspices of the U.S. - Japan Panel of Wind and Seismic effects of the UJNR
program. This meeting includes a two-day workshop with technical presentations
of the participants related to recent advantages of bridge engineering and a
study tour of bridge structures and organizations. Ten meetings have been
conducted so far, and all of them have proven to be very fruitful and productive
experience for the participants of both countries. The workshop will be held in
Japan in May 1995, to support the participation of U.S. delegates who will make
technical presentations and participate in the study tour.
