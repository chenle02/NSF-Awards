EIA-0218595&lt;br/&gt;Dimitri V. Nanopoulos&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M Research
Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electromagnetic and informational processes in
biomolecular polymers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the electric dipole
moment and quantum properties of tubulin, microtubules (MTs), microtubule-
associated proteins (MAPs) and cytoskeletal networks immobilized on thin metal
films utilizing surface plasmon resonance and femtosecond laser pulses are being
studied. The goal is to understand the electrical and conjectured quantum
properties of the cytoskeleton and determine whether biomolecular polymers and
specifically tubulin can be used as bits or qubits in the protein-based devices
such as logic gates, nanowires and memory registers in the biological and
quantum computers of the future. Measurements of the electric dipole moment of
tubulin and its dynamics in polymerized and free tubulin, investigate the
formation and propagation of the predicted kink-solitonic electric dipole moment
flip waves and monitor the polymerization and dynamics of MT-MAP networks under
different conditions are being measured. In addition, this research is ideally
suited to test MT-based 'quantum brain' and 'quantum neuron' models predicting
such phenomena as large-scale neuronal quantum coherence and teleportation of
dipole quanta. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
