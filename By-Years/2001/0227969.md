This proposal for a joint EU-US workshop will bring together the active
researchers from the US and European Union who are investigating information and
communication technologies in the home. This workshop is important as scientists
in a number of countries are studying technology in the home, but because of
publication lag times are not aware of each other's results. This workshop will
serve as a forum to address the role of technology in 1) household behavior,
including socialization, time use, and gender differences, 2) social
interaction, including the impact of the Internet on social capital and quality
of relationships, 3) employment and new forms of work, and 4) country
differences in the use and impact of technology in the home. One important
output will be an academic book documenting the current state of the theoretical
and empirical research.&lt;br/&gt;
