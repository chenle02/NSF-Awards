The objective of this work is the analysis and interpretation of radar
observations made during the microburst and Severe Thunderstorm (MIST)
experiment during the summer of 1986. The analysis will emphasize the
meteorological interpretation of polarimetric and dual frequency measurements
made by NCAR's CP-2 radar, together with cognate measurements made by supporting
aircraft and other doppler radars. //
