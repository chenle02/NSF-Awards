This project will make measurements of trace atmospheric gases that are
important to increase our understanding of the annual antarctic ozone hole. The
gases are chlorine monoxide, ozone and nitrous oxide, the first of which is a
unique produce of the destruction of ozone by chlorine. Nitrous oxide is a
valuable tracer of the dynamics of the atmosphere, and such measurements should
be useful in determining the degree of stratospheric subsidence during the polar
winter. The measurements will be made with a millimeter wavelength radio
spectrometer, similar to that which has been used by this same investigator in
McMurdo, Antarctica in previous years. This project is important for
understanding how man-made chemicals, such as the chlorofluorocarbons, can cause
global changes.
