A major goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of the roles
macro- and microstress play in affecting domain structures and various remanent
magnetizations. In addition, the PI will investigate the use of renormalization
group theory to explain the large range of local energy minima states that
individual grains access. Particular attention will be placed on investigating
theory that could have important payoffs in paleomagnetism. For example,
preliminary results of the theory suggest there are important techniques
available by which one can distinguish secondary magnetizations rom a primary
thermal remanent magnetization.
