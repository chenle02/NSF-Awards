This grant supports a conference at the National Bureau of Economic Research in
Cambridge, Massachusetts on November 29-30th on environmental economics. The
meeting has three objectives: (1) to make researchers in fields related to
environmental economics aware of the links between their work and environmental
issues, thereby stimulating research in the area of environmental policy and
global change; (2) to acquaint U.S. economists with the nature of funding
opportunities, both from NSF and from other sources, for research on
environmental policy; (3) to encourage collaborative research by teams of U.S.
and European economists with similar interests. This conference is very timely.
Public interest in environmental issues increased sharply in the late 1980's.
The national and international policy agenda now includes important new
initiatives on air and water pollution, global warming, preservation of the
ozone layer, and the disposal of solid waste. Many of the basic issues in this
area cut across other sub-fields within economics, including public finance,
industrial organization, international economics, and labor economics.
