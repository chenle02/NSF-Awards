This project provides improved laboratory instrumentation to prepare
undergraduate students majoring in the chemical and biological sciences for
careers in areas associated with biotechnology. This project is part of a larger
plan to restructure the curriculum and associated facilities to meet the changes
required in chemical and biological education. The high performance liquid
chromatography system will complement an existing core of analytical instruments
and methods available to students in the laboratory portion of the courses,
Biochemistry and Instrumental Analysis, taken by chemistry and biology majors,
and in the Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research Program in which all
chemical and biological science majors are required to participate. The
availability of HPLC will permit laboratory instruction in HPLC techniques and
will greatly expand the research topics available to students in the area of
biochemistry. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal
match for the NSF award.
