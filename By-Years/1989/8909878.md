Coastal Physical Oceanography (CoPo) has been organized to develop a national
plan for coastal oceanography for the next 1.5 decades. In this project the P.I.
will coordinate and host a series of workshops designed to refine and articulate
the specific scientific objectives, leading to development of an overall program
structure. Coordination with other major programs, federal agencies, and
oceanographic disciplines will continue.
