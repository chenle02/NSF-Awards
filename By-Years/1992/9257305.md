The research plan focuses on evaluation of alternative materials for use as
waste containment barriers, compatibility testing protocol of barrier materials,
and the development of a 2-D, three-phase flow model for heterogeneous material
for use in evaluating the effectiveness of capillary barriers for waste site
remediation and back-calculation of soil hydraulic conductivity values from
field-measured fluxes at existing landfills.
