The National Science Foundation (NSF) is pleased to announce the selection of
Harvard University?s Robert Wood, an Associate Professor of the School of
Engineering and Applied Sciences, to receive its 2012 Alan T. Waterman Award.
Dr. Wood is a core faculty member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically
Inspired Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waterman Award is the National
Science Foundation's (NSF) highest honor. The annual award recognizes
outstanding researchers under the age of 35 in any field of science or
engineering that NSF supports. This is the first year that two awardees have
been selected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a medal, each of this year's
awardees will receive a $1 million grant---twice the amount of last year's award
---over a five-year period for further advanced study in his field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Wood, is founder of the Harvard Microrobotics
Lab, which leverages expertise in microfabrication for the development of
biologically-inspired robots with feature sizes on the micrometer to centimeter
scale. His team?s project to develop robotic flying insects received an NSF
Expeditions in Computing Award in 2009. His other awards include being named to
MIT?s TR35?MIT Technology Review magazine?s annual list of the world?s top 35
innovators under the age of 35, and the 2010 NSF Presidential Early Career Award
For Scientists and Engineers. His research is an intriguing example of the
interplay of biology and engineering.
