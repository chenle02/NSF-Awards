Funding from this award will support the workshop "Graduate Statistics Education
at a Crossroads", to be held November 2-3, 2018 in Alexandria, VA. The workshop
will identify challenges and barriers that limit graduate statisticians from
fully participating in the new era of big data. To address these challenges and
barriers, workshop attendees will craft realizable recommendations for academic
departments and institutions. It is expected that these recommendations will
promote model curricula, pedagogical approaches, and innovative approaches that
have the potential to foster broader engagement with data science and to promote
success of future statisticians in data science research and the workforce more
broadly.

The workshop aligns with the training aspects of Harnessing the Data Revolution,
one of ten big ideas for future NSF investment. More specifically, the workshop
aims to identify an array of data-science related training activities that would
support the statistics community in order that statisticians fully participate
in cutting-edge interdisciplinary data science research. Additional details may

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
