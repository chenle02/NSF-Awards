One of the fundamental principles of the theory of signal and information
processing is the so-called Gabor uncertainty principle, which says that it is
impossible for a signal to be perfectly localized simultaneously in time and in
frequency. Perhaps counterintuitively, it is exactly this uncertainty principle
that allows us to digitize analog signals; that is, to completely recover analog
(continuous) signals that are band-limited, in some sense, from their samples
recorded at (appropriate) discrete set of times. The precise rate at which the
sampling needs to be done to guarantee stable recovery depends crucially on the
band-limited nature of the signal. The main goal of this project is to quantify
this subtle relationship precisely for very general types of restriction on
signal bandwidth. In addition the project provides research training
opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
develop a general operator-theoretic treatment of uncertainty principles, with a
goal of unifying many different forms of the uncertainty principle that appear
in harmonic analysis, and to discover new ones. In view of the advanced
development of harmonic analysis, it is quite surprising that manifestations of
the uncertainty principle are still usually studied one at a time, isolated one
from another. This project aims to systematize these results, further explore
the connections between them, and pave the way for new applications to control
theory, partial differential equations, and other areas of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
