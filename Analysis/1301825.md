The workshop will be organized in partnership with the center of Modelamiento
Matemático (CMM) of the University of Chile in Santiago and will be held Jan.
3-5, 2013 at CMM in Santiago, Chile. The organizers are Matias Courdurier from
the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Jaime Ortega and Axel Osses from
CMM and Gunther Uhlmann from the University of Washington. The focus of the
conference will be on "coupled-physics" or "hybrid" imaging modalities that have
received a lot of attention in recent years due to the great promises they hold
for medical imaging and other fields. By combining two or three different types
of waves (or physical fields) these methods overcome limitations of classical
tomography techniques and deliver otherwise unavailable, potentially life-saving
diagnostic information. Among these methods are the Thermoacoustic Tomography
(TAT), Photo-Acoustic Tomography (PAT), Ultrasound Modulated Optical and
Impedance Tomographies (UMOT, UMEIT), Magneto-Acousto-Electric Tomography (MAET)
and several other modalities combining magnetic fields with ultrasound scanning
of the tissue. Closely related to these methods are so-called combined physics
modalities such as Current Density Imaging and Elastography. Besides medical
imaging there has been also recent interest on coupled-physics inverse methods
in oil exploration in particular on the Seismo-electric effect.

One of the goals of this workshop is to give the participants, in particular
junior mathematicians, the opportunity of learning the state of the art in
research on coupled-physics inverse problems and discuss future directions and
problems. Another goal is to foster the interaction between researchers in
inverse problems in Chile, the US and other countries of Latin America, and to
also have increased interaction between junior and senior researchers in these
fields.
