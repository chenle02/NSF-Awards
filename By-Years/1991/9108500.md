Michael Herman is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies on vibrational relaxation in
liquids. He will apply path-integral Monte Carlo computer simulation techniques
to the calculation of the relaxation rate for vibrational populations of small
molecules in simple solvents. He will continue to refine the methodology for
conditioning of the highly oscillatory integrands which occur in real time
discretized path integrals. In the initial phase of the project only low lying
vibrational excitations of diatomics in simple solvents will be considered.
After sufficient numerical experience has been gained from these systems, he
will consider systems with highly vibrationally excited diatomics and
polyatomics for which the full path integral theory is required. %%% Theoretical
studies of vibrational relaxation in liquids is important in the field of
chemistry because the rate at which molecules gain and lose vibrational energy
influences their rates of chemical reaction, their energy transport properties
and their experimentally observed spectra.
