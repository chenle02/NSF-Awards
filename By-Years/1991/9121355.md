This investigation focuses on diel vertical migration by salps (pelagic
tunicates) in the vicinity of the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station. Salps
are efficient grazers on phytoplankton and other particulates; they are widely
distributed and sometimes occur in dense populations. Several species migrate
vertically, some as far as 800 m, while others are restricted to surface waters.
Recent work in the Subarctic Pacific and near Bermuda has revealed intriguing
new features to these migrations, which do not seem consistent with traditional
theories for the advantages of migration. Salps in the Pacific make shallow
migrations, but stop feeding while at the surface during the night. This
behavior is believed to relate mainly to spawning and fertilization. Recently
salps have been observed to consistently appeared at the surface at different
times of day - morning, afternoon and night. This apparent migration is also
inconsistent with the usual explanations. Dr. Miller and collaborators will
investigate the behavior of this extremely important group of pelagic
herbivores. They will test two, non-exclusive hypotheses for the migratory
patterns observed: 1) migration optimizes feeding at food-rich depths, or
temporally partitions food among spatially co- occurring species; 2) migration
concentrates salps at the surface and synchronizes spawning and fertilization.
The investigations address basic questions of adaptation and ecology in
migrating zooplankton, reproductive physiology of salps, and competition and
niche separation. They are also critical for calculations of the role of grazing
and migration by salps on vertical fluxes of particulate and dissolved
nutrients.
