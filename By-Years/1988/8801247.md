This project is concerned with various aspects of noncommutative ring theory.
The principal investigator will examine the structure of von Neumann regular
rings, differential operator rings, noetherian rings and related rings. The
research on von Neumann regular rings will also involve, via the Grothendieck
group, investigations into the structure of certain partially ordered abelian
groups. This project is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an
algebraic structure which is realized in a variety of settings in algebra and
mathematics. The specific research involves the structure and theory of von
Neumann regular rings and rings of differential operators. The latter type of
ring is of interest to other areas of mathematics and physics.
