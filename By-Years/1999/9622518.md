DMI-9622518 Malshe Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) diamond deposition has
enhanced the operating performance of many existing technological systems for
the electronics, optical, computer and mechanical industries. Previously, energy
sources such as ions, abrasive, and chemical was considered for post-synthesis
finishing and machining of CVD-diamond films. These techniques inevitably lead
to contamination and damage to the surfaces and subsurface layers as residual
stresses, chemicals residues, and defects. Many of these techniques were based
on applying a solid, liquid, or gas polish directly on the substrate. The
results of these techniques are slow, thereby resulting in damage and
deterioration. This research develops and investigates a novel femtosecond (fs)
pulse laser processing technique for ultrafine machining of CVD-diamond films
and other CVD-diamond based components. The investigators proposes that the
right combination of ultraviolet (UV) wavelength, pulse width, and processing
environment with this novel approach will not only refine existing laser-
processing techniques, but also surpass all other existing processing techniques
in their physico-chemical machining performances. The research task is in
collaboration with the Iowa State University.
