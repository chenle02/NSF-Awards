The instrumentation of the Rutgers Physics Learning Center will be enhanced
through the acquisition of several computer- interfaced mechanics experiments,
creation of novel mechanics experiments using videotaping techniques,
acquisition of several electricity and magnetism, optics and modern physics
apparatus, and computer-interfaced instruments for introducing medical
applications of physics. These experiments will be used in existing novel
programs for the non-calculus based introductory physics course, calculus based
general physics course, freshmen engineering physics course and a gateway
physics course. These experiments will also greatly enhance the scope of the
Physics Learning Center. Since the center provides instructional services for
over 4,000 students each semester, this equipment will receive continual and
heavy use.
