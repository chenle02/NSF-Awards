This award provides renewed support for the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center,
which collects, maintains, and distributes genetically marked stocks of the
common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The high degree of conservation of
proteins and of cellular and developmental pathways observed among insects and
vertebrates, in combination with an extensive set of well developed genetic
tools, has made the fruit fly one of the foremost model organisms for
investigation of fundamental problems in biology. The extensive collection of
genetically defined strains housed at the Bloomington Stock Center has become a
critical resource for modern research using Drosophila. The collection consists
of over 12,500 different genetic stocks, most genetically marked with visible,
lethal or sterile mutations (41% of the collection), other alleles (11%),
chromosome aberrations (20%), or transposon insertions (18%). The remaining 10%
consist of special-purpose stocks (10%), including those used for rapid mapping.
Information about stocks is incorporated into FlyBase, the primary Drosophila
community database, and is available from the Center's web site. This provides
the community of users with full access to up-to-date information about stocks
available from the collection. In addition, Center scientists are available to
answer questions and provide advice on the use of these materials. Strains in
the collection are in demand, with an average of 115,000 stocks a year requested
from the Center. Academic researchers receive over 95% of the samples
distributed. This resource contributes to scientific progress by assuring that a
wide variety of documented strains of current research value are readily
available to all researchers, and by promoting the effective use of available
research materials through information services. Drosophila resource activities
impact all areas of research that make use of Drosophila studies. Among others,
these include gene regulation, cell biology, developmental biology,
neurobiology, behavioral biology, population biology, ecology and evolution.
