A conference will be held, part of a the Gordon Research Conference series,
addressing issues of quantum-chromodynamics in nuclear physics. There will be
both experimental talks and theoretical talks on subjects ranging from color
transparency in nucleon knockout to strange quark amplitudes in the nucleon to
manifestation of QCD effects in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The
conference will be held in Tilton, New Hampshire, July 26-30, 1993.
