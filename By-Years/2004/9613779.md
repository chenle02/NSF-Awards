Abstract ATM96-13779 Weare, Bryan C. University of California, Davis Title:
Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Model Studies of Short-term Climatic
Variations in the Equatorial Pacific This grant is to support a modeling and
data analysis effort to better understand the physical processes responsible for
the climate and the short term climate change over the tropical oceans. This
work brings to bear three major modeling components. The focus is on the
multiscale interactions. Diagnostic studies of the results from the models will
provide extremely useful information as to the nature of the initiation,
development, and propagation of the tropical phenomena, Madden -Julian
Oscillation (MJO) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These studies
will be important in gaining a better understanding of the role of the Western
Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and the equatorial oceans as a whole in climate and
climate variability.
