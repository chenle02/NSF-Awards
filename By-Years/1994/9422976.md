This project extends transaction cost theory to decisions regarding inter-firm
research and development services in the particular context of software
development. The research is supported under the Joint NSF/Private Sector
Initiative and involves a collaborative effort between twenty-one private-sector
organizations and the principal investigators. The objective of the study is to
test important questions benchmarking sourcing procedures for software
development. This project's model of sourcing decisions and outcomes is richer
than those usually found in research on vertical integration. No other study has
examined both the sourcing decision and supplier performance separately,
although there are strong theoretical reasons why this design is advisable. The
design enables conceptual distinctions to be made between important questions.
Also, the data are not subject to the usual problems of hindsight measurement
bias or to difficulties in attributing causality. The model for this research is
grounded in problems of software sourcing that the cooperating organizations
currently face. The resources dedicated to choosing and managing new developers
have been rapidly increasing in recent years. The results of this study should
lead to new approaches to solving sourcing problems more generally in a world of
inter-firm reliance and cooperation. Thus, although the projects is based in
theory, it has strong operational component. This project will help both the
cooperating organizations and academic researchers learn how to initiate and
carry out this kind of research partnership.
