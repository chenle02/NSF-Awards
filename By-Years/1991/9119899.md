This project will test the fundamental underpinnings of the standard theory of
quantum electrodynamics (QED) by measuring decay rates and the properties of the
excited states of positronium, a "molecule" consisting of one electron and one
positron (positively charged electron). A related experiment will center on a
test of time reversal invariance, one of the fundamental symmetries thought to
be found in nature.
