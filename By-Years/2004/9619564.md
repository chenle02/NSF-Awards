Dr. Brian P. Coppola and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Michigan are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry, as well
as interdisciplinary programs in materials and bioscience chemistry.
Additionally, weekly programs are offered in subjects ranging from laboratory
safety, to careers in science and field trips to industry. Recruitment efforts
primarily target women and minority students nationwide.
