The project enhances the existing computer-aided mapping and geographical
information systems (GIS) laboratory capability in civil engineering at Cal Poly
Pomona. Seven surveying workstations are enhanced by the addition of an
analytical plotter and UNIX-based workstations, equipped with GIS software. The
analytical plotter is used in the photogrammetry class to teach students the
principles of analytical photogrammetry and photogrammetric data collection
methods for GIS databases. The UNIX-based workstations is used in the GIS class
to teach students the topological principles involved in geographical
information systems.
