Through 8 weeks on site, combining field work, laboratory investigations, and
synthesis activities, 12 undergraduate students per year, recruited from
institutions targeted to enhance women and minorities, will be trained in the
methods, strengths, and aims of multidisciplinary science, using Florida's Late
Neogene strata to erect a high-resolution stratigraphic framework within which
oaleoenvironmental change can be investigated. The pedagogic goals of this
project will be accomplished through a combination of field work and laboratory
analysis, with constant mentoring by the two PIs plus three additional faculty
members and an experienced graduate assistant, providing a 2:1 student:mentor
ratio. To facilitate the mentoring process and create a multidisciplinary
research environment, groups of two or three students will engage in focused
research projects to test wide-ranging hypotheses that will result in
presentations and, where appropriate, publications.
