&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to Clemson University for the support of
a three-year, REU Site entitled "Innovations in Biomaterials," under the
direction of Dr. Karen J. Burg. This ten-week summer program will involve eight
students annually in cutting edge research in areas including stem cell
technology and cell-based biosensors, working closely with two faculty mentors
and one graduate student mentor. A broad mix of students, including women and
under-represented minorities, from other institutions without bioengineering
programs will be recruited for the program. Students will also participate in a
series of lectures and workshops involving critical issues and topics in
bioengineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
