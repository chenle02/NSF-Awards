This research studies theoretically and experimentally adsorption of solute
from near critical fluids onto stationary phases. Theoretically, statistical
mechanical integral equations will be used to describe the equilibrium
thermodynamics of solute partitioning, and this will lead to equations for
partial molar enthalpies, volumes and ultimately partition coefficients.
Experimentally, a chromatographic technique will be used to acquire adsorption
data. Both lines of research will focus in particular on how the adsorption of
solute changes when the solvent is a mixture of two supercritical fluids in
their near critical region. For this case, the proposed research will study the
possibility that by varying the solvent composition the behavior of the solute
towards the solvent can be modulated from attractive to repulsive.
