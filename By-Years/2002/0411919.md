The Institute for Advanced Study will convene a group of research mathematicians
with significant experience in K-12 mathematics education to participate in the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics/Association of State Supervisors of
Mathematics (NCTM/ASSM) conference in Park City, Utah on July 21-25. This group
will examine the analysis of state mathematics standards developed by the
NCTM/ASSM conference from the perspective of the coherence of mathematics
content and priorities and sequencing of topics across grade levels. The group
will draft a set of 130 problems (roughly 10 per grade level) exemplifying core
knowledge and proficiencies in a mathematically focused, coherent K-12
curriculum.
