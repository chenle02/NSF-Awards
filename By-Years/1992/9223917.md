The study of returns to scale in firms has traditionally focused on
technological returns to scale in the production process. However, as the scale
of a firm's production process grows, so does its administrative apparatus. The
task of much of this administrative apparatus is information processing,
including communication and decision-making. This task is important to the
performance of the firm, and hence relevant to returns to scale. This research
uses a model of stochastic control with explicit and costly computation of
policies, coupled with a parallel processing model of information processing in
organizations. It is expected that a variety of results will be obtained for
which returns depend on assumptions on the statistical properties of the
information to be processed and on the loss function. Further studies include a
locational model of scale, explicit models of the firm with scale measured by
physical inputs and outputs rather than by the informational size of the
environment, and a distributed computational model of information processing.
This research works across the frontier between computer science and economics.
It relates information processing and organization design and function, and will
enhance our understanding of a problem of long standing and great importance in
economics.
