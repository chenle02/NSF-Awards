This project will provide the computing equipment through an infrastructure
grant that will enable greater capability for analysis of empirical social and
economic phenomena, mediated in cyberspace such as, for example, massive online
social networks, malicious web content, and underground cybercrime markets. The
popular online sites like Facebook and Twitter connect literally billions of
people; however, entirely new threats to such sites have emerged driven by
cybercrime. In the absence of effective defenses, online social ecosystems today
suffer. The empirical study of these threats and mitigating strategies in
today's enormous web infrastructure requires a highly scalable capable cyber
infrastructure. Better understanding these complex cyber ecosystems, made
possible through this equipment grant, will lead to new insights for making
cyberspace safer.
