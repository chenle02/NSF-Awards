This award will support research related travel expenses of four researchers in
ergodic theory. Professors Petersen and Weirdl are engaged in research in the
area of almost everywhere convergence. Professors Dajani and Hawkins are working
on projects whose aim is to classify non-singular endomorphisms. Ergodic theory
in general is concerned with understanding the average behavior of systems whose
dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.
This award will allow four researchers to attend conferences and to discuss
their work in ergodic theory with colleagues.
