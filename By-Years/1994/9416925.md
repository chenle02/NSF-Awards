9416925 Bernard This U.S.-Czech cooperative research project between Dr. John
Bernard of Ithaca College and Dr. Karel Fiala of the Institute of Landscape
Ecology, Czech Academy of Sciences, will address the development of clonal plant
populations in normal, unpolluted systems to populations growing in polluted
systems. The polluted systems to be studies will feature: 1) mountain forest
systems impacted by acid deposition and 2) wetland marsh systems affected by
sewage, landfill, or agricultural sources that produce higher loads of
decomposing organic matter. The researchers intend to produce an analysis of the
effects of pollution on clonal plants in these two natural ecosystems by
comparing their observations of natural and perturbed settings and laboratory
environments both in the U.S. and the Czech Republic. Results should yield a
rich new source of data on plant response to levels of pollution. This project
in population biology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence. ***
