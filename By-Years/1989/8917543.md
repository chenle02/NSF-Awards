Prof. Paul Dagdigian and Prof. Millard Alexander (U. of Maryland) are supported
by a grant from The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study electrical
and rotational inelastic collisions in diatomic molecules. These measurements
will allow us to obtain valuable insight into the fundamental processes that
govern chemical reactions in very simple systems that model the difficult
problems found in more complex molecules. The grant contains components from
both experiment (Dagdigian) and theory (Alexander) for such molecular entities
as CN, OH, NH and the very difficult H + C2 reactive system. The experimental
component will involve the measurement of state-resolved inelastic cross
sections both in crossed molecular beam and in optical-optical double resonance
(OODR) studies using a discharge-flow system. In the former, collsional
excitation of cold free radical beams will be investigated. The theoretical
component will involve both the ab initio determination of accurate potential
energy surfaces for the ground and low-lying electronically excited states of
three and four atom systems as well as quantum scattering studies based on these
potential surfaces. Particular attention will be devoted to the determination of
the crucial non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements.
