Funds are provided to quantify spatial and temporal variations in landslide
sediment production in the Waipaoa River Basin, New Zealand using a variety of
remote sensing techniques (InSAR, airborne LiDAR, historic air photos) in
combination with cosmogenic radionuclides (10Be). The Waipaoa Basin is one of
the MARGINS Source-to-Sink study sites, and this work will contribute to an
overall understanding of sediment generation and mobilization in landslide-prone
areas. The PIs will: 1) estimate the spatial distribution of slope failure on
seasonal timescales since the early ?90?s, 2) track downslope movement of
natural and anthropogenic features and generate maps, 3) document case studies
of landslide-prone hillslopes and their coupling to channel networks, and 4)
study the difference in landslide activity upstream and downstream of
knickpoints, and the relation to long-term climate evolution and land use
change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include international
collaboration with local (New Zealand) scientists, generation and rapid
dissemination of a state-of-the-art data set to the MARGINS community, graduate
student training, and local land-use relevance. &lt;br/&gt;
