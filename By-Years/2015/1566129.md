Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) have gained importance in a wide range of
applications over the last decade, such as search and rescue, reconnaissance and
surveillance, asset inspection, and delivery services. The economic impact of
integrating unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace is predicted to
be significant. By providing rigorous theoretical analysis and solid design
tools for securing consistent MAV navigation, this research has the potential to
significantly impact our lives, from pushing our knowledge boundary of
scientific understanding to protecting people from malicious
attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project advances science at the
intersection of (nonlinear) estimation consistency and security under resource
constraints and seeks to design resource-aware, attack-resilient, consistent MAV
navigation. To that end, an analytical study of the effects of sensor system
properties such as noise characteristics and sensing frequency on the attainable
estimation performance is being conducted to determine the best sensing
parameters to use. The integrated outreach program attracts underrepresented
minority students to STEM through comprehensive, innovative hands-on teaching
and learning of robotics programming for K-12 students.
