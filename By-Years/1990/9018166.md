This research is a continuation of a project begun in 1989 with seismologists
of the Institute of Physics of the Earth in Moscow to exploit USSR seismic array
data in central Asia: the Tien Shan. The objective is to delineate the
seismicity, structure, and tectonics of this major continental collisional
feature. Results to date include a significant reduction of earthquake epicenter
scatter and 3-D velocity models of the Tien Shan. Further work will concentrate
on wave-form modelling of converted phases from discontinuities in the crust and
upper mantle, shear- wave velocity analysis from surface waves, and anisotropy
investigations from SKS. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
