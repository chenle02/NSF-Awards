HeadMouse is an inexpensive microprocessor-controlled infrared-light-based
system that indicates head position in real- time, so as to enable a computer
user to control cursor movement on a computer display by head movement without
any head constraints or head mounted apparatus (glasses, helmet, etc.). By
activating the system using a designated key on a standard keyboard or by sing a
foot-operated or other kind of switch or special head motion, the user can
position the cursor in the same manner as the conventional mouse by changing
head direction thereby allowing use of presently available software. Such a head
direction director user-computer interface should not only be competitive for
the general personal computer "mouse" market, but also should have significant
advantages in laptop, disabled, oriental character, entertainment and military
niche markets. It could also easily be adapted to operate as a three-dimensional
headmouse.
