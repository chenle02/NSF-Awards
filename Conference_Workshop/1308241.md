The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
the "Computational Methods and Function Theory Conference, 2013" that will be
held June 10-14, 2013, at Shantou University in Shantou, Guangdong, China.

This event, which is the seventh in a series of quadrennial international
meetings devoted to the theme of interactions between complex analysis and
scientific computing, will host a formal delegation of thirteen individuals from
the U.S. The delegation will comprise ten junior mathematicians (i.e., recent
Ph.D.'s and graduate students) and three plenary speakers (Olga Holtz, Don
Marshall, Joel Shapiro). Function theory, as one of the fundamental disciplines
of mathematics, has widespread applications in many areas of the sciences and
technology. Its methodology, for example, is a fundamental tool in developing
computer algorithms for problems in systems theory and control. Conversely, some
of the basic research problems in function theory have recently become more
manageable through the use of the vast power modern computers provide. Thus
there is a synergistic relationship between function theory and computational
methods that greatly benefits both areas and that this conference will serve to
highlight. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
