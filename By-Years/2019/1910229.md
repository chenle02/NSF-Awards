The presence or absence of water on a small Solar System object tells us much
about the object's history and helps us trace the evolution of the Solar System.
Bodies closer to the Sun than the main asteroid belt are too warm to retain
liquid water, while bodies further than, approximately, Jupiter's orbit are
beyond the "snow line," where surface water is permanently frozen. Two groups of
asteroids, just inside Jupiter's orbit (known as the Cybeles and Hildas after
the largest member of each group) are proposed for study here. The PI will use
telescopes to break down visible and infrared (IR) light into its constituent
colors. From this, she will search for absorption features diagnostic of
minerals that contain liquid water. The PI will involve undergraduate students
from the College of Charleston in the research; part of the requested funding
will be used to purchase a new small telescope for the undergraduate-only
institution. This telescope will be used in the research. She will also visit
astronomy and earth sciences classes at a local high school, where she has
established a collaboration, in the Charleston area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
team will obtain visible (0.4-0.8 micron) spectra and near/mid-infrared (0.7-4.2
micron) spectra for 23 Cybeles and 9 Hildas). This broad wavelength coverage
will allow them to constrain the shallow 0.7-micron hydrated mineral band, the
0.9- and 1.1-micron bands due to water-rich clay minerals, the deep and sharp
3.0-micron hydrated mineral band, the rounded 3.0-micron water ice band. For the
brightest 13 targets, they will obtain rotationally resolved 0.7-micron spectra.
The observations will require ~25 nights spread over 7 observing semesters for
both the sub-meter optical telescope on campus and NASA's InfraRed Telescope
Facility (IRTF).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
