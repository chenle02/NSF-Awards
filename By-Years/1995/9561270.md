This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the transport of dry unipolar toner with electrostatic traveling waves in a
manner required for use in advanced forms of color laser printing and direct
powder printing. An earlier form of traveling wave device, known as the
`electric curtain,` transports toner too slowly for the desired use. Another
form, known as the `charged toner conveyor,` transports toner too fast. However,
a new way of operating a traveling wave conveyor has recently been discovered,
in which toner speed can be controlled to achieve exactly the range desired. A
non-interactive, unipolar (NU) development process can convey toner past
electrostatic latent images in the manner sought. During Phase I, traveling wave
conveyors will be constructed and demonstrated to transport toner over the
favorably predicted speed range. During Phase II, NU-development systems would
be developed for two general types of applications: simplified color laser
printers; and direct powder printers. In terms of developer performance, the
only significant difference in these applications is the required toner speed.
System architectures will depend on specific applications. This technology is
expected to find commercial appication in simpler, lower cost color laser
printers, which can be more competitive with printers based on liquid ink jet
technology. Such printers would provide better quality prints at higher speed.
Further, this technology would be the basis for direct powder printers with
great simplicity, reliability, low cost, and continuous-tone color capability,
eventually enabling a digital photo-printer with better quality/price ratio than
can be achieved by other technologies.
