Scholars in the emerging field of emotion labor acknowledge the need for
improved understanding and measurement of this construct's dimensionality.
Defined as the management of personal emotions to produce desired customer
responses, emotion labor's relevance for our increasingly service-oriented
economy underscores the need to understand both the parameters or dimensional
structure of this construct and its impact on various individually and
organizationally relevant outcomes. The objective of this Research Planning
Grant is the identification of emotion labor's defining dimensions and the
subsequent development of an index to measure these dimensions. Toward this end,
the research will 1) develop an item pool from literature review and qualitative
methodologies to ascertain relevant dimensions of emotion labor; 2) administer
an emotion labor item list to appropriate subjects, then use factor analytic
techniques to extract significant dimensions; 3) construct and administer a
revised emotion labor index; and 4) assess its validity and reliability as a
measure of emotion labor. With the availability of an appropriately developed
and tested emotion labor index, more systematic research on this subject may
result and concerns regarding its effect on the US work force may be better
addressed.
