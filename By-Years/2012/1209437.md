The PI proposes to study mathematical problems arising in kinetic models
centered at the Boltzmann theory. He plans to investigate boundary effects in
regularity and hydrodynamic limit problems via recently developed mathematical
tools. The PI also proposes to continue his study of stable and unstable galaxy
models in astronomy. The PI continues to work on stability of so-called BGK
waves in the Vlasov theory. The PI plans to investigate stability of `contact
line' problems in fluids using new frameworks. It is expected that new
mathematical tools will be developed in these research
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kinetic theory and models play an ever
increasingly important role in our understanding of various problems in science,
engineering and even social science (e.g. swarming). This proposal is set to
investigate mathematical problems arising in the study of stable galaxy
configurations, dynamics of solar winds, plasma stability control of wall-plasma
interaction in fusion, contact line dynamics for thin-film in material sciences.
