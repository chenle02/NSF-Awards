This research project will develop a robust unsupervised clustering technique
based on Genetic Niching. It includes the development of a statistical estimator
and to use this estimator in a Baldwin learning scheme. It will also develop an
evolutionary web personalization system as well as techniques for preprocessing
web usage data. The career development plan will include training graduate
students in web mining as well as integrating the results into the undergraduate
curriculum.
