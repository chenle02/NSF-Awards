This award will support a conference entitled The Second Conference on
Computation and Control. The conference will be held from 1 August to 8 August,
1990 on the campus of Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana. The theme of
the conference is the interaction between numerical analysts and control
theorists. Not only is there a need to merge computational methods into the
control theory design, but also there are areas in control theory that have
complete analogies in numerical analysis. Arrangements have been made with
Birkhaeuser to publish the proceedings from this conference.
