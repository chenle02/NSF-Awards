9505174 Lawson The proposed research lies at the interface of algebraic geometry
and algebraic topology. A principal goal is to further develop the theory of
algebraic cycles on projective varieties: this theory, largely founded by
Lawson, seeks to understand projective varieties from a topological standpoint,
and can be considered as a generalization of the theory of schemes. An algebraic
variety is defined as the common zero set of a collection of homogeneous
polynomials in several variables; algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic
varieties (or what is the same, homogeneous polynomial equations in several
complex variables). The proposed research has to do with applying topological
tools to study various subsets of algebraic varieties.
