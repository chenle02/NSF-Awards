This project is a study of the seasonal variability and long-term change of the
upper ocean structure of the Drake Passage. It consists of high density sections
obtained on each crossing by the U.S. Antarctic Program's research vessel
Laurence M. Gould, using expendable bathythermographs, supplemented by
expendable conductivity-temperature-depth probes. This information will continue
to lead to the establishment of a high quality data base with which to study the
magnitude and depth of penetration of the seasonal signals, connections to
atmospheric forcing, and the effects of interannual variations such as those
associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. The Antarctic Circumpolar
Current links the circulation of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans,
providing a global pathway for the interocean transfer of heat and salt
anomalies. Drake Passage is a convenient narrow choke point for property
exchange between the Pacific and the South Atlantic/Indian Ocean system. These
sections will supplement the approximately forty sections have been obtained
since September 1996. The probes are launched by the scientific shipboard
personnel on each cruise. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
