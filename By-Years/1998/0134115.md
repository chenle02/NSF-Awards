The theory of automatic control has reached considerable maturity in the last
few decades. Solutions to a large number of diverse and challenging problems
have been obtained, and many important mathematical aspects of the theory are
well understood. However, there remain several categories of problems for which
the success of standard control tools has been limited. These include:

1. Control of systems that cannot be stabilized by continuous feedback. 2.
Control of systems with sensor or actuator constraints. 3. Control of systems
with large-scale modeling uncertainty.

The research and educational development plan proposed here is aimed at
designing hybrid control algorithms. In this framework, a continuous-time
process is controlled by means of logic-based switching among a family of
regulators. The closed-loop system is then called hybrid because it combines
continuous and discrete dynamics. We study several situations in which such a
control paradigm is natural and helps overcome various shortcomings of more
traditional control methodologies.

The primary focus of this research is on systematic development of tools for
hybrid control design, applicable to general and useful classes of nonlinear
dynamical systems. We propose to achieve this goal by recognizing common trends
that unify different aspects of the problems under consideration, and by
exploiting recent advances made by the proposer and collaborators in nonlinear
disturbance attenuation and in stability analysis of switched systems.

Hybrid control techniques are suitable for implementation in the context of many
important applications that drive the modern technology, such as software-
enabled control, control over networks, and vision-based control. These methods
help bridge the gap between the mathematical control theory and engineering
practice. For this reason, they also generate high student interest. Our
research program will be integrated into the academic curriculum of the
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign through course development, student mentoring, laboratory
creation, and tutorial publications.
