Structure function relationship in enolase will be studied using a combination
of x-ray crystallography, site directed mutagenesis, and kinetic studies. There
are two, or perhaps three, divalent metal ion binding sites per subunit of
enolase which are sequentially filled. Some metal ions activate enolase, others
bind strongly but don not activate. Dr. Lebioda will study ternary and
quaternary complexes of enolase- metal ion-substrate-metal ion to image the
sequential steps in the enzyme mechanism. Crystals of mutant enolase will be
obtained (in collaboration with Drs. Brewer and Robson) and their structure
determined. The mechanism of enolase inhibition by fluoride ions will be
studied. Interaction of single stranded DNA with enolase will be modeled by
studying the complexes of oligonucleotides with enolase. The yeast enolase
crystals scatter to 1.8A resolution; this makes the system an excellent object
of the proposed studies. In addition to enolase research, Dr. Lebioda also
proposes to study the structure of another metalloenzyme, transcarboxylase (TC).
There is significant sequence identity indicating homology between TC and one or
more domains of other biotin enzymes. Thus, its structure will be representative
for this class of proteins.
