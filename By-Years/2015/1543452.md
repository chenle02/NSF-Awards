Previous studies of the Indo-Pacific region of Antarctica show that the margin
of the ice sheet in this region has advanced and retreated into deep interior
basins many times in the past. The apparent instability of this region makes it
an important target for study in terms of understanding the future of the East
Antarctic ice sheet and sea level rise. This project will study a number of
processes that control the ice-shelf stability of this region, with the aim of
improving projections of the rate and magnitude of future sea-level rise. This
project will engage a range of students and train this next generation of
scientists in the complex, interdisciplinary issue of ice-ocean
interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will integrate geophysical data
collected from aircraft over three critical&lt;br/&gt;sections of the East
Antarctic grounding line (Totten Glacier, Denman Glacier, and&lt;br/&gt;Cook Ice
Shelf) with an advanced ocean model. Using Australian and French
assets,&lt;br/&gt;the team will collect new data around Denman Glacier and Cook
Ice Shelf whereas analysis of Totten Glacier will be based on existing data. The
project will assess three hypotheses to isolate the processes that drive the
differences in observed grounding line thinning among these three glaciers: 1.
bathymetry and large-scale ocean forcing control cavity circulation; 2. ice-
shelf draft and basal morphology control cavity circulation; 3. subglacial
freshwater input across the grounding line controls cavity circulation. The key
outcomes of this new project will be to: 1. evaluate of ice-ocean coupling in
areas of significant potential sea-level contribution; 2. relate volume changes
of grounded and floating ice to regional oceanic heat transport and sub-ice
shelf ocean dynamics in areas of significant potential sea-level and meridional
overturning circulation impacts; and 3. improve boundary conditions to evaluate
mass, heat, and freshwater budgets of East Antarctica's continental margins.
