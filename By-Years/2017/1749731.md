Quantum computers, which harness the peculiarities of quantum physics to solve
hard computational problems, are poised to deliver significant and far-reaching
impacts to cryptography and privacy. Significant progress is being made in
developing these devices, indicating that quantum computing will likely be
viable in the next couple decades. Once viable, quantum computers will open up
new attack vectors that will render many current cryptosystems
insecure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is building new protocols to protect
against these new quantum attack vectors. Examples include multiparty
computation, public key cryptography, block ciphers, and more. Simultaneously,
this research is also devising novel systems that actually take advantage of
quantum computing to perform exciting new cryptographic tasks that were not
previously possible. As part of these goals, the project is developing new
theoretical foundations for studying and analyzing cryptosystems in the presence
of quantum computers. Finally, this project is developing and studying a new
theory of differential privacy in the quantum setting and devising new quantum
differentially-private protocols that provide improved privacy
guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
