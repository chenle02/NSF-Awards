In this rapidly changing and drying world, the rapid breeding and development of
climate-adapted crop varieties is a necessary foundation of US national
competitiveness and sustainability. This proposal takes genome editing by CRISPR
from its preponderant use of modification or alteration of one or few genes, to
a novel tool for genome-scale alterations that are urgently needed to accelerate
breeding. The development of this novel technology can impact the breeding of
multiple crops, including allopolyploid ones, such as wheat, canola, and peanut,
that can be notoriously challenging due to their genomic complexity, but are
critical components of US’s staple foods. In terms of outreach, undergraduate
and graduate students will be trained in advanced plant genomics and molecular
biology in the context of this project. Additionally, it will provide
opportunities for exposing underrepresented groups to STEM-related work through
dissemination of the concepts, methods and societal implications of this work
through publications, presentations and / or outreach videos geared towards the
general public and, specifically, younger audiences.

The strategy entails targeting CRISPR to hand-picked sets of chromosomal
sequences, so that “immune” chromosomes survive, while targeted chromosomes are
eliminated. This results in individuals with specific, desirable chromosome
sets, such as those from a given parent. The objectives are to demonstrate and
optimize accession-specific chromosome elimination and to engineer elimination
of a parental chromosome set in tomato, effectively resulting in haploid
induction. Using both the model arabidopsis and the crop tomato, the work
involves development of methods for identification of accession- and chromosome-
specific CRISPR targets, for rapid validation of these targets, and for
engineering of genotype- and karyotype-specific drives. Genome-scale alterations
of crop genomes through Targeted Elimination of Chromosomes (TEC), could
potentially enable broad application of haploid induction, manipulation of
allopolyploid genome, and selection of specific genome-wide haplotypic
configurations in hybrid progeny.
