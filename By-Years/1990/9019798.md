Research on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ranges from such global
problems as the functioning of an entire nervous system and the evolution of
form to the molecular bases of the gene structure and function. C.l elegans has
becomes an important experimental organism for the study of many aspects of
animal biology, particularly the genetic and molecular bases of development and
behavior. Dr. Anderson is requesting funds to help support two C. elegans
meetings to be held at the university of Wisconsin at Madison, WI in June of
1991 and 1993. Previous C. elegans meeting shave led to the exchange of
knowledge, methods, mutants, and clones and have been vital in establishing the
sense of excitement and collegiality that characterizes this field.
