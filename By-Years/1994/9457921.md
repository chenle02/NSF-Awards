9457921 Haile Crystal growth, chemical synthesis and characterization of fast
ion conductors by x-ray diffraction and a.c. impedance methods. Materials of
interest include proton-conducting acid sulfates and phosphates, proton-
conducting doped perovskites, and oxygen- conducting pyrochlores. Studies of
electrode/electrolye interactions via in situ x-ray diffraction, and refinement
of structural parameters from powder data using Rietveld analysis. %%% ***
