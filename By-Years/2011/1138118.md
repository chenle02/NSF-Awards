The NSF Divisions of Chemistry (NSF/CHE) and Materials Research (NSF/DMR) will
support a workshop titled "Nanomaterials and the Environment - the Chemistry and
Materials Science Perspective". Co-chaired by Vicki Grassian of the University
of Iowa and Robert Hamers of the University of Wisconsin, the workshop will be
held in Arlington, VA on June 28-29, 2011. The workshop will engage a diverse
group of established investigators from academia, US government laboratories,
and leading international laboratories who work to elucidate the interactions
between anthropogenic nanomaterials and the environment. The objective of the
workshop is to discuss and summarize the challenges and opportunities for
chemists and material scientists in this area of research in a workshop report
that will be broadly disseminated to the chemistry and materials science
community.
