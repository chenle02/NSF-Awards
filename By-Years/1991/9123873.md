This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder acquire a
Cryogenic Heliplex System, which will be used with an EPR-ENDOR spectrometer to
enable magnetic measurements at low temperatures. The equipment will be used in
research investigations in the following areas of chemistry: 1) reactive
intermediates, 2) transition metal complexes containing quinone liqands, and 3)
cooperative phenomena in molecular systems. Cryogenics relates to production and
maintenance of very low temperature, and the study of phenomena at these
temperatures. The cryostat which will be purchased with this award willallow
measurements to be made at temperatures near absolute zero.
