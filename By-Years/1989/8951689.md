The main goals that are achieved using the equipment in this project are: (1)
to enable the students to preform experiments that were able to be done because
the former instruments do not have adequate resolution or wavelength range, (2)
to provide students with opportunities to use digital data handling techniques
in conjunction with recording and manipulating infrared spectra. The IR
spectrometer purchased has a resolution of 1.0 wavenumbers and enables upper
division students to record spectra with sufficient resolution for use in
quantum chemical calculations. The communications interface permits the
instrument to be interfaced to a PC so that students gain experience with
digital data handling techniques. The interfcing and software system design is
done by students in a microcomputer interfacing course. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
