The principal investigators will study the petrology, structure, and geologic
history of the ultra-magnesian metamorphic rocks in the southwestern Pamir
Mountains of the Soviet republic of Tajikistan. The study will take place in
cooperation with scientists from the Soviet Union and has also been approved on
the Soviet side. The study is aimed at understanding the processes involved in
the metamorphism of these rocks, as well as the associated tectonic history. It
will also contribute to knowledge of the collisional processes that resulted in
the formation of the Alpine-Himalayan orogen.
