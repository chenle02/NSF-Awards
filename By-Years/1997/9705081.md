9705081 Marks This grant aims at a fundamental understanding of the growth of
metal films on semiconductors, with a view towards developing phase-diagrams
which include finite size effects such as the depression of the eutectic
temperature. Understanding the processes taking place at small sizes when the
metal reacts with the substrate is almost virgin territory, even for as simple a
system as Stranski-Krastanov (layer plus island) growth in a binary-eutectic.
The research approach combines transmission electron microscopy under ultra-high
vacuum conditions with more classic surface characterization techniques,
exploiting a new experimental system at Northwestern University with some new
techniques for obtaining atomic scale surface information. The primary questions
to be answered are: (1) What are the atomic scale surface structures? (2) What
is the atomic scale detail of surface defects such as domain and heterophase
boundaries, not just at the outermost atomic layer? (3) Can we build phase
diagrams of the monolayer and monolayer plus small particle regimes (l-10nm)?
(4) How do we combine these with particle-size effects, Ostwald ripening and
kinetic phenomena? Metals on semiconductors have been of substantial interest
both scientifically and technologically for many years. %%% As the size of the
metal film regions decrease (due to both the drive to achieve higher densities
and for novel applications such as quantum devices), it is no longer possible to
ignore finite size effects. This program explores the growth phenomena
associated with such films. ***
