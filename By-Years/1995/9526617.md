9526617 Barker This research is a collaborative effort with seismologists and
earthquake engineers in Mexico City and Grenoble to extend existing methods for
modeling 3-D seismic wave propagation in multi-layered structures. The work is
necessary in order to understand and explain the high levels of amplification
and long durations of earthquake ground motion in Mexico City, the Tarzana,
California nursery and other important sites. Variations of the Boundary Element
Method along with codes that extensive use of parallel processors will be
developed. This research is a aomponent of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program. *** ??
