Objective and Approaches: The objective of this research is to develop and
characterize a novel method to create low-cost microsystem platforms using
commercially available hydrophobic papers (e.g., parchment paper, wax paper,
palette paper). The approach is to use laser surface treatment of such papers to
selectively convert hydrophobic regions into hydrophilic ones and use such
conversion to embed smart materials and integrate electronics onto the paper.
Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merits of the proposed research lies in
scientific and engineering exploration of laser surface treatment of
commercially available hydrophobic papers to create low-cost microsystem
platforms. In particular: 1) investigation of the interaction of common surface
treating lasers (diode, CO2, and Nd-YAG) with commercially available hydrophobic
papers, 2) development of techniques to incorporate functional materials into
the laser treated papers, and 3) incorporation of active and passive components
onto paper platforms. Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of the proposed
research are in many areas including low-cost health care products,
consumer/wireless electronics, and micro-robotics. In the human resource
development, under-represented and minority undergraduate students will be given
the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the project and benefit from
exposure to and training in microfabrication, MEMS, microfluidics, transducers,
and microelectronics. An undergraduate course (Title: Green Electronics) with an
emphasis on the environmental implications of modern microelectronics technology
will also be developed to increase the awareness of the huge impact of
microelectronics in environmental degradation and sustainability.
