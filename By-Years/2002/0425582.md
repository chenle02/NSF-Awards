Funds are provided to characterize the distribution of water masses and organic
matter on the Eurasian shelf during several ice-breaker cruises by using a
multi-tracer approach and existing international and multidisciplinary
collaborations. Data from a recently tested in situ fluorescence probe will be
complemented by the determination of hydrographic characteristics, organic
tracers (lignin phenols, neutral sugars, stable carbon isotopes), and stable
oxygen isotopes (H218O). The analysis of this combination of measurements will
be used to investigate two main scientific objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1.
determination of the role of sea ice formation in the exchange of water masses,
in particular the formation of Arctic halocline waters on the Eurasian shelf,
and&lt;br/&gt;2. determination of the role of physical exchanges between the
Arctic Ocean and the Eurasian shelf in the biology and biogeochemical fluxes of
the region.&lt;br/&gt;
