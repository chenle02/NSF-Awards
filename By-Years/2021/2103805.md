Should you draw on a piece of paper, without running back over your strokes, you
will find that your figure has an even number of endpoints: one for each time
you brought pen to paper, and one for each time you lifted it. This basic fact
gives a relationship between the topology of one dimensional figures and
algebra. Mathematicians have built an elaborate machine based on the original
work of Pontryagin and Thom from the middle of the 20th century, extending this
correspondence to higher dimensions. This project aims to formulate notions of
algebraic structures on the geometric side of this correspondence, with intended
applications in the study of topology. The project will also support the
training of graduate students in the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's
new formulations are centered around the notion of a flow category which has
become central to modern approaches to symplectic topology, as well as to its
interactions with other mathematical fields, such as algebraic geometry, low
dimensional topology, and dynamical systems, as well as mathematical physics,
because the output of Floer's theory exactly provides such a structure. The PI
plans to formulate algebraic structures (algebras, modules, etc.) geometrically
at the level of the underlying flow categories. In this way, the PI expects to
make substantial advances in three areas: (i) Floer homotopy theory and its
applications to symplectic topology, (ii) the study of Fukaya categories and its
applications to mirror symmetry, and (iii) the interaction between differential
and algebraic topology, via a geometric model of Waldhausen's A-theory, with
intended applications to the study of Lagrangians
embeddings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
