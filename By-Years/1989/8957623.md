This project is concerned with the use of error control codes in computer
memory systems. For the case of semiconductor random access memories (RAM),
techniques for incorporating redundancy at both the on-chip and board levels is
under investigation. For the case of magnetic recording devices, the issues of
channel characterization, convolutional coding, and error control coding under
constraints on the 1s and 0s patterns of the data are being studied. Some
information theoretic aspects of the storage capacity of computer memory devices
is also under consideration.
