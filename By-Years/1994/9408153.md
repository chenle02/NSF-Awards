ABSTRACT CTS-9408153 C. Sorenson Static and dynamic light scattering techniques
will be developed to study properties of the fractal aerosol clusters, including
morphology, diffusional transport, optical scattering properties and aggregation
kinetics. Aggregates of particles formed through coagulation processes are
described as fractals, which allows for improved measuring techniques and
overall physical understanding. The experiments will be performed with
carbonaceous soot aerosols in premixed flames, and silica and titania aerosols.
The proposed measuring techniques have scientific relevance, and may be applied
to studies related to aerosols and colloids in industrial processes,
environmental aerosol analysis, combustion, and nuclear reactor safety. ***
