Advanced semiconductor devices require precision process control of layer
thickness and doping concentrations during epitaxial crystal growth. Mission
Research Corporation (MRC) and the University of New Mexico's (UNM's) Center for
High Technology Materials (CHTM) propose a robust, simple, retrofittable, in-
situ diagnostic for both monitoring and process control that will adapt easily
to most epitaxial growth system geometries without major system modifications.
This represents and exciting opportunity to advance to a new level of process
contol. The proposed system is a potentially high-performance, low-cost,
realtime control system for modern epitaxial growth such as metalorganic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and may also
find application in other CVD systems. This type of real-time measurement and
control of epitaxial growth will impact manufacturability and lower device cost
by improving precision, throughput and yield.
