Dr. Patricia A. Bianconi and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Pennsylvania State University are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5,
ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional and newer areas
of chemistry-analytical, bioorganic, biophysical, inorganic, organic, physical
and materials. A unique feature of this program is a series of seminar programs
designed to broaden their knowledge of chemistry and chemical instrumentation
both from a theoretical and practical viewpoint.
