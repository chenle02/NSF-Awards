9451084 Bloom This proposal requests funds to purchase equipment to strengthen
undergraduate labs in modern physics, optics and advanced lab courses in physics
at Winona State University. The center piece of the request is a combined
monochromator/spectrograph coupled with a 1024 pixel linear photodiode array
detector. A complete software data acquisition and analysis package,
functionally specific to the equipment, is an integral part of the overall
apparatus. A request is also being made for supporting equipment, including an
IBM- compatible computer, Michelson interferometer and light sources.
