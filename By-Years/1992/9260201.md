This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to produce
a single purpose self-contained, hand-held calculator for chemistry, based on an
earlier version which uses a special keyboard connected to a personal computer.
This calculator, which can be viewed as a chemical data base with calculation
powers, would provide students with a high powered special tool with which to
access information about the elements and basic rules of chemistry along with
special functions unique to chemistry. Although initially useful expressly for
chemistry problem solving, this device when combined with new hand-held
computers in the future could become widely available and used by a more
extensive audience.
