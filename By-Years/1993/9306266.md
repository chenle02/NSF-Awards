9306266 Richards Post-replicative methylation is the most common DNA
modification present in eukaryotic cells. Although DNA methylation has been the
subject of intense study, many questions remain about the function of this form
of DNA modification in eukaryotes. The proposal outlines a genetic approach to
the study of DNA methylation using the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a
model. We have isolated A. thaliana mutants that contain reduced levels of
cytosine methylation. Plans for further characterization of these
hypomethylation mutants and strategies for isolating new methylation mutants are
proposed. %%% It is anticipated that the A. thaliana mutants will provide a new
system for studying eukaryotic DNA methylation. ***
