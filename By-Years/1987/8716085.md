A fundamental goal of community ecology is to derive an understanding of
environmental processes (both biological and physical) which influence the
dynamics of populations in a community. In McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, benthic
community assemblages have strong east-west and north-south density gradients.
These assemblages are apparently related to gradients in primary production. The
objective of this research is to explain how productivity gradients are
functionally linked to the benthic system. The study will examine the relative
importance of in situ production and advection in influencing community
structure. The team of investigators will examine benthic microbial and
meiofaunal trophic relationships, ecology of protozoans and meiofauna, and in
situ benthic production. Studies of the macrofauna will focus on recruitment,
growth and survivorship. The physical component will be directed to regional
circulation and local current patterns. This integrated approach will provide
information on how the physical regime affects the benthic biological community.
