The objective of Phase I of this innovative materials research program is to
develop a high quality, advanced semiconductor material, which is currently not
available to the government or the commercial marketplace, using a variation of
the Liquid Phase Electroepitaxy (LPEE) growth technique. The specific goal is to
establish the advantages of the LPEE process for production of bulk single
crystals of GaAs using a Ga1-xBix melt instead of a Ga melt as a solvent. It is
strongly suspected that this research approach will lead to significantly
enhanced semiconductor materials for government and commercial device
manufacturers. The successful completion of the Phase I and II efforts will
provide a revolutionary high quality material for a wide range of government and
commercial applications far into the 21st century. This would directly provide
technological and economic benefits to the nation.
