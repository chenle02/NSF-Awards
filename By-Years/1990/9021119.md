This award provides travel funds for young investigators, mainly graduate
students, to attend the Third International Meeting on Chemical Sensors, to be
held in Cleveland, Ohio, September 24-26, 1990. Support will be provided for
nine graduate students and five young faculty members who are beginning their
academic research careers and have no other means of travel support. This grant
will enable participation by these people themselves. The conference is in an
area of emerging technology that will be critical to the economic
competitiveness of the nation.
