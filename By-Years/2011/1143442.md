This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project propose to use a
highly effective microfluidic based process to clean and disinfect contaminated
water. Veloctron will build the portable water treatment unit and test the
efficiency in killing pathogens and removing particles. The feasibility of
removing contaminants using micro bubble clusters and the subsequent degradation
of pathogens and chemical compounds by imploding the bubble clusters will be
tested. The broader/commercial impacts of this research are to provide solutions
that would enable the use of potentially contaminated water in a crisis or in
areas without proper water sanitation infrastructures. The use of untreated
water poses a severe health threat to populations throughout the world.
According to the CDC, over 100 million Americans obtain their water supply from
ground water,and over 50% of the reported waterborne outbreaks were due to
untreated water. In addition, the potential contamination of clean water sources
during crises such as flooding, hurricanes, earth quakes, or terrorist attack
poses additional challenges because the established water treatment
infrastructure may be unavailable to respond in time.
