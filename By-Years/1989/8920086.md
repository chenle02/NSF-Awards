This is a grant for support for a conference organized by UCLA titled,
Endangered Earth: An Evolutionary Perspective. It is scheduled for January 16-18
1990 and has three primary objectives: 1. To provide a focus for the development
of interdisciplinary teaching and research on Global Change within the
University of California System and more broadly across the California
scientific research community. 2. To inform a large and diverse academic and
professional audience of the identified threats associate with Global Change,
and the possibilities for action and remediation. 3. To bring together leading
experts in fields spanning the geophysical, biological and social sciences for
an interchange of concepts that ultimately must merge in an practical response
to Global Change. This conference is important because it seeks to stimulate
cross-disciplinary interactions on an environmental problem/issue of major
significance.
