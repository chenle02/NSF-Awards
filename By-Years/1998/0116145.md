With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University in Camden will acquire a300 MHz
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer with multinuclear capabilities and
a variable temperature control module. This equipment will enable researchers to
carry out studies on a) synthesis of fluorinated organic compounds; b)
characterization of various monomers and their corresponding precursors; and c)
the catalytic mechanisms of lipoamide dehydrogenase by probing native and
mutated enzymes with and without substrate. The investigators will also
integrate the NMR spectrometer into several undergraduate and graduate level
courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of
areas including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
