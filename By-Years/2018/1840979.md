The project aims to advance our understanding of anticyclones or high pressure
systems (clockwise/counterclockwise turning circulations in the
Northern/Southern Hemisphere) in the layer of the atmosphere within 10-50 km
above the earth's surface, which is called as Stratosphere. These stratospheric
anticyclones, including the Aleutian High and Atlantic High of the Northern
Hemisphere, and Australian High in the Southern Hemisphere, are co-evolved with
the stratospheric polar vortex (low-pressure systems) over each hemisphere's
winter pole as well as weather systems that produce cold-air outbreaks near the
earth's surface. The outcome of the project would help reveal stratospheric
processes and improve their predictions societally important and high-impact
weather events, such as cold-air outbreaks and winter storms. This project
supports a post-doctoral fellow and undergraduate student, contributing to the
training of next generation of scientists. The project's research methods will
be used in courses taught by the PI, thus introducing these methods to a larger
body of students outside of those working on the project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical experiments with an atmospheric model with
various specially designed configurations (e.g., with/without topography) will
be used to reveal the conditions under which continental scale near-surface
temperature anomalies would occur, acting alone or in concert with the
stratospheric processes that disturb the polar vortex. Numerical experiments
will also be used to disclose the patterns of stratospheric temperature
anomalies that lead to near-surface cold-air outbreaks in different geographical
regions. The project will yield fundamental new insights into stratospheric
circulation systems and their coupling with the weather at the earth's surface,
including new knowledge about near-surface cold-air outbreaks and their
regulation by stratospheric processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
