This project involves an updating and upgrading of materials testing facilities
through the purchase of an universal testing instrument and associated software.
The equipment primarily impacts four courses: Mechanics of Materials, Structural
Engineering, Structural Behavior, and Materials of Engineering. Only the first
of these courses previously had a materials testing laboratory component; the
project instrumentation allowed the addition of this capability to the other
three courses.
