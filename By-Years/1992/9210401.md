The objective of this project is to develop a quantitative thermodynamic basis
for the analysis and design of protein separations, comparable to that which is
routinely applied to non-biochemical separations in the chemical process
industries. The theoretical work will be complemented by experiments addressing
several aspects: characterization of structural and functional protein
properties, measurement of thermodynamic properties to verify the validity of
the thermodynamic descriptions, and separations experiments to evaluate the
predictions of performance based on the thermodynamic models.
