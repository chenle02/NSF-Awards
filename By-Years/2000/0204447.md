This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Using Geographic
Information Systems in spatially explicit analyses of population genetic
structure." This research uses geographic information systems (GIS) to explore
methods that incorporate explicit environmental information in distributional
analyses of genetic variation within species. The investigations are focused in
Southern California, where previous research has produced detailed environmental
data layers and many genetic data sets for species in similar functional groups.
It is being determined the extent to which landscape-level processes influence
the creation, distribution, and maintenance of genetic biodiversity across this
region.
