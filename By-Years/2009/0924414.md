This proposal seeks NSF funding for an interdisciplinary conference to be held
at Florida Atlantic University in 2010. The conference will focus on improving
our understanding of the networks in the brain that are responsible for the
generation of thought. The study of human brain function is possibly one of the
most important endeavors for society. While there has been an explosive amount
of research in basic neurobiology in recent years, progress has been limited in
understanding the brain networks that govern the cognitive processes of thinking
and intelligence. Conference participants will gain an overview of the present
state of research on brain networks from various perspectives, including
neurobiology, functional brain imaging, and cognitive science.

Understanding the integrated functioning of brain networks remains a significant
scientific challenge with enormous implications for the diagnosis and treatment
of cognitive disorders that result from impairment to the brain. These disorders
include a wide array of symptoms associated with stroke, Alzheimer's disease,
schizophrenia, and depression, to name a few. The overall aim of the proposed
conference is to bring together an outstanding group of researchers to examine
the dynamics of cooperative brain function from a multidisciplinary approach,
and to educate the next generation of researchers on important topics at the
frontier of studies in these disciplines. The highly interdisciplinary nature of
the proposed conference is likely to promote new and existing collaborations.
The funding will bring world-class experts to the meeting, and also enable
undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to
participate in the meeting with reduced fees and opportunities for travel
support. The speakers will include women and members of underrepresented
minorities. A critical outcome of the conference will be to produce an ongoing
web-based resource providing essential information on the brain networks of
cognition to the scientific community and the general public.
