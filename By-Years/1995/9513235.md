9513235 Pullin This Americas Program award will fund travel and related expenses
for a group of U.S. scientists to participate in a workshop on quantum gravity
to be held in Punta del Este, Uruguay, March 25-27, 1996. Organizers are Dr.
Jorge Pullin, Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Rodolfo Gambini, Ministerio
de Educacion y Cultura, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay. This
award will fund two U.S. senior scientists and seven junior researchers. Its
purpose is the exchange of ideas and recent research in the field of quantum
gravity. The proposed format of the workshop is a three day meeting with plenary
sessions by leaders in the field, and contributed papers and posters by
scientists of the region and U.S. participants. Scientific activity in the
Southern Cone of South America has grown at a steady pace in the last ten years.
In the area of quantum gravity, the region has three small but internationally
highly visible groups. This workshop will allow young researchers from the
region and the U.S. to exchange ideas and establish ties that may give rise to
future collaborations. ***
