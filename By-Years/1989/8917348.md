The Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains has the most
complete Gondwana sequence (Victoria Group of the Beacon Supergroup) in
Antarctica. This sequence is overlain by tholeiitic flood basalts of the Ferrar
Group which are related to Gondwana fragmentation. The volcanism and flood
basalt eruption reflect a major change in tectonic environment in the
Transantarctic Mountains, from a foreland basin associated with an active plate
margin to a continental rift related to Gondwana breakup. The objectives of this
project are to: 1) establish a detailed stratigraphic framework for the
volcanogenic rocks in order to assess the importance of regional thinning of
units and of syndepositional extensional normal faulting; 2) investigate the
paleovolcanology of this sequence, in particular that part of it formed by
phreatomagmatic processes, in order to understand the physical environment in
which the rocks were formed and the relations to the inferred tectonic setting;
3) further characterize the geochemistry of the volcanogenic rocks in order to
better define time dependent changes in magma compositions and possible
relations between the silicic and basaltic rocks; 4) attempt a preliminary
assessment of possible source regions for the silicic magmas.
