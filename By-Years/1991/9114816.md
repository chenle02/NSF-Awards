Professor Ulmer will work on the arithmetic of elliptic curves and automorphic
forms over function fields. In particular, he intends to work on analogues of
the conjecture of Mazur that asserts that the group of rational points on an
elliptic curve defined over a function field over a finite field in a certain Zp
extension is finitely generated. This project falls into the general area of
arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
