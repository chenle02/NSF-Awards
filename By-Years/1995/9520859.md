9520859 STRATTON We are studying the variation in growth and the timing of
reproduction in species of Potentilla in response to a gradient in the timing of
snow melt in alpine environments. We ask whether the observed variation results
from phenotypic plasticity or genetic differentiation. Experiments will
manipulate the timing of snow melt which determines length of the growing
season. Reciprocal transplant experiments and plant density manipulations will
determine whether adaptation to sites of one snow melting regime are ineffective
in other types of regimes. The responses of broad-ranging versus more restricted
species will be compared to determine how variation in growth and reproduction
restricts species boundaries. Our results will increase our understanding of the
importance of species-level variability in responding to environmental change.
More specifically we will determine how alteration of snow-melt regimes due to
climate change could lead to sustained phenotypic responses, shifts in
distribution limits, or local extinctions in alpine plants.
