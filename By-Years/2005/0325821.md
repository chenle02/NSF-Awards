The study of rice has tremendous potential impact, both because it is a useful
monocot plant model and because it is a direct source of molecular tools for the
analysis and manipulation of nearly every cereal grass crop. The high degree of
synteny (parallel organization) among cereal genomes makes it possible to relate
rice chromosomal regions, regulatory patterns, and genes to those of maize,
wheat, barley, sorghum, rye, and other key crops. Laser capture microdissection
(LCM) makes it possible to isolate RNA and other molecules from individual
visually selected cell types. This project combines LCM with microarray analysis
of gene expression to prepare a cellular atlas of expression profiles. This will
consist of a public database that provides information about the expression of
15,000 rice genes initially, and subsequently on all 60,000 genes of rice in
every cell type. This will serve as a resource for studies of physiology, growth
and development of rice and other cereals, with an unprecedented resolution. The
database will accommodate future cell-specific data collected under special
conditions, such as stress or pathogen attack. The project will develop LCM
techniques to gain access to every cell type of rice, and will rely on rice
whole-genome microarrays being developed in another NSF project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific deliverables of the project will be the further
development and testing of LCM in rice and the production of an expression
profiling atlas of 125 rice cell types. These will be released to the publicly
available website at a schedule of 10 in year 1, 15 in year 2, 50 in year 3 and
an additional 50 by year 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach and training
activities will include participation in Family Science Days at the Peabody
Museum on the Yale campus and contributions to museum displays on plant
genomics, targeted to a K-12 student audience. &lt;br/&gt;
