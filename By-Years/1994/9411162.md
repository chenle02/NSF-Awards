9411162 Lau During election campaigns voters are exposed to large amounts of
information about candidates. In some cases voters can choose whether to pay
attention, while in other cases the information is so ubiquitous that voters can
hardly avoid it. But in all cases, the flow of information is dynamic, one day
information of a candidate's position on an issue is readily available, the next
day it can hardly be found. Yet, researchers use static surveys as the method of
choice for studying campaigns. Surveys, however, can only capture a single point
in time, relying generally on the voters' memories of what they have seen and
paid attention to. The elections's dynamic nature is missing. One important
result of this mismatch is that while we can make good predictions of the vote
choice, we cannot do nearly as good a job describing how voters come to their
choice. This Doctoral Dissertation research project is designed to develop a
better understanding of the vote decision process by using a dynamic, computer-
based methodology to trace information acquisition and decision-making while it
is occurring. In particular, the question of whether voters employ an "on-line"
or a "memory-based" evaluation process will be explored. Traditional voting
models all suggest a memory-based model, where voters store information about
candidates during the campaign and search the contents of memory in order to
evaluate and choose at the "moment-of-decision." Were the model correct, then
surveys conducted near the time of decision would be an ideal methodology for
studying the vote decision because memories could be accurately recalled. The
on-line model argues instead that voters maintain an "on-line tally"
representing the current evaluation of a candidate; when the time comes to make
a choice, voters need not search memory for detailed information. Indeed, that
information has often been forgotten. Instead, they merely recall the tally
associated with each candi date and choose accordingly.
