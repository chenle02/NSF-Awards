This is an international travel grant to support three U.S. investigators to
travel to Costa Rica for NSF program development in joint cooperative earthquake
engineering research initiatives. The team of three U.S. investigators led by
Professor A. Veletsos of Rice University, will meet with Costa Rican
counterparts from the University of Costa Rica and structural engineering firms
in the City of San Jose, Costa Rica. This effort will lead to the development of
research cooperation between the U.S. and Costa Rica in the areas of advanced
technologies involving seismic design and geotechnical aspects of earthquake
engineering in connection with structural systems, architectural components,
siting, and soil foundation research.
