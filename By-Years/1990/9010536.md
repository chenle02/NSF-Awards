This Research Initiation Award will support Dr. Hansen's research in speech
recognition under conditions of noise and stress. Initial simulations show that
stress compensation can improve Markov-based recognition rates by as much as 42%
(over a 60% decrease due to noise and stress). Dr. Hanson has collected a
database of over 16,000 stressed and unstressed utterances, including speech
from psychiatric patients and from people enduring high acceleration forces. His
data also include examples of the Lombard effect, in which individuals modify
their speech to overcome environmental noise.
