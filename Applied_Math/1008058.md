The investigator gives careful mathematical treatments of a variety of
dynamical and steady-state nonlinear problems for deformable rods, shells, and
three-dimensional solid bodies, possibly in contact with moving fluids, variable
temperature fields, and electromagnetic fields. The bodies are composed of
nonlinearly elastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or magneto-(visco-)elastic
materials. In each case, properly invariant, geometrically exact theories
encompassing general nonlinear constitutive equations are used. The goals of
these studies are to discover new nonlinear effects and new kinds of
instabilities, determine thresholds in constitutive equations separating
qualitatively different responses, determine general classes of constitutive
equations that are both physically and mathematically natural, determine how
existence, regularity, and well-posedness depend on material behavior,
contribute to the theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and
develop new methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective computation for
problems of solid mechanics.

For treating the behavior of both new technological materials and old
biological materials, such as living tissue, traditional theories, based on such
simplifying assumptions as small deformations and linear response, may well fail
to capture important physical phenomena and may, in fact, give misleading
information. E.g., the study of a specific problem for a traditional theory may
indicate that a dangerous instability occurs in a solid body when an externally
applied load or frequency exceeds a certain threshold. An analysis of the same
problem without the simplifying assumptions may well show that a large class of
materials give rise to instabilities at thresholds much lower than those
predicted by simplified theories. Since correctly formulated exact nonlinear
problems of solid mechanics seldom can be directly subsumed under available
mathematical theories for treating the governing equations, one purpose of this
project is to develop new mathematical techniques to handle such problems. These
techniques can treat whole ranges of materials at one time. The results have
consequences for structures under loads (bridges, buildings, biological
structures), for control of "smart" structures, and for micro-electro-mechanical
systems (MEMs).
