&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0430304&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Wetherall, University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past
several years, Internet denial-of-service (DoS) flooding attacks have become
more frequent, larger, and more sophisticated. The root cause of these attacks
is that the existing Internet architecture allows any party to send packets to
any destination at any time, regardless of the wishes of that destination. To
address this problem, the investigators are experimenting with a new
architecture in which destinations have control over the network resources used
to reach them. Capabilities, represented by tokens carried on packets, are the
mechanism that is used to affect this control. The architecture provides two key
benefits. First, it aims to provide a long-term solution to the problem of DoS,
rather than a further step in an arms race with attackers. Second, it controls
DoS while preserving the traditional openness of the Internet architecture,
lessening the need for firewalls and intrusion detection systems that hinder the
growth of new kinds of applications. A prototype of the architecture is being
built for trial deployment on the Internet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
