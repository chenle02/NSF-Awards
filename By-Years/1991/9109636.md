The objective of this project is to study the problem of coordinating the
production of a seat of assemblies and of the components required to produce
them when the component production yields and the demand for the assemblies are
random. This problem is one of inter-plant coordination since the components and
the assemblies are usually produced in different plants. The project is
motivated by a problem in semiconductor manufacturing where a set of chips
(components) is used to produce different thermo- conductor modules
(assemblies). The problem is formulated as a stochastic program. The research
effort is divided between approximation schemes that exploit special structures
of decomposition procedure that solves the problems in two stages. An important
tool is a new lower bound on the expectation of the minimum of a set of random
variables. Proper plant coordination should result in higher expected (utility
of) profit and in an increased ability to satisfy demand for the assemblies.
Moreover, it should reduce the burden for the plants producing components by
releasing components for production in the right mix.
