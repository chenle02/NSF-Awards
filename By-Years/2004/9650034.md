The aim of this project is to strengthen the Microbiology/Cell Biology
concentration by adding two new courses (Medical Microbiology and Molecular
Biology); by purchasing new equipment, including fluorescence and inverted
phase-contrast microscopes; and by equipping a new laboratory with an upgraded
refrigerator, incubators, and phase-contrast/darkfield microscopes. These
interrelated plans enhance students' preparation by enabling them to learn new
laboratory techniques and by providing a greater variety of meaningful research
projects. It also allows the program to serve a larger enrollment in the
existing Cellular Physiology and Introductory Microbiology courses.
