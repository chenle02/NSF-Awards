This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes
the unsupervised extraction of contextual information from dedicated video
surveillance cameras by providing a mechanism to manually inject pieces of
semantic, using semantic knowledge as seed information to learn statistical
context models for: functional components, Environmental components, targets,
temporal components, and integrating the learned contextual information into
video surveillance systems.

Automatic exploitation of context from video will benefit: core computer vision
research areas such as segmentation, background-modeling, tracking, and
classification, event detection, automatic unusual behavior detection; abnormal
target behavior, weather conditions, sequences of events, and the like and event
handling. This project will have the most impact in the homeland security and
law enforcement areas.
