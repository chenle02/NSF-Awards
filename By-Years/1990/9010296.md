Most past research on the youth employment effects of the minimum wage focuses
only in men, or makes no distinction between men and women. The aim of this
project is to fill this gap in our knowledge by examining the labor market
experience of the 6,398 young women survey in the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth (NLSY). A measure of employment effects will be the time it takes to
get a first job after leaving school. If the young woman drops out of the labor
market or has difficulty finding a job after leaving school, the effects are
likely to persist in alter life. Hence, this first spell of non-employment is of
intrinsic interest. In later work, subsequent employment histories will be
analyzed and the as will the determinants of the decision to terminate or
continue schooling. The results of the research will be of interest for a umber
of reasons. First, little is known about the effects of the minimum wage on the
employment of young women. Second, there has not been any work on employment
effects of the minimum wage which uses recent American data. The NLSY also
includes much more detailed information about the family and community
background of the teenagers than previous studies have been able to take into
account. Finally, the NLSY over-samples blacks and hispanics so it will be
possible to do a detailed analysis by race.
