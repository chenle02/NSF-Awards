This is a conference organized by the American Psychological Association. It is
a convening of 30 assessment experts in psychology meeting in a workshop format
to identify best practices in assessment of the undergraduate psychology major.
These assessment experts are being drawn from both associate and baccalaureate
degree-granting psychology programs. Their primary focus will be on identifying
evidence-based assessments. Their secondary focus is the development of a plan
for disseminating these best practices and innovations to undergraduate
psychology programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Psychological
Association has promulgated goals and learning outcomes for the psychology major
for more than a decade. However, there have been only modest efforts to provide
evidence-based assessment practices. This project will align improved assessment
tools with the carefully laid out standards of performance embodied in the APA
Guidelines 2.0, written in 2013. These Guidelines specify five major goals of
the psychology major, including scientific inquiry and critical thinking. These
guidelines provide a modern foundation for department planning at the associate
and baccalaureate level.
