This doctoral dissertation award will support an economic analysis of riparian
wetland forests in the agricultural midwestern United States. The purpose of the
project is to test the hypothesis that riparian wetland forests have been
undervalued and therefore underproduced in the Corn Belt. This project seeks to
examine the benefits of riparian wetland forest to society by developing a model
that links floodplain land use with economic values of environmental services.
Among the most promising alternatives for reducing the damage to streams and
rivers is protection of floodplain lands as riparian wetland forests. This
project will have significance for policy regarding nonpoint pollution control
and farmland retirement programs. It underlines the need to recognize the
importance of the interaction between water quality and agricultural practices.
