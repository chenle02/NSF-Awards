As jury trials have become increasingly complex, state and federal court systems
have begun to implement innovations to the trial procedure aimed at improving
jurors' understanding of evidence. For example, several state courts are now
experimenting with allowing jurors to take notes or expanding preliminary
instructions. Most research looking at the effects of such changes in courtroom
procedure have been done at the level of the individual juror. Although several
field studies have begun to assess how these innovations may affect jury
functioning, there has been virtually no group-level experimental research in
this area. This project tests how jury innovations might affect the process and
outcome of jury deliberations. Influential models of juror decision making tend
to focus on individual- and not group-level processes. Even models of jury
decision making ignore the group process and predict group decisions solely from
pre-deliberation verdict preferences. Central to the research is a model of
group-level reasoning and an in-depth analysis of group deliberations. Two goals
of this study are to discover how changes in courtroom procedure may change the
manner in which individual jurors process evidence and also how such changes
affect how juries discuss the evidence. Results of this study, therefore, have
implications for psychological theories of individual and group decision making,
and should also prove valuable to federal and state court system policy makers
as they consider implementing these changes.
