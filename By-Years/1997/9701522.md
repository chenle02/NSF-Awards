9701522 RALEIGH The University of Hawaii will operate the R/V MOANA WAVE in 1997
as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects.
The MOANA WAVE is a 210' research vessel owned by the U.S. Navy and operated as
a UNOLS vessel in support of academic research. The ship is scheduled for 190
days of which 170 are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. All of the cruises
are in the Pacific with three NSF cruises in the vicinity of Guam. The remaining
NSF cruises are of short duration out of Hawaii in support the Hawaii Time
Series project. In addition the vessel will support three short cruises for
NOAA. The MOANA WAVE is part of the academic fleet used by NSF to support
oceanographic research. Most oceanographic research requires highly specialized
equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship for which the ship must
be specifically designed. This equipment also requires highly trained crew
members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same
manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the
operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic
research that are operated by universities and research institutions around the
country. ***
