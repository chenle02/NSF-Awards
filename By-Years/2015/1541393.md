Modern research is increasingly data-based, whether the endeavor is in the
physical, biological, or social sciences. Increasingly that research calls for
large amounts of data to be transferred, modified, synced, and reliably stored
for both the short and long term. The remarkable increase in both the generation
and use of digital data and data tools has left many researchers behind. The
primary mission of the CyberInfrastructure Engineer (CIE) is to significantly
engage in the interaction between researcher and technology via personal support
and consultation, and to teach introductory classes on selected topics, with a
net goal of bringing useful technologies to more
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CIE is working to improve the data-driven
nature of scientific research in three parallel avenues: 1) data safety through
the deployment of automated systems to move large scale research data to off-
site systems; 2) data transfer through the use of state-of-the-art tools and
systems currently unknown to many researchers; and, 3) data performance by
expanded use of the highest-performance storage, retrieval, and processing of
very large datasets. UCI is evaluating a number of competing designs and
services for a large-scale campus storage pool, creating a hybrid backup system
that caches data locally before sending it on via our NSF-funded Science DMZ
(UCI-LightPath) to longer-term, less-expensive, Cloud backup systems, and
automating and using existing high speed data transfer protocols to be much
easier for researchers to take advantage of.
