The study of electoral behavior occupys a prominent place in research on
American political behavior. However, very little attention has been directed
toward assessing the role an individual's own views play in assessing a
candidate's position, when the candidate has not made that position clear. This
Doctoral Dissertation Research project provides support for an investigation of
the extent to which individuals project their own political views onto
candidates who resort to generalities and inconsistent statements in their
campaign messages. Using an experimental design framework, this research
examines the relationship between the ambiguity of candidate issue positions and
individual projections. Do people project their own views onto an ambiguous
candidate? If so, what mechanism underlies this process? And does this mechanism
suggest that candidates can garner more favorable images by being ambiguous? The
answers to these questions will contribute to our understanding of electoral
politics, as more explicit links will be drawn between voter evaluations and
candidate qualities. In particular, this research will help delineate (a) the
extent to and conditions under which voters will project their own views onto a
candidate, and (b) the extent to which a candidate can manage his/her impression
among voters by being ambiguous about his/her policy positions.
