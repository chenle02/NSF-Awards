ABSTRACT DMS - 0204725. PI: Qiu-Dong Wang

This research proposal is mainly on the subject of non-uniformly hyperbolic
strange attractors. We propose to apply an abstract setting we previously
formulated and studied to rigorously prove the existence of non-uniformly
hyperbolic strange attractors in certain systems of ordinary differential
equations, including a modified system of van der Pol and certain periodically
excited systems experiencing Hopf bifurcations. We also propose to analytically
establish the fact that non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors naturally
arise when an asymptotically stable periodic solution of a given system of
ordinary differential equations is periodically excited by generic external
forcing. These non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors have properties that
include most of standard mathematical notions associated with chaos: positive
Liapunov exponents, positive entropy, SRB measure, exponential decay of
correlation, nice symbolic coding of orbits etc. We also propose to study the
geometric structure of the integral manifold of the spatial four-body problem.

This research proposal is mainly on the subject of non-uniformly hyperbolic
strange attractors. In general an attractor is a state to which a system will
eventually evolve. One of the most important way of studying systems in nature
is to first model then study them as solutions of certain differential
equations. We propose to apply a theory we previously developed to prove the
existence of a class of strange attractors in some systems of differential
equations arisen from various scientific disciplines including in the studies of
turbulence, fluid mechanics and plasma mechanics. The attracting states we
propose to study have very complicated dynamical properties and sophisticated
geometric structures. They were observed in many numerical and laboratory
experiments but their existence were rarely established mathematically in the
past. We also propose to study the geometric structure of the integral manifold
of the spatial four-body problem. This is a long standing mathematical problem
with potential applications on orbit design for artificial celestial objects.
