Problem III of the EqPac Science Plan states that new production is less than
expected in the central equatorial Pacific for the levels of primary production
and nutrient concentrations observed. The explanation may lie in the rates and
mechanisms of particle cycling. The P.I,'s propose to participate in the survey
cruises in the central equatorial Pacific at 140oW, to deploy an array of
floating sediment traps at each station and to measure the fluxes of: 1. total
mass; 2. particulate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (POC, PN, PP); 3.
chlorophyll and phaeopigments; 4. particle reactive radiotracers: 234Th, 210Pb
and 210Po; 5. major phase elements: Al, Sr, Ca, Mg, and Sr; 6. stable tracer
elements: Fe, Mn, Pb, Ba, Cd, Cu, and Zn. The P.I.'s will also collect and
analyze dissolved and particulate water column samples for 234Th, 210Pb and
210Po.
