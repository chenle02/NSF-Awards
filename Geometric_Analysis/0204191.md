DMS-0204191 PI: Georgios Daskalopoulos

The PI proposes three projects. In the first, the PI proposes to study
regularity of harmonic maps into the completion of Teichmueller space. The two
main applications are on symplectic Lefschetz pencils and on superrigidity of
lattices in the mapping class group. In the second project the PI proposes a
proof of higher dimensional partial analogues of the conjectures of Atiyah and
Bott on Yang-Mills equations over Riemann surfaces. These are nontrivial
generalizations to higher dimensions of the PI's previous work on the connection
between Yang-Mills and the theory of holomorphic vector bundles. Finally in the
third project the PI proposes some questions about harmonic maps from three-
dimensional manifolds to trees which generalize the well-known theory of
harmonic maps from surfaces.

The motivation for the first project is to use harmonic maps in order to
understand analytically the results of Kaimanovich-Masur and Farb-Masur on the
superrigidity of lattices of rank at least 2 in the mapping class group. In the
process the PI realized that the methods should also shed light in the rank one
case. The second project shows that there are still very close connections
between the analysis of the Yang-Mills equations and algebraic geometry. These
connections have been exploited in great detail by several people in the case of
Riemann surfaces but very little is known in higher dimensions. The PI's work
sheds some light in this direction.
