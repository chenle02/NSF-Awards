Scholars and journalists have long recognized a phenomenon called “rally ‘round
the flag” in which citizens support their country’s leaders during a time of
crisis. In the current era, however, increased political polarization may mean
citizens never support leaders from an opposition party regardless of national
and world events. We investigate whether a new formulation of the “rally ‘round
the flag” effect has emerged: “rally ‘round democracy” – i.e., crises now lead
to an increase in support for democratic principles among citizens in democratic
countries instead of increased support for political leaders in those countries.
We collect survey and social media data during the Russian invasion of Ukraine
to study the opinions of citizens in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Germany and the rhetoric used by political leaders in those countries during
wartime. This unique dataset of public opinion and elite rhetoric is available
for use by other researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We conduct a multi-country,
multi-wave design to test the emergence and responsiveness of “rally ‘round the
flag” and "rally 'round the flag" patterns and effects during the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. Since the research is conducted during the conflict, the
concurrent social media analysis allows us to speak to differences between the
public and “opinion leaders” during a crisis. The survey takes place over three
waves – two during the crisis, and one after the crisis largely concludes (or
becomes significantly less salient in each of the three countries). We use
social media to capture elite rhetoric in each country to track what they say
about the crisis and their country’s political leadership. We merge the social
media data with our surveys to contextualize our participants’ media
environments. In sum, this project allows us to open the “black box” that often
hides public opinion on foreign policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
