Computing - Other (35)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops an Information
Systems Security course which involves students working with authentic, real
projects, including small for-profit or not-for-profit organizations. The course
is not focused on technology, such as encryption, malware, intrusion detection,
and authentication, but rather on the less technical side of IS security,
including policy development, application development, fraud avoidance, and risk
management. Such knowledge is useful for security analysts, auditors, and
security-oriented systems analysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students working with
a small organization see a broad picture of how security can be implemented for
a constrained problem. This project develops a case study where students work
with an ongoing scenario in class through the semester. The case study includes
sufficient structure, including PowerPoint slides, an organizational
description, skeleton security documents, and lab scenarios. The case study
enables students to discuss solutions and to implement one. They work with
skeleton documents that can then help them to apply security concepts to a real-
world environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is interdisciplinary,
bringing together faculty from computer science, accounting and management
information systems, to ensure a real business case is considered - and to learn
from each other's expertise to provide a broader understanding of the problem.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project benefits the teaching community via a case
study developed for active learning labs related to information security,
network security, and security design. The program develops comprehensive
security materials scaled down and tested for use with small organizations or
businesses. Targeted community partners include not-for-profit organizations,
which help the underprivileged or minority-owned small businesses.
