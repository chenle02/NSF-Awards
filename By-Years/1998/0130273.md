Recent research has documented dramatic population declines and extinctions of
frogs, toads, and salamanders in many parts of the New World tropics, a pattern
seen in North America and elsewhere in the world. We propose the formation of
RANA, the Research and Analysis network for Neotropical Amphibians, to
coordinate scientists from a variety of institutions examining this issue. The
goal is to promote collaborative research that takes advantage of the tremendous
habitat and taxonomic diversity of the New World tropics. Members of RANA will
collect data to test leading hypotheses for population declines, including
disease, climate change, and UV-B radiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reports of
extinctions, deformities, and population declines of amphibians frequently
appear in the popular media, and represent a modern day mystery to scientists.
The global nature of this biodiversity crisis means that we have to look outside
of our borders to provide insights on why large numbers of frogs are
disappearing in many regions of the US, including Sierra Nevada and the Cascade
Mountains. This project will produce a bilingual Spanish-English publicly-
available website with information on amphibian declines and a database with
information on the status of all species of the New World
tropics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
