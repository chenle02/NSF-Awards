This award is to support collaborative research between Dr. Walter Klemperer,
University of Illinois, Urbana, and You Xiaozeng, Nanjing University, on
polyoxoanions as organic oxidants. In this research, the effectiveness of
certain chemical compounds as catalysts for organic oxidation will be
investigated with the objective of determining the oxidation mechanisms
involved. This research will draw on the interests and capabilities of the two
PI's and allow them to complement and strengthen research efforts already
underway on the organic chemistry of polyoxoanions. The joint efforts to prepare
polyoxoanions which can be characterized and used to perform organic oxidations
is expected to help determine the mechanisms involved in the oxidation process
of certain early transition metal oxides which are extremely difficult to
characterize.
