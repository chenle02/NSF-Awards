The principal investigator proposes to study several long-standing problems
involving forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) and
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), as well as their applications
in stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance theory. The main
contributions of the research include a new notion of forward-backward
martingale problem (FBMP), along with a general framework for studying the well-
posedness of the weak solutions of FBSDEs; and a study of stochastic
characteristics for fully nonlinear SPDEs, a potential fundamental building
block of the theory of stochastic viscosity solutions. The well-posedness of a
class of FBSDEs with jumps and possibly super-linear growth coefficients, as
well as its application to a class of optimal investment/reinsurance problems
with general insurance models will also be investigated. The PI also proposes to
continue his research on stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance
problems. Two particular problems: one involving the dynamic pricing of the
"Universal Variable Life" insurance, and the other involving systems driven by
normal martingales (or martingales satisfying structure equations) will receive
strong attention. The latter is also considered as a theoretical extension of
the proposed optimal reinsurance problem.

Almost all the proposed projects have strong background in applications,
especially in stochastic control and stochastic finance/insurance. Many of these
problems reflect the new trend of securitisation of risks in insurance products
and pension plans, and the results are expected to have broader impact on
actuarial mathematics, financial mathematics, and could benefit the insurance
community for good contract designs. The proposed project on the weak solutions
for FBSDEs, especially the new notion of FBMP, will fill the gap in the theory,
which has been left open so far. The proposed project on stochastic
characteristics of fully nonlinear SPDEs will bring new insight to the notion of
stochastic viscosity solutions, and is expected to substantially advance the
general theory.
