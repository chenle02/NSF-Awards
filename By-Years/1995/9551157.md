Park, PA 16802-1503 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Chemistry Title: Acquisition
of a Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is
serving as an integral instructional tool in our undergraduate chemistry
courses. The major use of the instrument is in the organic chemistry laboratory,
but students in the Special Problems and Research course are using the IR for
both instructional and research needs, while first year students are gaining
experience on the IR in the introductory chemistry course. Students are using
the instrument to confirm the identity of products and impurities, estimate the
proportions in a two-component mixture, identify functional groups in an unknown
substance, and reveal the typical complexity of many natural mixtures such as
citrus oils and gasoline. As part of the treatment of the electromagnetic
spectrum, students match a small set of compounds with their IR spectra.
Students store libraries of spectra and search such libraries easily.
Manipulation of stored spectra, such as the subtraction of solvent and
impurities spectra, is routine.
