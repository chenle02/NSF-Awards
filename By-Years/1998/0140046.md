During the initial stage of relativistic nuclear collisions, enormous amount of
energy is deposited in the collision region and the temperature and density can
be high enough that individual hadrons lose their identities. Instead of being
confined in hadrons, quarks and gluons can now move "freely" in this collision
region. The matter thus produced is called the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The
transition between hadronic matter and the Quark-Gluon Plasma gives us insight
into the interactions between quarks and gluons under extreme conditions. It is
also useful for the understanding of processes going on in other high
temperature and/or high density regions, for example, in the early Universe and
in the cores of neutron stars. To extract information about the Quark-Gluon
Plasma from the experimental observables, to bridge the initial quark and gluon
distributions and the final hadron distributions, the PI will investigate the
effects of the space-time evolution of the strongly interacting matter produced
in relativistic collisions. In particular, a transport model approach will be
further developed and used as the major theoretical tool for a detailed study of
the transient formation and evolution of the finite size, ultradense system
produced in relativistic nuclear collisions with nonequilibrium, viscous effects
automatically taken into account. The research will advance the understanding of
strong interaction physics that is the focus of current experiments at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the
nuclear physics program at the future Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
