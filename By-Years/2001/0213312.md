The design or reform of electoral rules has been a subject of intense debate in
many countries all over the world. Moreover, the choice of an electoral system
may have important economic consequences, because of the induced difference in
terms of the elected policy-making body. In this project I compare proportional
representation systems and majoritarian systems in terms of: (1) the number of
effective parties; (2) the expected policies, policy variance and welfare; (3)
corruption; (4) strategic versus sincere voting; (5) affirmative action and
gender equality. These objectives are pursued theoretically as well as
empirically: the representative democracy model has to allow for strategic party
behavior, strategic voting, free entry of candidates and new parties, and
incumbency advantages, and politicians must be allowed to have both policy
preferences and private objectives. With all these ingredients the model
suggests that majoritarian systems induce more policy variance, less corruption,
and less gender equality: these and many other predictions will be tested on
international data and on the basis of some detailed country studies.

The theoretical and empirical conclusions of the project can be important for
electoral design in new democracies as well as for electoral reforms in
established democracies. Beside the consequences of electoral formulas, the
policy relevant conclusions of the project will involve the comparison of closed
versus open list systems, the effectiveness and desirability of gender quotas,
the optimal legal thresholds in proportional systems, and the optimal mix of
public and private campaign financing. Moreover, the theoretical framework will
probably be very useful for future researchers interested in other aspects of
democratic policymaking.
