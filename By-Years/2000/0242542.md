Understanding the basis of gene expression is vital if researchers are to
dissect the complex biology of living organisms. The Bacillus cereus group
represents a diverse collection of bacteria capable of living in a range of
habitats and infecting a range of hosts. Spontaneously occurring phenotypic
variants are being isolated and characterized with a view to providing insights
into how these organisms regulate gene expression. A combination of traditional
microbiological techniques coupled with DNA-based micro-array technology will be
employed to uncover the basis of each variant providing fundamental data of
value to researchers working in this area.
