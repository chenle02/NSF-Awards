This research is concentrated at the interface of probability and analysis,
where martingales, harmonic analysis, analytic functions, and Brownian motion
overlap. Part of the research involves the study of a class of operators which
are called the projections of martingale transforms. Basic properties of these
operators ares examined together with their connections to probabilistic
products and to singular integrals. This research conducted at the border
between analysis and probability, demonstrates an extensive and balanced
knowledge of both and results in a cross-fertilization where fundamental tools
in one area are applied to the other. The research goes a long ways toward
answering Gundy's 1983 conjecture that the law of the iterated logarithm, which
holds for martingales, should also hold for harmonic functions. This is a
fundamental question which asks for a precise description of how the two basic
operators on harmonic functions, the nontangential maximal function and the
Lusin area function, control each other.
