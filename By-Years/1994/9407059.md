9407059 Osteryoung North Carolina State In this project in the Chemistry
Division, Dr. Janet Osteryoung will lead a delegation of U.S. chemists to Poland
to seek ways to develop mutually beneficial research projects, personnel
exchanges, and other scientific interactions. The visit, which is coordinated
with the Polish Chemical Society (PCS) and the Committee on Scientific Research
(KBN) of the Polish government, will give the American chemical community a
better insight into the actual state of chemistry in Poland, identifying
strengths, weaknesses, and grounds for collaboration. The delegation will make
recommendations about initiating useful cooperative efforts, and the results
will be disseminated in a report to the American scientific community.
