This project will attempt to quantify the influence of temperature,
precipitation, slope gradient and azimuth on the nature, rate and products of
weathering of granitic rocks. The dependent variables examined are the change in
modal mineralogy and bulk chemistry when the parent rock disintegrates to sand-
sized material, and the survivability of mineral-mineral interfaces in sand-
sized rock fragments within the weathered grus. The independent variables are
mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, temperature-weighted
precipitation, and the mean gradient and azimuth of the slopes on which
weathering takes place. Five lithologically identical plutons in diverse
climatic settings have been chosen for study, which allow the pair-wise
comparison of weathering settings in which four of the 5 independent variables
can be held constant, while the fifth attains high and low values in the two
members of the pair. The analysis of interface survival encompasses stereologic
analytic methods that have never been applied to sedimentary petrography before
and a new conceptual framework for viewing the rock fragment population of
sands. Potential exists for the development of lithological indicators of past
climatic change.
