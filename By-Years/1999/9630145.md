The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the viability of cost-
effective parallel computing techniques for two application domains that make
computing ubiquitous. The first one is parallel databases embodying a
clients/server paradigm used in data mining/data warehousing applications. The
second one is the physical simulation of virtual multimedia environments that
has potential use in several everyday situations. The challenge in this domain
is to perform realistic physical simulation in real time of multiple actors
(some real and some synthetic), each with several degrees of freedom. This
research will investigate the system architecture issues in the design of
parallel (cluster) servers engineered with commodity processing and network
components for supporting such applications. A shared address space across the
cluster is an attractive abstraction from the perspective of programming such
applications. However, accessing and caching data from this shared address space
can be expensive in terms of observed latencies in a cluster. Therefore, clever
techniques that hide the communication overheads for accessing the shared
address space are imperative to achieving good performance. The ultimate goals
is to make the cluster server appear as though the applications incur zero
overhead for communication. Specific research issues to be addressed in this
research include (a) mechanisms for realizing shared address space across the
cluster, (b) mechanisms for supporting variable granularity, caching, explicit
communication, and synchronization (within the framework of shared space)
tailored to the needs of these applications, (c) hardware assists necessary to
make clusters appealing as cost-effective parallel machines, and (d) detailed
performance evaluations of cluster servers under such multimedia and database
workloads.
