Myxococcus exhibits striking coordinated movements involving thousands of
individual cells. Myxobacterial cells move by gliding, a form of translocation
restricted to surfaces. Despite the complexity of their movement, myxobacteria
have the structural, chemical, and genetic simplicity of Gram-negative bacteria.
How myxobacteria glide, and how they communicate with each other to coordinate
their gliding, are the subjects of this research. Mutants that had lost the
ability to glide from a single mutational step were all found to be defective in
producing the same protein, mg1A, which implies an important role for this
protein in gliding. Antibodies have been raised to mg1A protein, and will be
used to find the number, location, and distribution of this important gliding
protein in the cells. How production of mg1A protein is regulated has been
determined by study of its messenger RNA. Another gene, called tgl, is used to
control gliding by cell - cell interactions. Tgl is necessary for socially
motile cells which move when they are within a cell's length of another cell.
Tgl is also necessary for a cell contact dependent stimulation of motility
whereby cells in a mixture of two different nonmotile mutants can move
transiently. The location of tgl protein in cells, and what happens to the
protein during stimulation, will be determined. The highly organized movements
of myxobacteria are in some ways clearly analogous to morphogenetic movements of
cells during development of multicellular animals. The structural and genetic
simplicity of the myxobacterial system allows these phenomena to be studied more
readily than in more complex biological systems. The results of these studies
are expected to shed some light on general principals underlying cellular mass
migrations.
