This is a study of the impact of local area characteristics on the aspirations
and attainments of individuals. It will investigate the spatial organization of
labor market structures, attaching data on the geographical unit to the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Economic and sociological models of attainment,
mobility, and career processes will be expanded to include the place of work,
and the mechanisms explaining the role of local effects will be studied using
multilevel analytic techniques. Two major attributes of local area are
hypothesized to have impact on status attainment: the opportunity structure, and
the local cultural milieu. This study brings together two influential research
traditions, by examining both how individuals attain occupational status and how
labor markets shape job opportunities. It will contribute to the knowledge base
for policy decisions concerning the American system of employment, and it will
improve social- scientific understanding of social processes that shape local
economies.
