This project supports student travel to participate in the 26th International
Meshing Roundtable conference will be held on September 18-21, 2017 in
Barcelona, Spain. Meshing is the decomposition of complex objects into simple
parts for design, display, and analysis. As technologies change in computing and
computer-aided design and manufacturing the demand for meshing seems only to
increase.

The IMR conference includes four short courses, four invited speakers, and
presentations of reviewed papers, research notes, and posters, and a
professional development session particularly targeting students and postdocs.
This award will support registration and some travel expenses for a dozen
students (undergraduate to postdoctoral, coming from U.S. universities, national
labs, or non-profit research organizations) to exchange ideas with experts from
around the world, fostering collaboration and recognition that can help them
launch their careers. (For selection criteria, see the conference web site
http://www.imr.sandia.gov/26imr)

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
