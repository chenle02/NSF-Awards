*** 9760197 Tomsic This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
investigate a non-vapor deposition method to deposit YBCO that will provide
c-axis texture on textured buffered metal substrates, similar to vapor
deposition Processes. This approach will provide an economical and practical way
to develop 5-25 micron textured YBCO deposits with high superconductor to sheath
ratios compared to vapor deposition processes. This will enable higher
engineering current densities for these high temperature superconductors. The
proposer will investigate various textured substrates, processing parameters for
developing YBCO on long length conductors. YBCO high temperature superconductors
on textured metal samples has been demonstrated with current densities of
700,000 to 1,000,000 amps/cm2 at 77 K by various research organizations on short
samples using static vapor deposition equipment on textured substrates. The
development of high temperature superconductors at 4-77 K, will enable the
commercialization of HTSC motors, generators, fault current limiters,
transformers, and transmission cables. ***
