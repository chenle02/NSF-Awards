The Particle and Nuclear Physics group at James Madison University aims to be a
key contributor to state of the art research in Intermediate Energy Nuclear
Physics while providing an outstanding educational experience for undergraduate
students. The three faculty members and their students focus on research
designed to explore the structure of nucleons (neutrons and protons) which are
the basic building blocks of any atomic nucleus. While it is understood that
nucleons are composed of three interacting (via gluon exchange) quarks (viewed
as fundamental particles) the picture of the mechanisms that give rise and
govern the evolution of multi-quark systems (protons, neutrons, nuclei) is not
yet complete. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group participates in studies aimed at
clarifying this picture by charting the structure of nuclei and nucleons using
electron, muon, and photon probes. Group members are deeply involved in the
efforts of building the hardware (detector development), software, as well as
the organizational infrastructure needed to carry out this research program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently the group is actively involved in ongoing
research at Jefferson Lab in experimental Halls A, B, and C (inclusive electron
scattering off the nucleon, duality studies, strangeness production) and
Fermilab (the muon gyromagnetic constant, g-2). Additionally, the JMU-PNP group
members are key participants in detector and software development (Hall C:
scintillator hodoscope detector, ROOT/C++ data analysis code; Hall B: forward
tagger, preshower calorimeter) that is part of the 12 GeV energy upgrade at
Jefferson Lab and are principal investigators on experiments that will take
advantage of this upgrade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group's success can be
measured through the number of publications, signaling the deepening of our
understanding of subnuclear matter. Equally as important success can be gauged
also through the number of undergraduate students that gain invaluable
experience by pursuing research in our group.
