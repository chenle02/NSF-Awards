Narrative: The recent emphasis on RDNA Technology has completely overshadowed
efforts to recover naturally synthesized proteins that are present in trace
amounts in blood plasma and are presently being discarded. This proposal intends
to bring together experts from industry and academia to field important
questions regarding the recovery of trace proteins via plasma fractionation. It
is intended to assemble a complete list of protein candidates that have high
potential for medical use. Also, to discuss the economics for recovery and
whether or not RDNA Technology would be better suited for their manufacture. A
final report will summarize the workshop and hopefully point the directions for
funding basic and applied research in the field of plasma fractionation.
