This proposal is a request for funds to support student participants at the
1993 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental Biology. The Conference will
be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on
the weekend of March 12-14, 1993. The general goal of this conference is to
bring together a broad range of developmental biologists, at various stages in
their careers, to present and discuss their research in formal and informal
settings. As in past conferences, an attempt will be made to integrate research
on plant and animal developmental biology to enhance communication between
groups that traditionally have been separated. The 1993 conference will include
four formal platform sessions and two poster sessions, as well as two featured
presentations by prominent developmental biologists. There will be ample time
for informal discussions during the mixers and poster sessions, and during the
meals, which will be in MBL's dining hall. One of the attractive features of
this conference is that it provides students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior
faculty with the opportunity to present their work to a diverse group of
developmental biologists in a supportive congenial atmosphere. Accordingly, the
established investigators chairing the platform sessions are encouraged to
solicit presentations from graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior
faculty, and all graduate students attending the meeting are encouraged to
present their work in the poster sessions. Abstracts will be published in The
Biological Bulletin.
