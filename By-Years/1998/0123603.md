This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic program supports
research on the synthesis and study of single molecule magnets (SMMs) by
Professor George Christou of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Florida. These molecules behave macroscopically as magnets at low temperature
but exhibit quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) which is responsible for
loss of magnetic behavior at increasing temperature. A series of new SMMs will
be produced from carboxylic acid derivatives of polynuclear manganese complexes
as well as from some iron compounds. Supramolecular aggregates of SMMs will be
synthesized in order to raise the barrier to QTM and allow them to operate as
magnets at temperatures higher than a few degrees Kelvin.

The goal of this research is to develop molecular magnets which ultimately can
operate at practical temperatures, analogous to the development of higher-
temperature superconductors. The results of this research will lead to an
enhanced understanding of the factors which produce magnetic behavior in these
molecules, as well as to the factors controlling its loss at higher
temperatures. The students involved in this multidisciplinary project will
receive broad training which will prepare them for careers in both industry and
academia.
