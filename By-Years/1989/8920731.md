This renewal grant is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program. Dr. Zweifel
is continuing his fruitful development of organometallic regents that contain
unsaturation(carbon-carbon double or triple bonds). These reagents have the
potential to provide new routes to the unusual structures found in some
pheromones in some pests and in some compounds used by sea organisms to
communicate with each other. The specific aims of the research are: (a)
elaboration of the ethynyl and enol ether groups of 1-methoxybut-1-en-3-yne into
substituted five- and six-membered ring lactones, acylsilanes, 1,3-diynes, and
yne-1,2-propadienes. The special merit of this lies in its potential for
transforming an inexpensive starting material into diverse and synthetically
attractive derivatives; (b) exploitation of the three potentially nucleophilic
centers of 1-(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-diyne derived mono- and bis(stannyl) enynes
for syntheses of beta-alkylidene-gamma-butyrolactones and beta, gamma-
unsaturated valerolactones. The biological activities of these hitherto not
readily accessible systems remain to be explored. The palladium-catalyzed cross-
coupling reactions of stannyl enynes with electrophiles will be investigated to
gain access to stereodefined conjugated ene-dienes, yne-dienes, and ene-diynes
whose structural features occur in many fungal metabolites, which possess
antibiotic activity; (c) preparation of chiral 3-borolenes and investigation of
their use as templates for effecting acyclic stereocontrol with concomitant
control of absolute stereochemistry in syntheses of quaternary carbon centers
and compounds having three consecutive stereogenic centers.
