The objective of this project is to examine the role that cytoplasmic
determinants play in the development of polyclad flatworms, one of the most
primitive of the spiralians with typical quartet spiral cleavage. Early
determination is characteristic of the polyclad Hoploplana inquilina but is less
rigidly programmed than that of the higher spiralians. Dr. Boyer proposes to
develop a cell lineage of the hoploplana embryo, an important tool for analyzing
experimental data, by injecting fluorescent dextran into blastomeres and tracing
the fluorescence to larval structures. She will examine development of specific
larval structures, the determination of symmetry, and the time and site of
localization of determinants by using blastomere deletion and separation
techniques, cutting uncleaved eggs, and altering cell geometry. In addition SEM
and TEM will be employed. %%% Cytoplasmic localization is a fundamental
developmental mechanism employed by eggs and early embryos in determining the
ultimate body plan of the adult. This process is most easily studied in simple
systems. This study will contribute to our understanding of one of the universal
mechanisms of early development from both ontogenetic and phylogenetic
perspectives.
