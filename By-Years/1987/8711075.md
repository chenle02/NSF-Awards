This is a proposal to study the primary mineralogy and composition of an upper
mantle peridotite and its subsequent alteration. The peridotite samples are
obtained from a 39.5 meter section of drill core obtained during ODP Leg 103 at
the Galicia Margin. The study will involve petrographic and microprobe analyses
of approximately 50 thin sections cut from various parts of the core, focusing
on the central and least altered peridotite, in order to characterize the
alteration mineralogies and textures, and to determine relict igneous minerals.
Sr isotopic analyses will be performed in an attempt to determine the age of
implacement and to further characterize the alteration history of the core. Some
attempt will be made to incorporate these data into a coherent tectonic picture
by estimating the P- T of the alteration assemblages. Studies such as this are
of fundamental importance to understanding the tectonic and thermal evolution of
the oceanic crust and upper mantle, and its penetration and alteration by
circulating fluids.
