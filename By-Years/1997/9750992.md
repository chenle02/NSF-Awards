The aim of this project is to expand and modernize the laboratory exercises in
the Mechanical Engineering Technology course in Physical Measurements. The
course has been predominantly lecture (42 out of 60 hours). Although the course
material deals with more than 50 types of sensors, laboratory experiments allow
practice with only 12 sensors, and data are taken manually, giving students no
experience with computer data acquisition. The objectives of this project are to
acquire a larger number of sensors for use in additional exercises, so students
gain practical experience and familiarity with the sensors; to include modern
computerized data acquisition equipment and techniques; and to shift the course
emphasis as much as possible from passive lecture experience to active
experimental experience, while using the strengths of multidisciplinary teams of
Electrical Engineering Technology students and Mechanical Engineering Technology
students to broaden the knowledge of students from each discipline. Articles
resulting from this laboratory development can aid other similar programs in
choosing laboratory equipment for such upgrades and justify and promote the use
of active, versus passive, learning, particularly with multidisciplinary teams.
