Continents slowly drift across the Earth's surface due to the forces of plate
tectonics. Oceanic crust is generated at mid-oceanic ridges and is returned
after some one hundred million years back into the Earth's interior at
subduction zones. Seismological investigations give us a blurry few of the
subducting slabs that appear to sink towards the base of the mantle. Geochemical
sampling at mid-oceanic ridge volcanoes and at hotspots such as Hawaii tell us
the long term story about how the ancient slabs are absorbed by the mantle and
brought back up by the slow churning of mantle convection. The formation and
recycling of oceanic crust has a clear strong influence on the chemical and the
thermal evolution of the Earth, but we remain in the dark as how changes in
physical properties, that occur deeper in the Earth, affect the behavior of the
crust and its mixing back into the mantle. This research project will add a
third way of looking at the dynamic Earth by use mathematical models that
predict how plate tectonics affects the composition and thermal state of the
Earth. The mathematical models are suited to predict the dynamical evolution of
the Earth over its entire age. The predictions can then be compared to the
observations of the present day Earth (as provided by seismology) and the longer
term perspective that geochemistry provides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new
aspects of the modeling approach include the consistent treatment of
compressibility and the associated phase changes that occur primarily between
440 and 670 km depth in the Earth's mantle. The compressible effects will allow
the PI to consider thermodynamically consistent modeling where the results can
be compared directly to seismological observations of the present day state of
the Earth's mantle. The investigators will use high resolution finite element
models of mantle convection that include a energetically consistent approach to
simulated plates.
