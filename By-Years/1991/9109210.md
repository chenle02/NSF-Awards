Although powerful, the transaction model adopted in traditional database systems
is found lacking in functionality and performance when used for applications
that involve reactive, long-lived and collaborative activities. The following
are some of the issues that arise in the context of the extended transaction
models that have been proposed to address this lack: correctness properties of a
model vis a vis visibility, consistency, recovery, and permanence (e.g.,
traditional transactions guarantee failure atomicity, serializability, and
permanence.); similarities and differences between two transaction models;
constraints on using two models in conjunction; and, mechanisms needed for
managing extended transactions. These issues motivated the development of ACTA,
a comprehensive formalism which characterizes the effects of transactions on
each other and on objects in the database. ACTA's ability to deal with existing
extended transaction models and correctness notions is indicative of its
generality. The need for extended transactions emerges from the demands of
applications, such as CAD/CAM, software development environments, object-
oriented databases, and distributed operating systems. By providing a formal
framework in which to capture the properties of extended transactions, and
thereby identifying the needed transaction management mechanisms, this work is
producing results that will impact these information-intensive application
areas.
