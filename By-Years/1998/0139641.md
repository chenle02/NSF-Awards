AST 0139641&lt;br/&gt;PI: Timothy H. Hankins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end state
of stellar evolution for many stars is collapse into a highly compact object.
These objects often appear as radio sources emitting very frequent short
radiation pulses and have become known as pulsars. Pulsars offer many examples
of extreme physical conditions that cannot be realized in the laboratory. In
this project, Dr. Timothy Hankins and collaborators will study the pulsar plasma
region via its coherent radio emission. The research team will carry out a
combination of observational and theoretical studies in order to determine
conditions in the radio emission region and to test current theoretical models
of that region. High time resolution observations with a new data acquisition
system capable of time resolution as short as one nanosecond will be used
directly to confront and test the theory. The theoretical modeling will predict
the characteristic time signatures arising from plasma dynamical processes that
are believed to occur in such regions. The new instrumentation will be made
available to the radio astronomy community.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
