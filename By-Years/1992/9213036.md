A high-temperature differential microcalorimeter for the study of gas adsorption
on high-surface-area materials is designed and constructed. The system is
designed to operate at temperature up to 625> K, using special materials for
this propose. For operation below 450> K, the pressure-gauge heads will be
inside the controlled-temperature region, as with present near-ambient designs;
for operation in the "high- temperature" region (450-625> K), the system can be
reconfigured to place the pressure gauges outside the high- temperature zone.
The system will be used in combination with catalytic tests to correlate carbon
surface chemistry with the catalytic behavior of carbon-supported metal
catalysts, including iron-containing bimetallics. It will also be used in
studies of diamond powder and of nanoparticles of silicon nitride.
