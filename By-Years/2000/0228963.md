ABSTRACT AST 0228963

The Combined Array for Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) will merge at a new site two
existing telescope arrays currently supported by the Division of Astronomical
Science's University Radio Observatories (URO) Program. These are Caltech's
Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) array of six 10.4-meter-diameter
telescopes, and the Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association (BIMA) array of nine
6.1-meter-diameter telescopes. CARMA will achieve resolutions as high as 0.2
arcseconds at a wavelength of 1mm and, due to its heterogeneous combination of
telescope diameters, will provide excellent imaging on all angular scales.
CARMA's sensitivity in the 1 mm band will be an order of magnitude greater than
that of the existing arrays due to the lower atmospheric attenuation of the new
site (an 8000' plateau in the Inyo Mountains about 15 miles from the current
OVRO site), and the merged array's greater collecting area, improved receivers
and spectrometer, and adaptive atmospheric phase correction. The new science
enabled by CARMA covers a broad range of astronomical topics, including star
formation and molecular clouds, studies of external galaxies, cosmological
studies using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and the investigation of solar
system objects.
