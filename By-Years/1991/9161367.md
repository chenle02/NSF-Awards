This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is in the
general area of Computational Chemistry. Global optimization plays a key role in
molecular computations in computational chemistry. Due to the large size of even
modest molecules, these methods must contend with countless local minima. Clever
algorithms have been developed that sample parameter space to reduce trapping in
local minima, but these fail by providing statistical rather than guaranteed
solutions. There is a class of algorithms that for certain functions guarantee
that a global minimum has been found. These methods achieve this remarkable
result using interval arithmetic. Interval global optimization has been known
for some time, but has never been applied to systems as large as those
encountered in computational chemistry. This project will identify how to modify
the functions encountered in computational chemistry such that interval global
analysis applies. It will also explore the parallel programming techniques
necessary to scale the calculations up to the huge sizes demanded by molecular
mechanics calculations.
