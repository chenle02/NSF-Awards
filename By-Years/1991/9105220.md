The Department of Mathematics at Brown University will purchase computer
equipment consisting of workstations, networking hardware, and programming and
symbolic algebra software which will be dedicated to support research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: (1) the study of wave phenomena, the numerical
computation of singular integrals related to free surface problems in non-linear
fluid dynamics, the scattering frequency of linear waves, and the unstable
solutions of nonlinear dispersive waves; (2) various problems in number theory
and arithmetic geometry, such as arithmetic properties of Weierstrass points,
p-adic dynamical systems and the fields generated by the fixed points of such
systems, canonical heights on elliptic curves over number fields, and the
Diophantine geometry of K3 surfaces; (3) boundary value problems and eigenvalue
problems for elliptic differential operators.
