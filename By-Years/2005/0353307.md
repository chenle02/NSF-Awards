0353307&lt;br/&gt;Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-Taiwan joint workshop
on advanced geophysical research in active tectonic areas proposed in December
2003 in Taiwan by Dr. Francis Wu, SUNY, Binghamton, and Dr. Kuo-Fong Ma of the
National Central University, Taiwan. Dr. Wu and other proposed U.S. attendees at
the workshop have worked extensively in Taiwan. Arc accretion is the most
important mode of continent formation throughout the post-Archean earth. Taiwan
offers the possibility of studying these processes in the world's most active
arc collision zone. Workshops such as this are essential for developing a large
complicated, international project and for establishing good communication among
collaborating scientists and working out the logistics for the planned large
international project. The project is jointly supported by the National Science
Foundation and the National Science Council of Taiwan. &lt;br/&gt;
