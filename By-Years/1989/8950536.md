The purchase of a 200Mhz FTNMR is being used to upgrade and modernize several
courses which are basic to the chemistry and biochemistry majors. This
instrument is providing a significantly better and more exciting research
environment for the students who engage in undergraduate research. The 200 Mhz
FT NMR is replacing the 20 year old 60Mhz CW instrument the department currently
owns. This instrument is being used in Organic Chemistry to introduce
experiments to analyze a broad range of compounds using 3 C as well as 1H NMR
spectroscopy. In the Physical Chemistry laboratory course, the theory and
advantages of Fourier transform techniques as well as the advantages of modern
NMR technology is being taught. This instrument will continue to help the
department to attract and retain women to careers in Chemistry and Biochemistry.
The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
