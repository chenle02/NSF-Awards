9530187 MONTOYA Denitrification (=respiration of oxidized nitrogen to dinitrogen
gas) results in the loss, from the biosphere, of combined nitrogen, a critical
nutrient for plant growth. The magnitude of denitrification affects the rates of
decomposition of organic matter in the water column. Changes in these rates can
alter the balance between the amount of carbon that reaches the deep ocean and
the amount of CO2 available in the atmosphere. The project will be conducted in
the Eastern Tropical North Pacific where suitably low oxygen waters persist.
Various measurements of denitrification in this environment will address
research questions that are crucial to understanding nitrogen and carbon cycling
in the ocean. State-of-practice N-15 techniques and isotope ratio mass
spectrometry will be used to determine dinitrification rates. ***
