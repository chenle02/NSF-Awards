Object-oriented languages offer one promising approach to making programs
easier to write and easier to modify and extend. Unfortunately, object-oriented
language constructs often incur a substantial run-time cost. To improve the run-
time performance of object-oriented languages, previous research applied
intraprocedural class analysis and compile-time class prediction to determine
the actual classes of arguments to a dynamically bound call at compile-time,
thereby statically binding the call to the target procedure and enabling inline
expansion to eliminate the overhead of the call. This work was performed
primarily in the context of purely object-oriented languages. The goal of this
project is to extend previous work in three directions. First, the scope of
analysis will be expanded to the whole application program. This necessitates
developing and evaluating techniques for constructing call graphs for object-
oriented languages and performing interprocedural class analysis. Second,
profile information will be incorporated into the analysis and optimization
process. In particular, profile information can provide much more accurate class
prediction information than can static estimation techniques. Third, procedure
specialization will be selectively applied to the optimization of object-
oriented languages. The goal will be to investigate the relative trade-offs in
cost and benefit among inline expansion, procedure specialization, and
interprocedural analysis for object-oriented languages. The suitability of these
techniques across a range of object-oriented programming languages, both pure
and hybrid, will be evaluated in this effort.
