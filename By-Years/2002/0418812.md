This award provides partial support for the acquisition of two major equipment
items: (1) a Carbon-Nitrogen analyzer, and (2) an ion chromatograph. The
instrumentation will be installed in a new laboratory at The Woods Hole Research
Center (WHRC). The instruments all share the common focus of enhancing
analytical capacity to study nitrogen (N) cycling processes in terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems. In addition, the capability for analyzing ammonium and
nitrate in soil solutions and stream water will be enhanced. These instruments
will also facilitate studying the efficacy of the denitrifying wastewater system
at WHRC's new building and facilitate development of new projects. The research
projects that will be advanced by acquisition of this instrumentation are
directly relevant to important societal concerns regarding the health of forests
that are experiencing increasing loads of N in atmospheric deposition,
increasing climatic stresses, and increasing risks of deforestation.
