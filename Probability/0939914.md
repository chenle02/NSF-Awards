This award provides travel funding to increase US participation in the half-year
program on Stochastic Processes in Communication Sciences at the Isaac Newton
Institute at Cambridge University, January 11 through July 2, 2010. The program
aims at the exposition of the latest developments in mathematical sciences that
sit at the boundary between the disciplines of stochastics and communications.
The program will bring together experts from the mathematics, probability,
engineering, and computer science communities, to advance the field and identify
important research directions. Up to twenty Visiting Fellows will be in
residence at any time through the period of the program, and additional Program
Participants will be invited for shorter periods. Four transversal workshops, a
satellite workshop for young researchers and several shorter events are being
organized, the primary ones being: (1) New topics at the interface between
probability and communications (11 - 15 January 2010); (2) Stochastic Networks
(22 - 26 March 2010); (3) Spatial Networks (6 - 9 April 2010); (4) Satellite
meeting for young researchers (At ICMS, Edinburgh, 7 - 11 June 2010); (5)
Statistics of Networks (21 - 25 June 2010). The NSF funding will be used to
facilitate the interaction of young US researchers with the top researchers in
these areas who will be in residence at the Newton Institute during this
program, by supporting the travel of junior researchers (graduate students,
post-docs, and faculty members at most seven years beyond Ph. D.), woman
researchers and researchers from underrepresented minorities.
