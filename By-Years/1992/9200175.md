The project provides opportunities for mechanical engineering students to
participate in research related to real problems involved in manufacturing
systems, control systems, thermal systems and fluid mechanics. The research
projects assume completion of the junior year in a standard mechanical
engineering curriculum and build upon the student's education in one or more of
the following courses: dynamics, kinematics, controls, fluid mechanics and heat
transfer. Students selected to participate in the program are offered the
opportunity to visit the campus prior to the start of the summer experience.
During the visit, they meet with the PIs and the research advisors. Matching of
the students and advisors is thus accomplished prior to the start of the
research experience.
