A Program to Improve Laboratory and Classroom Instruction of an Undergraduate
Social Science Curriculum The proposal is for equipment which will allow five
social science departments to build upon a successful National Science
Foundation LOCI grant received by the Departmment of Sociology in 1982. The
curriculum implemented in the Department of Sociology with the LOCI funds
integrated research methos into the the content of courses spanning the entire
curriculum. A recent purchase of a laptop computer/video projection system
permittd this successful pedogogy to be expanded to non-majors in large
introductory courses. Funds from this ILI grant would expand this pedagogy to
the departments of anthroplogy, geography, political science and psychology. The
ILI funds will create a 30 workstation social science computer laboratory and
procure additional video projection equipment. The project has strong
institutional support and College funds are committed to the planned upgrading
and replacment of the requested equipment.
