Maize is a major crop in the U.S. and a classical genetic system, particularly
well suited for cytogenetics. Its genome is divided among 10 chromosomes, and
gene locations can be charted in one of three fundamentally different ways-
analysis of trait linkage for a genetic map, DNA sequence determination for a
physical map, and microscopic visualization for a cytogenetic map. Integration
of the three map types in fruit flies and humans has proven to accelerate
genetic research. The production of a similar trio of integrated maps for maize
would advance understanding of the genetic material of one of the world's most
important cereal crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes advantage of
recent advances in cytogenetics and new plant genomic resources from other NSF
Plant Genome Research Program projects. The goal is to produce a cytogenetic map
of the entire maize genome. The rapid and cost-efficient method this project
will employ is to use segments of sorghum DNA (maize-marker-selected sorghum BAC
clones) as probes to stain the corresponding regions on maize chromosomes by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The results will be integrated with
other genome maps and released immediately into GenBank and MaizeGDB for public
access. The project will advance downstream research by aiding in physical map
assembly, establishing new reagents for chromosome research, and providing
insights into the evolution of maize and related
grasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables for this project will be the
development of FISH mapping tools and the placing of 500 loci on the cytogenetic
map of the maize genome. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A local outreach project, the
Maize 10 Maze project, will use the new cytogenetic map to guide the production
of a field replicate of the maize genome in which individual rows represent
single chromosomes. This self-guided public tour of the maize genome will raise
public awareness of how plant genome research can benefit society, relating
genome research to issues of public interest such as food production, plant
biology, renewable energy, and genetic diversity.&lt;br/&gt;
