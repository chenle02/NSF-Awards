Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project, titled Ike Wai from the
Hawaiian words for knowledge and water, will address the critical needs of the
state to maintain its supply of clean water, most of which comes from
groundwater sources. This supply is under increasing pressures from population
growth, economic development, and climate change. Effective management of water
resources requires detailed understanding of the underground geologic features
that determine the flow paths of subsurface water; these features are
particularly complex in Hawaii due to its volcanic origins and history. This
project will greatly improve understanding of where the water that provides for
the needs of Hawaii?s cities, farms, and industries comes from and how to ensure
a continued, high quality supply. The project team will engage and collaborate
with federal, state, and local agencies and community groups concerned with
water management. Training and education initiatives will prepare a diverse
workforce capable of meeting the research and policy-making challenges of the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;The overarching
scientific goal of this project is to generate more accurate and detailed models
of Hawaii?s aquifers, water flow, and transport processes. Geophysical imaging
will be used to produce high-resolution 3D maps of subsurface geologic
structures. Aquifer volume, flow, and connectivity will be measured by well
monitoring, geochemical and submarine groundwater discharge analyses, and the
use of microbial diversity as a novel groundwater tracer. The project will also
establish the Integrated Knowledge Environment, a centralized
cyberinfrastructure platform for data storage, high performance computation,
numerical modeling, and visualization. This resource will include data from the
project as well as legacy and new data from governmental agency collaborators,
and will serve as a tool for both research and water management decision
support. The modeling tools and knowledge gained through this project will be
extensible to other volcanic Pacific islands. The project will provide training
in geophysics, hydrology, and data science to undergraduates, graduate students,
and postdocs, and also provide career development mentoring to these groups and
junior faculty. Emphasis will be placed on the recruitment and retention of
women and under-represented minorities, particularly Native Hawaiian and Pacific
Islanders.
