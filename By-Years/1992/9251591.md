The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier Transform infrared
spectrometer for use in several lower division chemistry courses. This includes
courses for both majors and non-majors. In the Chemistry for Non-Scientists
course, students examine functional groups in commercial polymer films. In the
general chemistry course, measurements are made of the spectra of various
oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen groups. In organic chemistry, Friedel-Crafts
acylations are performed. In the analytical chemistry course, students identify
the components of the gas phase mixture that forms above concentrated nitric
acid, and also conduct an experiment to determine trace analytes.
