This award supports a study of the potential of thermoluminescence (TL) to date
high Arctic deglacial marine sediments. A suite of modern and, independently
dated, early Holocene and Late Quaternary sediments were specifically collected
from western Spitsbergen to explore new TL methods to date deglacial sequences,
as well as to test the accuracy, precision and temporal limitations of the
technique. This research is designed to provide needed insight into the basic TL
properties of sediments and to develop procedures that can routinely date
sediments. The focus of laboratory studies will be to gain a better
understanding of which particle size and mineralogic component yield the most
chronologically sensitive and stable TL signal. This study will outline the
fundamental basis for extending the TL method to Arctic deglacial marine-
sediments, ultimately providing a new method for constraining the timing of Late
and Middle Quaternary Arctic glaciations.
