AST-9731052 ABSTRACT Funds will be used to develop the Advanced Spectral Imager
(ASI) which will use Fabry-Perot interferometry to provide high spectral
resolution images with sub-arcsecond image quality over a wide field of view.
The ASI will provide two-dimensional maps of velocity, spectral line strength,
and spectral line width for astronomical objects. The ASI design is based on
successful experience with the Rutgers Imaging Fabry-Perot system currently in
operation at CTIO.
