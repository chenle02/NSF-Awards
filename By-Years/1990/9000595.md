The Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD) is the parsent-day manifestation, at
a divergent plate boundary, of a region of low gravity and anomalously deep
ocean floor between Australia and Antarctica. The AAD also contains the boundary
between Pacific- type and Indian-type global-scale isotopic provinces. The
spreading axis within the discordance displays an unusual, crenulate offset
pattern and, at constant (medium) spreading rate, almost the full spectrum of
axial ridge morphologies. Coupled with this morphologic and tectonic diversity
is an unusually broad geochemical diversity that appears to require a broad
range of primary magma compositions which require, in turn, a broad variation in
conditions of melting. The principal investigator led a successful cruise to the
area in 1988 and obtained 15 days of SeaMARC II side-scan coverage and 26 new
dredge hauls. The objectives of this work are to: determine, in as fine detail
as possible, the nature and location of the isotopic boundary; fully define the
geochemical and petrologic diversity of AAD lavas and to understand the
underlying petrogenetic causes for this diversity in relation to tectonics and
MORB genesis in general; and define and evaluate the diversity of lavas along
one section of the ridge in terms of distinctively different processes by which
they evolved.
