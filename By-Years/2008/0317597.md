A program is to provide RET for secondary schoolteachers. The proposal is to
continue and expand it's RET program developed in 1999 at the Cornell Center for
Materials Research (CCMR). An estimated number of participants are over 200
children, 100 teachers, and 80 families. The Center proposes a two-stage
program. In the first stage dubbed, RET-I, the teachers spend an intensive week
in each of the four key facilities of the CCMR, following the initial week of
orientation, and prior to the final week of curriculum development. The second
stage, or RET-II includes teachers involved in one-on-one research with a
faculty mentor working on a developed research proposal.
