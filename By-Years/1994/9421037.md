9421037 Trenary The metal borides are intriguing materials that are extremely
hard, chemically inert, and have very high melting points. Many of these solids
have unique properties making them useful in various applications. For example,
lanthanum boride and cerium boride are widely used as electrmn emitting cathodes
in a variety of electron optical devices and are far superior to tungsten and
other refractory metals for this purpose. High-quality single crystals of
yttrium boride are being developed for use as monochromators of 1-2 keV
synchrotron radiation. Because of the importance of surface structure and
surface properties in thermionic emission, the rare-earth hexaborides have been
the subject of many fundamental surface science studies. Yet many of the most
important properties have not been investigated. One of the most important
questions in the use of hexaborides as cathodes concerns their interaction with
the background gases present in all vacuum chambers. In this work, reflection
absorption infrared spectroscopy will be used to characterize the adsorption and
decomposition of simple background gases on the lanthanum boride and cerium
boride surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy also will be used for structural
studies of the number of technologically important metal boride surfaces. %%%
Little is known about the surface chemistry of boron-rich solids. These solids
constitute a wide and varied class of materials. They are of high interest to
the electronics industry as cathodes for electron beam lithography, and electron
emitting cathode in a variety of electron devices. Furthermore, transition metal
diborides as thin films in metal surfaces are important application areas
requiring ultra-hard coatings. ***
