Though radioactivity is widely used in bioassays due to its high sensitivity and
convenience, safety and environmental concerns have accelerated efforts to
eliminate its use. Several recent examples of procedures using luminescence have
surpassed conventional isotopic methods. Among these, luminescence of firefly
luciferase is the most efficient known. The investigators have completed
significant new research advancing the knowledge of the enzymatic mechanism of
firefly luciferase. The new chemistry provides greater luminescence intensity
with simpler reaction kinetics. To gain a broader perspective of properties of
beetle luciferases and to develop enzymes better suited to commercial
applications, the investigators propose to examine the structure and function of
several divergent isozymes by using cDNA clones already isolated coding for
these isozymes. Phase I will assess the feasibility of this proposal by
expressing and purifying the cloned luciferases in E.coli developing methods for
random mutagenesis, and initiating crystallization studies. Phase II will focus
on characterizing the recombinant luciferases, examining their relative
structural relationships, enhancing their properties by random mutagenesis, and
generating protein crystals of the new isozymes. Phase III efforts will use the
knowledge acquired on enzyme property enhancement to develop a number of
bioassay-related and other commercial applications.
