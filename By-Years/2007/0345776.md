&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of methodology
for the preparation of fluorodienes and fluorodienophiles that will participate
in cycloaddition reactions to give molecules of biological and theoretical
relevance. The building blocks under investigation are fluorobutadienes,
fluorocyclohexadienones, fluorovinylsulfoxides and sulfones and fluorovinyl
esters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this RUI award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Timothy B. Patrick in the
Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University. Professor Patrick will
focus his research efforts on developing methodology for the synthesis of
fluorinated building blocks useful for the synthesis of new fluorinated
materials. There is potential for broader impact of the work for the
pharmaceutical industry and the project presents an excellent arena for the
training of undergraduate and masters students.&lt;br/&gt;
