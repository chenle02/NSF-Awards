This award is for renewed funding of a diverse program of research in
elementary particle physics. Support is requested for a senior faculty member, a
postdoctoral research associate and one - two graduate students during the
requested three year grant period. The planned program consists of participation
in four activities: continued analysis of data of three experiments taken some
years ago at Fermilab, R&amp;D on muon subsystems and solar cells as active
calorimeter elements aimed at a detector to run at SSC early next century,
continued construction of the MACRO detector at the Gran Sasso underground
laboratory in Italy, and a search for magnetic monopoles possibly trapped in
meteorites that landed in Antarctica. Approval will be asked of the Fermilab
Program Advisory Committee to build and install at the Tevatron a prototypical
detector to study high rapidity products of p-p collisions.
