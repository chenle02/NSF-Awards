Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is adapting materials from several NSF-
funded projects for the purposes of improving the quantitative and analytical
skills of students in Finite Mathematics, Introductory Calculus, and Elementary
Statistics. The projects include DUE-9451597, "Computer Algebra Laboratories for
Business Calculus," DUE-0089435, "Online Statistics Education: An Interactive
Multimedia Course of Study," and DUE-0127007, "Enhancing Mathematics
Communication: Creating and Delivering Web-based Homework Problems." The
adaptations form the basis of a series of online modules that present
mathematics in relevant contexts and give students the opportunity for hands-on
mathematical experimentation, using computation as a powerful educational tool.
Both formative and summative assessment instruments are embedded in the project
design.
