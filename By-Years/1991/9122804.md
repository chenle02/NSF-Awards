There is much debate in political science literature about whether the rise of
global financial markets is socially beneficial or harmful. Unnoticed in this
debate is the impact which international financial transactions may have on
democratic institutions. For example, do international financial flows prevent
citizens from altering the content and especially the effects of fiscal and
monetary policies through elections? This research investigation addresses this
question by assessing how the workings of the global financial system affects
and is affected by specific features of electoral institutions. The investigator
will attend to this question through the construction and analysis of
theoretically grounded, mathematical and statistical models of financially open
democratic systems. This project should enhance our understanding of the
emerging global financial system by employing a more systematic and sound
approach to the topic than has previously existed.
