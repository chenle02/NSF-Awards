There is a commercial need for higher valued marine polysaccharides which are
used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. This proposal seeks to produce
these materials by enzymatically lowering the sulfate content of certain
seaweed-derived polysaccharides, such as agar and carrageenan. Being able to do
this has substantial potential for satisfying the stated commercial need, and
for producing these materials competitively.
