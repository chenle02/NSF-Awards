The AAAS Project on Science, Technology and Disability will develop, evaluate,
edit, design and publish four concise publications to serve as a comprehensive
accessibility guide for research directors, meeting conveners, department heads,
and professors so that all aspects of their programs will be accessible to
scientists, engineers and students wi physical disabilities. The publications
will be produced in the following order: Barrier-free in Brief: (1) Workshops
and Conferences for Scientists and Engineers (2) Classroom, Labs, and Worksites,
(3) Technology and Human Resources, (4) Out-of-School Science for Students with
Disabilities. The publications will be reviewed by scientists and engineers in a
variety of disciplines and with different disabilities, by Principal
Investigators who may or may not have had persons with disabilities with them by
directors of informal science programs, by young scientists with disabilities
who have participated in precollege science programs, and by members of
disability committees of professional scientific and engineering societies. The
publications will include listings of both human and technical resources.
