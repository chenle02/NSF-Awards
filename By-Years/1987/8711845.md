This U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in physical chemistry between
Dusan Bratko of the University of Ljubljana and Lesser Blum of the University of
Puerto Rico addresses statistical and mechanical problems of solvation phenomena
in simple solvent systems and in ionic colloid systems. The investigators will
emphasize the thermodynamic and transport properties. The research consists in
three parts: study of hard sphere fluid in a confined system, solvation pehomena
in a waterlike liquid and colloidal interactions. The co-investigators have
published jointly and are well recognized for contributions in this field. This
project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science
and Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal
Yugoslav institute. Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and
a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
