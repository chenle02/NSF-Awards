Collaborative Research: Decisions and interactions under risk and uncertainty
within and across cultures This project examines cross-cultural differences in
the conceptualization of risk, uncertainty, and ambiguity, in risk perception
and risk preference, and in the prediction of the (risk) preferences of others
(e.g., opponents in a negotiation), where the other is either from the same or a
different culture. Data will be collected in five countries: the U.S.A.,
Germany, Poland, Hong Kong, and the P.R.C.. There are two questions that guide
the research: (1) On what dimensions related to decision-making under risk and
uncertainty do cross-cultural differences occur? (2) What are the causal factors
that produce these differences?
