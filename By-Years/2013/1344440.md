The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, which
coordinates all U.S. research on the southernmost continent and in the Southern
Ocean. This project has the potential to create an appreciation in a wide
audience about the national importance of the research program supported by NSF
in the Antarctic and the ways in which modern science has advanced over its
antecedents in the "Heroic Era" of scientific exploration a century
ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Antarctic Artists &amp; Writers
program is allow a very small number of professional artists across a variety of
disciplines to experience that research first-hand in order to use non-technical
media interpret the science in that are accessible to a broad swath of the
general public, with the goal of increasing visibility and appreciation for the
science NSF supports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to create
installations in the United States science museums that creatively stage
?virtual encounters? between scientific explorers of the Heroic Age of
exploration at the turn of the 20th century and contemporary scientists,
allowing participants to compare and to contrast the two
eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This medium will allow prospective participants to
explore this material in a new, distinct, fresh and engaging way that immerses
them in the experience and that draws parallels and distinctions between
science, as it was conducted a century ago and how it is carried out
today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation provides access to
US Antarctic Program activities in Antarctica but does not provide funding for
this work.
