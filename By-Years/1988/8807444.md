This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is concerned with the reaction chemistry of compounds containing metal-metal
triple bonds. The structures and reactions of salts of the recently discovered
octahalodiosmate(III) anions will be examined with a view to (a) establishing
the steric and electronic factors that determine the rotational geometry within
the anions and (b) using these compounds as starting materials for the synthesis
of various mononuclear and dinuclear osmium compounds. Synthetic strategies will
be developed for the preparation of triply-bonded dirhenium(II) complexes which
contain bridging sulfur and arsenic ligands. The ability of the triply-bonded
dirhenium core to undergo a 4-electron oxidation will be utilized in the
conversion of dirhenium phosphine halide complexes into dirhenium polyhydrides
and in the reductive coupling of alkyl and aryl nitriles to give metal-imido
complexes. These reactions should constitute important synthetic strategies to
such classes of compounds. The relationship between dirhenium(II) complexes with
rhenium-rhenium triple bonds and hexanuclear trigonal prismatic rhenium(II)
cluster compounds will be examined through attempts to synthesize and
structurally characterize the latter. Compounds containing metal-metal bonds
continue to be of interest as catalysts and as precursors for alloys.
