Chatterjee This research concerns the development of algorithms and software
tools for synthesizing signal processing and control circuits that can perform
highly reliable computations under adverse conditions. This is achieved by the
use of both off-line (passive) and on-line (active) method. The approach is to
extract mathematical models of circuit behavior from high-level descriptions of
circuits, and then operate on them with numerical algorithms. These in turn
generate a group of architectural specifications that are functionally
equivalent. Design optimization is achieved by transformation of the multiplier
constants and restructuring of the circuit flow graphs. The optimizations are
carried out so as to maintain high levels of testability and fault-tolerance
without regard to cost criteria such as node activity.
