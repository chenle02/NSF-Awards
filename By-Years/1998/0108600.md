A three-year program of comprehensive studies of ionospheric E- and F-region
electrodynamics and of related aeronomic issues surrounding meteor-derived
metals in the upper atmosphere is proposed. The proposed studies are based on an
extensive ongoing observing program at Arecibo Observatory (AO) that involves
incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and meteor-mode radar as well as proposed
associated metal (Ca/Ca+, Fe, K, Na) lidar observations. AO is uniquely suited
for these proposed studies with the new dual-beam capability yielding the first
true 3-D observations, extreme sensitivity and directivity in both ISR and
meteor-modes, and the common-volume lidar capabilities. The proposed
observational and theoretical studies are intended to comprehensively test and
extend the hypotheses and conclusions concerning the origin and scale of the
apparently "new" electrodynamic processes resulting plasma-sheets and related
phenomena including true sporadic-E and in firmly tying micrometeoroid
atmospheric-entry processes to the aeronomy of metals in the upper atmosphere
and to provide whole-earth micrometeoroid mass fluxes of unprecedented accuracy.
