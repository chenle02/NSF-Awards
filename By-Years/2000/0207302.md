Filaseta&lt;br/&gt;0207302&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his collaborator
Douglas Meade develop&lt;br/&gt;and implement efficient algorithms for
irreducibility testing and&lt;br/&gt;factorization of polynomials with small
Euclidean norm. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, they classify through similar algorithms
all cases&lt;br/&gt;where reducibility occurs with Euclidean norm bounded by
some&lt;br/&gt;prescribed amount. Issues relating to the complexity
and&lt;br/&gt;parallel implementation of such algorithms are
considered.&lt;br/&gt; Both factoring and, more generally,
computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics have played a vital role in cryptography.
The&lt;br/&gt;importance of algorithms in such applications continues
to&lt;br/&gt;increase as technology advances. This project deals
with&lt;br/&gt;factoring polynomials of high degree from both a theoretical
and&lt;br/&gt;computational point of view. The work has application
in&lt;br/&gt;cryptography and in complexity theory, which deals with
the&lt;br/&gt;question of how much work is needed to solve certain kinds
of&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
