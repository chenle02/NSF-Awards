This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on synthesis
methods to bring the cost of perflurocyclobutyl (PFCB) containing polymers to
commercially practical levels. PFCBs are exciting photonic materials due to
their breakthrough optical performance and manufacturing characteristics of low
optical transmission loss, high Tg, broad refractive index tailorability, and
excellent melt and solution processability. Optical performance is tailored
based on the fluorine content and backbone structure of the polymer, making
synthesis innovation of this family of photonic materials critical to achieving
unique performance and commercial availability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
photonic materials market is projected to grow significantly due to the step
change in performance for electronic materials. Commercialization will be
achieved through sale of the polymer into the optical device market. &lt;br/&gt;
