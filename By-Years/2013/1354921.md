Recombination promotes genetic diversity and the continuous adaptation of
natural populations to ever-changing biotic and abiotic environments. These
well-known advantages of recombination explain why most species reproduce
through outcrossing. Significantly less attention has been paid to the fact that
recombination rates are themselves a variable and evolving trait. Despite the
profound importance of recombination in evolutionary and genetic studies, there
is a significant gap in our basic knowledge of within-species natural variation
in recombination. The PIs propose to take advantage of the unparalleled genetic
and genomic tools available in the model system Drosophila melanogaster to
conduct the first comprehensive study of intraspecific variation in
recombination, from the description of where and how much recombination rates
vary across genomes and among individuals of the same species, to the
elucidation of the molecular causes and evolutionary consequences of this
variation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide a new paradigm within
models of adaptation under suboptimal conditions by investigating a direct
mechanistic link between increased recombination and stressful conditions, the
very same circumstances where recombination may be most favorable. The PIs also
propose a two-pronged approach to increase the participation of women and other
underrepresented groups in science and education. They will organize a series of
high school seminars, focusing on Evolution as a modern scientific discipline,
and create a summer hands-on workshop for future educators. The workshop will
focus on evolutionary and genomic concepts, with laboratory experience and
experimental activities easily transferrable to secondary education settings.
These seminars will enable the participants to confidently discuss contemporary
issues related with evolution and modern genomic techniques (e.g., human and
primate evolution, personalized medicine, etc.) in their classrooms.
