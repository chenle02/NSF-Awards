This project deals with both theoretical and prototyping research in parallel
processing to harness the power of workstation clusters. The primary techniques
will based on aggressive scheduling, evasive memory and dispersed data
management. The formal work expands the previous results of the PIs in
asynchronous computing in several directions: (1) Extend the models to models of
fine-grained programs. (2) Permit the inclusion of architecture specific
characteristics into theoretical frameworks. (3) Techniques to distinguish
inconsistencies in memory states as viewed by different processors resulting
from time-outs, interrupts and failures (or indefinite postponement of a
computation). (4) Techniques to allow non-deterministic executions. (5) Model
input/output operations of fault-tolerant programs. The experimental part of the
project will build a scaled version to execute parallel programs on clusters of
workstations. The prototype will address issues related to the eager scheduling
of threads, the implementation of evasive memory and data management. The
prototype will attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the environment in terms
of efficiency. This project is conducted jointly by P. Dasgupta of Arizona State
University and Z. Kedem, of New York University.
