This award funds research that develops new methods in game theory for modeling
and predicting human behavior in strategic situations where individual beliefs
affect motivation. The goal is to incorporate factors such as emotions,
reciprocity, and social norms into a formal mathematical model of strategic
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his collaborator establish new methods
and new solution concepts for these 'psychological games'. They also develop a
way to model communication between strategic players. They use the new methods
to analyze a number of specific applied problems, including the effect of guilt
aversion on behavior, the role of informal agreements in shaping economic
outcomes, incomplete contracts, and the effect of a desire for revenge on
behavior after an agreement is reached.
