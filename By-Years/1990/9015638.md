Quantized Geometry comprises three closely interconnected areas: (1) The Zeta
functions of elliptic operators, which in topology and geometry are used to
describe non-local numerical invariants like torsion, and in physics are related
to functional integrals. (2) The geometry of certain infinite dimensional spaces
and groups, which have appeared in algebraic topology in connection with the
algebraic K-theory of topological spaces, in geometric topology in connection
with the groups of automorphisms of manifolds, and in physics as mathematical
models capable of incorporating new types of symmetry, like supersymmetry. (3)
Operator algebraic methods which, with the advent of K- theory, became relevant
to differential and topological geometry. This grant will enable a number of
junior mathematicians to participate in a conference devoted to Quantized
Geometry at the Ohio State University in May, 1991.
