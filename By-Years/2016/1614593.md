The 13th meeting of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA) will
take place in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, from June 13-17, 2016. (See
https://bayesian.org/content/isba-2016-world-meeting.) The International Society
for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA, www.bayesian.org) was established in 1992. Its
mission is to promote the development and application of Bayesian statistical
theory and methods useful in the solution of theoretical and applied problems in
science, industry and government. The ISBA meetings are important venues for the
exchange of research ideas in Bayesian statistics. This award will provide
funding for US Ph.D. students to attend and participate in this
meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting on Bayesian analysis will be held
June 13-17, 2016, in Sardinia. The conference will include short courses, oral
presentations, and poster sessions. The oral presentations include the De
Finetti Lecture by Persi Diaconis (Stanford University) and the Susie Bayarri
Lecture by James Scott (University of Texas). NSF funding will allow US Ph.D.
students to attend and participate in this meeting.
