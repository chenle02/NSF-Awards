9411826 KOWAL This award will pay for travel to conduct field work and museum
visits in Switzerland, West Germany and Spain and laboratory supplies for
molecular (chromosome preparation, DNA sequencing) studies to enhance the
dissertation work of a PhD graduate student, Harvey E. Ballard. The research
project of this student involves a phylogenetic analysis of species group
relationships in the large plant genus Viola. This genus includes the "true
violets" and may contain as many as 600 to 700 species. The research proposed
will utilize karyological or chromosomal data (largely taken from the
literature), morphological data and molecular (chloroplast DNA) data to address
relationships of lineages within this large genus. %%% Support for the training
of graduate students in modern systematic methodologies is important for
maintaining a workforce of scientists capable of meeting the questions and
issues of biodiversity which are of increasing global concern. ***
