This research project is designed to accomplish two aims: Aim 1: To construct
and array high-quality BAC libraries to provide a genomic resource on a wide
range of species. Aim 2: To enable researchers working with green algae, non-
seed land plants, and seed plants (including flowering plants) to identify genes
critical for understanding plant form and function and how land plants arose and
diversified. This project will enable progress toward an understanding of the
genetic basis for the transitions that mark the most fundamentally important
steps in green plant evolution. The Deep Green community
(http://ucjeps.herb.berkeley.edu/bryolab/deepgene/index.html) will help to
provide an infrastructure for ongoing scientific exchange. Bioinformatics and a
web site will be provided to the community to access these resources
(http://www.genome.clemson.edu/).

Selected Species: Desired coverage is given in parentheses. Where two coverage
values are listed, two libraries using different restriction enzymes will be
made.
