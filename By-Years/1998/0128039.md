The project is concerned with applications of the recent developments in general
equilibrium theory to problems arising in incomplete markets and finance. When
markets are not complete, an investor, who seeks portfolio insurance, will be
interested in the cheapest hedge that is marketed. Such insurance will not
exactly replicate the desired insured-payoff, but it is the "best'' that can be
achieved using today's market. One of the proposed problems deals with several
new methods of computing the minimum-cost portfolio by applying the newly
developed portfolio dominance method. In another direction, a new incentive
compatibility notion is proposed that will allow to develop a model where the
standard accepted conditions in finance will guarantee that a security that can
be obtained through incentive compatible trading must also allow all of its
options (puts and calls) to be obtained through incentive compatible trading.

Several applications in various disciplines of the techniques that are being
developed in this project are planned. The most important of which seems to be
on the problem of "Optimal Crop Diversification under Uncertainty" in
agriculture. Crop diversification is still practiced widely by both small and
large agricultural producers in industrialized countries. Smaller producers,
especially vegetable producers, often find the fixed costs associated with crop
specific technologies too high to be profitably employed. Large producers on the
other hand usually find the use of specialized technology highly beneficial, yet
they continue to plant different varieties or hybrids of the crop of
specialization. Planting different varieties, often those that respond
differently to uncontrollable elements of the local environment, provides
farmers with a natural form of hedging against risk. The existing literature on
risk in agriculture provides numerous insights into the proper role and use of
crop insurance, price and revenue hedges, and weather related derivatives. Much
of the discipline's existing literature and knowledge focuses on issues related
to price uncertainty and methods to hedge against price risk. The proposed
project will provide a complementary solution to these approaches by applying
the method of minimum premium hedge to the crop diversification problem.
