As the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, Arecibo Observatory in
Puerto Rico attracts thousands of visitors each year, of all ages and from many
countries. Pride in the Observatory has caused local Puerto Rican organizations
to contribute the funds necessary for the construction of the new Arecibo
Observatory Visitor and Educational Facility. Cornell University, in behalf of
the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, is requesting $774,463 form the
NSF-ISE over a two year period to develop and implement the exhibits and
educational programs which will give life to the Educational Facility. Within
the facility, we propose establishing an educational program centered on the
theme "More Than Meets the Eye", which will reflect the general idea that we can
study our world with tools which extend our direct sensory experience. The
proposed program will explore the unseen sky and, in particular, the objects
that fall under the scrutiny of a radio telescope. Specifically, the program
will introduce the visitors to the electromagnetic spectrum as a means of
exploration, will offer a framework of basic astronomy and atmospheric science,
and will provide understanding of the function and operation of the Arecibo
radio telescope. Some of Arecibo's most exciting new discoveries in the fields
of radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy and astomospheric science will
be presented so that visitors can experience the dynamic nature of science. ***
