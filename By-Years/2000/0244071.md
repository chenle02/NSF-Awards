0244071 Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to renew an REU
Site on nanodevices at the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville under the
direction of Dr. William D. Brown. Twelve junior and senior undergraduate
students per year will participate in a 10 week summer cross-disciplinary
undergraduate research experience that will initiate a high level of interest to
learn nanoscience based on a "teaching through doing" paradigm. It will
specifically address the teaching of surface science and quantum theory in the
context of nanoscience. In addition, the students will learn to construct an
educational framework through an industry-like organized training process that
develops their teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. They will also be
exposed to the wide range of theory in a classroom environment support the
program's experimental studies.&lt;br/&gt;
