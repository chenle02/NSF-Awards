The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Dr. Klippenstein for an investigation of unimolecular
reaction rate theory. A variational statistical approach is used for
dissociation reactions in which there is no barrier to the reverse recombination
process. Comparison of theory with experiment is based on use of potential
energy surfaces computed ab initio. %%% Understanding of the rates at which
chemical reactions occurs has lagged far behind understanding of reaction
energetics. Modern computational methods and new theoretical advances are now
making it possible to make progress on this long-standing problem. This award is
for a frontier effort in that direction.
