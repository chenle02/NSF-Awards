This research program uses coherent optical radiation to probe the dynamics of
collisions between atoms in an excited state. By measuring the absorption of
light and its subsequent emission as a function of its frequency, the details of
the quasimolecular collision intermediate structure can be delineated. Professor
Havey will use the polarization properties of the light to measure the amount of
alignment and orientation that can be transmitted from the reactant atoms to the
final products.
