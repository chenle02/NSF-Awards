This research will examine carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in annual samples
of banded corals from several sites in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The
goals are to establish the vriability of the ventilation of the main thermocline
with respect to CO2 and to determine the cause and spatial extent of decade time
scale changes in surface ocean 1 4 C during the past 500 years. First, high
precision (+2 / ) 1 4 C records will be reconstructed for the post-bomb period
(1953-present) for banded corals from the equatorial and South Atlantic.
Isopycnal mixing models for the upper ocean, similar to that used previously,
will be constructed for these locations and for the North and South Pacific.
Second, high precision 1 4 C records will be reconstructed for the Little Ice
Age (A.D. 1400-1850) from four sites in the world's ocean - North Atlantic
(Florida), North Central Pacific (Hawaii), eastern equat Pacific (Galapagos) and
Southwest Pacific (Great Barrier Reef). It will be determined whether the decade
time scale changes noticed in surface ocean 1 4 C during the Maunder minimum in
the Southwest Pacific (Abrahams Reef) were an ocean- wide phenomena, and the
potential impact of these changes on surface circulation and on the cycling of
CO2 will be assessed. Third, the Suess effect and the changes in 1 8 O and 1 3 C
in banded corals from the North Central and Southwestern Pacific will be
measured in order to assess the input of fossil fuel CO2 into the ocean. Fourth,
high precision 1 4 C will be measured on fossil corals that have been accurately
dating using 230 Th by mass spectrometry from the raised reefs of the Huon
Peninsula, Papua New Guinea. The goal here is to develop a method to extend the
radiocarbon chronology past that available from known-aged tree rings (&gt;9,700
calendar yrs BP), into the early Holocene and deglaciation periods when
atmospheric pCO2 was substantially lower than nineteenth century levels.
