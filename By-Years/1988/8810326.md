This is a study of metal-support interactions and promoter effects on platinum
supported on cation-exchanged zeolite L. The effects of alkali and alkaline
earth cations exchanged into the zeolite, the type of support (zeolite L versus
alumina), and platinum particle size on the catalytic activity and electronic
properties of the platinum are studied. The catalysts are tested for heptane
dehydrocyclization, toluene dehydrogenation, and neopentane hydrogenolysis. The
electronic properties of platinum are characterized by infrared spectroscopy of
adsorbed carbon monoxide and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Platinum
deposited on barium-potassium zeolite L is an active and selective catalyst for
the octane enhancement of unleaded gasoline. Related systems have demonstrated
metal-support interaction that influence performance. This study investigates
such effects in a series of catalysts used in production of gasoline and should
lead to improved performance and/or better control in the catalytic processes.
