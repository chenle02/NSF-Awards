As part of the Foundation's initiative to strengthen research environments in
primarily undergraduate institutions, the Division of Networking and
Communications Science and Infrastructure considers proposals to defray CSNET
dues and operating expenses under the research instrumentation category of the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Program. Northeast Louisiana
University has met both RUI and CSNET membership requirements and demonstrates a
genuine need for network access. Initially, at least three faculty members at
the college will have access to CSNET services. The benefits from network
communication will be significant and institutional commitment to future network
use is evident.
