A new laboratory relating to the first mechanical systems course is established.
The laboratory will consist of a number of workstations where students will
conduct a series of experiments. These experiments will complement the lecture
material which is concerned with the introduction of modeling of dynamic
systems. In the laboratory, the students will study instrumentation, computer
interfacing, and the basics of data acquisition as well as response of dynamic
systems. The experiments are designed so that systems involving several energy
domains may be studied. For each experiment, the students will model the system,
run a computer simulation of the response, acquire data from the actual system,
and evaluate their model.
