Reconstructing and modeling climate variations over the last 30,000 years or so
is one of the most important goals of global climate change research. Only by
determining how the global climate varied during this period can we begin to
understand the factors that controlled climate change in the past, an
understanding that is crucial if we are to interpret the climate changes of
today. For example, such an understanding is crucial if we are to separate
"natural" climate variations from anthropogenically induced ones, and to predict
future climate change. In this project, the investigators will use Global
Positioning System (GPS) data from regions previously covered by glaciers to
measure the present-day crustal motions associated with postglacial rebound.
Using these data, a refined model for the history of the ice cover will be
determined. This refined history can be used to estimate parameters that govern
the evolution of the climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
