The "Talladega College Science and Mathematics Improvement Program" addresses
the problem of low levels of African American participation in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and workforce through
enhanced STEM teaching and learning that will result from sustainable
improvements of the institution's STEM instructional and research
infrastructure. Infrastructure enhancements will address (1) student
recruitment, enrollment, retention and graduation; (2) curriculum reform and
improvement, infusion of technology to enhance instruction, undergraduate
research; and, (3) faculty development.

Curriculum reform efforts include revision and enhancement of STEM gate keeper
courses, development of honors courses in biology, chemistry and computer
science; and the establishment of an Environmental Science Program. Faculty will
be provided professional development opportunities to enhance their competence
and currency within STEM disciplines and to effectively incorporate technology
and active learning techniques into the learning process. Students will be
provided opportunities to engage in research activity on-campus and at research
institutions under the tutelage of research scientists.
