We are establishing a multi-purpose, undergraduate cognitive science laboratory
facility, based upon a set of 386 computer workstations, to effectively teach
existing laboratory courses in Sensation/Perception and in Basic Cognitive
Science, and develop new laboratory courses in Applied Cognitive Sciences and in
Psycholinguistics/Phonetics. When not scheduled for classes, the facility is
used for quality undergraduate, cognitive science, independent research
projects. The essence of the facility is a set of twelve separate student
laboratory stations, each in a small, separate research room. With this common
flexible hardware, implementation of the different laboratory courses requires
the knowledgeable application of specific software. Each system is capable of
producing wide ranges of auditory and visual stimuli, and recording a multitude
of responses from human subjects.
