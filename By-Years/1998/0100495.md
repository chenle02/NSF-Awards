New methods based on generalized Borel summation and trans-
asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;expansions are being developed by a number of analysts and
are emerging&lt;br/&gt;as a new field of study, "analyzability theory". The
methods enable one&lt;br/&gt;to treat solutions of equations at singularities
much more general then&lt;br/&gt;usually dealt with and provide a rigorous
foundation to previously&lt;br/&gt;formal calculations. The present proposal
aims at developing and&lt;br/&gt;applying these new techniques. The PIs will
continue their research in&lt;br/&gt;the context of ODEs, difference equations
and PDEs. Applications&lt;br/&gt;addressed include the classification of
nonlinear ODEs at irregular&lt;br/&gt;singularities, determining their
integrability properties as well as&lt;br/&gt;their reducibility to simpler
systems, study of adiabatic invariance,&lt;br/&gt;and Painleve' analysis for
difference equations. These techniques will&lt;br/&gt;be used to continue
rigorous research of the time dependent Schroedinger&lt;br/&gt;problem under
periodic perturbations of arbitrary strength and also of&lt;br/&gt;resonance
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a piece in an unfolding
enterprise to bridge the gap from&lt;br/&gt;formal calculations to rigorous
proofs, and in the advance of what&lt;br/&gt;appears to be emerging as a general
theory of singular behavior.&lt;br/&gt;Countless applications exist in
mathematics as well as in the study of&lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;
