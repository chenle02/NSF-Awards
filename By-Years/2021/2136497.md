The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to complete the development of a remote
electronic stethoscope platform to help physicians and clinicians remotely
diagnose and monitor a patientâ€™s respiratory status quickly, conveniently, and
objectively in an at-home setting. This technology will not only improve the
quality of care for patients, but also enable widespread use of safely-
monitored, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation, which will contribute to a
reduction in patient morbidity and mortality related to respiratory diseases.
The platform will also potentially enable a large collection of respiratory
physiological data, providing a valuable database for clinical and scientific
research as well as a framework for the use of artificial intelligence tools
that may improve respiratory care. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
addresses the challenge of telemonitoring the respiratory condition of patients
suffering from asthma and other pulmonary diseases, such as emphysema and
chronic bronchitis. The current standard of care relies on intermittent
monitoring via stethoscope by a trained healthcare professional, which raises
significant inter-user variability in the assessment and classification of lung
sounds. The proposed project will advance noise reduction, design-to-cost, and
design-for-manufacturing improvements, upgrading the backend data annotation and
analysis system to ensure system scalability and validating the system usability
and safety with substantial and relevant patient testing. The final smart
wearable stethoscope platform will enable development of predictive algorithms
that offer prolonged monitoring and recording of lung acoustic signals for
improved care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
