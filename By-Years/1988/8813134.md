This award will support a seminar, "Control Mechanics Applied to Robotic
Systems", organized jointly by Professor J.M. Skowronski of the University of
Southern California and Dr. G.F. Shannon of the University of Queensland,
Australia. Participants will meet in Los Angeles, California in January 1989 to
discuss current research and potential collaboration in the area of control
mechanics. Topics to be covered include 1) control of uncertain systems, 2)
control of flexible-link structures, 3) decision making and coordination control
for mechanical systems, and 4) applications. The workshop is timely in that it
will bring together leading American and Australian scientists and engineers in
robotics under uncertain environments, with applications to agriculture, mining,
and other areas. The workshop should stimulate cooperative research between the
U.S. and Australia in robotics.
