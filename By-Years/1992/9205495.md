The 1992 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental Biology will be held at
the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA on the weekend of May 1-3. This
proposal is for funds to support graduate student attendance and participation
at the meeting. The Conference is organized with the intent of bringing together
a broad range of developmental biologists, at various stages of their careers,
to present and discuss their research in formal and informal settings. Further,
the organizers continue to integrate research in both plant and animal
developmental biology in an effort to enhance the communication between groups
that have traditionally been separated. The Conference will include four formal
platform sessions and two poster presentation sessions, as well as a keynote
address and a second featured presentation by prominent developmental
biologists. The established investigators chairing the platform sessions are
encouraged to solicit presentation from graduate students, postdoctorals, and
junior faculty, and all graduate students attending the meeting are encouraged
to present their work in the poster sessions.
