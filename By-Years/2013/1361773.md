This research award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by
Professor Lawrence Que of the University of Minnesota to study iron facilitated
oxidation processes that are important in biology and in industrial settings.
Gaining insights into how Nature carries out the oxidation of strong C-H bonds
efficiently plays an important role in the design of oxidation catalysts for
large scale chemistry that will be more energy efficient, more environmentally
friendly, and less wasteful of our resources. Professor Que is working closely
with many graduate students and postdoctoral associates from diverse backgrounds
and preparing them to become the leaders among the next generation of
chemists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to generate synthetic
analogs of high-spin (S = 2) iron(IV)-oxo intermediates that serve as the key
oxidants for many nonheme iron oxygenases. The vast majority of synthetic
oxoiron(IV) complexes described to date have intermediate spin (S = 1), which
DFT calculations predict to be much less reactive than their high-spin
counterparts. To test the DFT prediction, we will synthesize complexes with
high-spin Fe(IV)=O units and characterize them by X-ray crystallography whenever
possible and by a combination of spectroscopic methods in order to gain detailed
insight into their geometric and electronic structures. The abilities of the
high-spin complexes to oxidize substrate C-H bonds will be correlated with their
properties and compared to those of low-spin Fe=O complexes to determine what
factors control Fe=O reactivity. A greater understanding of such factors will be
important for the development of more effective C-H bond oxidation catalysts.
