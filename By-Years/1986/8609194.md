This project will determine the role of aerobic methane oxidation in carbon
cycling in the Black Sea. Experiments will include rate determinations as well
as characterization of in situ populations. Determinations of methane oxidation
rates will be carried out as follows. Samples will be taken throughout the water
column, and a methane profile will be generated. Previous work suggests that a
break in the profile should occur at or near the oxic/anoxic interface. The
methane oxidation rate across the break in the profile will be estimated using
14CH4, to determine the site of peak activities. Samples from this depth will
then be used in kinetic studies to determine Vm and Km parameters for methane.
This information will be used to estimate in situ methane oxidation rates across
the zone of maximum activity. The data will then be compared to data generated
by other groups concerning carbon cycling in this environment. In situ
populations will be characterized as follows. Antigenic and electron microscopic
methods currently being developed, will be applied to samples from the zone of
maximum activity to obtain relative distributions of the different classes of
methanotrophs. Samples from the same locations will be used to set up both batch
and chemostat enrichments, and aerobic methanotrophs will be isolated and
characterized. These isolates will be compared to existing strains as well as
the in situ populations.
