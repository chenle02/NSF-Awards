9311874 Lee This project is on research to develop a very small fermentor which
will have sensors for measuring dissolved oxygen, pH, glucose, and cell density.
In addition, the glucose sensor would be oxygen-independent and self-
calibrating. The proposed micro-scale fermentor will be designed in a form
similar to a microprocessor chip. This will enable simple connections between
sensors and measurement units which will reduce cost. The small fermentor volume
and a design suitable for mass production will also minimize the cost. This type
of bioreactor device has the potential to significantly reduce the time and
effort involved with the great number of fermentations used in industrial
screening operations. ***
