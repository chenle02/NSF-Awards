935300 Hamrin The University of Kentucky will initiate a 3-week, residential
Young Scholars project in engineering for 30 students entering grades 11 or 12.
Project activities will include lectures on basic engineering principles and
hands-on computer experiences in graphics, CAD and engineering applications.
Mini-research projects will be integrated into these activities. The core of the
summer program will focus on four main disciplines: chemical, civil, electrical
and mechanical engineering. Career explorations, discussions on ethics of
science and student research presentations are also featured. During the follow
up activities, students complete an individual project and return to campus for
seminar presentations of these projects. ***
