9420425 Callcott The Principal investigators will utilize the extended energy
range at the Center for Advanced Microstructure Devices and the Advanced Light
Sources at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to study technologically important
materials such as high temperature superconductors, multi- layer magnetic
materials, and high temperature materials. They will study bonding of impurities
in semiconductors, low abundance elements in biological materials, and of
molecules and surface layers on surfaces. The research will lead to a deeper and
more quantitative understanding of soft-x-ray fluorescence in various materials.
This will lead to a unique instrumentation which will be used to study surfaces,
catalysis, interfaces and magnetic dichroism. The instruments will provide
unique capabilities for students and scientists from national, industrial and
university laboratories. %%% The Principal investigators will utilize the
