The CAREER award will address the key scientific uncertainties in assessment and
modeling of climate variability by focusing on moist convective processes and
their linkage to the larger scale circulation. The award will enable Dr.
Sherwood to strengthen undergraduate and graduate education and research
training in climate sciences at Yale. A teaching program aimed at providing a
physically based understanding of global-scale atmospheric behavior and climate
will be developed as part of this project. The research and educational goals of
the project will advance understanding and modeling of moist convective
processes, particularly their role in regulating interannual climate variability
through impacts on atmospheric lapse rate, moisture distribution and transport,
and the hydrological cycle.
