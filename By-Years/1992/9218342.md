This award supports a two-year collaborative research project betweeen
Professor Steven M. George of the University of Colorado and Professor Masataka
Hirose of Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. The research involves the
study of reaction kinetics on semiconductor surfaces to develop silicon atomic
layer processing. Professor Hirose focuses on the physics and chemistry in ultra
large scale integration (ULSI) process technology. The atomic layer control of
silicon processing is a critical need for ULSI device fabrication. The control
of monolayer processing requires an understanding of surface kinetics. This
collaborative project will bring together the background and expertise of the
two research groups in surface kinetics and device fabrication. The project also
mixes the disciplines of chemistry and electrical engineering. The PI will visit
Professor Hirose's laboratory twice, each time taking a graduate student with
him for an extended period. Professor Hirose and his colleagues will also visit
the University of Colorado.
