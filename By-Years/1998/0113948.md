This project will investigate the architecture and design of a single-
chip&lt;br/&gt;parallel computer system. As technology continues to improve and
transistor&lt;br/&gt;sizes decrease, the latency of on-chip interconnect wires
will have a&lt;br/&gt;greater impact on the performance of computer systems. In
the future,&lt;br/&gt;computer designers will need to develop architectures that
avoid the use of&lt;br/&gt;long interconnect wires in order to reduce the effect
of this latency. One&lt;br/&gt;such approach would be to include a number of
small, simple processors&lt;br/&gt;together on a single chip, forming a single-
chip parallel computer. This&lt;br/&gt;would reduce the effect of the latency
because the length of the&lt;br/&gt;interconnect wires would depend on the size
and complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;individual processors, not the size of the
entire system. By keeping the&lt;br/&gt;processors simple, long interconnect
wires will not be necessary. The&lt;br/&gt;challenge to designing such a system
is determining the features that the&lt;br/&gt;architecture must include. This
research project will investigate&lt;br/&gt;architectural features that provide
low-overhead support for parallel&lt;br/&gt;programs, applying them to the
design of the SCMP (Single-Chip&lt;br/&gt;Message-Passing) parallel computer.
Through the extensive use of&lt;br/&gt;simulation, the design and performance of
the SCMP system will be analyzed&lt;br/&gt;and compared to other computer
architectures.&lt;br/&gt;
