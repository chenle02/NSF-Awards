This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-2). It will support a new investigator with a MARGINS
Postdoctoral Fellowship for Ikuko Wada to model the physical properties of
mantle wedges using data from two MARGINS focus sites, i.e., Izu-Bonin-Marianas
and Costa Rica-Nicaragua. She will be supervised by two experienced
geoscientists, Mark Behn and Alison Shaw (sponsoring PIs only), both at WHOI.
Wada?s doctoral research presents an excellent background for the proposed work
in which she has already made a significant contribution by demonstrating that
the maximum depth of decoupling between the subducting slab and the overriding
mantle controls, the mantle wedge flow pattern and the thermal structure of the
forearc-arc region and that this depth is typically 70-80 km depths for most
subduction zones. She will use an array of constraints, including seismic, heat
flow and geochemical data, for the modeling effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts include the support of a young female investigator and insights gained
from this work will be useful broadly to the MARGINS community.
