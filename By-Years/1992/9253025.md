This project outlines a plan to enhance the Environmental Science Program at
Alabama A&amp;M University under the aegis of an interdisciplinary Center of
Environmental Research and Training (CERT). Emphasis will be given to research
addressing several water quality issues coupled with special emphasis on a
mechanism proposed to increase entry of minority undergraduate students in
environmental science specializations. In attempt to achieve these goals, four
objectives ar presented. Objective 1 focuses on toxic heavy metals interaction
with mineral surfaces. Mechanisms of toxic metals interactions with soil and
pure clay mineral surfaces (sorption/desorption/precipitation) as affected by
inorganic anion will be investigated in tandem. Objective 2 deals with research
on soil property effects on volatile organic compound migration in the vadose
zone. Here, the impact of selected soil properties on the migration of two
common volatile organic contaminants will be investigated. Objective 3 proposes
research on soil physical, chemical and hydrologic properties effects on organic
contaminant transport in the vadose zone. the downward movement of pesticide as
influenced by macropores will be evaluated using field data and modeling.
Finally, objective 4 presents a method to facilitate the entry of minority
students in the environmental sciences. Special emphasis is placed on the entry
of undergraduate students in environmental science.
