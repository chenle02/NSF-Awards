A biochemical engineering conference is being held to bring together academic,
government, and industrial groups carrying out research directed towards the
advancement of biochemical engineering principles and practice. The theme of the
conference is biochemical engineering for technology leading to processes and
products of economic value. The conference was organized by the United
Engineering Trustees with the advice of an executive committee. The biochemical
engineering conference series has been at the forefront of disseminating
information on engineering technology and research in the rapidly changing field
of biotechnology and realization of its commercial potential. The major
technical roadblock to bioproduct marketing is the lack of innovative
engineering applied to both the upstream and downstream processing. Dilute
solutions and extreme broth contamination makes separation and purification of
many products economically impossible. This conference will play an important
role in the eventual solution of these technical problems by bringing together
the world experts in biochemical engineering to address the issues.
