The I/UCRC for Wind Energy Science, Technology and Research plans to integrate
engineering with fundamental research to support the development of wind energy
systems for production of low-cost energy with high reliability. The center and
its partners intend to engage in a cooperative program of research and education
in the following key areas: (a) Composites, (b) Foundations, Towers, and
Infrastructure (c) Manufacturing and Design, (d) Structural Health Monitoring,
Non-Destructive Inspection, and Testing, (e) Control Systems and Energy Storage,
and (f) Wind System Planning, Siting, and Operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed I/UCRC will have broad impacts with respect to the environment, the
economy, and education. With large minority populations near Lowell and Dallas,
the Center is well situated to involve underrepresented groups within the wind
energy field. The Center intends to leverage best practices from several
successful programs to develop and integrate educational activities that enhance
recruitment and retention of diverse student populations and encourage under-
represented minority and female students to pursue STEM careers. In addition to
workforce development and R&amp;D, WindSTAR will provide a forum in which
multiple facets of the wind industry (e.g., wind turbine manufacturers,
manufacturers of key components, materials suppliers, suppliers of ancillary
equipment, service companies, and wind project developers) can work together to
solve precompetitive problems that hinder the advancement of wind energy.
