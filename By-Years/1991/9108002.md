Fundamental problems involving the interactions of photons and electrons with
atoms and negative ions either in the free state or in the presence of strong
static electric or magnetic fields will be studied theoretically. Physical
processes to be studied include multiphoton detachment of negative ions in the
presence of strong static electric fields, resonant photoionization of Be,
electron impact ionization of H and He, multiphoton processes in H, Ar and F-,
and photoionization of H in a strong, uniform magnetic field.
