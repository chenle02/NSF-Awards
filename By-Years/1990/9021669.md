This small Grant for Exploratory Research is made in order to develop a novel
experiment for detecting delamination cracks in a composite material. The
techniques uses (relatively) large amplitudes of vibration in the kilohertz
frequency range. The damping that occurs in this situation is useful in
evaluating subcritical crack growth.
