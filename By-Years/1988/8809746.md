A basic engineering issue is the organization of "complex" systems. Such systems
require the coordinated interaction and communication of many components, and
may involve highly concurrent and distributed computation and control. These
systems must generally interact with and adapt to a changeable environment. At
the present time, however, there is not even a suitable language to discuss the
organization of such systems, let alone a proper theoretical or mathematical
framework. To develop such a framework, it is proposed to focus on a "simple"
biological organism, the nematode worm C.elegans, as a small but essentially
self-contained model universe. PI's intend to incorporate experimental data and
theoretical constructs into a coordinated set of concurrent partial models, with
varying degrees of mutual influence. These models may differ as to type, level
of organization, degree of abstraction, and level of resolution. Over the long
term, they should incorporate the various stages of development, structure,
function, and behavior of the organism. Initially, however, the focus will be on
the function of the nervous system in the control of behavior. The approach will
comprise three interacting components: computer modelling and simulation,
mathematics and theory development, and laboratory experimentation.
