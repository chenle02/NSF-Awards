9529258 Lasaga This grant provides $154,875 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring a new in-situ near- atomic resolution hydrothermal system and
automated BET equipment for analysis of mineral surfaces in studies of
dissolution and precipitation kinetics. The hydrothermal system will be custom
built and used specifically for micro-scale analyses of dissolution and
precipitation rates at crystal surfaces while the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
instrument will be purchased "off-the-shelf" and used for determination of
reactive surface area of mineral powders. Determination of the reaction kinetics
of silicate minerals is central to low temperature geochemical research and is
essential to an understanding of environmental geochemical processes. ***
