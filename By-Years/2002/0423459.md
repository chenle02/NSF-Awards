"Understanding the Science Connected to Technology (USCT)" targets information
technology (IT) experiences in a comprehensive training program and professional
support system for students and teachers in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM). Participants have opportunities to assume leadership roles
as citizen volunteers within the context of science and technology in an
international watershed basin. Training includes collection, analysis,
interpretation and dissemination of scientific data. BROADER IMPACTS: Building
on a student volunteer monitoring program called River Watch, the USCT project
enables student scientists to conduct surface water quality monitoring
activities, analyze data and disseminate results to enhance local decision-
making capacity. The project incorporates state and national education standards
and has the potential to reach 173 school jurisdictions and 270,000 students.
USCT will directly impact 81 teachers, 758 students and 18 citizen volunteers.
The USCT project provides direct scientist mentor linkages for each
participating school. This linkage provides a lasting process for life-long
learning and an understanding of how IT and STEM subject matter is applied by
resource professionals. Broader impacts include accredited coursework for
teachers and students, specialized training congruent with the "No Child Left
Behind Act of 2001," and building partnerships with Native American schools.
INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The USCT project is designed to refocus thinking from static
content inside a textbook to a process of learning that includes IT and STEM
content. The USCT engages students (the next generation of decision makers) in
discovery of science and technology and expands education beyond current
paradigms and political jurisdictions.
