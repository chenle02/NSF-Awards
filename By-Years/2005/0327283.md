An array of twelve ocean-bottom seismometers will be deployed within the
'bull's-eye' region of the Ridge 2000 East Pacific Rise integrated studies site
at 9 degrees 50 minutes north. The character of near-axis faulting will be
studied, the seismically active hydrothermal system will be mapped, the seismic
character of any magmatic activity will be observed, and tidal triggering of
seismicity will be studied. The work is coordinated with other multidisciplinary
monitoring in the area and the results will be released as rapidly as
possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
