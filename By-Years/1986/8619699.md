Current concern with catastrophic dam failures focuses on the safety goals for
designing new dams and on possible retrofit of existing dams. Billions of
dollars are at stake and with the passage of time the risk of disaster
increases. The main objective of this project is to bring modeling of low
probability/high consequence event, risk analysis and management, and economic
analysis into dam safety. The work will be divided into four tasks as follows:
task 1) collect and review dam failure data; task 2) model the economic and
social benefits of dam operation; task 3) examine the comparative risks and risk
goals for dam safety; and task 4) develop an economic model that will consider
risk management alternatives with emphasis on public perception and information,
and will investigate cost/benefit analysis.
