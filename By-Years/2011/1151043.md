Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;Prokaryotic cells develop cell polarity, exhibit
time-dependent gradients of protein concentration, can divide with astonishingly
high precision at midcell, and exhibit precise control over the spatial position
of genetic loci in the cell. Loss of this ultra-structure has important
functional consequences, from the failure to efficiently segregate the
chromosome to the creation of anucleate minicells. To investigate such
questions, quantitative measurements are essential, but not sufficient. Models
that attempt to explain these inherently quantitative phenomena must make
testable, quantitative predictions. This research program is divided into two
main aims: (i) a program to quantitatively characterize, analyze and model these
organizational phenomena at a proteome scale in Escherichia coli and (ii) a
tightly focused program to investigate one important instance of cellular ultra-
structure: the mechanisms responsible for chromosome organization and
segregation in E. coli. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the
training of graduate students, this research program supports the development of
two new, truly interdisciplinary courses for undergraduate and graduate students
with diverse backgrounds from molecular and cellular biology to theoretical
physics: Contemporary Light Microscopy and Biophotonics and Quantitative
Imaging. Both courses are hands-on problem-oriented lab lecture courses inspired
by the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) Physiology Course. In addition, a third
course, a short quantitative imaging boot camp for the biologists is offered
yearly. The research program supports an outreach program to bring science into
the high school classroom and high school research interns into the lab.
