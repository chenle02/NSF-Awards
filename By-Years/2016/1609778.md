In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, Nanochemistry
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Bjoern Reinhard of Boston
University is developing a new approach to use light to sort chemical molecules
based on their "handedness." Similar to the left and right human hand, chemical
molecules can exist in different forms that cannot be superimposed. The term for
this categorization is called "chirality." Because molecules with different
chirality can show very different chemical and pharmacological behaviors it is
often important to separate them. To achieve this goal, nanoscale antennas are
being developed that, upon radiation with light, generate forces that point in
different directions for molecules with different handedness. An outreach
program developed by Professor Reinhard offers undergraduate students and inner
city high school students opportunities to participate in this research program
and to learn more about how light interacts with molecules. The broader impacts
of this work include the development of universal chemical separation techniques
that are applicable to a broad range of molecules and that can make
pharmaceutical compounds safer and cheaper. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor
Reinhard is developing plasmonic antennas that provide strong enough gradients
in optical chirality density to enable enantiomer-selective optical forces. The
project addresses the design criteria of nanoantennas that generate enantio-
selective forces in evanescent enhanced chiral fields of uniform sign. These
structures are implemented and characterized, and their ability to separate
enantiomers is tested experimentally. Throughout the project both simulations
and experiments are applied to optimize plasmonic antennas and maximize chiral
forces. This approach will lead to a quantitative understanding of how chiral
light-matter interactions are enhanced by resonant plasmonic nanostructures.
