9713544 Petrenko The fundamental nature of the adhesion of ice to metallic
surfaces will be studied. Experimental data for tensile and shear adhesion
strengths will be correlated with the nano- scale properties and structure of
the ice surface and the ice/metal interface, as determined by using nano-
tribological techniques, such as atomic force microscopy and other high
resolution surface and sub-surface materials probes. Results will also be
correlated with the properties of the liquid-like layer on the surface of the
ice, such as its thickness, electric charge and charge gradient, and its
capillary pressure. The effects of applied electrical fields will be evaluated.
The basic knowledge generated should contribute to the purposeful development of
ice- phobic coatings. ***
