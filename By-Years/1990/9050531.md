The rapid and continuing growth in the significance of the use of nuclear
magnetic resonance techniques in solving structural problems requires that a
modern curriculum place considerable emphasis on both theory and practice in the
area. Through the acquisition of a high-field NMR spectrometer, the institution
has improved the course content in five laboratory courses offered in the
Chemistry Department: Organic Chemistry I and II, Inorganic Chemistry,
Instrumental Analysis, and Senior REsearch. The acquisition of the
instrumentation has also resulted in improvements in the associated lecture
portions of these courses. The Gemini 200-RT system has been utilized to permit
the introduction of new experiments into each of the laboratories and to augment
techniques available to undergraduate research participants. The project has
been of major significance because it enabled the Chemistry Department to bring
it curricular content to standards recognized by national consensus.
