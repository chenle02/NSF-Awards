This research will continue the application of asymptotic methods to aid in the
performance evaluation of different types of queueing systems, such as large
queueing networks, interactive computer systems and communication networks.
These asymptotic methods allow one to estimate performance criteria even when an
exact solution is not available, and the approximate answers they provide are
very often highly accurate when compared to exact solutions for simpler cases
and numerical simulations. Most people do not enjoy waiting in line. In a more
general sense, such "waiting problems" occur frequently in computer and
communication systems. For example, when you make a long distance call the
telephone company's computers may have to put your call into a waiting line if
there is a large number of calls in progress at the time of your call. Depending
upon how efficiently the phone system is able to prioritize your call you may be
able to complete your call or you may hear a recorded message informing you to
try again. Similar problems arise when computers "talk" to each other: if the
queueing of data is not done properly then the transmission of data is either
slowed down or stopped completely. With this research the principal investigator
will use approximation techniques to provide estimates of waiting times in
various computer and communication systems.
