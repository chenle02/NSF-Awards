The purpose of this fundamental bioengineering research is to determine the
effects of hyperthermia on the viability of tumors and the reshaping of the
cornea. The PI will conduct a research program of experimental and theoretical
investigations designed to illuminate the reshaping of the cornea in order to
correct for visual defects. Information from such studies could have a profound
affect upon clinical treatment of severely impaired eye sight.
