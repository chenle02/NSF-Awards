This award supports Professors Robert Meyer and Seth Fraden and some graduate
students of Brandeis University to collaborate in studies of colloids and liquid
crystals with Professor H. N. W. Lekkerkerker and his group of the Chemistry
Department of the University of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The two groups have
complementary expertise in the field of liquid crystals (U.S. side) and colloids
(Dutch side) and have overlapping interests in the area of colloids which form
liquid crystals. Joint research will be carried out on specialized materials on
which each of the laboratories is expert, in order to advance understanding of
these important systems. For example, the Brandeis group has been working
recently on filamentous bacteriophage viruses that are susceptible to magnetic
field induced ordering. The Utrecht group has been able to synthesize rod-like
colloidal particles of the crystal Boehmite, and has developed expertise in
preparing colloidal particles with specialized organic coatings. These lines of
research come together in the current collaboration in studies of rod-like
colloidal particles which form ordered states in suspension in a liquid. The
collaborators will experimentally control the properties of the colloidal
particles and their interaction, and will make a detailed theoretical analysis
of the systems. The topic of colloids and liquid crystals is one of increasing
importance, as the field of complex fluids and their applications grow. As well
as being interesting in their own right, and the basis of many important
applications in technology and industry, these colloidal systems serve as model
systems for testing fundamental ideas about many other important physical
systems.
