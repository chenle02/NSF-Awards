9424209 Straka The Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program is designed
to attract talented students into research careers. Under this Site Grant, the
Principal Investigators will provide support for twelve undergraduate students
in late spring/early Summer of 1995 to work with meteorological mentors at
various university, state and governmental meteorological orgalizations and to
participate in the Verification of Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment.
Field work and research will be supplemented by tours and lectures to produce a
well-rounded experience that will provide the students an opportunity to become
aware of scientific research careers. A previous grant using a similar format
proved to be quite successful. A new feature in the current award, however, is
proposed cooperation with a historically black university building upon an
existing internship program originally established by the National Oceanic
Atmospheric Administration and Clark Atlanta University. ***
