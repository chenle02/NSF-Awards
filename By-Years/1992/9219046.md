The Drosophila abnormal gastrulation (noga) gene was identified in a genetic
screen for mutations mapping in the 71C-F interval of chromosome 3. Six alleles
of this embryonic lethal locus were recovered. In noga mutant embryos, a
defective gastrulation is observed in that the ventral furrow fails to form
properly, and the cephalic furrow and posterior midgut invagination occur
abnormally. The underlying reasons for this defective gastrulation phenotype are
currently unknown; a mutation in noga may result in an alteration of cell fate
along the dorsoventral axis or a mutation in noga may cause abnormalities in the
cell shape changes, cell movements, or cell-cell interactions necessary for
gastrulation. The specific goals of the research on the noga gene are the
following: 1) further characterize the noga mutant phenotype; 2) isolation and
molecular characterization the noga gene; 3) a study of noga gene expression
during normal embryogenesis; and 4) an investigation of the function of the noga
gene in gastrulation. Overall, the further phenotypic and molecular analysis of
this interesting gene should provide important information on dorsoventral
patterning and/or gastrulation in the Drosophila embryo.
