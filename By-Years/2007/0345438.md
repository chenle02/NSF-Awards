The magnetotelluric method measures naturally varying electric and magnetic
fields in order to determine subsurface electrical conductivity. Bulk electrical
conductivity of rocks depends mostly on small fractions of highly conductive
materials such as partial melt, aqueous fluids, metallic conductors, and
graphite. Fluid and partial melt distributions are key components to
understanding the structure and physical state of the Earth's interior, so
Earthscope has a plan to acquire MT data across the United States. Such a large
volume of data requires automated real time management and quality control and
processing tools for optimal final estimates of MT transfer functions that will
be used by others to develop conductivity models. We are developing the software
for these two tasks.
