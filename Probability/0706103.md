Professors Marcus and Rosen will continue their research on the relationship
between Gaussian processes and the local times of related strongly symmetric
Markov processes. This is the subject of their Cambridge University Press book,
Markov Processes, Gaussian Processes and Local Times, which was published in
October 2006. In writing this book they solved many problems and uncovered many
new ones. They are particularly interested in finding a heuristic explanation,
based on sample path properties, of the fact that Gaussian processes with
infinitely divisible squares are precisely those Gaussian processes with
covariance that is the zero potential density of a strongly symmetric Markov
process. They will also continue their program of using Gaussian process
techniques to discover new sample path properties of local times, such as
central limit theorems for the moduli of continuity of local times of Markov
processes. In continuing to explore the interplay between Gaussian and Markov
processes they will also consider non-normal central limit theorems for the
moduli of continuity of Gaussian processes with convex covariance functions as a
first step towards obtaining similar properties for local times.

Many important phenomena, such as weather patterns or the behavior of the stock
market, are so complex that the only way to study them is to consider them as
random, or stochastic, processes. Mathematical models of stochastic processes
are studied to give insight into the physical phenomena that they represent. On
subtle property of a stochastic process is the amount of time realizations of
the process spend at the possible values that it can take. This property is
called the local time of the process. This proposal is to continue research on
the local times of symmetric Markov processes.
