Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the 2015 Gordon
Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on "Soft Condensed Matter
Physics: Self-Assembly and Active Matter". The award is jointly funded by the
CMP, CMMT and BMAT programs in the Division of Materials Research and by the
Chemistry Division, both in Math and Physical Sciences, and by the CBET and CMMI
programs in Engineering. This Gordon Research Conference will bring together
leading scientists from a variety of fields in a collegial atmosphere that
supports open discussion to discuss issues at the cutting edge of soft matter
physics. This meeting will focus on two topics at the forefront of Soft
Condensed Matter Physics: Self-Assembly and Active Matter. Many of the proposed
talks are bioinspired. On the one hand, some researchers seek to provide insight
into biological function by applying ideas coming from soft matter. On the other
hand, other researchers exploit biological principles and phenomena for soft
material applications. Topics in self-assembly include biomineralization, virus
assembly and assembly of Janus and DNA colloids. Active Matter topics include
swimmers, driven colloids, actin and microtubule assembly and tissues. In
addition, this conference will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar that
provides a unique opportunity for young researchers to share in the GRC
experience and build informal networks with their peers.
