According to the classical theory of measuring flow by Doppler ultrasound, one
can estimate only that component of the flow that is in the direction of the
ultrasound beam. The PI has discovered that flow that is perpendicular to the
ultrasound can also be measured by appropriate analysis of the spectrum of the
reflected signal. This is a proposal to extend this novel finding to turbulent
flow and to design transducers that allow determination of blood flow under
either laminar or turbulent flow conditions. The proposed research has the
potential of greatly improving our ability to measure blood flow noninvasively.
