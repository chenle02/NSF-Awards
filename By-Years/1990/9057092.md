This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic Dynamics Program
supports the research of Dr. Joshua L. Goodman of the University of Rochester.
This work is aimed at describing accurately the properties of high-energy
species that are formed in chemical reactions, and it will improve our basic
understanding of how chemical reactions occur. The experiments that will be
carried out by Dr. Goodman will span three areas: (1) the study of retinal
proteins to determine how light energy drives chemical and biological reactions,
(2) the investigation of relationships between structure and energy for organic
reactive intermediates, and (3) the applicability of orbital symmetry selection
rules to odd-electron photochemical reactions. The work will utilize time-
resolved photoacoustic calorimetry, which allows measurement of microscopic
volume changes of a system following perturbation by photoexcitation. The
magnitudes of these volume changes can be related to reaction enthalpies and to
volume changes involving reactive intermediates. The photoacoustic detection
method will be extended to methods of activation other than photoinitiation.
