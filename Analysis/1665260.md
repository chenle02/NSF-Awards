In classical Newtonian physics, the location and movement of a body are
simultaneously measurable at a moment in time. An early discovery of modern
physics was that this state of affairs is very much different at the subatomic
level. In particular, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics asserts
that it is impossible to simultaneously determine the position and momentum of a
quantum particle with arbitrary precision. In 1926, von Neumann laid the precise
mathematical foundation for what it is that can actually be measured in the case
of a subatomic particle. This work involved the use of operators, linear
transformations acting on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Operator theory,
the branch of modern mathematics that studies operators, has subsequently
developed to become a far-reaching area of research in pure mathematics, and
numerous additional applications throughout mathematics, physics, and
engineering have been discovered. This research project involves the development
of new techniques within operator theory as well as the application of
established techniques to attack a number of questions involving the theory of
functions. While it is not the primary focus of the project, the research has
many potential applications to mathematical physics, control theory, and the
theory of optimization. A pillar of modern operator theory is the Sz.-Nagy
dilation theorem, which models contractions acting on Hilbert space by extending
them to co-isometries acting on larger spaces. This theorem and its numerous
refinements open the door to studying holomorphic functions in one and several
variables through the use of operator-theoretic methods. This project studies a
variety of problems in several complex variables and other areas of analysis
using these operator-theoretic methods. In particular, operator-theoretic
methods will be employed to study: interpolation problems of Nevanlinna-Pick and
Cartheodory-Fejer type; the boundary behavior of analytic functions defined on
polydiscs and poly-halfplanes; the derivation and descriptive theory of extremal
holomorphic mappings arising from the Caratheodory and Kobayashi extremal
problems; and the canonical derivation of representation formulae for analytic
functions in specific classes such as the Schur, Herglotz, Pick, Loewner,
Bessmertnyi, and Stieltjes classes on domains in several variables. A related
focus of the research is to apply modifications of the modeling methods to
develop the theory of analytic functions on varieties in commuting variables and
on free domains in several non-commuting variables.
