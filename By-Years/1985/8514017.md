This project is an experimental study of the phase equilibria behavior of
selected CO;i2 + hydrocarbon binary and ternary mixtures, which can contribute
to the understanding of the phase equilibria behavior of CO;i2 - enhanced oil
recovery systems. Vapor-liquid, liquid-liquid-vapor, and solid-liquid-vapor
phase equilibria of the homologous series of binary mixtures of CO;i2 +
n-alkybenzenes are studied. Also, the liquid-liquid-vapor phase equilibria of
the ternary mixture CO;i2 + n-nonadecane + propane are studied in order to
assess how the presence of a light hydrocarbon species extends the three-phase
region of a prototype CO;i2 + hydrocarbon system in thermodynamic phase space.
The studies are performed in the temperature range of -60;so to 125;soC at
pressures up to 2000 psia.
