This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Scott Halle of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct collaborative research with Dr.
Takayoshi Kobayashi at the University of Tokyo. They will investigate the
Ultrafast Nonlinear Optical Properties of Organic Polymers using femtosecond
coherent transient spectroscopy (FCTS). Organic semiconductors would prove
useful in optical signal processing were their optical properties, such as index
of refraction, optical coefficients, and response times, sufficiently nonlinear.
However, the nature of the nonlinearities for organic semiconductors has yet
been little investigated, partially because the wavelengths of the femtosecond
lasers ordinarily used for these studies are inappropriate for the organic
semiconductors. The FCTS technique, however, which was developed by the Japanese
collaborator, is suitable for use with the organic materials.
