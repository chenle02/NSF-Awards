This award provides for continued operation of the armored T-28 meteorologic
research aircraft system as a nation facility for research into cloud,
thunderstorm, and hailstorm processes. The cooperative agreement under which
this project would be funded provides for the management, staffing, upgrading,
testing, operation, and maintenance of the T-28 facility. The aircraft will be
available to the NSF scientific community for penetrations of mature storms in
support of planned research projects such as CaPE or STORM. The aircraft will be
upgraded with electric field measuring devices which will enhance the scientific
capabilities of the facility. A post-doc has been added to the staff. This will
strength the educational aspects of this facility as well as help to improve
observational- oriented research activities at the facility.//
