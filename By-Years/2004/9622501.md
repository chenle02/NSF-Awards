9622501 Vetelino This proposal requests that NSF cost share in the purchase of
piezoelectric sensor fabrication equipment which will be vital to the University
of Maine (UM) sensor efforts and a valuable asset to other UM researchers and
industry. The design, fabrication and testing of piezoelectric sensors is an
active area at the UM. These sensors, which are sensitive, portable, small, and
inexpensive, can detect gases in the parts per (SAW) gas microsensor, the
application of neural networks to SAW gas sensors, an acoustic plate mode
biosensor, a SAW corrosion sensor, an acoustic emission sensor, a sensor for
making nylon and an automotive oil quality sensor. The proposed fabrication
equipment is also critical to a large NSF-funded multi-user thin film synthesis
and processing facility and an NSF funded program which integrates sensors into
the undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering (EE) curricula. Since the
present fabrication equipment is unreliable, sensor research has been slowed,
impediments to exploring new research directions have arisen, and the
integration of sensors into the curriculum has been difficult. ***
