EAR-0203388 Michael J. Carr Several important questions about the nature of the
subduction process require a transition from existing qualitative subduction
signals, such as Ba/La and 10Be/9Be, to quantitative fluxes such as Ba flux in
gm/unit arc length/yr. This is accomplished by employing 40Ar/39Ar dating
techniques to measure the ages of the older units in several large Central
American volcanic centers. These new data, along with previously determined
volume measurements, enable the determination of average volcanic flux rates for
different segments of the arc. Integrating volcanic flux rates with regional
geochemical data allows an estimate of element fluxes to be made. From these
integrated data several major problems are being addressed, including the
physical cause of along-strike variations in subduction signal in Central
America, the mass balance of elements cycling through the Central American arc,
and the quantity of incompatible elements that are delivered to the deep mantle
through subduction.
