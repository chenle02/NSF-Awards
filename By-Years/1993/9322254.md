9322254 Kuehl The project will analyze data collected during a cruise off
Bangladesh. Seismic reflection data and sediment cores will be analyzed to
determine the fate of the massive load of sediments transported by the
Ganges/Bramaputra/Meghna river complex. The author poses 10 hypotheses
concerning sediment transport and deposition, based on preliminary data, and
requests support for geochemical analyses to date the sediments, and for further
processing and analysis of the seismic data.
