This is a proposal to study the structure and dynamics of hadrons at low and
intermediate energies using effective field theories/chiral perturbation theory,
and 1/Nc expansion methods. The main objects of research in the meson sector are
eta and eta' decays, but also strong interaction effects in the semi-leptonic
decays of heavy-light mesons are to be studied applying heavy quark symmetry. In
the baryon sector excited baryon masses will be studied in the framework of the
1/Nc expansion, and isospin breaking in pi-N couplings and em radiative
corrections for nucleons will be topics. A new formulation of the effective
field theory treatment of the two-nucleon system is to be developed. Many of the
projects support the experimental effort at JLAB.
