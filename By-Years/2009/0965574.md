This project is awarding 34 to 38 two-year scholarships to students pursuing
associate degrees in one of the following programs: Electronics Technology,
Drafting Technology, Precision Machining, or Pre-Engineering. Students are
required to take a weekly seminar course designed to optimize their success at
the school and learn about career opportunities in STEM areas. Overall, the
program provides students with both theoretical and practical knowledge,
combining classroom education with labs and worksite-based learning
opportunities. After finishing their degree, students can transfer to a
partnering four year school or enter the local workforce in a STEM career.
