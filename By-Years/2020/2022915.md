Economic exchange, cultural transformation, and social complexity are heavily
influenced by migration and movement of people. This research seeks to use
ancient DNA (aDNA) to better understand such influences in regions with limited
previous cultural study. Based on the genetic ties between various sites, it
will be possible to address questions of how individuals moving between the
different sites, and into other regions, reflect changes in the archaeological
assemblages that have been excavated. This, in turn, can help to better
understand todayâ€™s shifts and changes that have been brought about by the
movement of individuals and mixing of cultures which occur so frequently.
Radiocarbon dating for samples from the sites will also allow for refining the
history of the region and modeling cultural changes and dynamics. Additionally,
two students will attend a month-long summer course that will introduce them to
the field of ancient DNA and the required laboratory techniques. Due to the lack
of widespread ancient DNA facilities, this will allow for helpful training and
grounding for future work and collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the
world has always been connected through the movement of people, exchange of
goods, and sharing of cultural traits, the evidence of such can be found within
the genomes of individuals as well as in the archaeological sites they leave
behind. The present research is comprised of multiple lines of inquiry that
address questions on gene flow, genetic variation, migration, trade, and
interaction among societies. Whole mitochondrial DNA genomes (mitogenomes) will
be sequenced for the individuals in order to assess the relationship between DNA
and intermigration and intermarriage patterns as evidenced by material
culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
