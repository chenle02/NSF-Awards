The South Atlantic basin hosts the largest chlorophyll-a blooms of the Southern
Ocean, dominance likely associated with off-shelf flows of highly fertilized
waters drawn from the southwestern continental shelf region. This project will
investigate the extent to which these continental shelf outflows are controlled
by the interactions of two distinct western boundary currents, the Brazil and
Malvinas currents, with the shelf circulation. The numerical simulations with
sub-mesoscale permitting resolution will generate the most detailed description
of the circulation to date. This project will also advance the characterization
of the southwestern Atlantic shelf circulation through the novel use of in situ
and remote observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
characterize the shelf and deep-ocean exchanges in the southwestern Atlantic
region. The project will test the hypothesize that the boundary currents
regulate these exchanges by injecting deep ocean waters onto the northern and
southern portions of the shelf and detraining shelf waters at the frontal
system. The dynamical mechanisms connecting the shelf to the deep-ocean
circulation will be identified. The dominant modes of variability of the coupled
system will be characterized and the influence of these modes on the mass
exchanges between the shelf and the deep ocean will be investigated. The
analyses will include data produced by a suite of numerical experiments along
with in-situ observations and satellite data to establish confidence in the
model results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
