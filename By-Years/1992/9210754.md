Demand substitutions are common in practice, in the manufacturing,
distributions and service industries. An example where downward substitution
structure arises is the steel industry where steel beams of greater strength can
substitute for beams of lesser strength. This project will develop a general
framework which identifies properties of the optimal policies and efficient
algorithms to calculate the optimal policies for large size and real life
problems. There are few studies that deal directly with the problem of demand
substitutions, and most of them deal with only the specific case of two
products. The models and solution techniques are useful in solving a variety of
problems like safety stock locations, and allocations of cards to customers in
the car rental industry, and the yield problem in the airline industry.
