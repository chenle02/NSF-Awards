This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate
in actual field tests the novel room temperature dewatering process. In the
Phase I project, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) demonstrated a stable
osmotic distillation (OD) process on orange juice, grape juice, and coffee. In
typical applications, solids levels were increased from approximately 10% sugar
to approximately 70% sugar. Taste tests showed no significant difference between
original juice and re-diluted OD product. Process stability was demonstrated by
obtaining equivalent product when operating temperature was increased to 40C and
maintaining performance after multiple juice dewatering and cleaning cycles.
Product stability was demonstrated by leaving OD juice concentrate open to air
with no microbiological growth due to very low water activity in the juice
concentrate. In the OD process the solution to be dewatered is placed on one
side of the hydrophobic membrane and a high salinity feed is placed on the other
side. Water vapor then moves from the solution to the high salinity side. While
OD has been around for 15 years, no significant commercial products have been
developed due to these hydrophobic microporous membranes rapidly wetting out.
This project will demonstrate a novel, non-porous perfluoromembrane that
eliminates wet-out while maintaining high water vapor transport.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications include beverages,
pharmaceuticals, neutraceuticals, and industrial chemicals. &lt;br/&gt;
