The regulated movement of membrane vesicles within the cell is a process
essential to life. This trafficking of membrane vesicles mediates the transport
of proteins within the cell and the secretion of certain selected proteins from
the cell. Minor defects in these processes can result in devastating
physiological consequences. The correct trafficking of vesicles requires a high
level of specificity, as transport vesicles containing only the correct cargoes
(e.g. specific proteins) must form at the proper donor membrane and be delivered
to the right target membrane. However, the mechanisms that underlie the
specificity of membrane transport remain largely undefined. In this project
fission yeast will be used to investigate these regulatory mechanisms,
especially those mediated by the ADP Ribosylation Factor Guanine Nucleotide
Exchange Factors that are known to play a role in determining the specificity of
secretory traffic. Broader Impacts. This project will enhance undergraduate
research through 1) integration into inquiry-based teaching laboratories, 2)
providing research projects for 4-7 senior biology students each year and 3)
summer research opportunities for undergraduate students.
