9217791 Boyle The PIs would like to take advantage of a rare passage of the
French vessel Marion Dufresne through the North Atlantic to obtain long and
large diameter piston cores on the Bermuda Rise. Such a temperature latitude
cores would contain a record that could be similar to the Vostock Ice Core with
high temporal resolution. The cores could become a principal tool for resolving
the climatic and paleoenvironmental record of the past 2-3 glacial cycles, which
is one of the prime objective of the global change research program. ***
