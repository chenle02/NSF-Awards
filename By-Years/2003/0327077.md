While exciting nano scientific discoveries stream continually from research
laboratories, due to the lack of new manufacturing paradigms, scaling to
industrial level production still faces critical challenges. The Center for
Scalable and Integrated NAno Manufacturing (SINAM) embraces a vision for a new
manufacturing paradigm that will transform laboratory science into industrial
applications, in nano-electronics, biomedicine, and in traditional industries.
We have organized an exceptional team of scientists and engineers from six
institutions: UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford, UCSD, University of North Carolina
and HP Labs to embark on this important mission. SINAM proposes a nano-
manufacturing paradigm that integrates an array of new nano-manufacturing
technologies to address the above mentioned critical challenges. Proposed top-
down nano-manufacturing technologies include: a plasmonic imaging lithography
(PIL) that uses engineered surface plasmons with extremely short wavelength, and
ultra-molding lithography , both aiming nano manufacturing at the 1-10 nanometer
scale. SINAM will further develop a novel hybrid approach, in combining the top-
down and bottom up technologies to achieve massively parallel integration of
heterogeneous nanoscale components into higher-order structures and devices.
SINAM will develop system engineering strategies to scale up the technologies
developed and work with industry to develop next generation of nano
manufacturing tools, which will be used for commercial product design and
development.

SINAM's broader impacts includes education and training for a high tech
workforce, and societal outreach for general public benefits. We will make
special efforts with California schools to reach out to minority and female
students. These educational activities include: (1) Grades 7-12, Discover
Nanotechnology where SINAM researchers will create an inquiry module on
Nanotechnology for students; (2) Nano-Manufacturing Summer Academy will provide
a six weeks summer training for undergraduates students and K-12 grade school
teachers; and (3) "Graduate Young Investigator (GYI)" and Industrial Internships
for Graduate Students. To build awareness of the opportunities and impact of
nano manufacturing, we will work with California Science Museums and the
California State Economic Strategy Panel. We also plan to work through
professional organizations such as ASME, SME, and IEEE in organizing symposia.
We will establish the SINAM Industrial Consortium to work closely with our
industrial partners such as HP, IBM, etc, to transfer new technologies developed
at SINAM to industrial applications. We have also developed partnerships with
government laboratories as well as international top research centers in Europe
and Asia. We have identified LARTA (Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance, a
non-profit organization) as our partner in technology transfer and economic
development. SINAM's integrated research and education platform will have wide
and profound impacts on human life experience through applications in computing,
telecommunication, photonics, biotechnology, health care and national security.
The new manufacturing paradigm to be developed will greatly impact the human
society, its future and its history, just as the steam engine and the
microelectronics revolution have done.
