Experimental measurements of photoionization, using synchrotron radiation, will
be carried out in order to obtain accurate cross sections, to study fluorescence
and autoionization, and with the objective of unraveling the effects of electron
correlations and spin-orbit interactions on atomic systems. Areas of
investigation include (1) measurement of relative photoionization cross sections
of atomic nitrogen, (2) improved atomic oxygen cross sections, (3)
autoionization lines caused by excitation of 2s electrons in atomic oxygen, and
(4) fluorescence produced by simultaneous ionization and excitation of argon.
