This project will utilize a multi-fluid global simulation of the magnetosphere
to study several important questions concerning the interaction of the
magnetosphere with the ionosphere and with the plasma sphere. It will examine
how changes in ionospheric conductance modifies the cross-polar cap electric
potential drop, the effects of ionospheric mass loading on the evolution of the
magnetosphere and how the introduction of heavy ionospheric ions affects the
reconnection process in the magnetotail.
