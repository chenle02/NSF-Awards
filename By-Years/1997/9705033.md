9705033 Heller The project supports a two-day workshop held in conjunction with
the SIGCSE meeting and the ACM conference. The intent is to draw 30 potential
PIs to the meeting and offer them substantive support on how to address the
needs of secondary school computer science teachers. Through a combination of
panels, presentations and work sessions, the participants learn about the trends
in computer science education, addressing pedagogical needs, teacher
perspectives, and evaluation. A web site to maintain the materials is also
provided. Cost sharing is 6% of the NSF award.
