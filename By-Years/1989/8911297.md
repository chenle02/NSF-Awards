The objective of this research program is to study small particles and surfaces
using a combination of high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and
theoretical modeling. The proposed research effort focuses on two areas: (i)
small particle research and (ii) gas-surface effects. The small particle
research quantifies structural fluctuations and characterizes the phenomena of
encapsulation and sinking of particles on a substrate. Gas surface effects focus
on changes in the structure of thin films and small particles when exposed to
low pressure gas.
