This is an award to support research on the role of solution chemistry, chemical
characteristics of the solid- solution interface and colloidal interactions with
porous media on the transport of colloids in groundwater. Objectives of this
project are to develop a theoretical framework for these phenomena and then to
conduct laboratory experiments to evaluate the chemical factors that affect
movement of colloids in porous media aquifers. The approach planned in
developing the transport model will be to combine fundamental theories of mass
transfer, consideration of the hydrodynamics of colloids in porous media,
colloidal interaction and stability. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted in accord with the NSF Program Announcement: Research Initiation
Awards, NSF 88-99. Results are expected to provide a scientific base for
characterizing the fate of colloidal particles that are suspended in water as
they move through a porous medium such as a groundwater aquifer or a filtration
process in a water treatment system. In addition to their role as pollutants,
colloidal particles can serve as the vehicle for transport of bacteria and
viruses. Results of this research may also be applied to engineering design of
systems to isolate aquifers from potential contamination by seepage from
hazardous waste disposal sites.
