The project involves the development of a computer-based laboratory to be used
for instruction in cognitive and experimental psychology courses. The laboratory
will expose students to the many methods employed and the important phenomena
studied in the traditionally experimental areas of psychology, including
cognitive, learning, and methodology. Furthermore, the opportunities to become
familiar with the use of the computer as an integral part of their course work
will equip students with the skills necessary to participate more fully in the
research process.
