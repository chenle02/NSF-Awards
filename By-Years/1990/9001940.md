This phase 2 SBIR proposal is concerned with a new device which utilizes a
technique developed for an ink-jet writing machine. This device should allow the
delivery of very small amounts of fluid in the close proximity of a cell. Cells
communicate with each other by secreting chemical messengers, such as hormones
and neurotransmitters and it would be important, both for theoretical and
practical purposes, to be able to replicate this process. This device promises
to do precisely that. If the design is successfully implemented it will be
possible to deliver minute amounts of chemicals known or suspected to be
cellular messengers, directly onto the surface of cells. Also, it will be
possible to deliver drugs suspected to interfere with cellular communications.
For this reason the device could become an important tool in the pharmaceutical
industry.
