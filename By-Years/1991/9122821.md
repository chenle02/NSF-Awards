Feral pigs (Sus scrofa L.) are common animals throughout much of California.
Their grubbing activities remove vegetation and disturb soil, prompting concern
that they may be harming populations of native plants and encouraging alien
weeds. This project is concerned with the nature and rate of revegetation of
meadows grubbed by feral pigs. Observational techniques, experimental
simulations of key features of pig damage, and transplant experiments will be
used to achieve the following objectives: 1. To describe the seasonality and
extent of pig damage 2. To document the revegetation of areas disturbed by feral
pigs 3. The describe the responses of plants to grubbing and to infer plant
characteristics responsible for between- species differences 4. To identify
characteristics of grubbing important to revegetation. This research will
increase both our understanding of the threat posed to native plant communities
by feral pigs and our knowledge of the roles that patchiness and disturbance
play in plant communities.
