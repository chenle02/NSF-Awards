9309345 Muhunthan The objective of this research is to develop a new technique
based on simulation, aimed at building models of real porous media. On the basis
of measurements of characteristics made using thin sections of porous media at
the microstructural level, an artificial medium that has the same average
geometric properties as the original medium will be created. The permeability
tensor will be obtained by solving the field equation numerically in a sample of
three-dimensional reconstructed soil medium. the results will be compared with
experimental data. The possibility of determing the permeability tensor by
direct observations on thin sections will be also investigated. ***
