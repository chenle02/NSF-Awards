This award supports the organization of a 2-day Workshop on Artificial
Intelligence to Assist Mathematical Reasoning in May 2023. This workshop brings
together academic, industry, and government stakeholders to discuss the

(1) state of the art of using AI to assist mathematical reasoning, including
case studies in particular domains; (2) opportunities to advance research in AI
for mathematical reasoning and potential impacts from doing so, and technical
advances required to expand this initiative; (3) current challenges and barriers
to the use of AI for mathematical reasoning; and (4) roles for stakeholders in
advancing AI for mathematical reasoning.

Workshop videos and presentations will be posted online and a professional
science writer will author a short workshop proceeding reflecting the key points
from the workshop.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
