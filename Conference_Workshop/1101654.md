This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the 2011 and
2012 meetings of the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS). GPOTS 2011
will be held at Arizona State University during the period May 18-22, 2011 and
GPOTS 2012 will be held at the University of Houston during the period May
30-June 30, 2012. The meetings will be both dynamic and topical, focusing on
several high-impact areas. The focus areas will include classification of
C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras; wavelets, frames and their applications;
operator spaces/systems and their applications; the interaction between non-
selfadjoint operator algebras and function theory; dynamical systems for
C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras; subfactors; and the interaction between
discrete mathematics and operator algebras. The themes of the meetings
demonstrate the surprising links among operator algebras, geometry, and
topology; the connections between frame theory and computing; and the
relationships among von Neumann algebras, mathematical physics, probability, and
random matrix theory.

These GPOTS meetings will bring together both experienced and junior
researchers, including graduate students, and postdocs to discuss recent work
and advances in operator theory and operator algebras. GPOTS conferences are an
extremely attractive and welcoming venue for graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and junior faculty, serving as a springboard for their future in the
profession. A priority of the 2011-2012 GPOTS conferences will be to build up
networks that facilitate the entry into the operator theory and operator
algebras research community of graduate students, postdocs, and new faculty
members who are interested in operator theory and operator algebras - with a
particular emphasis on underrepresented groups. Priority for funding will be
given to graduate students, other young researchers and participants without
other support as well as members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. In
addition to advancing areas of mathematics, the subject matter of GPOTS
2011-2012 has connections to engineering, quantum computing and mathematical
physics.
