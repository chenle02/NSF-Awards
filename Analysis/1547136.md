This award provides funding for the workshop "Analysis in Lyon" which occur at
the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, October 26-30, 2015.

This workshop focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
field of partial differential equations. The topics to be covered in the
workshop are gradient flows, regularity theory for optimal transport, Ricci
curvature flows, pressureless gas dynamics, fractional diffusion, and kinetic
theory. This award gives young researchers without other funding the opportunity
to participate in this workshop. A (partial) list of confirmed speakers includes
L. Caffarelli, W. Gangbo, S. Serfaty, F. Lin and C. Villani. The organizing
committee will strive to make this opportunity known to target groups through a
variety of media.
