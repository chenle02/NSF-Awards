This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project seeks financial support to
acquire a modular, instrumented single-screw extruder with sensors and a multi-
function co-injection molding machine as experimental instruments to be used at
the Polymer Engineering Center (PEC), University of Wisconsin-Madison. The
research proposed here responds to the call by the NSF's Directorate for
Engineering, as stated in its "NSF Engineering: The Long View" document, for
rapid development of "advanced manufacturing technologies" based on "advanced
fabrication and processing methods" and "advancements in the quality of
education on maintaining a preeminent engineering work force."

The acquisition and development of these state-of-the-art, instrumented machines
will improve the quality and expand the scope of current research, research
training, and integrated research and education activities related to polymer
processing at the PEC. Specifically, these instrumented machines will expedite
the research progress in improving existing and developing new polymer
processing methods; it will also enhance the learning environment that serves
nearly 250 student attendances in various polymer processing courses and lab
sessions each semester at UW-Madison.
