This award supports a conference to explore establishment of a National
Transportation Research Information Clearinghouse to serve ten University
Transportation Centers funded by the Department of Transportation. The
conference is scheduled for May, 1989 in Washington, DC. The National Science
Foundation's interest stems from the conference's planned exploration of efforts
to establish a National Research Network as proposed in the report from the
Office of Science and Technology Policy of October 1987, "A Research and
Development Strategy for High Performance Computing". The conference will focus
on how to upgrade existing facilities in support of a transition plan to the
network through a cooperative effort among major government users.//
