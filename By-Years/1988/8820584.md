This award supports collaborative research between Nicholas Cernansky, Drexel
University, and Shi Shaoxi, Tianjin University on the effects of fuel properties
and physical factors on engine combustion processes. This award adds an
international dimension to work funded under NSF grant CBT 8706030. Through a
coordinated research program, with the chemistry of combustion being
investigated at Drexel and the physical processes of combustion being studied at
Tianjin, the investigators hope to obtain a better understanding of the
chemistry and physics in engine combustion and autoignition processes. Drexel
will focus on low and intermediate temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons using a
variety of laboratory systems, including static and flow reactor systems, to
isolate relevant chemical processes. Tianjin will focus on physical factors,
such as surface deposits, heat transfer and fluid flow effects, using a variety
of laboratory and engine test facilities. Ultimately, this research could lead
to improved engine performance.
