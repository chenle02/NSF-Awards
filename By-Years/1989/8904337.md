The goals of this project are to obtain a picture of a protein and its solvent
environment at atomic resolution and to test how well the mobility of atoms in
the structure is modeled by molecular dynamics and normal mode treatments of
protein motion. The test system for these studies is the well-ordered,
hydrophobic protein, crambin, which diffracts to at least 0.83 A. An underlying
motivation is to understand the forces which stabilize protein folding by
determination of the protein's equilibrium geometry and vibrational motion and
by calculating the magnitude of the interaction forces in the crystal with an
empirical potential energy function. Crambin presents a unique opportunity to
view a protein with its surrounding solvent at truly atomic resolution,
unprejudiced by a restraining protein model. There are numerous benefits from
this information. The geometry of the peptide unit can be seen for the protein
itself. The hydrogen bonding distances and angular distributions both within the
protein and for the water can be examined. The arrangement of water molecules
around polar and nonpolar groups at the protein surface may provide a model for
building water around other protein surfaces and for understanding water at the
active sites of enzymes.
