The principal investigator proposes to study various topics on vertex operator
algebras. In particular, the following topics will be studied: (1) Induced
modules: The PI will define an induced functor from the twisted module category
for a vertex operator algebra to the twisted module category for a bigger vertex
operator algebra. This will establish a basic tool for studying the
representation theory for vertex operator algebras and lead to solving well
known conjectures in orbifold conformal field theory.(2) Modular invariance: The
PI expects to prove that twisted trace functions or partition functions are
modular functions over congruence subgroups of the modular group for a rational
vertex operator algebra. In particular, the graded dimension of any irreducible
twisted module or twisted sector is a modular function. It is also expected to
obtain that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the graded
dimensions of the irreducible modules is invariant under the full modular group.
This will have immediate applications in classification of vertex operator
algebras. (3) Classification of rational vertex operator algebras with small
central charges: Rational vertex operator algebras which play the fundamental
roles in rational conformal field theory form the most important class of vertex
operator algebras. The PI will classify the rational vertex operator algebras
with the central charge less than or equal to 1. This can be regarded as the
first step in classification of rational vertex operator algebras.

Vertex operator algebra theory is a new area of mathematics. It provides an
algebraic foundation for the 2 dimensional quantum conformal field theory in
physics and is also deeply related to many important areas of mathematics such
as representation theory, group theory, modular forms, topology invariants, and
C*-algebras. The proposed research studies some fundamental problems in the
field and has important applications in both mathematics and physics.
