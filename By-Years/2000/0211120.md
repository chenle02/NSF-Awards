With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
John E. Baldwin, of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University, is
studying isomerization reactions of isotopically labeled hydrocarbons. Professor
Baldwin is establishing the relative importance of one-center and two-center
epimerizations in spiropentanes and cyclopropanes and obtaining the first
experimental measures of secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on these
stereomutations. In addition, he is exploring a number of other fundamental
hydrocarbon isomerizations, including the conversion of cyclopropane to
propylene via 1-propylidene, [1,3]-carbon shifts, [1,5]-hydrogen shifts,
interconversion of bicyclo[5.1.0]octa-2,4-dienes via intermediate
bicyclo[4.1.1]octa-2,4-dienes, and "carbo-Claisen"
rearrangements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermal reactions of small hydrocarbon
molecules play key roles both in fundamental organic reaction chemistry and in
large-scale petrochemical processes such as hydrocarbon reforming. Professor
John E. Baldwin, of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University, is
studying the thermal transformations of a variety of small molecules. By
incorporating stable isotopes, Professor Baldwin is able to obtain a
comprehensive view of these transformations, obtaining insights into the
reaction mechanisms which will ultimately lead to a fundamental understanding of
how thermal reactions characteristic of simple organic chemicals occur.
