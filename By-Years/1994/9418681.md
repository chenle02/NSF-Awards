9418681 Hesterberg This project will locate and quantify deformation due to
past, relatively recent tectonic activity in areas of low relief, such as the
New Madrid seismic zone, which are often located far from plate boundaries and
may be overlain by thousands of meters of sediments. Previous geomorphic methods
have had little success in the past; this project will develop and test new
methods that are based on the observation that streams adjust their channels to
external change by incising, aggrading, or altering their sinuosity. The method
is a statistical one and relatively inexpensive. It uses topographic maps rather
than field work. The results of this project will provide a useful reconnaisance
tool for any low relief continental area subject to large earthquakes and will
profoundly improve our understanding of active tectonics in the cratonic regions
of continents.
