A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system(GC-MS), a Fourier transform-
infrared spectrometer and two high performance liquid chromatographs are being
acquired for the Science Resource Center to help strengthen the chemistry
laboratory program. Acquisition of these instruments is enabling students
enrolled in an associate in applied science in chemical technology degree
program to have access to these instruments which are widely used in industry,
allowing industrial technicians to upgrade their skills and allowing chemistry
and other science and engineering students to use state-of-the-art equipment to
develop laboratory skills, as well as reinforce the learning of chemical
principles. High school advanced placement students, students preparing to be
teachers and precollege science teachers are also benefitting by having access
to the instruments. In the program, laboratory experiments are being emphasized,
utilizing the requested instruments which bridge theoretical concepts with
practical industrial applications. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
