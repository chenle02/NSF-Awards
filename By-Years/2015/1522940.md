This project will organize and conduct a highly visible dissemination outlet for
grant holders from a variety of NSF programs supporting engineering education.
This outlet will take the form of a poster session at the American Society for
Engineering Education's (ASEE) Annual Conference for each of the four years from
2016 to 2019. Such a poster session has been held at the June ASEE conference
every year since 1986, with NSF sponsorship since 1992. The grant programs from
which awardees have been invited have changed and expanded over the time and
will evolve with changes in NSF programs. Recent sessions have included the
following NSF programs: Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (TUES), Advanced Technological Education
(ATE), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion
(STEP), Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), Improving Undergraduate STEM
Education (IUSE:EHR), and Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education in Engineering
(NUE). Grant recipients who have received engineering awards in the two years
previous to the conference will be invited to submit an abstract for inclusion
in the poster session. If accepted, they will be invited to submit a paper for
the proceedings and, if the paper is accepted, present in the poster session.

The NSF Grantee Poster Session at the ASEE annual conference is a central and
well-attended event at the ASEE Annual Conference. Continuation of the session
at future conferences will result in the broad and rapid dissemination of the
research-based engineering education developments. The papers associated with
all posters will be freely available and searchable via the ASEE webpage. This
exchange and availability of ideas will result in those effective practices and
research results being adopted by other educators in their own programs. The
session fosters interaction between engineering education practitioners,
education researchers, and institutional administrators. These interactions will
lead to new collaborations and project ideas to address emerging issues in
engineering education.
