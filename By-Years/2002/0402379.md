This proposal seeks support from the NSF to help offset costs for student and
postdoctoral participation in a workshop entitled "Non-Ambient Crystallography:
The Science of Change" to be held in Berkeley, CA on Dec 4-7, 2003 at the
Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This
interdisciplinary conference is currently sponsored by the Consortium for
Materials Properties Research at High Pressure (COMPRES), the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (LBNL) and the International Union of Crystallography
(IUCr). Funding in the amount of $7500 is being requested primarily to provide
travel support to enable young scientists, especially students, to participate
in the meeting. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
