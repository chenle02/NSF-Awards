Abstract EEC-9708968, National Technological University, Lionel V. Baldwin,
Principal Investigator This award provides funding to the National Technological
University for support of the 1996 National Engineers Week Teleconference for
Middle and High School Students. The eighth annual Discover Engineering!
Teleconference will be delivered nationwide during National Engineers Week, on
February 19, 1997. The special focus of the teleconference will be a very fast-
paced, highly interactive look at the transition from high school to college,
featuring a panel of three high school students, two undergraduates and two
professional engineers. The telecast is central to many local activities held
during National Engineers Week wherein engineers welcome students and teachers
to the workplace, providing tours and discussion which are stimulated by the
telecast.
