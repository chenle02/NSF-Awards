Many marine animals living in soft sediments alter their behavior depending on
near-bottom flow speeds. At low flow, feeding on deposited particulate matter is
common, while at higher flow animals often switch to feeding on suspended
matter. This "switching" is thought to be beneficial in terms of using better
food items or minimizing competitive interactions due to limited food resources.
However, little direct evidence exists that animals obtain a net benefit by
switching their feeding behavior. Laboratory experiments will be conducted on
three bottom-dwelling species with different capacities for switching. A
seawater flume will be used to create environments differing in flow speeds and
availability of suspended and deposited particulate matter. Feeding and growth
rates of individual animals will be measured to test hypotheses about the
benefits obtained under these differing conditions. Selected experiments will be
replicated at sites in the field where flow regime and supply of suspended
particulate matter vary.
