This research project studies the theory of quantum mechanical phenomena in
disordered environments. The research aims to extend mathematical analysis of
the electronic properties of disordered structures within the framework of
ergodic Schrödinger operators. The project has potential impact in physics
through improvement of the understanding of quantum mechanical transport
properties of media exhibiting certain kinds of disorder.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates spectral properties of ergodic
Schrödinger operators. The potentials of these Schrödinger operators are
obtained by sampling with a continuous function along the orbits of an ergodic
transformation on a compact metric space. This framework covers many examples of
interest, such as almost-periodic potentials and random potentials. The primary
objectives of the project are to investigate the following: direct and inverse
spectral theory for quasi-periodic Schrödinger operators in one dimension with
applications to the Korteweg-de Vries equation, the presence of absolutely
continuous spectrum for quasi-periodic Schrödinger operators in higher
dimensions, the relationship between decay of gap lengths and smoothness of the
potential, the almost periodicity of the Jacobi parameters associated with
balanced measures on dynamically defined Cantor sets, the scope of general
operator renormalization equations and their applications, one-dimensional self-
similar potentials beyond the reach of hyperbolic dynamics, connections between
bound states and essential spectrum for perturbations of periodic Schrödinger
operators, and the interface between direct and inverse spectral theory for
almost periodic Jacobi matrices.
