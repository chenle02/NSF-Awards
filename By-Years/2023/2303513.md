The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) covers a large area of the tropical western
Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans. Recent observations indicate that the IPWP is
undergoing profound changes. The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is also changing.
The ITF moves relatively warm and fresh upper ocean waters from the western
Pacific and Indonesian Seas to the Indian Ocean. This movement plays a critical
role in the climate of the region. However, limited oceanographic data from the
region make separating natural variability from anthropogenic trends
challenging. Given the significance of the IPWP, separating multidecadal
variability and anthropogenic trends is critical. This study will combine data
collected from sediment cores with model simulations to investigate 1100 year of
changes in the ITF. As part of this work, K-12 educational material will be
created for schools in the Indo-Pacific region. The project will support a
graduate student, and a post-doctoral researcher.

The team will conduct a modeling â€“ data collection effort to gain insights into
the controls of the ITF and how they might differ across time scales and
background climate states over the last millennium, including the Industrial
Era. New, well-dated, highly-resolved, records of thermocline structure,
reconstructed using geochemical and faunal measurements, will extend
instrumental records from the ITF region to span the last millennium. Dynamical
interpretations of the data will be provided by a hierarchy of ocean and climate
models, which will be used to evaluate the dominance of wind and buoyancy
forcing on different time scales, and link reconstructed variability to
multidecadal variations in tropical Pacific mean state (e.g., the Walker
circulation) and the monsoons. Models will also be used to assess if and why
modern warming has altered the relationship between global temperature and the
Walker circulation, as well as to evaluate the climate impacts of ITF
variability and how they are transmitted (atmospheric or oceanic
teleconnections) in simulations of the past, and in future projections.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
