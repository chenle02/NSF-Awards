This workshop will bring together researchers to spur future developments of
experimental and theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of
correlated f-electron systems. In recent years, there has been rapid development
of experimental techniques that provide direct measurements of both equilibrium
and non-equilibrium electronic structures, as have new calculational methods for
the time-independent and time-dependent electronic structures. The workshop will
allow researchers at the forefront of their fields to discuss, exchange ideas
and explore applications of novel spectroscopies to correlated f-electron
systems in a focused forum and also bridge the ever widening gap between time-
resolved experiments and non-equilibrium theory. The participants will include
graduate students, junior and senior faculty at US universities and national
laboratories, as well as international leaders in the field.
