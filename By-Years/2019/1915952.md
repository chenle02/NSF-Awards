The goal of this project is to conduct a workshop of the Electrical and Computer
Engineering (ECE) Department Heads sponsored by NSF and National Academy of
Engineers (NAE) on the topic of "Combating Climate Change: Can it also help the
ECE Renaissance?" on April 19-20, 2019 in Minneapolis, MN. The proposed workshop
program includes presentations by experts on climate change, opportunities to
increase female enrollments in ECE courses, an introductory course on climate
change and electrical engineering suitable for freshmen as well as high school
students, and breakout sessions to prepare an action plan. The proposed workshop
is a positive step towards understanding the linkages between climate change and
electrical engineering. Follow on actions could lead to attracting larger number
of high school students including women and minorities towards
ECE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate change is happening rapidly, and it poses a
great threat to the humanity. Some of the solutions to combat climate change are
using renewable energy to generate electricity, electrifying transportation and
increasing system efficiencies, which require the knowledge of electrical
engineering. Many young people don't see the relationship between these
solutions and ECE. This proposal addresses promoting this relationship and
provides an avenue to leverage combating climate change for increasing the
pipeline of talented high school students opting for power/energy as well as
other related fields within ECE, which could reverse the trend of declining
enrollments in ECE programs nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
