Abstract: The program ``Low-dimensional contact geometry" is organized jointly
by the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) and the Department of Mathematics
of Stanford University. It will run from mid-August till mid-December 2000. The
program will end with a a Contact Geometry Workshop. The goal of the program is
to capitalize on recent progress in contact geometry. It seems that the time is
ripe now for new breakthroughs in the field, and that the concentration of both
established and young researchers in contact and symplectic geometry and related
areas, as well as participation of several graduate students, may help to
produce new remarkable results. The organizers feel that a coherent picture of
contact geometry in 3 dimensions is within reach. In particular, the
participants will try to achieve a complete classification of contact structures
for large classes of 3-manifolds, to make further advances in the theory of
Legendrian and transversal knots in contact 3-manifolds, and to establish
further properties of contact 3-manifolds which serve as boundaries of
symplectic 4-manifolds.

Contact geometry was born more than two centuries ago in the work of Huygens,
Hamilton, Jacobi as a geometric language for optics. It was soon realized that
it has applications in many other areas, including non-holonomic mechanics and
thermodynamics. One encounters contact geometry in everyday life when parking a
car, skating, using a refrigerator, or watching the beautiful play of light in a
glass of water. Sophus Lie, Elie Cartan, Darboux and many other great
mathematicians devoted a lot of their work to this subject. However, till very
recently most of the results were of a local nature. With the birth of
symplectic and contact topology in the Eighties, the subject was reborn, and the
last decade witnessed a number of breakthrough discoveries. There were found new
important interactions with Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic and sub-Riemannian
geometry, foliation theory, complex geometry and analysis, topological
hydrodynamics, 3-dimensional topology, and knot theory.
