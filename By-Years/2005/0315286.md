In this project, the susceptibility of small populations to extinction will be
studied. Some organisms can only reproduce asexually (i.e., clonally), and
theory holds that if their populations dwindle to small numbers, then they are
at risk for the accumulation of harmful mutations and extinction. However, it
has been proposed that organisms that can shuffle, or recombine, their DNA
during reproduction will not be as at-risk when their numbers are low. In the
laboratory, the relationships among the intensity of recombination, the
population size, and the probability of extinction will be modeled using
populations of ribonucleic acid (RNA) in test-tube environments. RNA is
chemically similar to DNA but can have life-like catalytic activity, as do whole
organisms, and is thus perfectly suited to laboratory experiments aimed at
testing how recombination slows the loss of this activity in spite of harmful
mutations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be carried out at Portland
State University in Oregon and will involve the training of both undergraduate
and graduate students and high-school science teachers. The results will bear
directly on strategies to manage small populations, be they endangered species
in the wild or in zoos, populations of cells in the body or in the lab, such as
cultured cells grown to study cancer, or populations of viruses during
