The research advisory committee of the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics (NCTM) will sponsor a NCTM STANDARDS Research Catalyst Conference in
March, 1991. The purpose of this working conference is to define and stimulate
research on the perspectives envisioned by the CURRICULUM AND EVALUATION
STANDARDS FOR SCHOOL MATHEMATICS and to monitor the implementation of the
STANDARDS within school settings. Without a collaborative research and
monitoring effort, policy actions, curriculum development, assessment reform,
and pedagogical innovation may proceed without the feedback necessary for
systematic modification and informed decision- making. This conference will
serve to set a research agenda and to catalyze research, development, and
monitoring efforts that examine intended and implemented mathematics curriculum
and assessment reform across the nation by stimulating complementary study
within six focus areas are: assessment, curriculum change, communication,
policy, secondary core curriculum, and representation tools and models.
Conference attendance will be selected by application. Special efforts will be
made to include minorities, new researchers in mathematics education,
mathematicians, and school practitioners in research teams directed by
established leaders in mathematics education. These leaders will serve as
mentors who will organize the framework and the background papers of studies to
be conducted by the participants and a research agenda monograph to be
distributed by NCTM. Long-term outcomes include research reporting presentations
at the 1991 and 1992 NCTM Research Presessions and an interim summary of the
resulting research and monitoring activities.
