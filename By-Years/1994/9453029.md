9453029 Duensing The Exploratorium will develop an exhibit "Memory: A Biological
Cognitive and Cultural Exploration" along with various complementary components.
The primary objective of this project is to increase the public's awareness of
the extent, importance, and nature of their everyday rememberings. Exploratorium
staff will use an approach to memory, and cognition in general, that considers
culture and cultural differences as essential to people's thinking and behavior.
The exhibit area will be about 2000 sq ft in size and will consist of ten to
twelve new activities and six revised interactive, interdisciplinary exhibits.
Here visitors will have the opportunity to interact with the exhibits,
researchers, scientists, artists, and other visitors, to explore the nature of
memory and its effect on their lives. The exhibits will give visitors direct,
experiential insight into the workings of their memories. Other major components
of the project include multimedia presentations, printed materials,
demonstrations, film programs and a symposium. A publication Memory and
Perception will be a supplemental guide that can be used by teachers and
students at the secondary level. It will address appropriate themes in the
Science Framework for California Public Schools. Museum professionals,
researchers, teachers, and evaluators will be invited to participate in a one-
week symposium on Cognition in Science Centers. The purpose of the symposium is
to develop a conceptual and practical model of what presenting cognition in an
informal education setting means. A report will be published and broadly
disseminated by professional museum organizations. It is estimated that the
project will reach approximately 629,000 visitors annually which includes 69,000
students and 550 teachers.
