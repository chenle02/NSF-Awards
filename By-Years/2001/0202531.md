Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Singularities and Statistics in Nonlinear
Partial Differential Equations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A first goal of this
proposal is to study mathematically singularities in fluids and plasmas, and
their connection to physical processes. Specific problems include free surface
pinch-off in fluids, geometric depletion of singularities in active scalars,
incompressible Euler and MHD equations related to vortex and magnetic
reconnection. A second goal of the proposal is to study statistics of long time
behavior of dissipative systems, such as thermal fluid convection. Specific
goals include bounds on heat transport in convection, energy cascades, coarse
inertial manifolds, and turbulent front propagation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluids
and plasmas involve many active length and time scales that interact
dynamically. The long time behavior of complex systems, such as turbulent
convection, involves also many interacting spatial and temporal scales.
Mathematical studies are needed to guide computer simulations. What quantities
are well behaved, and can be safely predicted with rather inexpensive, coarse
computations? What conditions produce rapid generation of small scales? Which of
these are important and result in qualitative changes? What are the
characteristics of the ensuing dissipative energy transfer? These are
fundamental questions for progress in understanding and computation of complex
phenomena. This proposal is aimed at a core of such
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: April 12, 2002&lt;br/&gt;
