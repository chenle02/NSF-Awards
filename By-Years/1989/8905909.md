ZnSe/GaAs heterojunctions and multiple quantum wells will be fabricated by the
relatively unexplored technique of chemical beam epitaxy. Controlled
substitutional doping of each material system will be addressed. Special growth
conditions will be determined to grow each semiconductor layer, having optimized
material quality, simultaneously. The proposed research equipment is crucial to
identify proper growth processes necessary for fabrication of stoichiometric
layers. Gas flow ratios for the various atomic species versus temperature will
determine the layer quality, but will also affect possible interfacial compound
formation or the presence of interface state densities. An in situ analysis
technique, such as Auger electron spectroscopy, can give an initial clue to what
relative amounts of each specie are present at the surface of each layer. Rapid
strides will be possible since each sample will be analyzed even before it is
removed from the ultrahigh vacuum environment.
