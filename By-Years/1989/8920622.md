This project is part of a collaborative effort between Haverford College,
Michigan State University, and the University of Wyoming for extragalactic
observations with near infrared imaging cameras. Haverford College has an
outstanding reputation for involving undergraduate students in front line
research, and has produced astronomers out of all proportion to its size. This
award will enable them to participate in the development of two modern infrared
CCD cameras, and to utilize these devices in studies of the formation of
galaxies in the early universe.
