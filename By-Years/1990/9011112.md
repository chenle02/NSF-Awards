This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989) The Loma Prieta earthquake data will
be used to develop a new response spectrum method for analysis of bridges and
other multyply supported structures that are subjected to differential ground
motion. A frequency dependent correlation model for the support motions of the
Bay Bridge, accounting for the effects of traveling waves, attenuation,
propogation path, and local soil and geologic structures will be constructed and
calibrated. This function will be applied to the response spectrum analysis
based on the principles of stochastic processes. The new response spectrum
method will be used to investigate the response of the Bay Bridge during the
Loma Prieta earthquake and to determine the causes of its failure. Special
emphasis will be given to determining the influence of differential support
motions on the observed performance of the bridge. The results from this anlysis
will be compared with planned time-history analysis of the bridge by a separate
research team at Berkeley, thus verifying the response spectrum method. The
method will then be used to predict the response of the Ba Bridge to a potential
earthquake of large magnitude on San Andreas or Hayward faults. This part will
be carried out in parallel with other planned studies of the Bay Bridge at the
Universit of California at Berkeley. The investigation will advance the
methodology for analyzing the bridge response to multiple-support seismic
excitations.
