9451214 DiJulio The Mechanical Engineering Department at California State
University, Northridge has developed new courses in automotive and environmental
engineering. For the past nine years our students have distinguished themselves
in national automotive engineering design competitions and as a result the ME
Department has developed expertise in the area of alternative fuels. Last year
as part of curriculum development in environmental engineering a new senior
design course was developed which provides an opportunity for students to solve
local industry's environmentally related problems. High student demand for these
automotive and environmental engineering laboratories and a lack of new
equipment threatens the quality of these programs. The State of California has
provided limited, one-time funding for the 94-95 academic year for an
engineering and computer science building expansion and laboratory improvement.
This proposal requests matching funds for automotive and environmental
engineering laboratory improvement. Specifically, the engine dynamometers and
instruments requested will provide additional measurement, diagnostic and
development capabilities in projects related to the use of alternative fuels in
engines. Engine performance characteristics will be integrated with emissions
measurements via the Department's existing exhaust gas analyzer. The gas
chromatograph requested for the environmental engineering lab will be used to
evaluate soil remediation projects and automotive emission of methane and non-
methane gas concentrations. The requested equipment will support instruction and
provide research opportunities for undergraduates in the future.
