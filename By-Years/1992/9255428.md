This intensive six-week workshop deals with modern methods of recombinant DNA
and protein analysis, aiming to provide college faculty with the expertise
necessary to introduce this work into their undergraduate programs. Procedures
will be consistent with research standards and will explore low-cost techniques
that are appropriate to an undergraduate teaching setting. In addition to
laboratory skills, principles underlying the methods and their extension to
problems at the forefront of research will be treated.
