9321794 Wilkinson For her doctoral dissertation, Ms. Janette Wenrick Boughman
will investigate the maintenance of group foraging in the omnivorous,
neotropical greater spear-nosed bat. These bats forage in groups around rich,
ephemeral food sources, while giving loud vocalizations. Neither the advantages
of group foraging nor the functions of these vocalizations are fully understood.
Ms. Boughman's research will focus on two areas. First, she will determine if
acquisition of information about food distribution from group members is a
primary advantage of group foraging. To this end, she will analyze social and
echolocation calls to determine if these calls provide acoustic signature
information. Playback experiments with captive bats will determine whether
acoustic information is used to discriminate between individuals and groups.
Foraging experiments will help to determine the function of this information to
animals foraging in groups, and measure benefits to test relevant group-foraging
models. Second, Ms. Boughman will conduct field work to corroborate results of
research with captive animals. To this end, she will make observations as a
basis for estimating frequency of group foraging, foraging success of solitary
and group-foraging individuals, and weaning success of roost groups. Field
playbacks will test group discrimination by bats at foraging sites. This work
will add substantially to understanding of how group members discriminate
between their group-mates and others. It will provide insight into the influence
of vocal communication in structuring social systems and mediating complex
behavior, and the importance of information transfer in maintaining group
foraging behavior.
