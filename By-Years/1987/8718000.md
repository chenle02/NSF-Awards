The Ocean Studies Board of the National Academy of Sciences will continue in
1987 its efforts in support of planning, review and evaluation of U.S. ocean
science research programs and related activities. The OSB has established three
sub-groups to address issues of interest to the National Science Foundation:
Arctic Ocean Research, ocean climate research, and international ocean science
policy. The Artic Ocean group will advise NSF on possible areas of future
research in the Arctic Ocean and will serve as the primary U.S. interface with
the international Arctic Ocean Sciences Board. The ocean climate research will
provide guidance to NSF and other Federal agencies regarding the World Climate
Research Program (WCRP), especially the WCRP studies of interannual variability
in the tropical ocean and global climate (TOGA) and the world ocean circulation
experiment (WOCE). The international ocean science policy group will consider
long-term ramifications of the steadily increasing implementation by foreign
countries of the marine scientific research provisions of the UN Convention of
the Law of the Sea. The OSB will also convene small workshops as required; will
complete its follow-up of major workshops the Board convened in FY 1987, such as
the workshop on ridge crest processes; and will provide support for Federal
long-range planning in specific scientific areas upon request from NSF and other
Federal agencies.
