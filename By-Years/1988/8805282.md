This proposal requests renewal of a REU Program for nine undergraduate students
in the research area of Sensor Technologies. The REU activity will be part of
the Center for Sensor Technologies which provides the facilities (laboratories,
equipment, and instrumentation) for faculty and students to interact and
collaborate, exchange ideas, and share resources. Project topics include
optical, mechanical, and thermal sensors; micromaching; packing; neural
network.based sensors; and sensor interfacing. This innovative center and its
associated faculty can provide undergraduate students substantive educational
and research experiences. The students will be chosen from not only the
University of Pennsylvania but from over 25 local colleges in the region where
research capability is sparse.
