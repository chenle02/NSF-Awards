This grant investigates micromechanical deformation using atomic force
microscopy, continuous indentation testing, and impression creep analysis. These
techniques are applied to several materials systems (bucky balls, amorphous
metals, polymers) to develop new tools for micromechanical testing applicable to
thin films. Nanoindentation experiments are planned using the atomic force
microscope and its associated small indenter. Shear bands are examined in
polymers and amorphous metals. Theoretical support includes consideration of the
molecular dynamics of the interaction between bucky balls, finite element
analysis of continuous loading and unloading with an indenter, and diffusional
creep at aluminum grain boundaries. %%% The results impact the area of
micromechanical measurement of thin films and small particles. Crack nucleation,
erosion, and localized deformation are examples of microdeformation phenomena
that would benefit from improved analysis techniques.
