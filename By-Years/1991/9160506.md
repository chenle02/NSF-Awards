This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area instrumentation development in the subfield of infrared spectrometry.
Conventional methods of infrared (IR) spectroscopy utilize either a small
throughout (IR flux) optical element for dispersion followed a detector (or
array), or a large throughout, scanning interferometer followed by a detector. A
new, smart detector design is proposed here for accomplishing transform
spectroscopy of infrared light directly on the detector chip itself. The new
method is a large throughput transform technique which incorporates the
multiplex advantage without requiring a mechanically scanned interferometer.
This new spectrometer is potentially very small, compact, and rugged, especially
if it is fabricated on a silicon wafer substrate, as is planned (i.e., a
spectrometer on a chip). This opto- electronic device structure can also be
adapted to other IR instrument technologies. During this Phase I project these
investigators will make a first loop on the full design and concept testing for
the graded interference-filter spectrometer device. The concept for this new
device for IR transform spectroscopy arises out of several areas of strength
within the research staff at Advanced Fuel Research, Inc., hence the potential
for success is large.
