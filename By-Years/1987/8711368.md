This proposal requests funding for the operation of a centralized marine
aquarium facility that serves as a shared, core resource for seven ongoing
research projects at the Marine Biomedical Institute and other departments of
the University of Texas, Galveston. These laboratories are engaged in basic
research in the neural sciences, studying aspects of anatomy, electrophysiology
and biophysics, pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior in vertebrate and
invertebrate aquatic species collected by and/or maintained in the aquarium.
Projects include: studies on the electrophysiological and pharmacological
effects of natural and synthetic egg-laying-related peptides on identified
neurons in Aplysia, electrophysiological and behavioral studies to identify and
characterize the neuronal circuits that underlie rhythmic swimming behavior in
glutamate and dopamine on isolated horizontal cells from the retina of catfish,
anatomical and electrophysiological studies on vestibular modulation of
locomotion using stingrays, biochemical and electrophysiological studies on the
identification and actions of a novel peptide transmitter in Aplysia that
influences the processing of peptides in the atrial gland and CNS neurons that
regulate egg laying and influence the bag cell neuroendocrine system, and
immunocytochemical, biochemical and physiological studies of central neurons in
Aplysia that regulate bag cell activity. The facility also supports projects
that are involved with electrophysiological, morphological, and pharmacological
analyses of the neural regulation of locomotion in lamprey and stingray spinal
chord.
