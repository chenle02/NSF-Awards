This project supports research on the phenomenon of fatigue crack growth.
Understanding the phenomenon is important for contact loading situations
encountered in bearings, gears, and wheel/rail applications. Much research on
crack growth has been done for tensile loading. This project focuses on
compressive/shear loading and comprises three phases covering characterization
of load path experienced by a crack tip, examination of behavior of a crack
branch during a stress cycle, and finally the development of growth law
applicable to contact loading. The theoretical work is swupplemented with an
experimental component.
