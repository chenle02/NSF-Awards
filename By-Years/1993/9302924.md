9302924 Adeyiga Hampton University requests support from NSF for an upgrade of
its connection of its campus network to VERnet from a speed of 56,000 bits per
second to one for 1.5 million bits per second. VERnet is the midlevel network
located in the state of Virginia. VERnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Hampton University a connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The University needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputer, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
