9521691 Trueb This research involves resolution of relationships of fossil and
Recent frogs in several basal lineages. In addition, there are several ancient
frog fossils that have been discovered recently and that are undescribed. It is
probable that these fossils will provide insights on the broader problem of
basal frog relationships and biogeographic history. Recent attempts to resolve
frog systematics using living taxa have been unsatisfactory and inclusion of
data from the fossil record has been thwarted by poor descriptions and lack of
coordinated collaborative efforts between neontologists and paleontologists.
This project will address this problem and involve the collaborative research
efforts of the PI, a South American collaborator and three students. %%% The
significance of the research on basal frog lineages is that it will provide the
framework necessary for unraveling relationships among later diverging frogs and
allow a more comprehensive understanding of frog taxonomy, relationships and
biogeography. ***
