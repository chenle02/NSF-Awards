This award supports the implementation and testing of a prototype computer
system that will allow CISE departments connected to Internet, electronic access
to technical and research reports. This is a collaborative effort between Old
Dominion University, Virginia Polytechnic University, SUNY at Albany, and the
University of Virginia. A workshop was held at Snowbird'92 to formulate the
initial recommendation. The proposed system will consist of a central index to
be kept on dual servers which will store relevant information in an easily
accessible format. Each participating site will locally store its own reports
and will handle index interactions between the central site and the central
index facility. The prototype system will be implemented at the four
collaborating institutions. Testing of the proposed prototype will also include
user testing and evaluation of the performance and scalability of the system.
