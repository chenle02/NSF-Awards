9320221 Forgacs Funds are requested for travel support for the U.S.
participants to the Les Houches Winter School (workshop) on "Interplay of
Genetic and Physical Processes in the Development of Biological Form" to be held
from February 20- 26, 1994 at Les Houches, France. The aim is to attempt to
bridge the gap between the disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics in a
particular field: the development of biological form. Chemists and physicists
will be brought together will cellular and developmental biologists to discuss
the relative importance of genetic and physical processes in development and
their possible interactions. ***
