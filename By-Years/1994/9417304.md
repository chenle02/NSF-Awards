9417304 Xu Large scale atmospheric systems such as low and high pressure centers
are typically governed by a balance of pressure gradient and coriolis forces and
are, therefore, termed balanced flow. For small-scale phenomena such as
thunderstorms, this balance typically does not hold and these weather features
are referred to as being governed by unbalanced flows. The Principal
Investigator will perform a numerical and theoretical study of these two flow
types. Density current features, squall lines and mesoscale vortices are
important mesoscale weather producing systems and often persist over timescales
longer than individual convective storms. These long-lived mesoscale structures
may involve different types of interactions between the balanced large scale
flows and more transient small scale motions. Studying the related balanced
dynamics versus unbalanced dynamics may lead to a new understanding of why the
concerned structure is long-lived. The balanced (or unbalanced transient) flow
component in a mesoscale convective system is likely to be controlled
deterministically (or stochastically) by the large scale environmental flow.
Identifying the balanced and unbalanced flow components in mesoscale convective
systems may provide useful information for improving or developing cloud
parameterization schemes for numerical weather or climate prediction models. ***
