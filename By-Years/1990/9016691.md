This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists in a joint
seminar on "Fundamentals of Bath Smelting and Clean Steel Production," to be
held in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in October 1991. The meeting will
focus on fundamental research on methods of developing new ironmaking
technologies that use coal directly and processes to prodice high quality
"clean" steels. The co-organizers are Professor Richard J. Fruehan and Alan W.
Cramb, Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science, Carnegie
Mellon University and Professor Nobuo Sano, Department of Metallurgy, University
of Tokyo. This is the third joint seminar in the general area of steelmaking,
with the others being held in 1976 and 1983. Technically advanced countries,
such as the United States and Japan, must develop new iron and steelmaking
processes that are economical, pose fewer environmental problems, and produce
high quality steels for national and international markets. Both countries are
developing such processes to produce high quality or ultra clean steel. Such
steels are required for new steel products and improved current products, such
as those for automotive applications. It is in higher quality steels that the
United States and Japan have some advantage over lower cost producing nations
and must maintain their advantage. In the process of bath smelting there are
many fundamental generic problems. Whereas much of the practical know how for
the process is confidential in nature, the generic fundamental research is not.
Examples of fundamental research include slag foaming, reduction reactions, and
solution of ore and coal. The joint seminar will provide a unique forum for
discussing this research which will, in the long term, benefit each country's
efforts to develop a new process.
