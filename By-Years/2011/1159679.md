Recent years have seen extraordinary breakthroughs in computational sentiment
analysis and social network analysis. This research has helped to reveal that
robust language understanding --- in dialogue, in text, on the Web --- depends
on accurately identifying attitudes, emotions, and social relationships.
However, missing from the current scientific and technical picture is a deep
understanding of the ways in which sentiment affects, and is affected by, our
interpersonal relationships and social networks. The central goal of this
project is to fill this gap by developing algorithms, methods, and data sets for
modeling sentiment as social and interpersonal. The approach balances fine-
grained sociological and linguistic study, computational modeling, and large-
scale data-mining of weblogs and other interactive social
media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to reshape the field of sentiment
analysis by moving it towards inferential models of emotional language as
situated in specific social contexts. It also provides social network analysis
with rich features for characterizing social ties, thereby facilitating the
identification of new latent structure in social networks. The work addresses a
wide variety of social and political issues, including the extent of media
polarization, the effects of bias and framing, and the role of emotional content
in shaping the flow of information. It can also inform the creation of the next
generation of communication tools --- software for virtual meetings and online
collaboration that intelligently tracks users' evolving attitudes, social
networking platforms that distinguish relationship types, and data-mining tools
relevant for legal discovery, intelligent tutoring, and media analytics.
