This full scale project focuses on the development of a rapid, validated scale.
The scale will be used by teachers, administrators, and evaluators to measure
student motivation in accordance with a theoretical view grounded in Expectancy-
Value Theory (EVT). The project features a mixed methods approach to
establishing the valid and reliable measure along with an established validity
framework seeking six types of validity and reliability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing and validating the measure, the project team
members will add to education and evaluation theory in terms of informing
understanding of the cost factor in the Expectancy-Value-Cost model of
motivation. In terms of practical applicability, the resulting scale will be
available for widespread use to predict important learning indicators and inform
potential further interventions with students to improve motivation and other
learning outcomes.
