The overall goal of this research is to understand mechanisms used by organisms
to defend themselves against photosensitizing compounds, compounds which are
activated by light and, when photoactivated, are toxic to living cells.
Specifically, this work will address the resistance of a group of fungal plant
pathogens, Cercospora species, to the photosensitizing toxin cercosporin which
they produce. Preliminary studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that the
production of carotenoids and the presence of some cell surface factor(s) are
responsible for cercosporin resistance. Of the two, the cell surface factor(s)
appears to be of primary importance and will be the major emphasis of this work.
Two major approaches will be used. In one, a heterologous transformation system
will be used to identify genes responsible for cercosporin resistance. The
fungus Neurospora crassa, which lacks the cell surface factor(s), will be used
as a recipient for a Cercospora genomic library, and transformants will be
screened for cercosporin resistance. In the second approach, interactions of the
cercosporin molecule with sensitive (freshly isolated) and resistant (12 hour
old) protoplasts will be studied. Attempts will be made to isolate a
cercosporin-binding protein, and possible changes in the cercosporin molecule as
it contacts the surface of a resistant cell will be studied by looking for
alterations in the fluorescence emission spectra of cercosporin in contact with
the surface of sensitive and resistant cells. This work has the potential to
provide new and significant information relevant to a number of disciplines.
Photosensitizers are important compounds in nature, and are used in medicine and
agriculture, yet little is known about mechanisms by which certain organisms or
cell types resist their effects. Characterization of the fungal cell surface
factor(s) responsible for the resistance of this fungus to its own toxin
therefore, will expand significantly our understanding of this phenomenon.
