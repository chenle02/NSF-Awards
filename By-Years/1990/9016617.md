A three-year research program is awarded to develop monolithically integrated
polarization-modulated lasers that can be modulated to ultra-high-frequencies
and coupled lasers that can function as optical bistable elements for use as
switches, memories, and logic circuits. A unique feature and basic theme of the
proposed program is that the device concepts are tested and evaluated in the
context of a fabrication approach that is suitable for large scale integration
eventually. specific tasks include: a. To build an electro-optic TE-TM mode
converter for integration with a semi-conductor laser to form a polarization-
modulated laser; b. to demonstrate self and externally- controlled polarization
modulation of semiconductor lasers in the 20 to 100 GHz range; c. to build
coupled- semiconductor lasers to demonstrate two-mode bistability and to
characterize the switching speed and switching energy of these devices; d. to
develop optical gates and subsystems based upon monolithically integrable
bistable semiconductor lasers; e. further improvement of chemically-assisted
ion-beam etching (CAIBE) scheme for fabricating monolithically integrated
optoelectronic devices and circuits.
