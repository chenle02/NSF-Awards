Support is provided for the Workshop on Thermal Plasma Characterization on
October 13-14, 2002, in Minneapolis. Presentation and discussion of the state of
the art lead to identification of specific research needs to enable or improve
the use of thermal plasmas in such application as lighting, circuit breakers,
coating, cutting and joining, chemical manufacture, and waste
processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
