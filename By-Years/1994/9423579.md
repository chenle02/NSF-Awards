This is a study of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere using data from the
Urbana Medium Frequency radar which has been in continuous operation since
March, 1991. Science studies will focus on investigation of spatial and temporal
variability of winds, tides and gravity waves in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere at Urbana and the mutual interactions between these components of
the motion field. Coupling with the lower atmosphere will be studied by
comparing the gravity wave characterization provided by the MF radar with
simultaneous observations of tropospheric wave activity provided by a
stratosphere-troposphere radar located near Urbana. The spatial and temporal
coherence of short term variability in tidal components will be studied in a
collaborative effort involving the MF radar network stations in North America.
In support of the science studies, analysis technique development will be
carried out to determine optimum techniques for extracting momentum flux
estimates from the MF radar data using software-based interferometry techniques,
and theoretical development of radar scattering models will be combined with
numerical simulations to address questions that still exist regarding the nature
and geophysical interpretation of MF radar backscatter. ***
