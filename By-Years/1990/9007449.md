This project is directed at developing a better understanding of the nature of
some of the basic econonic issues facing centrally planned economies, especially
as these issues relate to the transition of these economies to more
market.oriented systems. The importance of this research stems from the
historical significance of the economic transformation now under way in the
communist countries of Eastern Europe, and the need to better understand the
salient economic issues involved. This research is primarily an application of
economic theory to the area of comparative economic systems, and it will improve
our understanding of the economic reform process in three areas. The first
application will extend classical consumer theory from the special case of
market clearing prices to the more general case of arbitrary prices with search,
waiting, and inventory behavior, which are absent in the special case of market
clearing. The second study will show why planned economies are usually plagued
by shortages of consumer goods. The third application will analyze the
conditions under which a mixture of planned and market systems may be much worse
than either system alone. This could have important implications for how one
gets to a market system without making things much worse during the transition.
