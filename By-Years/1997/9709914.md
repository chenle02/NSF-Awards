Pennsylvania State U. The proposed activity is a workshop which focuses upon the
topic of the future of economic geography and its potential contribution to
understanding the processes of globalization and social and economic change. The
workshop will bring together scholars from geography, economics and regional
science to discuss the formulation of a new research agenda that builds upon the
traditional strengths of this sub-discipline yet speaks to more contemporary
concerns and views. In addition to the goals of research agenda development and
bridging the `old` and `new` realms of economic geography, a distinct objective
is to consider and discuss the matter of methodologies and the role of teaching
in advancing this area of inquiry. The project will result in a conference
report that will be broadly distributed to appropriate communities of scholars.
