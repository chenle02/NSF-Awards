This proposal sets out a research and development program for a novel type of
wide area ion source with a current density of at least 1 A/cm2, or three orders
of magnitude greater than a Kaufman source. the proposed new ion beam technology
would be lower cost (20% of present designs), compact and light weight. The ion
source would have wider application than competing technologies, including
spacecraft ion thrusters, and if successful would have a significant economic
impact. The major technical objects of the Phase I SBIR work program will be a
'proof of concept' test of an ion source and assessment of the possible
technical benefits and challenges in this technology. Critical parameters such
as stability, brightness, total current, energy spread, and lifetime will be
measured.
