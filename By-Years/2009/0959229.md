This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor John C. Ford and colleague Jaeju Ko from
Indiana University of Pennsylvania will acquire a high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) instrument equipped with an automatic injector and pulsed
amperometric detectors. The instrument will be used to support research
activities such as kinetic studies of celluloses and cyclodrextrins as well as
surface chemistry of diamond. Results of these studies will be also be used in
computational studies of enzyme active-sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An HPLC
system will allow separation of mixtures of substances into individual
components to facilitate their study by analyzing the characteristic traces
provided by the interaction of such substances. The technique employs liquid
samples which are run through separation columns at high pressure. This research
will have a significant impact in a number of areas, especially organic
chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research.
