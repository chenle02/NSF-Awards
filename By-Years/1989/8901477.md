8901477 Auchmuty The principal investigator will conduct research on the
construction and analysis of variational principles for certain problems that
are important in applications. He will develop, and implement, some new
algorithms for numerically solving these variational problems. The problems to
be studied include non-self-adjoint elliptic eigenproblems and their application
to linear hydrodynamic stability theory, and nonlinear eigenvalue problems for
the Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations which arise in quantum theory. Another
class of problems centers on the variational characterization of solutions of
the Navier-Stokes equations, including the properties and consequences of these
principles. The numerical research will center on numerical methods for finding
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of both symmetric and non-symmetric matrices, also
the numerical simulation of the equilibria of rotating self-gravitating fluids,
which are simple hydrodynamical models of stars and planets.
