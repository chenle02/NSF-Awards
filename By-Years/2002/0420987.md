With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron will acquire an Electron
Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer. Research projects to benefit from the
EPR include studies on such paramagnetic materials as 1) metallo-enzyme models;
2) novel organometallic materials; 3) MRI contrast agents; 4) porphyrin
complexes; 5) biomaterials; 6) conducting polymers; 7) silyl radicals; 8) powder
coatings; 9) catalysts; and 10) dendrimers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer yields information on the molecular
and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information
about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived species that are often
essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical
reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, from
manufacturing to materials and biological chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
