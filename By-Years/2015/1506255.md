The 17th Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability, a conference
series sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS), is organized
by and held for junior researchers. The primary objective is to provide a much
needed venue for interaction among new researchers. The meeting will take place
over three days, August 6-8, 2015, at the University of Washington, in Seattle,
WA. The meeting will be held immediately preceding the Joint Statistical
Meetings (JSM) in downtown Seattle. Participants will be statisticians and
probabilists who have received their Ph.D. within the past five years or are
expecting to receive their degree within the same year. Each participant will
present a talk or poster. Topics will cover a variety of areas in statistics and
probability, from theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers will give
plenary talks for inspiration and other senior researchers will take part in
discussion panels covering topics of importance for young people embarking on an
academic/research career, such as teaching, mentoring, publishing and
funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference series is explicitly aimed at
training the future leaders and workers in statistics and probability. In
helping to create networks of new researchers, it lays the groundwork for future
collaboration and the informal exchange of ideas and knowledge. It is also
critical for professional cohesion, which is particularly important as research
fields become more and more specialized. Meeting people outside of one's
research specialty area, and learning about their research, favors a more
comprehensive view of research, which is important when taking editor positions
and other professional service activities. The conference also attracts
participants with different backgrounds and nationalities, and underrepresented
groups --- women, minorities and people with disabilities --- are explicitly
encouraged to attend.
