This award is being made by the Chemistry Division to enable the participation
of 13 younger U.S. scientists in the Bilateral NSF- SERC Joint Workshop on
Asymmetric Synthesis which will be held at the Pingree Park facility of Colorado
State University, Pingree Park, Colorado, July 3-8, 1990. They will participate
in the Workshop with 12 young scientists from Great Britain. The purposes of the
workshop are (1) to expose them to the broader community of international
scholarship, and (2) to build long-term bridges for productive international
researh collaboration and knowledge exchange. Asymmetric synthesis has become an
area of intensive research interest and significance in chemistry. The strict
demands placed on the chemical and optical purity of new marketable drugs makes
the discovery and implementation of new and efficient asymmetric chemical
constructions a primary concern in chemistry.
