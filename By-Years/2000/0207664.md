ABSTRACT: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH-- LIFE HISTORY STRATEGIES, GROWTH RATES AND
MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTEREVOLUTION ACROSS THE COELUROSAURIAN/AVIALAN TRANSITION

Gregory M. Erickson. Kristina Curry-Rogers, Mark Norell

Birds (avialan dinosaurs) are unique among living animals in showing extremely
rapid growth rates. How they attained this capacity is unknown. In our research
we will reconstruct the growth of the earliest birds and their closest
ancestors, the coelurosaurian dinosaurs. We will do this by coupling age
estimates (garnered through growth line counts) with size estimates for a
diversity of fossil species. From the results we will be able to quantitatively
assess when and how avian growth rates were generated and determine whether the
first birds were simply feathered dinosaurs or physiological equivalents to
living species. Aside from helping us to understand how the most speciose group
of animals living in our world came to came to be, broader impacts of this
research include: 1) establishing a World Wide Web site from which the lay pubic
and professions can learn about scientific research, 2) providing advanced
scientific training to undergraduate and graduate students including those from
underrepresented groups, and 3) providing material for our public and non-major
collegiate lectures in paleontology.
