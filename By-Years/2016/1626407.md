An award is made to the Chicago Botanic Garden (CBG) to acquire a ploidy
analyzer that will be utilized for conservation and horticultural research; for
practical plant conservation activities; and for secondary, post-secondary, and
graduate education and other collaborative projects. Variations in ploidy (the
number of sets of chromosomes in a cell) play an important role in both plant
and fungal evolution and diversity. Differences in plant ploidy also have
significant practical applications, from the selection of appropriate plants for
restoration projects to its impact on breeding and selection of agronomic and
horticultural crops. The traditional method of analyzing ploidy via chromosome
fixation, staining, and microscopic analysis is time consuming, inexact, and
impractical for analyzing a large volume of samples. The ploidy analyzer will
allow the rapid, inexpensive, and high-sample volume processing of plant and
fungal DNA ploidy and nuclear genome size. This will broadly enhance CBG?s
conservation and horticulture research, education programs, permanent plant
collections activities, and other collaborations. CBG staff will disseminate
their research results to professional, scientific, and public audiences through
scientific and popular publications, presentations, on-site interpretation and
displays, and through CBG?s website. The public will also benefit from enhanced
restoration practices for natural areas, from improved ornamental plants for
garden use, and from opportunities to serve as students, volunteers, and outside
partners on the projects made possible by the ploidy analyzer.

Chicago Botanic Garden conservation studies encompass the biology of small,
fragmented populations; the genetics of both rare and invasive plant species, as
well as fungal populations; plant and fungal responses to climate change and to
ecosystem management; and spatial and temporal patterns of molecular genetic
diversity in populations. The ploidy analyzer will make possible such studies as
delineation of seed transfer zones for restoration studies of species with
varied ploidy levels, and assessing seed longevity in storage of species with
varied ploidy, as the larger cell sizes of higher ploidy seed can impact the
longevity of frozen seed. The ploidy analyzer will also impact CBG?s
horticultural programs, such as affording the breeding program the ability to
match the ploidy of the parents used in crosses, assess the ploidy of plants
treated to increase their ploidy, and aid in developing sterile triploid forms
of landscape plants to avoid potential invasions. The ploidy analyzer will also
be made available to regional conservation researchers and restoration
practitioners as well as to commercial and independent plant breeders that do
not access to this equipment.
