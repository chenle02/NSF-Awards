This award supports the research of Professor Richard Wilson at The California
Institute of Technology. It is a three year continuing grant made by the Algebra
and Number Theory Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences. Professor
Wilson is one of the most innovative researchers in the area of mathematics
known as combinatorial designs. His current research involves the decompositions
of edge-colored complete graphs. Many standard combinatorial problems are easily
reduced to this problem including the triple whist tournaments of E. H. Moore,
nested triple systems and self-orthogonal Latin Squares. In this proposal he
will continue the existence theory of the decomposition of these edge-colored
graphs, generalizing his celebrated existence theory for pairwise balanced
designs. Many important results can be expected from the research in this
proposal.
