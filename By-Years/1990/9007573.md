Food intake, appetitie and body weight are controlled by the brain through an
interaction with peripheral signals. This interaction is complex and poorly
understood even though it is of obvious importance. Recently it has been
discovered that a peptide in the brain, neuropeptide Y, induces feeding when
injected into specific nuclei of the hypothalamus. The hypothesis of the
proposal is that glucose raises insulin which acts in the hypothalamus to
inhibit the peptide and when glucose levels are low, the reduced insulin
triggers increased neuropeptide Y which stimulates feeding. The test of these
hypotheses and the rate at which such changes occur can be measured most
accurately by studying the regulation of mRNA expression in situ. This will show
where and how much neuropeptide Y is formed and under what conditions.
