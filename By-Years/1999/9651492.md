This university is one of the few universities in the United States that has a
Department of Archaeology. As such, it is able to provide a concentration of
courses that would be difficult to obtain at other universities. An active
faculty represents many aspects of the field, and all of them are committed to
promoting the use of sciences in archaeology. Whereas the staff has a modern
approach, the department's lack of equipment has prevented it from providing the
most up-to-date scientific methodologies. Funds are now being used to obtain
equipment that would ameliorate this problem and permit expansion of several
courses that are critical to improving the quality of undergraduate instruction
in archaeology. The courses in question instruct students about the role of
sciences and scientific methods as applied to archaeological problems. Equipment
is being used for four courses that include both field and lecture/laboratory
components: Department Field Schools in conjunction with a course, Remote
Sensing, Geoarchaeology, and Micromorphology of Terrestrial Materials. The
department is in the process of developing a concentration in geoarchaeology. In
addition to a course in Geoarchaeology, a course in micromorphology and its
application to archaeological problems is being added. Micromorphology is a
relatively new subdiscipline in geoarchaeology. This course is unique in that it
is aimed explicitly at advancing the application of this scientific technique to
archaeological problems. Until recently, resources have not been sufficient to
teach a small class of even 10 students. To augment the instrument to student
ratio, this project will purchase binocular and petrographic microscopes, as
well as teaching aids such as a video camera and monitors to train students in
scientific observation and interpretation.
