This award provides support for participants in two meetings of the annual
Oklahoma PDE Workshop during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 academic
years:&lt;br/&gt;(1) a workshop on recent progress in partial differential
equations of fluid mechanics, with emphasis on modeling of geophysical fluids,
to be held at Oklahoma State University on October 10-11, 2009;&lt;br/&gt;(2) a
workshop on analysis of partial differential equations arising in geometric
applications, to be held at the University of Oklahoma on October 9-10,
2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each meeting features invited lectures by two leading
researchers on topics of current research interest in applied partial
differential equations. The events bring together scholars currently making
important contributions, early career mathematicians, and students working in
the field. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by
students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
