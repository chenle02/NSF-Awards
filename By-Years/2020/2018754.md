Communication networks are critical components of todayâ€™s scientific workflows.
Researchers require long-distance, ultra high-speed networks to transfer huge
data from acquisition sites (such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory, also knowns as
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in Chile) to processing sites, and to share
measurements with scientists worldwide. However, while network bandwidth is
continuously increasing, the majority of data transfers are unable to
efficiently utilize the added capacity due to inherent limitations of parameter
settings of the network transport protocols and the lack of network state
information at the end hosts. To address these challenges, Q-Factor plans to use
temporal network state data to dynamically configure current transport protocol
parameters to reach higher network utilization and, as a result, to improve
scientific workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q-Factor leverages programmable
network devices with the In-band Network Telemetry (INT) application and
delivers a software solution to process in-band measurements at the end hosts.
Using Q-Factor on Data Transfer Nodes (DTN)s, TCP/IP parameters will be
configured according to temporal network characteristics, such as round-trip
time, network utilization, and network congestion. This tuning is expected to
result in increased network utilization, shorter flow completion times, and
significantly fewer packet drops caused by network buffers overflow.
Additionally, Q-Factor is geared to save host memory by tailoring kernel
parameters and buffers to optimal sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q-Factor targets a
timely issue in communication networks: underutilization of ultra high-speed
networks for science workflows. In order to keep scientific progress
unconstrained, future science workflows need to support emerging data-intensive
science experiments (e.g., the Vera Rubin Observatory, High Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider) where data generation grows significantly, reaching exabytes of
traffic each year. Results of this project will also allow better understanding
of optimal buffer sizes of network devices for huge flows and the interaction of
various congestion control algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental
measurement data, network state information, network topology, software code,
TCP tuning guidelines, and results will be available on the Q-Factor website
https://q-factor.io, which will be maintained and indexed for at least three
years after the completion of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
