This is a collaborative project between Mei.ling Hsu of the University of
Minnesota and Chen Shupeng of the Institute of Geography, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Beijing. Professor Chen is Director of the Institute's Laboratory of
Resources and Environment Information System (LREIS). The investigators will
establish a Geographic Information System (GIS) for urban China and conduct
research on the characteristics and functions of Chinese urban places, the
process of urbanization, and the evolution of the Chinese urban system. The
project is sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The
research plan consists of the following tasks: (1) mapping contemporary urban
China to obtain an overview of all urban places; (2) analyzing the spatial
interaction between places in the Chinese the urban system; and (3) conducting
two case studies in the Beijing.Tianjin.Tangshan economic development region and
Shandong province that will focus on urban nodes and linkages, the city
characteristics of today, and the changes since 1949. In China the research work
will be conducted by the staff of the LREIS, who will design the geocoding
system and the database structures of the GIS, digitize and input the locations
of the urban places, and input the published data on town and city
socioeconomic, land, and transportation systems. During the course of the
project, Professor Chen will spend time at the University of Minnesota,
participating in the data evaluation.
