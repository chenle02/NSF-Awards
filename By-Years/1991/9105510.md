The principal investigator will study the fundamental and dynamic properties of
silicate minerals and glasses as a function of temperature and pressure,
employing various high-pressure, spectroscopic, and computational techniques.
This information will supply earth scientists with critical information needed
to understand physical and chemical behavior of materials deep within the Earth.
