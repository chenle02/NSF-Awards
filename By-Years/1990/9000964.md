Anthropologists have long recognized that the African apes, of all primates,
are most similar to humans. A significant shared derived feature of these
animals is their unique knuckle- walking locomotion. A major gap in our
knowledge of such locomotor patterns includes the morphological correlates which
would allow identification of such patterns from the fossil record. The primary
objective of this research is to evaluate the functional relationship between
kinematic patterns of knuckle-walking locomotion and the associated
morphological features of the forelimb in adult and young African apes. This
will be accomplished using two dimensional kinematic analysis, analysis of
weight distribution between fore and hindlimbs using pressure sensitive paper,
and quantitative analysis of morphological features of forelimb postcrania in
interspecific and ontogenetic comparisons. Results from this research will
document the allometric variation in movement patterns and associated knuckle-
walking morphology. Such a study is essential to account for allometric effects
in the reconstruction of locomotor behavior from skeletal material of fossil
apes and hominids.
