The structure of feasible computations will determine whether we can efficiently
solve the optimization problems posed by nature and the modern world. The
project investigates which problems have efficient solutions, and why some
problems lack computationally feasible algorithms. Of particular interest are
the structural relationships between complexity classes, and the internal
structure of complexity classes. A long-term goal is to show that the
"structural" approach to computational complexity is a broadly applicable
paradigm of research, and a companion to algorithms. Structural approaches to
many areas (including real-valued computation and zero-knowledge theory) will be
pursued, and many themes of structural complexity theory (including lowness,
positive reductions, ranking, and the isomorphism conjecture) will be re-
examined.
