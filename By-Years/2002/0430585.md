This research aims to develop tools and techniques to find and eliminate
security vulnerabilities in software. The approach is based on static analysis,
which by analyzing source code can model all possible executions of a program.
The distinguishing feature of the project is to show that very large
applications are free from classes of security vulnerabilities. Thus, the focus
is not just in finding security holes in software, but in verifying their
absence. Previous experience has shown that simple, approximate tools do not
find all or even nearly all security vulnerabilities; the higher assurance given
by verification is needed. The experimental goal is to apply these techniques to
the Linux kernel, a security-critical application with millions of lines of
code.

The main technical approach being investigated is based on user-defined type
qualifiers that refine the standard types of the programming language. Previous
work has shown that type qualifiers are a natural and useful way to explicitly
specify desired security properties that are normally only implicit in a
program. In much the same way that a correctly typed program cannot have run-
time type errors, having consistent type qualifiers throughout a program implies
that the property expressed by those qualifiers must hold in every execution.
The significance of this work is that, if successful, it will improve the
understanding of how to perform sophisticated static analysis of very large
programs. The broader impact will be in discovering and repairing new security
vulnerabilities in widely-used software infrastructure and in verifying that
some of that infrastructure is free from at least some security flaws.
