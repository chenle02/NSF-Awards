9515524 Shapero A study of nuclear physics will be carried out that will assess
the field's status and plans for the future. This study will be part of a larger
survey of physics entitled Physics in a New Era. This report will follow the
previous decade study of physics by the National Research Council of the
National Academy of Science ten years ago. The nuclear physics study will be
carried out by a committee of twelve physicists to be appointed by the NAS/NRC's
Board of Physics and Astronomy. ***
