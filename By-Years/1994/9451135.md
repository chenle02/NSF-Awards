9451135 Naim The goal of this project is to educate geography students about how
electronic information technology can be used to investigate physical and human
processes through analysis of spatial patterns. To do this we will established
an environmental remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS)
Laboratory with cost-effective workstations. Students use this equipment to
investigate local phenomena, such as air and water pollution, preservation of
natural resources, and the impact of urban and industrial development on local
rural areas. These applications give the students practical experience in data
collection, analysis, and dissemination, and enhances their ability to work with
real time data. The project has also strengthened the geography curriculum by
providing three new courses in remote sensing, computer cartography, and GIS.
