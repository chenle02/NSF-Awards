This experimental activity focuses on configuring, maintaining, and adaptive
power management of remote sensors and their embedded software used in
environmental observing systems. The approach is based on a well known and
popular cluster configuration system out of UCSD called Rocks. Sensor platforms
and sensor networks require scalable and reliable solutions to manage their
software configurations. This activity sets out to prove or disprove that a
solution proven to work for heterogeneous cluster and data center configuration
and management (ROCKS)can be applied to distributed sensors. Attached to this
work is a set of integrated research and development activities on improved
power management for sensor platforms and their operational workloads. Broader
impact derives from the initial targeted communities in limnology and marine
science with associated real world scenarios, and extends to other environmental
observing systems as well as disaster response. Educational content from the
work will be developed and inserted into a graduate level course at UCSD on
embedded computing. Intellectual merit is found in the new approach to sensor
reproducibility and adaptive power management algorithms.
