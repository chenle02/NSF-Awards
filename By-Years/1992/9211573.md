This project studies the incorporation of a diverse rural population into the
banana industry of Belize. An anthropologist from the University of South
Alabama will conduct an ethnographic study of ethnic diversity in the
recruitment and deployment of workers from Black and Indian ethnic origins. The
project will examine the differences between ethnicity and class as causes of
labor force participation by interviewing workers, growers, and processors in
depth, on their values and opinions about the appropriate work for members of
different ethnic groups. This research is important because ethnic hostilities
are a common cause of labor force troubles. This case study of a local industry
in a multi-ethnic area will provide valuable information on the nature of ethnic
hostility, and how it relates to socio- economic class differences. This
information will be valuable to those concerned with minimizing ethnic
antagonisms in labor forces in similar situations.
