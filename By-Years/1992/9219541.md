9219541 Meyer Portable arrays of digital seismometers recording passive sources
(earthquakes) or active sources (explosions) are capable of imaging buried
structure in the crust and mantle. This award will support the development of a
new type of portable digital seismograph for field deployment in seismic array
experiments of long duration in remote areas where maintenance is difficult and
expensive. Some of the desired design features to be incorporated include low
power consumption, waterproof, temperature insensitivity, improved timing, and
capable of burial against the threat of vandalism. ***
