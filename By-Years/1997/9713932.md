9713932 Jawahir The awarded research is aimed at developing a comprehensive
predictive model for turning operations. Quantitative experiments will be
conducted to classify various groups of chip flow, curl mechanisms, and breaking
mechanisms for the development of appropriate relationships for generic turning
modeling. Relationships for chip-side and back-flow mechanisms will be developed
using fracture mechanics for 3-D chip breaking, as well as techniques for
quantifying the effects of tool-chip tribological interactions. The results will
be used to develop a predictive model which has a wide range of variability to
represent a large spectrum of conditions. Besides being useful to the
development of applied machinability for machining systems, this model will
enable the design of innovative chip-groove geometries for cutters used in
turning operations. This award could lead to a fundamental understanding of the
complex tool-chip interactions in turning with grooved tools and the development
of an accurate model for predicting 3-D chip flow, curl and breaking processes
as well as the corresponding stresses, strains and temperatures. The study is
also practically important, especially for total chip control in uninterrupted
automated machining.
