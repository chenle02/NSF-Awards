0404590&lt;br/&gt;Dubcovsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.- Argentina award will
provide support for Dr. Jorge Dubcovsky, University of California, Davis, to
collaborate with Dr. Viviana Echnique at the Universidad Nacional del Sur in
Bahia Blanca, Argentina. Their project involves the molecular genetic analysis
of lipoxygenase activity in pasta wheat. This activity contributes to the bright
yellow color in pasta and pasta products. The pigment is an antioxidant, which
increases the nutritional value of these products. The goal of this project is
to provide a better understanding of the interaction between Lox activity and
pasta color in durum wheat and to develop new molecular tools for the
manipulation of this trait in breeding programs. An added benefit of this
project is that a U.S. student will travel to Argentina to learn Lox activity
tests while participating in an international research activity. &lt;br/&gt;
