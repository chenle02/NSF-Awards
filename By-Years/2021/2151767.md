The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an intelligent and
evolving tool that provides a framework to teach financial literacy skills to
children. The literacy lessons are implemented at the childâ€™s pace and stage of
development. The product seeks to provide a family finance and entrepreneurism
platform that combines real money, peer performance feedback, and artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven education to teach youth how to responsibly use money
and build businesses. By utilizing AI, the project will curate educational
content into an immersive digital learning experience that is tailored to the
individual regardless of wealth, demographics, or geographic location. Through
this innovation, youth may be better positioned for success as they transition
to financial independence. This project may also allow academia and industry to
work together to validate an individual's financial preparedness and
independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project focusses on designing the principles and mechanics of a
user performance feedback mechanism that promotes financial wellness. Financial
literacy is important at every stage of life. The Phase I of this project is to
develop a performance mechanism and uses deep AI techniques to baseline the
goals for data collection and logical data organization, as well as to determine
performance measurements and individual learner groupings. These metrics include
static data, dynamic data, logical organization of data, calculation methods,
and scoring principles. Once optimized, the outcome of the project may encourage
individuals to achieve financial stability and
success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
