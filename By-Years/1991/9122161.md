The goal of this project is to advance the basic chemistry of extended
porphyrins. A range of new pyrrole-, furan- and thiophene-containing macrocycles
will be synthesized and studied. The compounds will be used to gain insight as
to which structural features (core size, denticity, macrocycle shape, etc.) most
clearly influence intrinsic binding properties. %%% With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program supports the research of Professor Jonathan L. Sessler
of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin. Dr. Sessler
will focus his work on the synthesis of a class of compounds known as expanded
porphyrins. These compounds have interesting potential in the area of host-guest
chemistry in that they contain cavities which can be tailored for the
recognition of and specific binding of cations or anions. One possible practical
use of the compounds would be in the recovery of heavy metals from wastewater.
