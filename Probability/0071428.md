Proposal: DMS-0071428 PI: Kenneth Brown Institution: Cornell

Abstract: This proposal covers a wide range of topics relating topology,
algebra, combinatorics, and probability. Specifically, the principal
investigator proposes to study: The poset of cosets of a finite group; Markov
chains associated with hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, and buildings,
including a chain that is related to the Moran model in population genetics; the
topology at infinity of Artin groups; the spectral radius of random walks on
certain infinite groups; and the graph of generating sets of a finite group.

This work reveals unexpected connections between different fields of
mathematics, thereby illuminating both fields. For example: (a) a random walk on
an abstract combinatorial object sheds light on a model in population genetics;
(b) geometry and algebra have led to new results about Markov chains, which are
used for simulations in many areas of science and applied mathematics; and (c) a
probabilistic question about groups, which are algebraic objects used in the
study of symmetry, leads to a new topological tool for investigating these
groups.
