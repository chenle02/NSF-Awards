Physical maps of whole chromosomes have placed an essential role in a number of
fundamental breakthroughs in genetics. The completion of high resolution
physical maps of three model genetic systems, Aspergillus nidulans, Neurospora
crassa, and Magnaporthe grisea, and of other fungi such as Nectria haematococca,
is likely to open up new avenues of research on the molecular and evolutionary
genetics of fungi. By building a 29 kilobase (kb) resolution physical map of the
A. nidulans genome, we have made the striking observation that there is an
alternating banding pattern in the distribution of repeated sequences along the
chromosomes of A. nidulans. This observation has implications for development,
functional organization of genomes, chromosome structure and function,
recombination, and genome evolution. In this proposal we plan to specify and
acquire a robotics system for physical mapping which will enable several
laboratories to ascertain whether or not other filamentous fungi, such as N.
crassa and M. grisea, share this banding pattern in repeated sequences along
their chromosomes. This robotics system will be maintained by the Fungal Genome
Resource (FGR) at the University of Georgia and will serve the fungal genetics
community as a whole by providing an array of new experimental strategies to
address a broad class of problems in fungal ,genetics.
