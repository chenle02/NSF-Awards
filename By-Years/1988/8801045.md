A program of research on the basic physics of atoms, ions, and simple
molecules, and of their interaction with electromagnetic radiation, will be
continued. The two main directions of research are: 1. The exploration and
development of new methods of using lasers and other coherent light techniques
in atomic spectroscopy. 2. The study of the simplest atoms at such a level of
precision that stringent tests of the calculations based on fundamental atomic
theory can be made.
