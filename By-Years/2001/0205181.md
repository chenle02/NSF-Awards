EIA-0205181 J. Tinsley Oden University of Texas, Austin ITR/AP: A COMPILATION
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RELIABLE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research of this project will develop mathematical and computational processes
for validation analogous to those used for verification and evaluate these
processes by actual and computational experiments. At the core of the proposed
integrated framework for verification and validation lies the concept of
hierarchical modeling. Hierarchical modeling is a systematic coarsening of
mathematical models from a base model which is known a priori to contain all of
the information, which can be extracted from a given experiment to within
quantifiable bounds. The goal is to determine, by introducing approximations
into the base model, the computationally simplest model which contains the
information content of the experiment. This process requires an ability to
evaluate the error introduced by each approximation to the base model, a
capability for capturing the semantic content of both models and experiments, a
capability for comparing the information content of the experiments and
simulations and a capability for implementing a family of computational systems
implementing the sequence of models so that the conceptual process can be
realized and evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
