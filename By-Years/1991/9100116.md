A significant component of this investigation is the study combined-mode,
radiation and conduction, heat-transfer problems in plane- parallel media and in
spheres and cylinders. An especially concise form for the required particular
solution will be used, along with the classical spherical-harmonics method of
solving the radiation equation can be carried out without gross approximations
in the solution of either equation. A portion of this study will be focused on
seeking better understanding of the heat-transfer mechanisms that can give rise
to a loss of convergence in standard iterative solutions. A second component of
this research project, the spherical-harmonics method is to be used to develop
solutions to a class of multi-group or non-grey radiation-transport problems.
The multi-group model to be considered allows a general anisotropic scattering
law and transfer from any group to any group. Computational aspects of the
developed solutions are to be investigated, and numerical results for numerous
test cases are to be developed. Once the solution technique for the non-grey has
been established and tested numerically for the plane-parallel case, some
extensions will then be made to problems with spherical and cylindrical
symmetry.
