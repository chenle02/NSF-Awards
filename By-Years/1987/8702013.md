Calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca2+dependent regulatory protein which activates a variety
of enzymes and evidently serves an important role in cellular metabolic
regulation. A mechanistic model has been developed to explain how CaM activates
enzymes and this model predicts the behavior of several enzymes reasonably well.
However one enzyme, NAD kinase from peas, differs significantly from other CaM-
activated enzymes in several important ways and does not appear to fit the
model. The proposed experiments will determine the cause of this unique behavior
by probing the thermodynamics of activation, the site of interaction with CaM,
and the domain structure of NAD kinase. The results of these studies will lead
to a better understanding of the unique behavior of NAD kinase, which should, in
turns, contribute to our knowledge of how CaM performs it roles in cellular
metabolism.
