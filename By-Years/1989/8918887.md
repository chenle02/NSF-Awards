Research will be conducted on the unusual magnetic behavior exhibited by three
series of correlated f-electron systems: the cerium monochalcogenides CeX (X =
S, Se, Te); the uranium monopnictides UX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi); and, the
uranium monochalcogenides. A synthesis of first-principles electronic structure
calculations and a phenomenological model of orbitally- driven magnetic ordering
will be employed to investigate the effect of hybridization of moderately
delocalized f-electrons with band electrons on the diverse magnetic behavior of
this class of systems.
