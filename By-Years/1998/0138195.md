This research is focused on an understanding of the magnetic structure and
exchange interactions present in hybrid magnetic semiconductor materials.
Semiconductor superlattices consisting of conventional II-VI materials in which
alternate layers are antiferromagnetic and non-magnetic exhibit interlayer spin
correlations of a surprisingly long range comparable to that in metallic
systems. Neutron scattering is used as a probe of the magnetic structure, order
parameter, and correlation range in these systems as a function of semiconductor
doping. The results indicate that a magnetic interaction other than conventional
superexchange is dominant. One of the present research objectives is to
investigate in detail this exchange coupling and its dependence on electronic
structure, strain effects, and types of doping. In addition to the II-VI
materials, the research will focus on a detailed investigation of new
ferromagnetic III-V systems, including the unusual dependence of the
ferromagnetic transition temperature on composition and on the effect of thermal
annealing. Neutrons will also provide direct information on the formation of
ferromagnetic clusters or other nanoscale inhomogeneities that may affect the
onset of infinite-range ferromagnetism. Finally, neutron reflectivity will be
used to investigate the spatial dependence of the order parameter, and to
investigate proximity effects between a hybrid III-V ferromagnetic semiconductor
and an adjacent II-VI antiferromagnetic layer.

Semiconductor and magnetic materials both play essential, but distinct, roles in
many common electronic devices. Examples are computer memories made of
semiconductors and hard disk drives utilizing magnetic materials. Recently the
potential has arisen for a marriage of semiconducting and magnetic properties in
a single material utilizing the concept of "spintronics." This research program
is designed to use the powerful technique of neutron scattering to probe the
magnetic state of materials that are both semiconducting and magnetic. The
neutrons can be scattered by interacting with nuclei inside these systems, and
in addition, since neutrons possess a magnetic moment, they can interact with
magnetic fields inside materials. The result of such scattering provides direct
information about the magnetic structure inside a material and over what
distances the individual magnetic moments are coupled together. This type of
information on the magnetism can be correlated with changes in the
semiconducting properties of the materials as the system is "doped" with various
chemical elements. The result provides necessary information to simultaneously
optimize both the magnetic and the semiconducting aspects of these new compounds
for future hybrid spintronic devices.
