The project challenges high aptitude freshmen and sophomores through the use of
computers to stimulate their creativity. The students are undertaking alternate
laboratory explorations aided by interactive videodiscs and computer interfaced
instruments. Among the activities they are engaged in is design their own
experiments on suggested topics, constructing appropriate interfaces to a
variety of instruments ranging from Spectronic 20 manual spectrometers and pH
meters to gas chromatographs and atomic absorption spectrophotometers and the
use of spreadsheets for data analysis.
