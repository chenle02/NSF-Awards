The 1989 University of Washington Summer Institute will be a workshop on weak
interactions and symmetry breaking in nuclear physics. The relative merits of
experimental tests of parity nonconservation, time reversal violation, isospin
symmetry, lepton and family number conservation will be studied and their
relation to models of the electroweak and strong interactions elucidated.
