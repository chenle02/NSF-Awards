Title: Transmetalation Reactions Research Collaboration in U.S. and Egypt
ABSTRACT NARRATIVE: Description: This proposal is a request for a second award
as a follow-on to a two-year research effort funded by NSF award INT-8512210.
The research team from Northeastern University headed by Dr. Geoffrey intends to
continue the collaboration with the University of Alexandria, Egypt team lead by
Drs. Mohamed A. El-Sayed and Ahmed El-Touky. This collaborative effort has
broadened the chemistry discovery relating to the metal exchange in polynuclear
materials. The proposed new work will build on the past effort in six important
areas including the building of larger and more diverse multi-metal molecules at
lower cost; the use of these molecules as sources of new metal alloys and
chemical catalysts to be used in still newer systems. Development of the
transmetalation phenomenon will lead to the establishment of new areas of study
in organic and organometallic chemistry. The purpose of the Science in
Developing Countries Program is to advance the exchange of international
scientific knowledge and to contribute to the scientific infrastructure of
developing countries. This proposal meets those criteria. Scope: These
international collaborators are in the process of developing new approaches to
handling metals that can very possibly lead to new and unexpected products of
unique and useful characteristics for use in both the laboratory and in the
public sector. An additional pay-off of this research is the provision of a
wealth of learning opportunities for students pursuing degrees in organic
chemistry. A final value of this research is the advance of the scientific and
technical knowledge of the research teams and their impact within their separate
universities. The collaborative work of these scientists from Northeastern and
Alexandria universities has resulted already in significant scientific advances
and a number of joint publications in major refereed journals.
