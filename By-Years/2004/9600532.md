9600532 Brusslan Undifferentiated cells of the plant meristem contain
proplastids. When leaf development is initiated, proplastids develop into
chloroplasts, the site of photosynthesis and carbon fixation. Although numerous
mutations that alter the chloroplast have been isolated from a large number of
plant species, none so far have led to a clear understanding of the molecular
events involved in chloroplast development. Arabidopsis thaliana offers an
opportunity to understand this process because genes identified by mutation can
be cloned. Virescent mutants that display a delay in greening and hence a delay
in chloroplast development, have been isolated in the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana. The goal of this research is to characterize these mutants
biochemically and genetically in order to determine which mutants are likely to
be defective in the signal transduction pathways that regulate chlorplast
development. A second goal is to analyze the pigments and proteins of the light
harvesting complexes (LHCs) of all mutants, regulatory or non-regulatory. The
assembly of the LHCs has not been regorously investigated on a genetic level in
higher plants. Chloroplasts are essential for life on earth because
photosynthesis produces oxygen and consumes carbon dioxide. A clear
understanding of the development of the organelle that performs this important
function is important for agriculatural and global warming research.
