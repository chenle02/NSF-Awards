Dr. Quatrano 96-04672 Zygotes of the brown alga Fucus provide a model system to
study the basic mechanisms involved in the generation of zygotic/cell asymmetry
and the partitioning of localized cytoplasmic components to the resulting
daughter cells. Large, single-celled zygotes synchronously develop a polar axis
in culture that can be experimentally oriented by imposed gradients such as
unilateral light. Such cells present an ideal system to study how a polar axis
is established and how a cell directionally transports cytoplasmic material to a
site defined by an extracellular vector. Dr. Quatrano now knows that secretion
of these targeted vesicles into the extracellular matrix (ECM) is required to
stabilize the molecular asymmetry established by the external vector, and
believes that this also have evidence that secreted material into the ECM may
signal information to the cytoplasm to initiate polar growth and to orient the
plane of cell division. The role of targeted secretion, resulting in an
asymmetry of the macromolecules present in the zygotic ECM of Fucus, now
provides an exciting paradigm to apply to other polar cells for the study of
extracellular positional information during development. Using the Fucus system
he will pursue answers to the following questions: What are the cellular cues
and sequences in MRNA that are responsible for the localization of specific
transcripts in the developing Fucus embryo? What are the roles of small GTP-
binding proteins and septins in the development of cell polarity and the
orientation of cell division in the Fucus zygote? What are the similarities
between the molecules and processes that establish polarity in Fucus and those
operative in higher plants, yeast, insects, and vertebrates?
