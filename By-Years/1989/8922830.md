Interdisciplinary research program on the effects of charged ionic interfaces
between a solid and an aqueous electrolyte. Specific systems of interest are
metal/electrolyte interfaces in electrolytic cells, and brine-saturated porous
media with large surface/volume ratio. Electrolytic deposition will be used to
study pattern formation and non-linear phenomena at high current density. The ac
properties of rough and fractal electrodes due to diffusive relaxation of
interfacial charge will be investigated. Thermodynamic and ac impedance
experiments will give information on interfacial charge transport in porous
media. Coupling between the charged layer and fluid flow in such media will also
be studied.
