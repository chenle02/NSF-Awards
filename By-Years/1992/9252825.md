This is a one year MRIA planning grant award. The project consists of
investigating the feasibility of research on intelligent interfaces based on a
user behavior model which emphasizes individual user differences. Previous user
models have been based on the similarities of the ideal, well-trained user. A
secondary objective of the plan to be investigated is the use of the main
results in the area of querying databases, particularly in aiding the user in
the formation of queries. Finally, the project involves planning on the best
approach for an evaluation of the system through testing with actual users of
the system. This investigation contributes to the understanding of user models
and their utility and, in general, to the theory and practice of interface
design. The preliminary study investigates the most appropriate architecture for
the adaptive user model, the design of the intelligent interface, and the
evaluation study.
