Professor Galicki will continue his research in hyperkahler and quaternionic
geometry related to problems in mathematical physics. He will construct new
Kahler metrics which are invariant under a quaternionic action on the space and
which satisfy prescribed curvature conditions. In addition, Professor Galicki
will study certain first order differential systems analogous to the vortex
equation and monopole equations. The principal investigator's work is cross
disciplinary. The research in the differential geometry of quaternionic
manifolds often uses results and methods of mathematical physics. At the same
time, the powerful methods of differential geometry frequently bring about a
better understanding of important problems in the search for a unified field
theory.
