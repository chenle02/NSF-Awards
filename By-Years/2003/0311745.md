Mathematical Sciences (21) The Department of Mathematics at Pacific Lutheran
University is introducing the use of Maple and WeBWorK into its first two
calculus courses to increase student engagement and lay stronger conceptual
foundations for subsequent courses. Contributions from the PowerTools page on
the Waterloo Maple website are being adapted for use by students to explore, to
visualize, and to generate conjectures. The WeBWorK program, developed at the
University of Rochester (see DUE-9950567 and 0126940), is also being used to
provide online feedback to students on homework exercises. A key feature of this
project is the systematic approach used by the entire department to establish
shared learning goals for students and to employ technology in pursuit of these
goals. Training workshops are featured not only for mathematics faculty, but
also faculty in allied disciplines.
