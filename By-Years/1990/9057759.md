The principal investigator is studying the coherent interaction of light with
matter, on extremely short timescales (subpicosecond). Of particular interest is
the way in which the relaxation dynamics of simple electronic systems is
modified by strong optical fields, on time scales shorter than or comparable to
the timescales on which the exchange of energy between the electronic system and
a dissipative reservoir occurs in many solid state systems.
