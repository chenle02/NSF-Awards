The National Center for Engineering and Technology Education (NCETE) links
technology educators with engineering educators in a symbiotic alliance to build
capacity for research; nurture a cadre of talented, diverse leaders in
engineering and technology education; and infuse engineering content, design and
analytical skills into K-12 schools. The Center includes partners with strengths
in engineering and in technology education, including four land-grant university
research partners (Utah State University, the University of Minnesota, the
University of Illinois and the University of Georgia), five technology teacher
education partners (Brigham Young University, California State University at Los
Angeles, University of Wisconsin - Stout, Illinois State University and North
Carolina A&amp;T State University) and fifteen K-12 school district partners.
NCETE vertical linkages spanning the educational levels from K-Ph.D. in regional
teams are located in the West, the Upper Midwest, the Central Midwest and the
Southeast. Regional teams facilitate collaborative research, professional
development, capacity building and dissemination of research findings and model
practices. NCETE also facilitates horizontal collaboration among Ph.D. programs,
teacher education programs and K-12 partners to build capacity and to share
effective strategies and practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCETE is building a
community of informed and able researchers and leaders to improve the national
capability to conduct research in emerging engineering and technology education
areas. In addition, center research partners are creating a body of research
that improves our understanding of the learning and teaching engineering and
technology subjects, and evaluates the benefits and shortcomings of engineering
content for student learning in diverse K-12 settings. These findings are
intended to inform decisions about curriculum and assessment, influence the
development of engineering and technology education and provide data about
curriculum implementation in schools. Technology teacher education partners are
preparing technology education teachers at the baccalaureate and master's levels
and conducting professional development for practicing K-12 teachers to prepare
them to infuse engineering content into the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;
