The project will provide students instruction in the use of graphics capable
microcomputers in a specific geologic course and how to conduct a structural,
stratigraphic, and economic analysis of a specific geologic region. Eight
graphics capable microcomputer systems, two dot matrix printers, one laser
printer, and one plotter will be purchased and housed in a geology computer
laboratory. The projects will be conducted in the laboratory section of the
junior-senior level structural geology course. Emphasis will be in three areas:
problem identification; data analyses; and, geologic interpretation. First, the
students will generate data files from such field data as air photos, geologic
maps, oil well logs and "on-site" field data. Second, the files will be analyzed
with software programs such as structural contouring, isopach mapping, 2- and
3-D models, log analyses, reservoir analyses, stereonets, rose diagrams, and
various histograms. Last, the data will be interpreted, nd reports will be
required. Each student will be expected to present their results in a formal
seminar before their peers, and each will be encouraged to submit the results
for publication. The University will match the award with an equal amount.
