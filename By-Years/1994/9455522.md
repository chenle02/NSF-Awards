9455522 Feinstein A cognitive based approach is used to develop comprehensive
materials for the first courses in Computer Science based on Implementation D of
Computing Curricula 1991. The distinguishing features are: (1) materials based
on a strategic sequencing and the associated level of mastery of key topics, (2)
a topical coverage carefully based on a spiral approach to information
presentation, (3) an integral use of structured labs as a necessary component,
(4) an emphasis on frequent feedback to facilitate learning and evaluate the
effectiveness of instruction, (5) remediation materials for students requiring
additional assistance to meet the required levels of mastery ,(6) an early use
of teams, (7) a student surveying tool used to track all students to provide
outcome assessment, and (8) review and evaluation by multiple institutions for
iterative material refinement and national dissemination. The project will be
carefully evaluated by a team of eight consultants with expertise in the fields
of computing, computing education and educational psychology. The materials
developed will also be critiqued by professionals at a wide variety of other
institutions for their input as to the applicability of the materials to
students at their institutions. The resulting materials will be made available
in hard copy and through electronic media.
