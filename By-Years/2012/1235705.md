This grant is providing logistical support for the 2012 Tri-Agency Climate
Change Education Principal Investigators Meeting, held April 17-20,2012 at the
Sheraton National Hotel. The meeting is attended by representatives of more than
120 separate projects funded by NSF, NASA, and NOAA climate education-related
programs. Grant funds are being used to develop the meeting registration web
site and rent audio-visual equipment and other materials as required by the
meeting agenda. The conference has a strong focus on integration of research in
the climate sciences and the learning sciences, in order to strengthen
educational practices in formal and informal learning environments, as well as
improve the acquisition of knowledge about the complex, interdisciplinary topic
of climate by learners of all ages. A major goal of this jointly sponsored
conference is to improve coordination, cohesion, and synergy among the grantees,
in order to foster greater efficiency and impact. Development of a common
framework for program evaluation related to climate change education, which
directly addresses priorities articulated in the 2012 NSTC Co-STEM report
"Coordinating Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
Education Investments: Progress Report", is another goal of the conference.
