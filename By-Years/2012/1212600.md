Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (University of Georgia) proposes to support
technical services on R/V Savannah, a 92? general purpose UNOLS research vessel
operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. They will provide a technician on most cruises to maintain and
assist scientists in the use of shared-use instrumentation at sea. The technical
services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items
from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget in this
proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing
grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support
for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support
of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers. All users (or the appropriate
funding agencies) share support for basic technical services on the vessel
equally, with NSF paying a share of technical support costs based on fractional
usage of the vessel during the year.
