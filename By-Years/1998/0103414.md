Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to NSE,
NSF-0019. A Forster transfer microscope (FTM) will be developed to allow in vivo
imaging of living cells with 5 nm resolution. The unprecedented resolution will
be achieved through non-radiative Forster energy transfer between a scanning
probe containing a silicon nanoparticle and a sample tagged with dye molecules.
The FTM will exploit two recent developments in nanotechnology: (i) the
discovery, at the University of Illinois, of a technique for fabricating 1 nm
silicon nanoparticles with excellent size uniformity and fluorescence
efficiency, and (ii) the development of a combined atomic force microscope /
near-field scanning optical microscope (AF-NSOM) with 50 nm optical resolution
and 1 nm height resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FTM will be used to solve a
long-standing question about how hormones and drugs interact with epithelial
membranes: "Is ion transport modulated by movement of ion channels to and from
the apical membrane (vesical trafficking), or by changes in their activation
state?" As cultured epithelial membranes become a more widely used biomaterial,
e.g. skin for burn victims, an understanding of cell dynamics on the 100 nm
scale and below will be invaluable.&lt;br/&gt;
