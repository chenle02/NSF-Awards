(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;Current stream engines are mostly stand-alone
systems, whereas in many applications, stream processing will be one component
of a larger information system. Coupling with other components, such as user
interfaces, transactional data and archives will be increasingly important. For
stream queries to be robust over extended execution periods, they must have the
means to adapt to both internal and external changes. Changes in input rates,
time lags and data distributions can cause shifts in internal memory and
processing loads. Operators must adapt to these changes both local and in
concert with other operators. Variations in client demands create opportunities
for improved resource use to which operators must adapt. For a stream processing
system to be robust in the face of changing workloads and possible system
faults, the architecture must have levels of flexibility and adaptivity not
currently existing. The team proposes three approaches to developing the
necessary flexibility. They will use a formal analysis that will provide precise
notions of time and progress, in order to provide criteria and metrics for a
variety of situations. In addition, they will elaborate operator and
architecture design activities that will then be implemented and evaluated in
two different data stream systems. In addition to faculty at Portland State
University and graduate students there, the team has an ongoing collaboration
with AT&amp;T Research, who will provide access for testing the new system. The
techniques developed on this project will broaden the number of applications
that can be reasonably served with data stream systems, and by working with
commercial systems, the adoption of those techniques into next-generation
products will be accelerated. In addition to a new course in steam systems, the
team works with high school interns each summer, who are recruited through the
Saturday Academy program at Portland State.
