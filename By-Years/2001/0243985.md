0243985 Sanger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Cleveland State University. NSF will
support six students per year for research opportunities in glass and
electrorheological sciences. The program will be implemented at the Industrial
Technology Institute (ITI) at the university to (1) give undergraduate students
opportunities to innovate on real technology-development projects; (2) attract
and retain highly-motivated undergraduate students into engineering careers
while emphasizing the participation of populations underrepresented in research
fields in the United States; (3) offer students an early opportunity to
experience applied engineering research and development in high-performance
glass forming technology and electrorheological fluids; and (4) balance the
academic classroom learning experience with hands-on experience. The program is
designed as a yearlong activity where students work 20 hours per week during the
school year and 40 hours per week during the summer.&lt;br/&gt;
