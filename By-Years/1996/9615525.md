This study concerns the formation processes of Weddell Sea Bottom Water, a very
cold and saline water mass found at the continental shelf edge of the
southernmost Weddell Sea. The formation process is believed to involve saline
but warm Circumpolar Deep Water, and extremely cold but relatively fresh Ice
Shelf Water, however little is known about the process itself. Weddell Sea
Bottom Water is important since it is a precursor to Antarctic Bottom Water, a
dense, globally distributed water mass. The outflow of Ice Shelf Water from
beneath the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf has been the subject of a continuing
international field program. In February and March of 1998, a British Antarctic
Survey (BAS) cruise on board H.M.S. Endurance will focus on the oceanic and
atmospheric exchange processes within the open water at the face of the ice
shelf. This study is an integral part of the scientific program of the cruise
and will concern the mechanisms responsible for the mixing of Ice Shelf Water
with other regional water masses as it emerges from under the ice shelf. The
measurements that will form the basis for the analysis include vertical profiles
of temperature, conductivity, and velocity microstructure; acoustic Doppler
current profiles, and rapidly-sampling temperature sensors mounted on BAS
current meter moorings. Data sets collected by other participants in the cruise
will include atmospheric measurements, a regional survey of the hydrographic
structure of the upper ocean, and satellite-based remote sensing products.
