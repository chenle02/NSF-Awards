9304110 Helmberger This research is to compute motions from large earthquakes at
sites underlain by three-dimensional earth features, especially where a deep
soft-material basin underlies buildings and other structures. Results from
recent studies of the 1985 Mexico Cit earthquake, the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake and the 1992 Landers earthquake in southern California will be used
to compute the response of the Los Angeles basin to great earthquakes. The work
is motivated by the fact that these earthquakes produced surprisingly large
motions at considerable distances, especially at soft-rock sites. These motions
were significantly larger than those predicted by standard engineering practice.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
