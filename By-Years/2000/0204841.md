Roald Hoffmann of Cornell University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to carry out research that aims to (1) explain
the electronic structure of molecules, discrete or extended, that present
puzzles in bonding, (2) develop a qualitative understanding of the chemical
bonding in important classes of molecules, with a focus on relationships between
molecular and extended systems, stressing the construction of conceptual bridges
between organic and inorganic structures, (3) look broadly and qualitatively at
problems of reactivity on surfaces and at interfaces, (4) predict as yet
unsynthesized systems with unusual properties, and (5) devise further analytical
tools for applied quantum chemistry. The methodology to be employed will be
quantum mechanical calculations of both qualitative (extended Huckel method) and
quantitative (density functional theory) reliability, as well as the apparatus
of perturbation theory for constructing interpretations. Outcomes are expected
to provide a wide range of chemists, physicists, and materials scientists with
the tools to analyze and understand qualitatively bonding, structure, and
reactivity over a wide range of discrete molecules and extended structures.

Although the computational apparatus of quantum chemistry is at a stage where it
is possible to attain predictive chemical accuracy for medium-sized molecules,
there remains a strong need in the chemical community for explanations and
increased understanding. These explanations represent a portable, qualitative
accounting of the factors responsible for the structure, energetics, and
reactivity of molecules, and are the goals of this research. Such accounting can
be couched using chemical ideas that are qualitatively useful to the broad
scientific community, such as electronegativity, orbitals, electrostatics, and
steric effects.
