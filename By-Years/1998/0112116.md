0112116&lt;br/&gt;Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports an upgrade to
the seismological computing capability and enhancements to our ability to
process and interpret environmental geophysical data at the University of Texas
at El Paso. The equipment will be used primarily to interrogate huge volumes of
seismic data from refraction and reflection data sets and to run seismic
tomography and waveform modeling codes including full waveform finite difference
simulations. To accommodate these needs we will use grant funds to purchase a
multi-CPU Unix server with enough computing capacity for these tasks, as well as
two PCs that will be dedicated to environmental geophysics projects. The new
computers will replace outdated equipment. These computing facilities will
support the research of PI, Kate Miller, and Co-Pis, G. Randy Keller, Diane
Doser, Steve Harder, and ca. 20 graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;***
