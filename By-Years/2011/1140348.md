This project is creating a set of virtual reality experiments that will expose
K-12 and college students, as well as the public, to laboratory equipment used
in the study of materials. Some laboratory equipment can be quite expensive or
cumbersome and certain experiments are time-consuming. This virtual reality
approach is making technical equipment accessible at little or no cost to many
more people around the world to learn about engineering and materials science,
including visitors to museums and students at schools which do not own this
equipment. The modules are 3-D and fully interactive to help attract more
students to engineering careers. Researchers are studying how students learn
from using these virtual reality modules, which will help others develop better
virtual reality educational tools for other subjects in the future.
Collaboration with a university in Brazil, funded through NSF's Office of
International Science and Engineering, is allowing the modules to be translated
and developed based on topics that will help broaden participation in science
and engineering.
