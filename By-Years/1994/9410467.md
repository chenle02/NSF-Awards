9410467 Topoleski This Research Initiation Award investigates the fundamental
mechanisms of wear in CoCr alloys, a critical step toward improving artificial
joint materials and the quality of life for joint recipients, and reducing the
cost of arthritis care. Wear is expected to become the major cause of artificial
joint failure, requiring costly revision surgery and inducing irreparable bone
damage. In order to synthesize new materials, or modify existing materials to
resist wear, the fundamental wear mechanisms must be understood. Polyethylene
wear is integrally linked to the condition of the articulating metal component,
yet research of metal component wear has been practically neglected. Failure
analysis of in vivo CoCr wear is an essential element of this research. Surface
roughness measurements will provide quantification of wear. Scanning electron
microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, an x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
will be used to investigate the wear surface. In vitro wear testing to
investigate the mechanisms of wear, and the effect of wear surfaces on the
integrity of artificial joints will be based on the failure analyses. ***
