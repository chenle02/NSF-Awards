This four-year program prepares 128 high school chemistry teachers with the
content knowledge, instructional and leadership skills and confidence to serve
as peer mentors/collegial coaches, workshop presenters and agents of change in
their schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These lead teachers will be provided with
in-depth chemical knowledge, as well as skills to implement standards-based
instruction and assessment. The skills and knowledge to serve as mentor,
coaches, presenters and change agents for novice teachers will also be
enhanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is composed of a 3-week summer
institute each of 2 summers with extensive academic year follow up through
electronic networking, on-line mentoring, workshops, newsletters and classroom
visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
