Hill/Sherry 9300310 This project will examine the use of information technology
in Native American efforts toward development and increased cultural autonomy.
Research will take place primarily on the Navajo Indian Reservation, with
multiple levels of analysis being pursued. These levels include: 1)
identification of the uses to which computers and related artifacts are applied;
2) microanalysis of instances of computer use, focusing on the relationship
between Navajo conversational patterns and the interactive demands imposed by
computer software; and 3) attention to the economic and political environments
into which technology is introduced. Methods will include ethnographic
observation and interview techniques, as well as the use of video and audio
recordings (and transcription) to capture and identify patterns of behavior and
problems of interaction at the micro analytic level. Results will be of interest
to studies of Native American relations with the dominant culture; culture,
science and technology programs; discourse centered approaches to culture
change; and studies in human-computer interaction and inter ethnic
communication. *** v &amp; &lt; t 2 T &amp; | PR&amp;+D &amp; T y ZX&amp;+E
