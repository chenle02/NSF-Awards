CBET- 0829027&lt;br/&gt;Doty, Sharon L.&lt;br/&gt;University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research considers phytoremediation
of TCE using fast-growing cottonwood and willow trees; endophytes
(microorganisms) living within these trees will be used to enhance the
remediation processes. Since many of the poplar and willow endophytes isolated
in the PI's laboratory can both induce rapid root growth and fix atmospheric
nitrogen, the presence of these endophytes may have a vital role in the survival
and successful establishment of these tree species. This project is the first
comprehensive study of the beneficial role of endophytes on TCE metabolism by
two tree genera most suitable for phytoremediation. Development of methods of
improving the ability of trees to remediate polluted sites that do not involve
genetic engineering will aid in making this greener technology more accepted for
widespread use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and seven of her ten lab members
are female scientists. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited through the
UW Minority Program. As an active member of the International Poplar Commission
and part of the Working Group on environmental uses of poplar and willow, the PI
has direct connections to users of poplar and willow around the world to ensure
that the knowledge generated in this project will be utilized promptly to
improve remediation of pollutants in an environmentally sustainable way.
