Abstract Seitzman GIT CTS-9502371 The proposed research includes the development
of non-intrusive combustion diagnostics to be applied to high pressure
combustion environments such as encountered in gas turbines. The PI intends to
model candidate optical techniques in order to evaluate their feasibility as
high pressure combustion diagnostics. This approach was considered very
innovative. He has a creative educational plan which includes the development of
teaching abilities, course development, student mentoring, and high school and
community out-reach programs. The Panel predicted he would be quite successful.
