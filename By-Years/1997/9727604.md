This award provides support for travel for students and postdocs to attend the
Workshop on Non-neutral Plasma Physics to be held in Boulder, CO, July 29-August
1, 1997. This workshop is the third in a series that began in 1988. The program
includes both invited talks and poster sessions on a variety of topics of
current interest in plasma physics, including ion traps, positron plasmas, and
dusty plasmas. Student attendees are selected on the basis of an abstract
submitted for a presentation at the conference.
