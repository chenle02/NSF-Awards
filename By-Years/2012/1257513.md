discuss research priorities and ways to collaborate and explore the potential
for joint US and China research in the area of ecology and evolution of
infectious disease, and stimulate awareness of the crosscutting benefits of such
efforts. Cross-cultural and interdisciplinary knowledge and novel insight will
be gained as well as lasting collaborations towards uncovering key questions in
this arena. Current research in the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases
