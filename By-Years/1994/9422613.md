9422413 Braford With this award a research group at a predominantly
undergraduate institution headed by Dr. Mark Braford will conduct studies on
brain evolution. Developmental and anatomical studies will be made of cell
groups in the forebrain of ray-finned fishes. These studies will allow the group
to test hypotheses about the relationship of forebrain features in these fish to
some of those seen in mammalian brains. This work will yield new information
that will help us to better understand how the brains of mammals were developed
into their present form. ***
