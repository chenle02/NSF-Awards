9357520 Liu This project is for one of the NSF Young Investigator (NYI)
awardees. The awardee plans to investigate the transport phenomena and surface
properties of mixed ionic-electronic conductors. The intention is to improve the
design of materials vital to batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and devices for
removal of NOx and H2S. The awardee also intends to inspire the students in the
solid state ionics, which will impact energy, environment, and the quality of
life. %%% This is a NSF Young Investigator (NYI) award. The awardee will pursue
fundamental investigation into the solid state ionics. The intention is to
improve the design of materials for batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and gas
removal devices. the awardee also intends to inspire the students in solid state
ionics, which will impact energy, environment, and the quality of life. ***
