9307650 Palakal This award will fund an interdisciplinary study focused on
furthering the understanding of the bat's echolocating system. It will combine
neurophysiological, multi- resolution signal processing and artificial neural
network approaches to determine a biologically plausible model of the FM bat's
auditory system. The overall goal is to identify the mechanisms underlying
auditory perception. This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and
Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of proposals that through the
study of neurophysiological systems could advance engineering science and
advance the knowledge of biological systems through the use of engineering
analysis techniques. The research being funded by this award has the potential
to advance both neurophysiological sciences and the field of engineering through
its biological, signal processing and modeling approaches. ***
