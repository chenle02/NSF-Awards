This grant will provide funds for capital equipment to allow the Notre Dame
Nuclear Structure Laboratory to pursue new initiatives in Radioactive Ion Beams,
Nuclear Astrophysics, and Superdeformation and other High-spin phenomena. The
new equipment is divided into four categories: new style accelerating tubes for
the Tandem accelerator and associated vacuum equipment upgrading, electronics
equipment for the detection systems, a data acquistion and handling system, and
Compton-suppressed germanium detectors for the gamma-ray studies. These are all
areas considered to be of prime current interest in the field of nuclear
physics. The Laboratory is used exclusively for academic research and for the
training of Graduate and Undergraduate students. The University will demonstrate
its support by cost sharing on this grant.
