The University of Florida has a strong research group in the area of Computer
Vision. Undergraduates at the university, however, currently have no exposure to
this increasingly important field of study. They plan to offer an upper level
undergraduate course in Computer Vision to familiarize students with this area.
It is their contention that without access to near-realtime computer processing
and display capabilities, such a course has little relevance; it is critical
that one learn what the qualitative and quantitative behaviors of various
computer vision algorithms are by directly manipulating high resolution imagery.
Their current equipment holding prohibit them from offering such a course to a
reasonable size class (twenty of so) of undergraduates. To support this
coursework, they are seeking funds to purchase a small group of workstations.
These workstations will be used for laboratory support of the undergraduate
computer vision class. The class and laboratory work envisioned will give
undergraduates an opportunity to bring together many of the concepts that have
been conveyed to them in their mandatory course work in a fascinating field of
study.
