This Leadership Activities project will provide opportunities for 30 teachers in
the state of Michigan to become knowledgeable about the Middle Grades Math
Project (MGMP) and its attendant instructional model and to subsequently serve
as leaders in mathematics education in their school districts. Sixty peers of
the 30 leader teachers will also have the opportunity to learn more about the
materials and model in a summer workshop in 1987. Both the leader teachers and
the peer group will have follow-up support from the Aquinas College staff and
from administrators and supervisors in their own school districts. All
participants, especially the leader teachers, will be encouraged to develop
additional instructional materials consistent with those developed by the MGMP.
The leader teachers will be recruited for the program by Aquinas College staff
in cooperation with district administrators who recognize their instructional
skills, desire for improvement, and leadership potential. The leader teachers
will be actively involved in the identification of the peer teachers in the
second year. The leader teachers will also be responsible for conducting in-
service programs in their school districts in addition to implementing the MGMP
units and instructional methodology in their own classrooms. The project will
have direct support from the developers of the MGMP materials and will allow
immediate use and evaluation of those materials in a summer school of middle
grade students. A well-developed evaluation model will allow measurement of the
impact of the program on both the teachers and their students.
