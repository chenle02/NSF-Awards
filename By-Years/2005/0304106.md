ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0304106&lt;br/&gt;Jongyoon Han,
MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic motion of biomolecules within a confined
space will be studied, using regular nanofluidic channels made by standard MEMS
technology. Nanofluidic channels with known shape and depth (10~1000nm) will be
designed and fabricated on Si or polymer substrates to confine molecular motion
at least in one dimension, and the stochastic motion of single molecules will be
followed by the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy technique. The changes in
molecular stochastic motion, caused either by the confinement effect or the
interaction with Debye layer, will be studied. The result of this research could
provide insights in understanding biomolecular transport in the confined
intracellular spaces. Also, it could generate new ideas for controlling
molecules within nanostructures, which has a direct application in biomolecule
sensing and separation. Also, the concept of molecular manipulation by
nanofluidic channels could have broad &lt;br/&gt;impacts and applications in
various science and engineering areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is being
funded by three programs in CTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate and Multiphase
Processes &lt;br/&gt;Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing
&lt;br/&gt;Separation and Purification Processes &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
