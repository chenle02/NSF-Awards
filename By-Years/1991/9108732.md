The mammalian nervous system is analogous to an electrical wiring system that
sends messages to all parts of the body. The axon is an exceptionally long
"electric wire" extension of the neuron and conducts the electrical signals
generated in the nervous system. Though it is not fully understood how axons
reach their targets, it is known that axons expand as a result of the slow
movement of its front end, the growth cone. As the growth cone slowly moves
around the body, the axon lengthens from behind. Filamentous proteins of the
cytoplasm, actin, microtubules, and intermediated filaments compose a dynamic
skeletal structure for cells, that underlies the ability of axons to elongate.
This research project will focus on describing the motility of the
lammellipodial growth cone. Mechanical tension is expected to regulate the
cytoskeleton during axonal elongation. This ideas is supported by thermodynamic
considerations that suggest the assemble of filaments is affected by mechanical
forces. The relationship between mechanical tension and two other known
stimulators of axonal elongation; nerve growth factor and electrical fields will
be investigated to determine whether growth signals transduce through tension or
act independently. In conjunction with these studies, the Principal investigator
will study the assembly of microtubules during the process of axonal initiation
and ascertain what chemicals are responsible for the motility of growth cones by
using tension measuring methods. These cytomechanical investigations will
provide new insight in understanding axonal development in the nervous system.
