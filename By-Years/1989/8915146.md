To understand the transport of energy throughout the middle atmosphere requires
observations around the globe. Many observational programs are currently in
place and form a network of observing stations comprising the global network
required for understanding of the global wind fields and for testing and
development of current global models. This project is primarily for the
continuation of meteor echo measurements in the height range of 80 to 110 km
made from Durham, New Hampshire. The observations will be used in a number of
international and national campaigns as well as in more localized studies in
conjunction with the Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar.
