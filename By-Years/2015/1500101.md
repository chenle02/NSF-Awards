Engineering a secure IT system, in addition to technical skills, requires a
particular mindset focused on using cybersecurity solutions effectively against
sophisticated and stealthy cyber attacks. The traditional lecture-centric style
of teaching has failed to deliver that mindset, which is the direct result of an
over-emphasis on specific technical skills (with limited lifespan and
insufficient technical depth), abstract rather than deeply technical examination
of fundamental concepts, and an impatience in developing broader analytical
skills. The vast majority of cybersecurity failures are the result of poor
understanding of the security landscape and an inability to adapt to new
threats.

Peer instruction may be a solution to this challenge. This project evaluates the
effectiveness of peer instruction methodology for cybersecurity education, and
develops the peer instruction material for three cybersecurity courses offering
an introduction to security concepts, a defensive view of cybersecurity, and an
offensive view of cybersecurity. The two primary mechanisms are used for
measuring impact of peer instruction, which are pre- and post-testing, and
isomorphic questions.
