This award provides support for the continued operation and improvement of the
Haystack Radio Observatory, for many years one of the foremost university
operated observatories. The completion of the upgrade to the telescope surface
will provide the most sensitive instrument in the U.S. at 3 mm wavelength.
Studies then possible will contribute to many areas of astronomy, including
increasing our understanding of star-forming regions, the interstellar medium,
and star formation in other galaxies.
