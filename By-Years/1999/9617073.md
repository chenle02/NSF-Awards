Shull, Michael AST 96-17073 Dr. Shull will study the absorption line spectra of
QSOs using rigorous models of radiative transfer, gas dynamics, and thermal and
chemical evolution coupled to modern cosmology. There are three main topics --
the temporal evolution and spatial variation of the metagalactic radiation
field, the effects of local sources and the nature of the low-redshift Lyman-
alpha clouds and galaxy halos.
