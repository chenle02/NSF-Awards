The goals of the research project 'Counting curves on higher dimensional complex
projective manifolds' are1) to explicitly calculate the expected number of
curves (one-complex-dimensional submanifolds) on higher dimensional manifolds in
settings where one expects finitely many such curves, 2) to determine when the
expected number is actually realized by (rigid) curves. One aim is to simplify
recent advances by Givental, Yau, et al. carrying out 1) in the case of Calabi-
Yau threefolds. Another is to study the general deformation of a special
situation in which the curves, although expected to be finite, actually move in
families.

This project lies within the area of research called complex projective
geometry, that is, the study of geometric properties of solutions of systems of
polynomial equations in several variables. The research is related to
fundamental questions in quantum physics and differential equations.
