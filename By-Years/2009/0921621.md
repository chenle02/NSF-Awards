Through a multi-city case study in China and Russia, the researcher seeks to
elucidate the political dynamics that explain why and how the enforcement of
regulation varies across space and time at the local level. Examining the
difference between official policy and local implementation of policy offers
unique opportunities to understand law-in-action as opposed to law-on-the-books.
Countries transitioning from command to market economies, such as China and
Russia, are particularly interesting with regard to theoretical understanding of
policy implementation because of the social, political, legal, and economic
uncertainties induced by such transitions. The researcher will conduct
interviews with key officials involved in the promulgation of policy, actors
charged with local enforcement, members of non-governmental organizations, and
targets (potential and actual) of enforcement to identify and explain punitive
versus rehabilitative enforcement and variation in punitive enforcement actions.
In addition, the researcher will conduct archival work in both China and Russia
to gather relevant police records and information on press coverage. The results
of this research will provide insights into state capacity, policy
implementation, and criminal organization.
