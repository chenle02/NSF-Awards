The objective of the proposed work is to derive and analyze mathematical models
that describe the dynamics of flames. The models will be derived systematically
from the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy by means of asymptotic
methods and analyzed using analytical and numerical methods. It is proposed to
identify mathematical models that contain enough details of the real combustion
systems and analyze these models in order to gain basic understanding on how the
physical and chemical processes interact in the simpler circumstances.
Comparison with the experimental record will be performed in order to test the
models and their predictions. The mathematical problems involve nonlinear
evolution equations and nonlinear aspects of flame instabilities.

The objective of the proposed work is to gain fundamental understanding in the
complex processes occurring in combustion problems, problems that are
encountered in various engineering applications. Improving our fundamental
understanding of combustion phenomena could suggest new directions for applied
research and lead to a better design of combustion systems. The problems that
will be investigated are related to phenomena that have been observed in the
laboratory but are not yet completely understood. The proposed work will address
three classes of problems: The first class is concerned with the evolution of
premixed flames in open space and in confined environments, where the coupled
effects between the flame and the hydrodynamic field is of primary interest.
Studies of premixed flames have significant technological importance and are
directly applicable to internal combustion engines processes. The second class
of problems is concerned with instabilities in non-premixed combustion, or
diffusion flames, for which theoretical studies are only now emerging. Non-
premixed conditions are favored in furnaces for safety reasons and in diesel
engines here the liquid fuel evaporates in the combustion chamber providing the
necessary fuel vapor that burns with air. The third class of problems is
concerned with flame spread over flammable liquids, where the combined behaviors
in the liquid and gas phases determine the flame dynamics. Flame spread over an
accidental spillage of a flammable liquid, or a "running liquid fire"
encountered in petrochemical industries, can become a fire hazard.
