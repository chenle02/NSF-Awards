9313473 Ondov This award to the University of Maryland allows them to renovate
the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry's Environmental Low Contamination
Facility. This facility was constructed in 1978, primarily, for the preparation
and handling of materials and samples associated with aerosol particulate
collections in urban and remote areas, and the packaging of these materials for
instrumental neutron activation analysis. A laminar-flow clean bench, installed
at this time, continues to provide the department's only clean facility for
sample digestion and chemical separation. Due to increased activity in this
scientific area and due to the deterioration of the facility, there is a great
need to modernize this laboratory space. Based on numbers of Ph.D. graduates,
the Analytical- Nuclear-Environmental Division's efforts make the University of
Maryland one of the largest institutions for graduate environmental research.
Recognized internationally for their research in marine geochemistry, nuclear
and marine chemistry, and atmospheric aerosol chemistry, the Maryland professors
offer one of the few nationally-recognized graduate environmental science
programs, and one of the few programs that train students in nuclear analytical
methods. Trends in environmental research continue to demand larger numbers of
analyses with ever increasing analytical sensitivity, thereby intensifying the
demand for improved analytical technology, methods and concomitant clean room
facilities. The renovations to be completed will support the work of outstanding
researchers in this field as well as 22 graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows. ***
