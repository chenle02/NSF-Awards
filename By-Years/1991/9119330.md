A widely advocated mechanism for the evolution of reproductive isolation
involves the co-evolution of sender/receiver communication systems between
sexes. This study will test the hypothesis that male calling song and female
mate preference are genetically correlated in the two sibling ground cricket
species, Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius. Parent- offspring and full sib
quantitative genetic methods will be used to assess the degree to which inter-
and intraspecific variation in male calling song is correlated to variation in
female preference of a male's calling song. In addition, the heritability of
female mate preference (as measured by phonotaxis to male calling songs) will be
estimated. Knowledge of the heritability of female preference, and its genetic
correlation with male calling song will provide insights concerning the speed of
response to past, present and future selective pressures; more importantly, the
absence of genetic variance could pose a fundamental constraint to the evolution
of mate recognition systems.
