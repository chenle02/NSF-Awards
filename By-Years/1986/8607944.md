Boiling heat transfer is used as the preferred mode of heat transfer whenever
very high rates of heating or cooling are needed. A pivotal issue in boiling
heat transfer is the so-called critical heat flux, because it represents the
highest rate at which heat can be transferred by boiling. This work will extend
prior knowledge of the critical heat flux to more demanding situations.
