This grant provides travel support for students wishing to attend the 2015
SIGMETRICS conference, which is to be held in Portland, Oregon on June 15-19,
2015. The SIGMETRICS conference is the flagship conference of the SIGMETRICS
community, which is the ACM Special Interest Group (SIG) for the computer
systems performance evaluation.

This grant supports up to 20 US-based graduate students to attend and
participate in the conference, to learn about the latest research directions,
and to meet and discuss their research with leading experts in the field.
Students have an opportunity to participate in workshops on special topics or on
workshops intended to support students with diverse backgrounds, to present
research posters and/or talks, and to volunteer as scribes for the conference
sessions. This grant support enables attendance of students who would not
otherwise have been able to attend.
