A long-term program concerning the extraglactic distance scale, specifically
aimed at improving distances to nearby calibrating galaxies, will be carried
out. With the advantage of the higher precision now achievable with digital
charge-coupled detectors (CCD), and by obtaining multicolor data, the reddening
for the Cepheid stars in the galaxies under study can be determined, thus
eliminating a major systematic uncertainty in their distance determinations.
Such an improved calibration will provide critical data for the determination of
the Hubble constant, which in turn will provide insights into the properties of
the Universe as a whole; i.e., cosmology. The specific projects are intended to
provide: 1) New distances and reddening estimates to galaxies for which Cepheids
have already been discovered. 2) The discovery of new Cepheids in southern-
hemisphere galaxies, with the intent of increasing the number of galaxies upon
which the determination of the Hubble constant rests. 3) An investigation into
the possible systematic effects of metallicity of the Cepheids on the
calibration of the Cepheid distance scale.
