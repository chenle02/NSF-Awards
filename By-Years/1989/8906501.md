The proposed project would establish Hunter College as a node on NYSERNET and
as a consequence, a node on NSFNET. The nearest NYSERNET node is at the
University Computer Center (UCC) of CUNY. A dedicated T1 line between Hunter
College and the computer service is already in operation. Thus, the project
requires the purchase of an IP router at both ends of the line, as well as
additional cards to the multiplexers at both ends of the line. Once the
connection is established, researchers using computers can exchange data with
any other NSFNET site with great ease. It also significantly facilitates data
transfer between the mainframes at the UCC and minis with powerful graphics
capabilities. Finally, it provides remote log-in capabilities from Hunter
College computers to supercomputer centers and allows for quick tranfer of
results to local computers for analysis.***//
