Defensive behavior is controlled by physical and chemical events within the
central nervous system. These events are influenced by environmental, hormonal
and genetic factors. Dr. Caroline Blanchard is a expert on the behavioral
aspects of defense. This Career Advancement Award is made for the purpose of
advanced training in new techniques so that Dr. Blanchard can enhance her skills
in the areas of the neuroanatomical and neurochemical bases of defensive
behavior. The technique of receptor binding autoradiography will be used to
demonstrate where in the brain specific chemicals are active and what factors
can change the binding patterns. The technique of direct chemical stimulation
will be used to explore which brain sites and which chemical transmitter signals
are important in influencing specific behaviors. Neuroendocrinological
techniques will focus on the role of brain hormones. By studying connections
among different neural groups, the circuits involved in behavior can be
determined. Part of this award involves collaborative research with a group of
Russian neuroscientists who are interested in genetic aspects of behavioral
defense systems. Knowledge gained from these studies will lead to an increased
understanding of the neural mechanisms of defense.
