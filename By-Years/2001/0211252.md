This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Kirk S. Schanze of the University of Florida to
pursue studies on the "Photophysics of Metal-Organic and Organometallic pi-
Conjugated Oligomers". Pi-conjugated polymers and oligomers comprise a new
generation of molecular materials with technologically useful optical,
electronic, and opto-electronic properties. Research is underway to investigate
the excited state properties of mono-disperse pi-conjugated oligomers that
contain transition metal chromophores to gain a molecular level understanding of
their excited state properties. Objectives include an understanding of how
transition metal chromophores modify the excited state properties of the pi-
conjugated organic systems and how the pi-conjugated molecules modify the
excited state properties of the metal complexes, particularly the properties of
the triplet-pi, pi* manifold of the conjugated oligomer. Metal ion complexes
involved in metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states include
Ru(II), Os(II) and Rh(III) with alpha-thiophene oligomers that modulate the
energy gap between the MLCT and triplet-pi,pi* manifolds in both mono- and
polynuclear complexes. The excited state properties of platinum-acetylide
oligomers will be examined to provide clear information concerning the spatial
extent of the singlet-pi,pi* and triplet-pi,pi* excitons and to understand how
inter-chain interactions modify the excited state properties of the pi-
conjugated Pt-acetylides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The photochemistry of pi-
conjugated molecules attached to transition metal ions are being investigated as
to their basic photophysical properties with applications that include novel
electronic light-emitting devices, light-to electrical energy conversion, laser
light protection, and plastic electronic circuits. &lt;br/&gt;
