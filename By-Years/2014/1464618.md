The Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS), an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) established by Brigham Young University and
the University of Colorado in 2012, provides innovative solutions to key
technical challenges facing the UAS industry and trains a diverse, highly
qualified cadre of leaders for this emerging field. In seeking to join the
C-UAS, as a third university site, Virginia Tech brings expertise in a variety
of critical and complementary research areas. Virginia Tech also leads one of
six FAA-designated unmanned aircraft system test sites, which presents an
opportunity for C-UAS partners to support the FAA's regulatory policy
development efforts while establishing a foothold in emerging commercial
markets. This planning grant supports Virginia Tech's effort to develop a
viable, self-sustaining Site Addition to the C-UAS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific research agenda to be addressed within this C-UAS Site Addition will
ultimately be determined by the Center's Industry Advisory Board (IAB),
including new representatives who commit to join the Center along with Virginia
Tech. Likely focus areas for the expanded C-UAS research program include
advanced flight control (e.g., methods to construct robust, secure, and
mathematically certified control algorithms), agriculture (e.g., methods to
monitor plant pathogen transport), machine vision and machine learning (e.g.,
software for real-time, on-board intelligent image processing), multiphysics
design optimization (e.g., aircraft design optimization tools that incorporate
unsteady fluid/structure interaction), safety and airworthiness (e.g.,
reliability prediction methods that incorporate imprecise uncertainties
intrinsic to small UAS), and wireless communications (e.g., the use of software
defined radio and intelligent communication protocols that adapt the information
flow to the environmental conditions). Proposals for specific research tasks
will be developed in coordination with prospective industry and government
partners to ensure that those partners are fully engaged in the process and
committed to the research program.
