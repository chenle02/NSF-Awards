The mechanisms that control the ductility or embrittlement in iron-manganese,
platinum-rhodium-tungsten, iridium, and nickel aluminide by the presence of
small amounts of impurities will be studied. These alloys represent a range of
crystal structures and will allow one to test the generality of the observed
effects. Hall-Petch experiments on materials doped with either ductilizing or
embrittling impurities will be done to determine the effect of impurity on the
ability of grain boundaries to impede the transmission of slip. Measurement of
the relative impurity segregation behavior to surfaces and grain boundaries will
be made. In situ deformation in TEM will provide a detailed understanding of the
mechanisms involved in slip transmission.
