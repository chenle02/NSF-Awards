9403734 Mitra This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Urbashi Mitra to work with Professors Pierre Humblet and Dirk Slock
at Institut EURECOM in France. Wireless communication networks are proposed for
fixed site sources such as local area networks. The shared radio channel
necessitates the development and analysis of efficient receivers for signals
from a multitude of users. These new multi-user receivers must operate
synergistically vis a vis concerns for bandwidth efficiency, radio spectrum
allocation, the receiver technology complexity, quality of service and privacy
issues. The object of the proposed research is to augment newly proposed multi-
user receivers to be adaptive structures. Further extensions are proposed to
accommodate interference from time-dispersive communication channels. The
possibility of creating adaptive multi-user receivers that operate without the
use of training signals will also be investigated. ***
