A two-day workshop on sediment research will be held in the fall of 1986 in
Washington, D.C. A number of highly appropriate participants have been contacted
and a list of nearly 20 expected discussion leaders is provided. Tentative
sessions have been organized as follows: bedload; suspended load; alluvial
roughness; numerical modeling; rain and estuary behavior; special engineering
problems. Specific questions to be addressed have been formulated for these
themes. Two main issues are (1) applications of fluid modeling techniques to
sedimenting flows, and (2) utilization of new developments in instrumentation.
