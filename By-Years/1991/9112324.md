The purpose of this research is to bring biological and geological relationships
into the structure of an economic model for the valuation and management of
tropical forests. The economic model is grounded in theory and incorporates
recent developments in the modeling of dynamics and decision-making under
uncertainty. The project's application to a specific planning problem will
demonstrate the importance of this multidisciplinary approach to the complex
issues surrounding tropical deforestation and resultant global change and loss
of genetic diversity. The first part of the project will develop a theoretical
model for the management of tropical forests that address some special
constraints and uncertainties associated with their use. Specifically,
uncertainty, irreversibility, and spatial relationships modify traditional
management schemes to reflect the character of tropical management issues. The
inclusion of spatial interactions between plots allows the model to address the
complementary issues of minimum habitat size, reforestation, and externalities.
The second part of the study involves an application of the model to a land
planning case in Thailand. Data collected to describe the benefit flows from use
options and the types of biological interactions across plots will be inserted
in a computer algorithm that will solve the nonlinear programming problem for
the Thai data. The planning model will determine spatial and intertemporal
allocation patterns among a group of land users.
