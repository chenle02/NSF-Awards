A mathematical object known as a 3-manifold resembles our physical space if one
views a small piece of it. However on a large scale, 3-manifolds have properties
that may be quite different from what we are used to seeing and experiencing.
Such manifolds are common objects in science, appearing for example in physics,
astronomy or data science, as well as in various fields of mathematics. Here the
Principal Investigator will study intrinsic properties of 3-manifolds, and how
they relate to various areas of mathematics. Since many properties lend
themselves to computer study and yield interesting algorithms, the PI will also
look at questions that encompass how "hard" 3-manifolds are computationally. The
award provides funds for supporting a graduate student.

Due to Geometrization (W. Thurston, Perelman), every 3-manifold can be
canonically decomposed into pieces, and each piece has a certain geometric
structure. Thus, on a global scale, one can match topological information for
the manifold with the respective geometry. However, on a local scale, that is,
intrinsically, the connection between the geometry and topology of a 3-manifold
is not well understood. This is particularly so for hyperbolic 3-manifolds,
though there are questions for other classes as well. The goal of the first part
of this project is to obtain a deep insight into this, for 3-manifolds with
finite hyperbolic or simplicial volume (since not all manifolds here are
hyperbolic). There are projects on embedded surfaces and arcs in 3-manifolds,
cusped or closed, addressing well-known conjectures in the field. While these
questions are interesting a priori, the second part of the project is concerned
with applications of the developed results and techniques, and aims to use the
obtained insight for deepening connections with other areas. In particular, (a)
to better understand the interplay between geometric topology and algebraic
geometry of 3-manifolds, through the study representation variety of a
3-manifold; (b) to address the problems on the interface of theoretical computer
science and low-dimensional topology, through an overlap with complexity theory
and computable analysis.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
