Incremental computation is the technique of efficiently maintaining computed
information about a changing object. This idea is used in doing semantic
checking in programming environments, spreadsheets, document formatting in
WYSIWYG editors and many other applications. Simply recomputing the information
from scratch after each change is often too inefficient. Writing explicitly
incremental algorithms that describe how to update the computed information in
response to changes is difficult and error-prone. Incremental evaluators, given
a computation to perform, automatically figure out how to correctly and
efficiently update their output when their input changes. Past work in
incremental evaluators has been targeted primarily at helping to automate the
construction of programming environments that perform such activities as type
checking and code generation. The techniques used are unsuitable for many of the
problems associated with more advanced programming environments that use
concepts such as inferential or transformational programming, program
verification and other semantically-rich concepts. Previous work helped to lay
the ground work for a new paradigm of incremental evaluation that shows promise
of being widely useful for such problems. The goal of this project is to
continue the development of that research and to incorporate those ideas into
useful tools so that these ideas and tools can be used by the research community
to assist in the development and exploration of advanced programming
environments.
