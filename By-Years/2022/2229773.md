New, fast-moving open source ecosystems centered on big data and data science
have emerged due to the successful business models in hyperscale computing
industries. This Phase 1 project explores sustainable and effective pathways for
establishing open source as an alternative translation for technologies using
Skyhook as a pilot project. The project will coordinate a series of workshops
convening open source experts and community leaders with diverse backgrounds to
build expertise for open tech transfer within the university. An important focus
in these workshops is the ability to foster a diverse community and encourage
participation from historically excluded communities. The project seeks to
impacts the adoption of Skyhook technology for reproducible research
prototyping, as a teaching tool in classrooms, and for the establishment of open
source as a viable translation path of technologies for research
universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apache Arrow is a representation of columnar
data in memory which has created a wide-ranging and rapidly growing open source
ecosystem of efficient data processing with many different programming language
bindings (e.g., C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Julia, MATLAB, Python, R,
Ruby, and Rust). Due to the common representation, data can move efficiently
without conversion between the ecosystem's processing engines running on
different systems. Skyhook aims to become a research prototyping ecosystem and a
blueprint for efficiently embedding data processing libraries in storage systems
and computational storage devices while enabling processing and storage
ecosystems to evolve independently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
