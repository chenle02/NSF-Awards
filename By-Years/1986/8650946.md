This project involves the development of a new course that interfaces the theory
and practice of scanning electron microscopy with a traditional "Light
Microscopy and Microtechnique" course. Electron microscopy is a common tool used
in industry and postgraduate research, and yet is rarely presented in an
undergraduate curriculum. The new course, entitled "Scientific Methods Using
Scanning Electron Microscopy", allows upper-division undergraduates to be
exposed to this state-of-the-art technology. The course is directed at students
from a variety of disciplines and is cross-listed under the Departments of
Biological Science, Chemistry, Engineering, Geoscience, and Physics. The
scanning electron microscope (SEM) acquired through this award serves as the
focus of the didactic aspects of this project which include the theory of
electron microscopy and ultrastructure interpretation. Other basic skills that
are emphasized include data generation, gathering, analysis, and presentation.
Before students enter the course, each is asked to submit a project proposal
from any field or discipline on any topic--as long as an SEM is part of the
methology used to study the problem. The first three weeks of the course are
devoted to the theory of electron microscopy, and are designed to give the
student a working knowledge of the instrument. After a rigorous check-out at the
end of week three, the student is given wide latitude in the pursuit of
individual projects. Weeks four to the end of the semester are devoted to the
interpretation and presentation of data. Completed projects must be submitted in
the form of a scientific paper, and also as a 10-minute oral presentation.
