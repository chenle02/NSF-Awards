The proposed research is a systematic investigation of (real and complex)
reflection groups in PU(n,1). The main goal is to obtain new discrete subgroups
and lattices in PU(2,1), more specifically many new non-arithmetic lattices.
Hyperbolic reflection groups are an important class of groups in the realm of
discrete subgroups and lattices in Lie groups, and more generally in geometry
and topology. Such groups are accessible to a direct geometric description and
understanding which are not always clear for groups defined algebraically or
arithmetically. While these reflection groups are relatively well understood in
the constant curvature setting (they are then "Coxeter groups" in Euclidean,
spherical or real hyperbolic n-space), very little is known about their complex
hyperbolic counterparts.

A "tessellation" or crystal structure is a way of filling space with non-
overlapping tiles in a pattern that repeats infinitely often. A "lattice" is the
symmetry group of a tessellation. Understanding these crystallographic
structures in Euclidean 3-space is crucial in Chemistry. The PI studies the
analogous structures in "hyperbolic spaces". Real and complex hyperbolic spaces
are spaces of negative curvature modelled on the real or complex numbers.
Negative curvature means loosely that non-intersecting "straight" lines tend to
diverge from each other in both directions. Real hyperbolic spaces of dimensions
2 and 3 appear in special relativity, in Lorentz and Minkowski space-time;
understanding these spaces and their symmetry groups is important in theoretical
Physics. Finally, the PI will continue his various outreach activities involving
undergraduates and K-12 students.
