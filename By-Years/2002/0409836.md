Most earthquakes take place on geometrically complex fault systems rather than
simple planar faults. Recent earthquakes on such fault systems have shown quite
clearly the important effects of fault geometry on the dynamics of earthquake
rupture, slip, and ground motion. This project is to study the dynamics of
geometrically complex fault systems over multiple earthquake cycles using
numerical simulations. Specific fault geometries to be addressed include faults
with bends, faults with branches, and faults with offset segments. To accomplish
this task, dynamic models for the earthquake rupture and slip process are being
integrated with quasi-static models to simulate the processes of slow tectonic
loading, nucleation, and post-seismic relaxation. An integrated algorithm to
model these processes is being developed in this research. Using this technique,
the researchers are modeling the complete earthquake cycle: initial stress
distributions on faults before an earthquake rupture are a consequence of slow
tectonic loading, stress relaxation, and residual stress from previous ruptures.
Nucleation is also be spontaneously developed, and dynamic rupture patterns and
ground motion are calculated. Thus, the long-term effects of fault geometry and
characteristic behaviors of fault systems over multiple earthquake cycles are
addressed in a self-consistent manner. The results will aid in the
interpretation of recorded earthquakes on geometrically complex fault systems,
such the Hector Mine and Chi-Chi events. The results will also aid in the
prediction of future behavior of complex fault systems such as the San Andreas,
as well as the ground motion during earthquakes on these faults.
