This planning grant to Old Dominion University has the long-term goal of to
enhancing the student learning process by a curricular transformation that
integrates visualization modules, simulation software, and virtual experiments
and labs seamlessly across all engineering disciplines. The planning grant
itself will address a number of specific questions: What is the best way to
educate engineering students to provide them with hands-on experience through
the virtual domain to address the changing requirements of industry? What
visualization technology platforms should be used? What existing educational
materials are most suitable for adoption based on the College.s curricula
transformation vision? What visualization modules should be prepared in-house,
and what widely used computer software should be integrated in courses? How can
different education technology tools be integrated seamlessly into the
curricula? What assessment instruments should be developed to gage the
effectiveness of the proposed transformation? These questions will be answered
in the planning grant through the establishment of the Visualization-Enhanced
Engineering Education Laboratory (VEEEL), which will feature the development of
a prototype visualization module as a test bed for the proof of concept. The
Laboratory will also serve as a catalyst for partnerships among the faculty and
area institutions, visualization and simulation software companies, and other
academic institutions with proven success in this area.
