This proposal is a request for a multi-user central computer facility for the
cognitive science group at Brown University. Broadly defined, cognitive science
is the study of the mind and its structural and functional representation. Such
study includes the investigation of representational and computational
components involved in using and comprehending language, and in perceiving,
acting, thinking, and knowing. A central characteristic of cognitive science is
its concern with computational problems. There are four broad areas of research
represented in Cognitive Science at Brown University in which the computer has
served as a necessary tool. These include neural modelling of language and
cognitive process, computational vision, speech, and memory and cognitive
processes. Although most of us represented in this proposal have our own
computer equipment, the need for and the utility of a central cognitive science
machine has been proven to us over and over again. The requested equipment and
associated software will allow us not only to maintain but increase our current
computational resources and will allow us to maintain, and develop a state-of-
the-art computer and communications network for research in many areas of
cognitive science.
