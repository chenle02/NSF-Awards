With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr.
Trevor Hayton of the University of California Santa Barbara is developing new
methods for the synthesis of double and triple bonds ("M=E" bonds) between
certain metals and nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms. These new bonds are
highly reactive and, consequently, they undergo unprecedented reaction chemistry
with industrially useful chemicals, such as those that bear carbon-carbon double
and triple bonds, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide. However, because these
molecules and bonds are so reactive, scientists do not fully understand how to
make them selectively without making a large number of unwanted side products.
In this project, Dr. Hayton is developing new chemical strategies to limit side
reactions and form only the desired M=E bonds. With this high level of control,
the reactivity of these bonds can be explored in a systematic way, opening the
door to new catalytic transformations. Dr. Hayton is actively engaged in the
mentoring of women and under-represented groups via the SoCal Organometallics
(SCOM) meeting. By organizing and participating in this annual meeting, Dr.
Hayton provides students with presentation and networking opportunities.
Industry involvement at SoCal Organometallics also provides these students with
access to potential employers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Hayton is developing the
"Reductive Deprotection" methodology for the synthesis of late metal-ligand
multiple bonds, such as terminal sulfido complexes of copper and zinc, terminal
oxo complexes of nickel, and terminal nitrido complexes of group 10 metals.
Reductive deprotection involves the reductive removal of a protecting group from
a chalcogen or pnictogen atom, unmasking a latent M=E bond. The target complexes
allow them to quantify the extent of pi-bonding within the M=E linkage as they
traverse the periodic table from Fe to Zn, giving chemists a better
understanding of the "oxo wall" concept. Additionally, reactivity studies with
alkenes, alkynes, NO, and CO reveal unprecedented small molecule
transformations, opening the door to new catalytic reactivity with these
industrially relevant substrates. This research provides excellent training to
undergraduate and graduate students in the synthesis and characterization of air
sensitive metal complexes, preparing them for careers in academia, industry, or
the national laboratory system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
