9526372 Nolet This research is to continue a fundamental research program in
seismic tomography concentrated mainly in the upper mantle of North America.
Special emphasis will be on features visible in prior work such as a deep plume
beneath Yellowstone, remnants of the Farallon plate in the upper mantle, and a
250 km deep root under the Canadian shield. Local surface waves will be used to
constrain the depth of the Moho discontinuity and teleseismic travel time data
will be analyzed with waveform inversions and 3D wave bending algorithms.
Further applications will be developed to extend the methods to higher
frequencies, giving higher resolution in regions of large lateral heterogeneity.
Deep dehydration models will be tested by application of the tomographic methods
to the Indonesia/Philippine subduction area. *** ??
