This grant will provide support for junior researchers to attend a three-day
workshop whose focus is the physics of excited baryons. This topic is timely in
light of a program of experiments which are now underway at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility, and whose purpose is to provide a better
understanding of the underlying structure of protons, neutrons and their excited
states. Speakers at the workshop are experts in the subtopics which will be
covered by the workshop.
