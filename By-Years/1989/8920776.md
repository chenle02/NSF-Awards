This project establishes the coordination base for the U.S. precast concrete
research projects. It will integrate the results of the research into readily
usable forms and: * organize major coordination meetings of all principle
investigators at six month intervals, * coordinate activities between U.S. and
Japan precast concrete research activities through annual joint meetings, *
provide coordination with other precast concrete programs on-going elsewhere, *
facilitate transfer of technology to industry and the design profession. This
project will provide an effective mechanism for integration of the four research
projects into a coordinated research effort.
