Abstract





Fefferman and Stein will study problems in harmonic analysis, including the
decay of multilinear-operator-valued oscillatory integrals, the domination of
pseudodifferential operators, ergodic theory on semisimple Lie groups, multi-
parameter harmonic analysis and its applications to several complex variables,
constructive methods in fluid mechanics, discrete versions of singular Radon
transforms, scaling laws for mechanical systems, and applications of harmonic
analysis to atoms.

Harmonic analysis began with the work of Fourier in the early 19th century. Its
theme is to analyze complex behavior (heat flow, vibration,...) by writing it as
a sum of basic pieces behaving in the simplest way. Harmonic analysis is crucial
in many parts of science and technology. Fefferman and Stein are pursuing ideas
in harmonic analysis and relating them to problems in mathematics and physics.
