Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies of
Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD), which is the strong force that binds the
constituent gluons and quarks to form a proton or neutron. New techniques will
be used to investigate the production of massive quarks at particle colliders
over a range of energy scales and also to investigate the QCD scattering of
particles at very high energies. Since the theory of QCD is very complex in
general, the study of its effects in specific relevant processes is important to
gain insight into this theory. In addition, the understanding of QCD background
interactions is crucial to the interpretation of high energy collider data which
are being used to search for evidence of new physics.
