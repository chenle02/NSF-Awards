Ocean scientists from the United States academic research community will be
supported to participate in activities of the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea (ICES) which are of special interest to this community
and the ocean science programs in which it is involved. These ICES activities
will include the annual ICES Statutory Meeting; meetings of ICES Working Groups;
and scientific workshops and planning meetings. During the first year of this
award, U.S. scientists will be supported to participate in meetings of ICES
Working Groups on shelf hydrography; marine chemistry; benthic ecology; multi-
species models; larval fish ecology; biological effects of environmental
changes; and phytoplankton management.
