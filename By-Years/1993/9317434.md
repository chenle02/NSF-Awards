9317434 Farmer This award will provide the PI with support to participate in
development (with scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory) of high ion
yield ion sources for solid state mass spectrometers. The primary focus of the
project involves design, testing and attachment of a miniature version of a hot
cavity source to an isotope ratio thermal ionization mass spectrometer. A second
aspect of the proposed work will elucidate ways of increasing element ion yields
by studying the nature of ionization of dopants in Si- glass matrices.
