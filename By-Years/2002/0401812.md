This project will provide for the coordination of the NSF Geospace Environment
Modeling (GEM) Workshops. The GEM workshops comprise a 5 day-long workshop each
summer and a half-day mini-workshop in conjunction with each Fall American
Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting. The next summer workshop will be held in June
2004 in Snowmass, Colorado and the following year a joint workshop with the
Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) program will be
held in Santa Fe, NM. The funding for this project will support all facets of
the workshop coordination including: facility planning, meeting logistics, room
and audio-visual rental, student and postdoc travel support, and some associated
administrative support. The goal of the workshop coordination is to provide
organized forums to foster the community-wide discussions and research needed to
achieve the GEM program goals.
