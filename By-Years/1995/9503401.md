9503401 Wells There has been no systematic study of the phenomena of subsurface
cementation of beach sand and its subsequent subaerial exposure as beachrock in
intertidal environments. This may have important implications for
sedimentological, wave and current processes in the littoral zone. The PI will
carry out a pilot project in Puerto Rice to study beachrock and coastal
stability. 16 beach profiles will be measured and instruments deployed to study
lateral variations and processes. USGS and University of Puerto Rico scientists
will also collaborate. ***
