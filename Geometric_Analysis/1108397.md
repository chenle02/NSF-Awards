Abstract

Award: DMS 1108397, Principal Investigator: Garrett Alston

Mirror symmetry is an exciting branch of mathematics that is concerned with
duality between the symplectic and algebraic geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
There are two complementary conjectures that purport to explain this duality-
Kontsevich's Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture (HMS) and the Strominger-
Yau-Zaslow conjecture (SYZ). The principal investigator aims to study mirror
symmetry in the context of these conjectures by studying explicit examples.
First, an investigation of the manifold mirror to the quintic threefold will be
undertaken. The PI will search for objects on the mirror manifold that exhibit
behavior similar to a certain class of Lagrangian submanifolds on the quintic.
This will provide a direct and concrete illustration of HMS. In conjunction with
this work, a study of Floer cohomology of Lagrangians in K3 surfaces will be
undertaken. This work will exploit explicit Lagrangian torus fibration
constructions of Gross, Castano-Bernard, Matessi and others, which in turn are
inspired by the SYZ conjecture.

Algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry are deep and important fields whose
origins go back hundreds of years. The questions and ideas arising from these
fields have inspired many mathematicians and physicists and led to great
scientific advances. Mirror symmetry promises to add to this legacy. Mirror
symmetry has its roots in string theory and today is an important branch of
physics. To mathematicians, mirror symmetry is an exciting and tantalizing
subject because it hints at a link between algebraic and symplectic geometry. It
is often these types of links-links between different subjects-that lead to
breakthroughs. The goal of this project is to discover links between algebraic
and sympletic geometry by applying newly developed theory and techniques to
certain examples that are of central importance to mirror symmetry.
