While one of the promises of the upcoming 5G/6G systems is to offer increased
performance in terms of coverage and performance, there is a major effort in
integrating millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices into Next Generation
Networks (NextG). As there will be more and more connected devices per
capabilities of NextG systems, the attack surface for cyberthreats arising from
both classical and quantum computers will also be expanded. More importantly, as
the progress in building quantum computers is becoming more realistic, it is
prudent to adapt end-to-end quantum-resistant security protocols into the NextG
systems as they get designed and deployed for data in-transit and at-rest.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate concepts from quantum-safe
device level security, wireless networking, security management and network
evaluation in ways that have not been studied before. Major project activities
include the following: (i) investigation of quantum-safe cryptography algorithms
for the IoT devices deployed in NextG systems, (ii) efficient quantum-safe
certificate management in NextG systems, and (iii) end-to-end deployment and
evaluations of quantum-safe cryptography in NextG systems. Potential outcomes
will focus on bringing significant benefits to society as the project will
increase the security of everyday connections against the attacks from sponsored
attackers with future access to quantum computers benefiting both defense and
commercial entities. This project will also offer training opportunities for
under-represented students to conduct quantum-cryptographic research on a real-
life 5G testbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
