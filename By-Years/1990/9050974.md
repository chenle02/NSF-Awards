The geology department is integrating field geophysics into the field component
of lower and upper division courses with emphasis on the use of geophysical data
as a tool for problem solving. A gravity meter, magnetometer and portable
computer are being acquired to meet four goals: 1. exposure of all geology
majors and a majority of physics majors to geophysical field techniques, 2.
enhancement of undergraduate research opportunities, 3. year-round use of the
equipment, and 4. limited use by non-majors in demonstration settings and
exhibits. The equipment is being used in a new lower division course in Field
Methods as an exercise in quantitative data acquisition, contouring and mapping.
It is used in the Structural Geology course to study offsets in the Balcones
fault zone or to model a salt dome. Use in the Geophysics course emphasizes
processing and modelling methods. Students participate in planning of surveys
and prepare a comprehensive report on the analysis techniques and results. It is
also used for several surveys on the yearly Majors Field Trip, as a
demonstration tool in the Oceanography course, and in an exhibit monitoring
Earth tides. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
