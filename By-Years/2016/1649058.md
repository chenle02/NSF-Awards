The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project affects the significant
energy consumption that is due to separation processes. From petroleum refinery
to food and beverage production, many industrial processes need to overcome the
entropy of mixing. Membrane separation is the most energy efficient method of
separation, but commercial membranes are inherently limited by their material
properties. In particular, high temperature, corrosive, or sterile processes are
severely hindered by material selection. Currently, polymers are used for
membranes with small molecular-weight cutoffs, while ceramics are applicable for
larger contaminants. In many cases, heat is used to drive the separation because
membranes are insufficient to provide required rejection. But, in the case of
water desalination, membranes afford half to a quarter of the energy use per
unit of water treated, illustrating the inherent inefficiencies of distillation
or drying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses graphene oxide (GO) as
a material platform with tunable chemistry to offer size-exclusion based
membrane separation with increased robustness. In addition to permeability,
temperature stability and resilience to cleaning chemicals offer operational
cost savings. This project previously built a fundamentally new way of
assembling membranes by using chemical cross linkers between GO sheets in order
to leverage the low feedstock cost of GO, the improved permeability of a
nanoporous thin-film membrane, and the increased resilience to organic foulants.
Further, the production of these membranes was designed for manufacturing,
incorporating only solution-based processes with analogues used in industry
today. In the current work, with a deep understanding of the chemistry and
physics of graphene oxide through the lens of separation mechanisms, it is
anticipated that this system can open up many exciting opportunities for rGO
membranes in a number of important separations.
