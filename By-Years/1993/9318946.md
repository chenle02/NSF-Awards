9318946 Sheng The proposed work will focus on the following aspects of the high
temperature superconductor processing and characteristics: a) systematic
elemental substitutions for the existing layered high temperature
superconducting materials; b) design and synthesize new layered superconductors
with new structure; c) to identify possible superconductivity at about 200K
thallium-based ceramics; and d) to improve the flux pinning capabilities of the
existing thallium-based superconductors for practical application. The Principal
Investigator is one of the inventors of the thallium-based superconductors. %%%
The proposed studies are directed toward the objective to discover new and
superior oxide superconductors and to improve the existing superconductors for
high tech applications by increasing their flux pinning capabilities. ***
