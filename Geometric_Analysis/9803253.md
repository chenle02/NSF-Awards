Abstract Proposal: DMS-9803253 Principal Investigator: Tobias Colding The
proposed investigation includes research on manifolds with Ricci curvature
bounds, function theory and more generally theory of sections of bundles on
manifolds. Finally the proposed research will include compactness and
convergence results for minimal surfaces in three manifolds and their possible
topological applications. One of the fundamental problems in geometric analysis
is to try to understand the relationship between the topology, the geometry, and
the analysis of manifolds. In the proposed research the PI intends to try to
accomplish this in two main cases, the first being for manifolds with Ricci
curvature bounds and the second being for three manifolds.
