DMS-0138323&lt;br/&gt;Reinhard C. Laubenbacher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
supports research concerned with the algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;representation of
cell complexes, a special type of &lt;br/&gt;topological space. These complexes
arise as topological &lt;br/&gt;models of data and processes in science and
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Specific applications of interest are to biological,
social, &lt;br/&gt;and communications networks, as well as to problems in
&lt;br/&gt;statistics. Topological invariants of the complexes provide
&lt;br/&gt;measures of certain characteristics of the processes
&lt;br/&gt;producing the data. The use of cell complexes as data
&lt;br/&gt;models represents a new application of these structures &lt;br/&gt;to
science and engineering network problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods
employed include tools from computational &lt;br/&gt;algebra, combinatorics, and
combinatorial topology, thereby &lt;br/&gt;making a contribution to the
applicability of new mathematical &lt;br/&gt;areas to some pressing and
challenging applied problems. &lt;br/&gt;Research results will be disseminated
directly to the end &lt;br/&gt;user outside the mathematical community. The
project impacts &lt;br/&gt;a number of graduate students, including students
from &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;
