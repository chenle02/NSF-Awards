Structure of functorial compactification of&lt;br/&gt;moduli of abelian
varieties and their relatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will
continue to study the moduli of stable pairs with semiabelian group action and,
in particular, the part which gives the functorial compactification of the
moduli of abelian varieties. The aims are: to get a detailed description of the
structure of this space and the way the closure of the Schottky locus sits
inside of it; to study generalizations of this moduli space to the relative case
and to the case of other group actions. The methods employed are going to be
both algebro-geometric and combinatorial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is
in the field of algebraic geometry, but with a strong combinatorial aspect. The
main object of algebraic geometry is solutions of polynomial equations. Started
in the ancient times, in the 20th century it saw development of new and
enormously powerful methods. Its applications reach across the scientific
boundaries to such diverse fields as physics and cryptography. Combinatorics
concerns counting, and is the basis of most real-life applications of
mathematics. The grant will also support education and scientific training of
new PhD students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
