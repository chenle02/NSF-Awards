&lt;br/&gt;In the last 10 years, the field of genomics has made tremendous
progress, changing the way that basic research is conducted, attracting a new
generation of scientists to the field and contributing a wealth of new
information and knowledge with potential medical and agricultural applications.
In order to have the broadest impact, the large-scale, genome-wide data sets
generated must be released and made available to the research community in a
timely way. A two-day workshop entitled "The International Workshop on Rapid
Release of Pre-publication Data", organized by Genome Canada in partnership with
the National Institutes of Health-National Human Genome Research Institute (NIH-
NHGRI), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the UK Biotechnology and
Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the UK Wellcome Trust, will be
held May 12 - 13, 2009 at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel in Toronto (Canada). This
workshop will bring together 150 research scientists, generators of large-scale
data sets from human, plant and microbiome sources, database curators, funders
and journal editors from around the world to review the history, successes and
challenges of rapid, prepublication data release, to revisit the definition of a
"community resource project" and to discuss how to ensure that data of different
types produced by community resource projects continue to be made available
rapidly and in a manner that makes them maximally useful for scientific
research. Funds from the NSF will support 10 US scientists to participate in
this workshop. It is anticipated that the outcomes of the workshop will be
developed into a set of international guidelines for pre-publication release for
the major types of large-scale, genome-wide data sets being produced from
international human, microbiome, and plant community resource projects. A
perspective paper to publicize the workshop recommendations and guidelines will
be submitted for publication.
