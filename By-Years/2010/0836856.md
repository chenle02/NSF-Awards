The American Education Research Association (AERA) in conjunction with the
National Academy of Education (NAEd) will conduct a multidimensional study of
research doctorate programs in education to parallel the large-scale assessment
undertaken by the National Research Council (NRC) of 62 other fields. The NRC
declined to examine research doctorates in education. Education research is
among the largest doctorate-producing fields and the sole one dedicated to
understanding science and mathematics education, learning, literacy, and
performance. Yet there has been no comprehensive study of research doctorate
programs in this field nor has there been an assessment of the state of
education and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the NRC assessment, the AERA-
NAEd study assesses the characteristics and quality of education research
doctorate programs through (1) quantitative data based on questionnaires from
institutions, programs, faculty and students; and (2) faculty publication and
citation data and dissertation key words. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. will
undertake the fieldwork, data cleaning and database preparation. This is the
same organization that does the NRC survey, so results from this study can be
integrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
