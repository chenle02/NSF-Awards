Deformation/rigidity theory, initiated by Sorin Popa in the early 2000's, has
been extremely successful over the last decade in answering a number of
longstanding problems in von Neumann algebras and ergodic theory. The
juxtaposition between deformability properties such as Haagerup's property, free
products, or unbounded cocycles, with rigidity properties such as property (T)
or spectral gap allows one to discover hidden structure in a von Neumann algebra
where both types of phenomena occur. This has led to new insight into the
structural properties of these von Neumann algebras, and in turn has found
applications to other areas such as measured group theory, or the theory of
L2-invariants. The Principal Investigator will continue to investigate and
develop these ideas, focusing on their close connection to aspects of ergodic
theory.

Von Neumann algebras were introduced in the 1930's and 40's in part as a tool
for developing a mathematical foundation for quantum physics. Von Neumann
algebras have since become a field of independent interest with further
applications to areas of mathematics such as ergodic theory, Voiculescu's free
probability theory, Jones' theory of subfactors and planar algebras, knot
theory, and many others. The development of von Neumann algebras has also
historically been closely connected to the study of measurable dynamics and
these connections have recently begun to reemerge in the presence of newly
developed rigidity phenomenon. The investigation of this rigidity phenomenon has
since led to new connections between von Neumann algebras and other areas of
mathematics. Furthering the development of rigidity will in turn lead to new
insights and connections among these various fields.
