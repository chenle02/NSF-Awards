This study will investigate gender equity issues in four aspects of academic
employment: recruitment, academic rank, tenure, and salary. The purpose is to
measure gender "gaps" in these areas and to account for their severity with
variations in the organizational characteristics of academic institutions. The
framework is Zald's political economy theory. Sources for the data are the NSF-
sponsored 1989 Survey of Doctorate Recipients and supplementary information on
institutions from the CASPAR (Computer Aided Science Policy Analysis and
Research) data base. The PI will conduct secondary data analysis of career
outcomes for the science and engineering faculty in representative fields from
the natural and social sciences and engineering and analyze the recruitment of
entry level faculty initially.
