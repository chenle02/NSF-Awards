This research activity is a one week workshop on 'Asymptotic Analysis and
Numerical Solution of Nonlinear Differential Equations' to be held at Argonne
National Laboratory in March of 1990. The workshop will be devoted primarily to
nonlinear partial differential equations that, because of the occurrence of a
large or small parameter or critical parameter values, are amenable to
asymptotic analysis. Emphasis will be placed on equations that arise in the
context of nonlinear transport and diffusion phenomena. This research workshop
will focus on certain problems in applied analysis. The problems typically arise
in the modeling of physical phenomena. Examples are the modeling of fluid flow
with critical Reynolds number, flow through porous media, and combustion
phenomena. The goal of the workshop is to advance recent progress in the
synthesis of asymptotic analysis and the numerical solution of singular
perturbation problems.
