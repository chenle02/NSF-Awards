When a strong ocean current interacts with ocean bottom topography, eddies are
formed on the lee side. This proposal is to study the process of eddy generation
and decay by both steady and unsteady flows past topographic features. The PI
(Boyer) will simulate the effect of topographic interaction in rotating tank
experiments by moving the topographic obstacles relative to a stratified,
rotating fluid. Additionally, a numerical model will be run (Holland) using a
primitive equation formulation with 20 layers in the vertical. Results of the
laboratory and computer models will be used to predict the geophysical result of
the interactions in the ocean.
