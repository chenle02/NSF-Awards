This award provides support for the workshop on Fluid-Structure Interaction
Problems to be held at the National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS) in
Taiwan, May 26-29, 2011. The award will provide partial support for US
participants, principally graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and
junior faculty.

The fluid-structure interaction problems arise in a variety of important
applications in materials science, biological flows, and multi-phase flows among
others. The workshop includes plenary lectures by international speakers on
topics of current research interest in the area of fluid-structure interactions,
including modeling and analysis, the related theory and analysis of partial
differential equations, various numerical methods, and applications. It will
provide a venue for the discussion of important recent advances and the current
directions of research. The workshop encourages presentations by junior
participants. It will serve to expose new research opportunities to young
researchers and graduate students, and to facilitate the scientific
collaborations between US scientists and their international counterpart. NCTS
will support most of the expenses and logistics of the workshop.
