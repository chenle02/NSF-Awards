A Phase II program is proposed to complete the scientific research for a new
concept for the design of broad area (102 - 104 cm2), high energy electron guns.
This plasma electron (PE) gun uses a plasma, which is generated in a cold
cathode discharge, as the source of electrons. The electrons are extracted in an
array of beamlets which pass through a thin metal foil window, its support
structure and into air with minimum losses. The result is an innovative electron
gun concept which is expected to offer substantial benefits relative to existing
designs including higher electrical efficiency (>85%), higher operating voltages
(>400 kV) and lower cost (>$4/Watt). These attributes are critical for many
applications. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the basic
feasibility of the PE-gun concept using a small- scale, low energy device. The
Phase II objective is to complete the PE-gun research program by performing
experiments with a large-area device at high energy. This effort will consist of
five tasks culminating in the operation of an experimental 5 x 20 cm2, 400 kV
PE- gun at a beam power level of 2.4 kW. Success in Phase II will provide a firm
foundation for the development of commercial PE-gun systems in Phase III.
