Reflecting the improvement in parallel computer technology during the past
decade, parallel computing has emerged from the realm of graduate study into the
undergraduate curriculum at larger research universities. In 1991 the ACM/IEEE-
CS Joint Curriculum Task Force recommended the incorporation of several
knowledge units related to parallel computing into the curriculum of all
undergraduate computer science programs. Unfortunately, at many small colleges
and universities, computer science faculty members possess little experience in
parallel computing. To assist these computer science faculty in learning about
parallel computing, this project develops and implements two five-day parallel
computing workshops. The workshops accommodates one- hundred participants from
small academic institutions lacking faculty knowledgeable in the area of
parallel computing. The workshop's main objectives are to: provide participants
with sufficient knowledge and hands-on parallel programming experience so they
can incorporate parallel computing into their curriculum; provide participants
with educational materials to facilitate incorporation of parallel computing
into their curriculum; and establish electronic mail capability between all
participants and the project directory for exchange of ideas, technical support,
and results relating to parallel computing. After participants incorporate
parallel computing into their institution's curricula, these institution's
undergraduate computer science students will be better prepared for their
professional field. Additionally, educational materials developed for the
workshops will be published, and made available electronically by anonymous ftp.
This will assist other academic institutions interested in incorporating
parallel computing into their curricula, or hosting similar workshops.
