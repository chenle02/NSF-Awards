Proposal is for a 3-day Workshop, to be attended by the major researchers in
Discrete Event Dynamics Systems. It is impractical to obtain reviews from
persons who are knowledgeable but uninvolved. The DEDS area has been gradually
growing. Operations research problems in manufacturing systems have led to
System Theory models (such as markov decision processes) and larger areas of
application (communication protocols, e.g.). The work of several major figures
in Operation Research and System Theory can now be compared and unified
approaches synthesized. The goal of the Workshop, to provide future mission-
oriented research applications, will give it focus; the rapidly developing field
makes such a Workshop timely; and the Budget is realistic. In view of the
probable future impact of the Workshop on DEDS research, I recommend awarding
this proposal a grant in the amount requested.
