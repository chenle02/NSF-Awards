The University of Nebraska will undertake a project to create computer-based
chemistry lesson planning tools for use in secondary science methods courses.
The project will assemble a database of chemistry lessons and activities which
will be accessed through HyperCard for lesson planning. The lesson planning
tools will be created by merging existing databases, such as Doing Chemistry and
MicroScale, with contributions from secondary science methods teachers and
practicing high school chemistry teachers. The tools may be personalized and
adapted to individual teaching styles and approaches. CAI materials showing how
to use the tools for preservice secondary methods students will also be
developed. The software will be distributed free of cost to every secondary
science methods instructor in the United States. The cost sharing by the
university and other sources will be 38% of NSF's contribution.
