Abstract

Award: DMS-0707003 Principal Investigator: Arlie O. Petters

The goal of this research project is to develop a mathematical theory of the
shadow patterns cast in the cosmos by the action of gravity on light. The
project aims to characterize the pointwise total magnification and magnification
cross section functions of these shadow patterns, both in the geometric and wave
optics limits for certain key gravity models. This study requires a geometric
analysis of caustic singularities, diffraction integrals, and asymptotics in a
curved spacetime setting. The proposed research would lay a platform for
generalization a study of shadow patterns to arbitrary Lorentzian manifolds,
which in turn would lead to a new exploration in Lorentzian geometry. The
findings will also yield a detailed gravitational lensing comparison of current
key geometric gravity models like general relativity, PPN models, and braneworld
gravity, allowing for predictions that may test these gravity models.

Shadow patterns are all around us. We drive through them on the way to work and
swim among them in pools. Similar patterns are also cast throughout the universe
by the gravitational fields of stars, galaxies, black holes, dark matter, and
dark energy. Perhaps even more mysterious is that these shadow patterns are
connected with one of the profound questions about the nature of our physical
world -- namely, whether physical space has more than the familiar three spatial
dimensions of length, width, and height. This research will employ gravity's
cosmic shadow patterns to explore the nature of black holes and dark matter, and
the dimensionality of physical space. The work will also formulate predictions
that test Einstein's general theory of relativity and other gravity models. The
project is interdisciplinary and creates a synergistic interaction between
mathematics, physics, and astronomy.
