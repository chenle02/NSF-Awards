Drs. Williams and Dressler at the University of Florida and their colleagues in
Ecuador will study the interaction between Gongora orchid species and their
native pollinators, bees of the euglossine group. The study will include
analysis by gas- chromatography and mass-spectrometry of the chemistry of floral
fragrances emitted by the orchids, which serve as attracting cues for
pollinators. Field experiments in the tropics are designed to test whether
orchid species produce diagnostic floral fragrances that attract only particular
pollinating bees, or whether floral odors serve a "generalist" function,
attracting many different pollinators. The results will be important in
understanding the evolution of reproductive isolating barriers among orchid
species and in determining the range of chemical cues that orient insect
behaviors.
