9512191 York The proposed project requests a terabyte storage system from 35 to
100 terabyte capacity over a high performance network. The proposed system is a
high performance research infrastructure for high speed remote access to multi-
terabyte databases. It will be shared by scientists in several diverse
disciplines including research in climate studies, turbulence, cosmic ray air
showers, and x-ray crystallography with the advanced photon source. All these
tasks require terabyte databases. The proposed project is a collaboration
between the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, IBM, and
Ameritech. ***
