Databases power many of the largest and most commonly used Internet services and
applications in the world. Today, these systems are run in a distributed fashion
across multiple machines or even across data centers, driven by the growing
volumes of data and the growing scale of Internet services. The network
communication is becoming a severe bottleneck in distributed databases.
Recently, a new technology, SmartNIC, has been invented to add intelligence into
the network interface card (NIC) to reduce the computation overhead of host
processor. This new hardware device has great potential in accelerating
distributed database operations. The goal of this project is to explore
opportunities in this design space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will
develop SmartNIC-accelerated high performance distributed databases for both
online-analytical processing (OLAP) and online-transactional processing (OLTP)
workloads. The work can improve both on-premise and cloud distributed databases
and add significant value to society at large. The proposal work can potentially
be integrated into commercial distributed databases, leading to high performance
and low latency for internet services and applications which can bring benefits
to individual customers. The software developed through this project will be
incorporated into existing open source big data stacks and database
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
