The research is to study the application of fractal geometry to characterize
crack patterns formed on the fracture surfaces of cross-linked thermoset
polymers. Fracture experiments will be performed on a series of well
characterized resins (ranging from rubbery to brittle) and on non-Newtonian
fluids of varying viscosity. Numerical methods will then be developed for
analyzing pattern formation in these systems to better understand the physical
and chemical processes which contribute to the fracture behavior. The fractal
dimensions and other scaling exponents characterizing the geometrical and
topological features of the tree-like cracks will be analyzed to determine
whether there is a relationship between these exponents and the material
properties.
