ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0240787&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research
project, scientists at the University of Hawaii will study the rate of nitrous
oxide (N2O) formation in seawater and determine how production rate relates to
the release of N2O to the overlying atmosphere in the eastern tropical North
Pacific Ocean, the subarctic Pacific Ocean and in the Bering Sea. The
experiments will identify the relative importance of the microbiological
pathways by which N2O is produced in diverse marine environments. This study
will take advantage of several new analytical innovations to refine our
understanding of N2O cycling in the eastern tropical North Pacific and to extend
our knowledge of N2O sources and sinks to the subarctic Pacific and the Bering
Sea. The research team will take advantage of a rare opportunity to join
already-funded research cruises to explore large regions of the ocean that are
at once poorly understood but also very quantitatively significant in the
workings of the global nitrogen cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
