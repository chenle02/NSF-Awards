The Greater Washington Educational Telecommunications Association (WETA) in
partnership with BBC2 and the Open University, is producing ten half-hour
television programs that explore the reality of scientific discovery. In each
episode, five scientists who have been abandoned on a deserted island solve
science-based challenges using only their collective expertise, wits, the
island's resources and a few basic tools. In one episode, for instance, the
scientists will need to: 1) calculate their location with the exact latitude and
longitude, 2) create insect repellant, and 3) design and build a homemade radio.
The programs capture both the disappointments of experiments that go wrong as
well as the joy and excitement of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The television
series will be supported by "Rough Science Adventures," field experiences where
members of the public solve challenges similar to those facing the scientists in
the television program, and by a Rough Science website. Outreach partners
include the New York Hall of Science, the National Society of Black Engineers,
and the International Educational Technology Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
