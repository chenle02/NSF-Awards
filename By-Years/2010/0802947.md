The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the feasibility of
using cryomilling to deagglomerate highly sintered carbon nanotubes, as an
effective method of dispersing such nanotubes into polymer matrices. Cryomilling
of nanotubes is a simple and scalable process but it has the risk of damaging
the intrinsic properties of the nanotubes by interfering with pi-pi bonding
interactions responsible for their properties.

If successful, the proposed research will present a methodology for achieving
composites with well-dispersed nanotubes that can be tested for mechanical,
electrical and other essential properties for lightweight, high strength
structural applications.
