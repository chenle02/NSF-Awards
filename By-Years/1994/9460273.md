This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at a method
to significantly reduce the cost of fuel cells which are actively being
developed as the power source for electric vehicles. Specifically, this program
will demonstrate the practical application of inexpensive catalysts, containing
little or no noble metal, as H2-oxidation catalysts in a proton-exchange
membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The catalysts are intended to replace the costly Pt
anode catalysts, currently used in PEMFCs. Objectives of the Phase I program are
to demonstrate short-term stability of the catalysts, develop efficient
electrode structures for use with these catalysts, and evaluate the tolerance of
the catalysts to contaminants in the fuel stream. The program will culminate in
continuous operation of a 40-cm2 active area PEMFC containing the most promising
catalyst for a minimum of 200 hours. The development of inexpensive catalyst to
replace the Pt-based PEMFC anode catalysts would result in a significant
reduction in PEMFC cost, increasing the economic competitiveness of PEMFC-
powered vehicles with vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines.
