The long-term objective of this project is to predict the final, tertiary
structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence. Protein folding is the
final step in translating the genetic message encoded in the DNA into a
functional product. This structure is very specific: the mutation of a single
amino acid residue in one protein can cause transformation or eliminate
viability of an otherwise healthy cell. Although a very large number of protein
sequences have been determined, only several hundred protein structures have
been solved to atomic resolution. Because the three-dimensional structure of
most proteins is determined by the amino acid sequence, it must be possible to
predict this structure from the primary sequence. This award investigates
several unique approaches to this prediction problems: determination of protein
secondary structure using novel neural net and artificial intelligence
techniques, determination of the tertiary structure of omega loops based upon
amino acid rotamer libraries and constraints built into the structure of the
omega loops themselves, and prediction of hydrophobic core residues in proteins.
