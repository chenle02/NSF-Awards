In this project ("Heavy Atom Isotope Effect Studies of Organic Reaction
Mechanisms") in the Organic Chemical Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Arthur Fry in the Chemistry Department at the University of Arkansas,
Fayetteville, will study kinetic isotope effects in order to determine the
details of the paths (mechanisms) by which molecules react. This research
project utilizes heavy atom isotope effect studies in determining mechanistic
details for a variety of addition and elimination reactions. Specific reaction
systems on which carbon-14 isotope effect measurements and calculations are
being made are the Hofmann and Cope Elimination reactions, the solvolysis of
substituted alpha-phenylethyl compounds, the decomposition of brominated
cinnamic acids, the addition of arenesulfenyl chlorides to phenylethenes, and
the addition of dibromine to 1,2-diphenylethenes, cinnamic acid esters, and
phenylethynes. Correlation of experimentally measured and theoretically
calculated isotope effects will be used to determine details of transition state
structure, motion through the transition state, and the timing of bonding
changes in chemical reactions.
