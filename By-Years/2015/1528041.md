Organizations and companies often archive high volumes of versioned digital
datasets. There are research challenges and opportunities for developing
integrated archival and search support needed for data preservation, electronic
discovery, and regulatory compliance. Since versioned datasets contain highly
repetitive content, deduplication can reduce the storage demand by an order of
magnitude or more; however such an optimization is resource-intensive. After
deduplication, the structure of an inverted index for versioned data becomes
complex and it is expensive to search relevant results. This project will study
low-cost solutions for compact archiving and indexing and develop efficient
algorithms and systems techniques for searching versioned datasets. It will also
consider that the archived data can be stored in an untrusted server environment
and investigate tradeoffs in efficiency and privacy-preservation for search. The
developed solutions will bring significant computing and storage cost advantages
for application users involving large-scale versioned data management and
search. The developed software will be made public for research communities. The
research effort will be integrated with an educational plan containing research
mentoring, instruction improvement, and outreach
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be focused on studying key
challenges and cost-sensitive technical aspects in integrated archival and
search support for managing large versioned datasets. The main tasks include
efficient software architecture and optimization for detecting duplicated
content on a cloud cluster architecture, fast multi-phase search with a hybrid
index structure to exploit content similarity and query characteristics, and an
efficient privacy-preserving framework with top result ranking.
