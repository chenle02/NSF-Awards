The foci of this research are two-fold. First, a novel two stage process will be
developed for the preparation of carbon networks. The initial step involves
organization/orientation of polyvalent monomer units in a lattice. The second
step consists of polymerizing and crosslinking the monomers in their lattice
positions. Materials reminiscent of zeolites should result. The second area of
emphasis is on diamond film growth. Small organic substrates will be used to
probe hypothesized carbon incorporation mechanisms. With this renewal award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Ken S. Feldman of the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University.
Professor Feldman will focus his work on the design and synthesis of covalently
linked, periodic one-,two- and three-dimensional networks, composed mainly of
carbon. Theses systems have potential to address specific goals in separations
and catalysis technology. In addition, the mechanism of carbon incorporation
during Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) diamond film growth will be pursued. This
knowledge will provide a foundation from which subsequent studies on substrate
compatibility and film surface modification can be initiated.
