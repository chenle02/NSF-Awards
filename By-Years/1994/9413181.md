9413181 Goltz This award is being made through the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research program. It will involve the collection of perishable data on the use
of near real-time loss and damage data by the State of California in the
aftermath of the Northridge, California earthquake of January 17, 1994. The
study will examine how shaking intensity maps, estimates of casualties,
displaced individuals, and damage, all made available in the hours and days
after the event, were used by agencies of state government to direct emergency
response activities, plan for recovery, and to discuss cost sharing issues with
the federal government. This research will provide insight into the application
of new and rapid methods of loss estimation to disaster response and recovery
policy. ***
