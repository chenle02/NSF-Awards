This is a request from Claypoint Productions for 124,700 of a total budget of
$526,178 to produce a one-hour prime-time documentary program on the Wright
Brothers, the processes of science and engineering used in their work, and the
science and technology behind their development of the airplane. The PBS program
will cover the subjects of aerodynamics, aeronautics, geometry, algebra, applied
mathematics, mechanical engineering, the process of invention, and the history
of technology. A teacher's guide will be developed to supplement the film.
