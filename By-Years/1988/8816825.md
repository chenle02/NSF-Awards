This project will seek to upgrade and continue operation of the image
intensified monochromatic all sky auroral imager at South Pole Station. The
instrument is complementary to several others operating at South Pole, including
the new imaging riometer, the all sky camera, the keogram, the photometers and
the Fabry-Perot interferometer to be installed in 1989. The upgraded instrumnt
will have a four wavelength filter wheel which will allow direct calculation of
the particle energy input to the atmosphere. The primary data storage system is
a standard video recorder, which allows the review of an entire season's data in
just a few hours. This greatly facilitates the identification of auroral events
of interest.
