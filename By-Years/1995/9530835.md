This starter grant award to Northern Arizona University will support the
research of Professor Marin S. Robinson. The research examines the process by
which ice is a scavenger of oxidized and partially oxidized organic molecules
from the gas phase. Near-grazing angle reflection spectroscopy is used to
examine bulk and surface properties of hydrogen peroxide uptake onto water-ice
films representative of tropospheric ice clouds. Pure and doped films, as well
as films co-deposited with organic reagents, are studied. Gas phase oxidation
products are monitored using mass spectrometry. Condensed phase oxidation
products are monitored using Fourier transform infrared-reflection absorbance
spectroscopy. The results provide insights regarding the competition between gas
phase and condensed phase oxidation mechanisms. The research clarifies the role
ice plays as a tropospheric scavenger and aids in interpreting the complex
heterogeneous chemistry that takes place in aqueous cloud droplets.
