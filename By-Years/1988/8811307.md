Basement membranes are thin extracellular matrices which provide structural
support to endothelial and epithelial cells and which regulate the passage of
macromolecules into the underlying stroma. Evidence is accumulating that
implicates the basement membrane in maintenance of the differentiated state.
This appears to involve interactions between proteins in the basement membrane
and receptors on the surface of the overlying cells. Before these interactions
can be understood in detail, it is first necessary to understand more about the
macromolecules which make up the basement membrane and how these molecules are
organized and assembled extracellularly. Compositional and biosynthetic studies
will therefore be performed on basement membrane synthesized in vitro by bovine
corneal endothelial cells. The changes in rates of accumulation of three cell
adhesion proteins, fibronectin, laminin, and thrombospondin, in response to
growth factors and compositional modification of the basement membrane, will be
studied.
