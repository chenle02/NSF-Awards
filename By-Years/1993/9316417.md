9316417 McKinney In order to help connect macroevolutionary patterns to
ecological processes, PI will examine patterns of abundance in fossil
populations through a model that focuses on the patchy nature of the geographic
distribution of most populations. The model will be tested using benthic
foraminifera from a core of Paleogene strata from Georgia.
