9502977 Koberstein This investigates two new concepts to increase adhesion and
modify interfaces in immiscible polymer blends. The first concept uses
polydisperse block copolymers adsorbed at the blend interface to increase
interpenetration and entanglement of the copolymer into the homopolymer matrix.
The effects of polydispersity on the critical micelle concentration, the rate of
diffusion of the copolymer to the interface and the interfacial tension
reduction afforded by the copolymer will be investigated. The second concept
uses end-functional block copolymers as interfacial modifiers. The concept,
coined surface active adhesion promoters, is based upon the end-
functionalization of a surface active block copolymer. When the low energy block
adsorbs at the surface, it brings with it the end group, which lies just below
the surface. When contacted with a polar material, the end groups rearrange to
interact or react with the polar material, bridging the interface between the
matrix polymer and polar material, thereby acting as a surface active adhesion
promoter. %%% The control and polymer interfaces and surfaces will lead to rapid
advances in polymer blending, adhesives and coating technologies vital to the
science and technology base of US industry. ***
