Methane gas hydrates are ubiquitous in arctic regions and in continental margin
marine sediments. They are important archives of methane and are extremely
sensitive to changes in temperature and pressure, making them potentially
important in terms of assessing greenhouse gas emissions and continental margin
slope stability. This award facilitates the participation of graduate students,
postdocs and others in the four-day long inaugural Gordon Research Conference on
Natural Gas Hydrates at Colby College in Maine. The workshop brings together a
diverse group of scientists from academia, the government, and industry. It
focuses on building bonds between researchers in these different sectors and
provides a venue for them to discuss geochemical, geophysical, microbiological,
and hydrological issues related to natural gas hydrate formation and
destruction. Broader impacts of the work include increasing knowledge of a
potential important alternative energy resource and host mineral of a strong
greenhouse gas (methane). Special efforts will be made and funds are allocated
to increase the participation in the workshop of women and other groups under-
represented in the sciences.
