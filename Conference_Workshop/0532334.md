This proposal, SIAM Interdisciplinary Conferences in the Mathematical and
Computational Sciences, requests support for six conferences or workshops per
year and support for student and postdoctoral travel.

The objectives of this special meetings series are to provide an
interdisciplinary forum that enhances the understanding of advances in the
mathematical and computational sciences within and beyond the mathematical and
computational sciences community and to disseminate the results and findings of
the meetings via the SIAM website, in SIAM News, and in proceedings or reports,
as appropriate.
