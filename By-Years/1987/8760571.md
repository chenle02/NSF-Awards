This research is aimed at the development of an ultra low absorbance kinetic
photometer. A key problem in making low absorbance measurements is the random
noise generated in various system components such as photodetectors, and by
environmental effects such as airborne contamination and schlieren effects. The
proposed instrument will rely on wavelength modulation techniques to reduce the
impact of these error sources. The design goal is to develop an instrument that
will accurately measure kinetic absorbance changes as low as one microabsorbance
unit per second within 100 seconds. This would represent a major improvement
over existing instruments.
