This research project aims to advance the development of statistical methodology
and theory for analyzing nonstationary time series. A nonstationary time series
is a sequence of data points collected at successive time points with certain
aspects changing over time or being nonstationary. Nonstationary time series
appear very frequently in various scientific fields including economics,
engineering, environmental science, finance, and medical science among others.
Ignoring nonstationarity and dependence, two important features of nonstationary
time series, can lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, the research project
is expected to promote scientific research in not only statistics but also other
disciplines that involve the analysis of nonstationary time series. In order to
capture the temporal dynamics resulting from the nonstationarity, the parameters
are allowed to change over time and modeled as deterministic but unknown
functions of time, which are intrinsically infinite dimensional. To avoid
potential misspecifications of parametric models, nonparametric methods are used
to estimate and make inference about the underlying parameter functions. The
research to be performed involves parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and
variable selection for regression models with time-varying parameters. By
allowing a general class of nonstationary and dependent processes, the methods
to be developed and the asymptotic results to be established can be widely
applicable, and we are able to understand and quantify the effect of
nonstationarity and dependence on the asymptotic behavior of parameter
estimators and test statistics of interest.
