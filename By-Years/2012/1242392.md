The Biopolymers Gordon Research Conference (GRC) will focus on the fundamental
physico-chemical properties of biopolymers, including structure, folding
dynamics, stability, and interactions. The goal of the meeting is to convene
leaders in the field with students, postdocs and juniors scientist in a five day
conference that will discuss current state and future directions of research
efforts in biopolymers. The conference will advance our understanding of the
fundamental properties of biopolymers as related to their biological function
and will foster connections between physics, chemistry, chemical engineering,
computer science and biology. The 2012 Biopolymers GRC will specifically support
the participation of minorities and women.
