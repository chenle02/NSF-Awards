Through its scientific activities, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute
(MSRI) of Berkeley, California, seeks to strengthen U.S. research in the
mathematical sciences. MSRI works to develop innovative mathematical programs
and organizes and hosts a variety of working groups for mathematical scientists.
At any given time during the academic year, MSRI is home to leading researchers,
postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, who come from around the country
and the world in order to participate in semester-long research programs on
topics drawn from a broad spectrum of active areas in fundamental mathematics.
Programs catalyze new research collaborations and create connections for U.S.
mathematicians with leading researchers from around the world. In addition, MSRI
organizes and hosts many workshops each year that benefit the mathematics
community at large; subjects include mathematics education, recent breakthroughs
in various areas of the mathematical sciences, and graduate and undergraduate
training and research. As a result of these combined activities, approximately
2,000 mathematical scientists each year visit MSRI lectures. MSRI actively
promotes the diversity of the research population in the mathematical sciences.
Through public events and other outreach programs, the Institute also
contributes to the public's understanding of mathematics and its utility in
modern society, as well as appreciation of the inherent beauty of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term programs are organized around
subjects proposed by members of the mathematics research community that are then
developed with the advice and guidance of MSRI's Scientific Advisory Committee.
Programs involve a wide range of areas in mathematics, from number theory to
subjects connected to physics and computation. The Institute works to combine
fields and pair programs in ways that are often novel, lead to new connections,
and sometimes lead to the recognition of a new field. Each program features
introductory and research workshops, a Connections for Women workshop, seminars
and lectures, postdoctoral mentoring, and collaborative research among the
participants, with the goal of assimilating and expounding the latest results in
the area, stimulating new research and collaborations, and disseminating the
results, through traditional publication channels as well as video streaming.
Two-week Summer Graduate Schools introduce ideas and trends in mathematics that
broaden students' perspective and introduce them to future colleagues. Other
programs include Hot Topics Workshops, planned at short range, which complement
the long-term programs and their workshops, catalyzing research progress in
rapidly developing fields in the mathematical sciences.
