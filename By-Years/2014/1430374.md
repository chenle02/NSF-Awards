The objective of this EAGER grant is to investigate the feasibility and assess
the integrity of the implantable device design through computational simulations
and optimizing the design for a specific flow rate and delivery time. This
objective will be accomplished by implementing the following tasks: (i) Develop
design concepts and conduct computational simulations through nano-channel
arrays of varying length, height and width, and simulate the drug release
kinetics for several candidate drug molecules; and (ii) Optimize the design for
specific flow rate and delivery time. Based on the optimized design, a prototype
model will be explored. This approach of using computations and design
optimization for drug device design and integrity has never been examined for
AMD devices due to challenges in size and extended delivery
time.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;This project is a high-risk and
high payoff and will provide a fundamental understanding of the physical and
mechanical interactions through nano-channels of the drug delivery design and
will provide valuable scientific insights into integration characteristics and
implantable drug delivery devices. Investigating the design integrity and
integration of implantable devices for AMD such as the one proposed in this
EAGER project will help reduce the costs and risks associated with frequent
injections and promote delivering the drug in a controlled manner and in the
required amounts for treating AMD disease.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and develop a novel implantable drug
delivery device incorporating nano-channels with controlled drug kinetics and
delivery time for treating AMD, and thereby benefit society at large. This
project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with multidisciplinary
knowledge and training related to drug delivery devices, computational studies
and optimization. The research results will be integrated into courses the PI?s
teach in the ME and ECE curricula. The VCU School of engineering?s summer
enrichment programs will be expanded to include this project related work in
outreach activities with high school students.
