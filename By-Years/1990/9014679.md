Research is proposed on the properties of interfaces. Studies are to include
droplet spreading, pattern formation in chemical reactions at interfaces,
interfacial dynamics, the effect of wetting on fluid flow in small channels, the
coexistence of bulk phases and phases in confined geometries, and elastic
relaxation at interaces. Techniques to be employed include Monte Carlo and
molecular dynamic simulations of both continuum and lattice models, density
functionals, mean field theory, and the remonalization group.
