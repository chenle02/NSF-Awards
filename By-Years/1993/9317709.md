9317709 Sundaresan It was proposed to provide partial support to 12 professors
and students from U. S. to participate at the Fourth International Conference on
Circulating Fluid Beds, which will be held in Somerset, PA, during august 1-5,
1993. The meeting will bring together researchers from universities and
industry, almost in equal number. The exposure of university researchers to
operating experiences, industrial research needs, new applications and system
configurations is particularly useful because of the large gap currently
existing between applications and theory. The peer reviewed proceedings will be
distributed to the scientific and industrial community working in the field of
circulating fluid beds. The participants (4 professors and 8 graduate students)
to be partially supported from the NSF award are leading researchers or do
research in leading research groups. The exposure of eight graduate students to
industrial issues and international community will be beneficial to their
training and future carrier. ***
