This award supports the research of Professor D. Zeilberger to work in
combinatorics and special functions. He intends to work on the Macdonald
conjecture, the conjecture of Askey and Gessel on positivity of coefficients of
certain rational power series and that of Mills, Robbins, and Rumsey on
alternating sign matrices. The research is in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to
modern communications, for example the design of large networks as in telephone
systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
