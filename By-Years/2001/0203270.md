The focus of this project is the development of innovative library-quality
software and under- lying mathematics for dual active set techniques in
optimization.The dual active set algorithm (DASA)was .rst introduced in the
context of state constrained control problems,and later in the context of
constrained mathematical programs.For linear or quadratic programming,each step
of the algorithm is equivalent to solving a linear system of equations,and in
successive steps,there is a small rank change in the matrix corresponding to the
change in the active set.Numerical experience has shown that the dual active set
framework is an extremely e .cient approach for solving some broad classes of
optimization problems,including problems in optimal control and quadratic
network optimization.A version of the algorithm targeted to linear programming
has already solved some LPs that other state-of-the-art packages are unable to
solve.We will develop a variety of sparse matrix techniques,which have broad
applicability,and which provide,in par- ticular,the numerical foundation for
DASA.Each technique will be developed into library-quality software and made
widely available.These include:
