#: 0328802&lt;br/&gt;Title: Nonseparable Multiclass Learning for Object
Tracking&lt;br/&gt;PI: Shen, Xiaotong&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State Univ Res
Fdn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object tracking is an important technology of image and
video processing for many applications, including vision-guided automation,
automatic target identification, object-based video compression, and face
recognition. A fundamental tool that underlies the technology of object tracking
is machine classification. Recent developments of binary psi-learning allow us
to further achieve higher generalization accuracy for nonseparable and
multiclass cases. This proposal presents an interdisciplinary research plan to
address the problem of multiple object-tracking via this new learning tool. The
project will investigate how the accuracy of psi-learning can be maximized by
studying its generalization ability as well as methods for assessment. Specific
desired outcomes of the project are (a) creation of a stable foundation for psi-
learning and further development of learning theory, optimization theory, and
algorithms, and (b) specific development of mechanisms for object tracking and
extraction in multimedia compression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
is expected to have broad impacts to education, research, economy, and society
at large. In particular, the technology developed in this project is widely
applicable to scientific and engineering frontiers, including face-recognition,
target identification, and cancer genomics classification. Plans for technology
transfer are proposed to benefit the economy. The proposed educational program
will train students in an interdisciplinary area of statistics and electrical
engineering. Success of this project will bring tremendous benefits to
fundamental scientific research, high-performance computing, and information
technology, and have significant broad impacts to society at
large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
