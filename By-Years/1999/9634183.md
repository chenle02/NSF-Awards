9634183 Perez-Luna This project will examine the implications of the
intersection of art, science, and technology as revealed by the events occurring
around the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the first general
electronic computer, ENIAC-50. The finished product will be radio programming
and audio material that presents the coming together of scientists, artists, and
other participants in Philadelphia. It will build on the previous research and
explorations in both of these fields toward finding commonalties and ways in
which each has influenced the other. The finished product will be broadcast for
the general public and also can be made available to scientists and educators in
the field as resource material for courses, seminars, and lectures as they
explore the intersections of science and art and implications this has for
research and education.
