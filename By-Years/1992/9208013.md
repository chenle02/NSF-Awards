Professor Smedley will measure energy transfer between excited atoms using
time- and wavelength-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission profiles
will reveal the delicate interplay between collisional and light field
interaction when atoms absorb light energy in the presence of perturbing
partners. This project will be carried out within the context of the RUI
(Research at Undergraduate Institutions) program and will expose several
undergraduates to a physics research environment.
