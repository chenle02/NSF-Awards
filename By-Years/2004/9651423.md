The Mathematics Department has been actively involved since 1988 in a serious
and successful program to improve instruction, understanding, and retention for
women and minority students in its calculus courses. Mathematics students use
computer technology in collaborative teams to create portfolios of challenging
projects. Science classes, as well as mathematics classes, have been using this
calculus laboratory to create portfolios of challenging projects. This project
provides 40 laptop computers (20 to the Mathematics Department and 20 to the
Science Department)and 100 TI-92 calculators (40 to the Mathematics Department,
40 to the Science Department, and 20 to the Mathematics Laboratory). These
laboratory capabilities will create an educational environment that emphasizes
the interconnection of all fields of scientific knowledge in order to prepare
students more effectively for the scientific environment of the future.
