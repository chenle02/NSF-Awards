9720170 Landau, David P. University of Georgia Acquisition of a Symmetric
Multiprocessor Scientific Computer System The University of Georgia is upgrading
its parallel scientific computing facility to a 24-node Silicon Graphics Origin
2000 High Performance Computer System to advance a multidisciplinary activity in
intelligent multiscale scientific simulations. This platform has the flexibility
to run several jobs at once in mixed configurations and will allow a user to run
programs requiring distributed memory processing. Research areas to be supported
range from parallel computing, artificial intelligence, optimization and
interoperability issues, scalable parallel algorithm design for nuclear physics,
fluid flow modeling, materials simulation, molecular modeling, quantum
chemistry, polymer modeling, and geological modeling. The proposed computing
facility will allow the University to continue and expand its educational
programs in computational sciences. In addition to graduate students
participating in the research projects described in the proposal, existing
undergraduate and graduate courses in computational physics, biology, simulation
methods, and business process modeling will utilize the proposed facility.
