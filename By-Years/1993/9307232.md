The objective of the proposed investigation is to address fundamental issues
related to the cooling of high temperature, high heat flux surfaces by liquid
jet impingement. In recent years such cooling methods have been widely used in
the processing of primary metals such as steel and aluminum. Of concern is the
delineation of regions associated with single phase forced convection, forced
convection nucleate boiling, and film boiling on a heated plate exposed to a
single jet of an array of jets. Local heat transfer measurements will be used to
determine convection coefficients in single and two- phase flow regimes.
Parameters to be studied include hydrodynamic and geometrical features of the
jet and jev arrays. To assess the applicability of basic results inferred from
laboratory studies, models that use laboratory-generated data to predict the
thermal response of strip steel under mill conditions will be developed, and
predictions will be compared to mill data provided by the steel industry.
