The Works Projects Administration funded numerous archaeological projects in
the 1930s. These projects abruptly stopped with the start of World War II. The
result is that materials from surveys and excavations were never properly
catalogued, inventoried, or stored. The resulting disorganization makes them
extremely difficult to use. The Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory of the
University of Texas seeks to improve the research accessibility and scientific
usefulness of the archaeological collections and documents generated by the
WPA.University of Texas projects of 1937 to 1941. The staff will reinventory,
systematize and rehouse the collections, inventory and cross.index the
accompanying fieldnotes and documents, and produce a computer based inventory
and data file for researchers. The WPA projects are extremely important for
Plains archaeology. These collections provided much of the empirical foundation
for the development of scinetific archaeology in Texas.
