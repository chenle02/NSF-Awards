9514190 Kisslinger We propose to initiate new collaborations between nuclear
theorists at several Chinese institutions and those at Carnegie Mellon
University. These new projects in medium energy nuclear/particle physics are
based in part on fruitful collaborations during the past decade. One of the main
efforts is the study of the quark structure of hadrons and nuclei, which will
give important insight into the nature of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the
theory of strong interactions. This research will also include research on
nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hyperon interactions based on quark/gluon
interactions. The methods of QCD sum rules will be used to help develop models
consistent with QCD theory. Another effort will be the study of the
modifications of hadronic properties and interactions in nuclear matter. This
research will include studies of nucleon nucleon scattering in heavy ion
collisions as well as the modification of hadronic masses ans coupling
constants. The method of QCD sum rules will also be used here when applicable.
This collaboration is supported under the U.S.-China Cooperative Research
Program.
