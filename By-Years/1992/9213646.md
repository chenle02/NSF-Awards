It is proposed to develop on apparatus for characterization of compressible
filter cakes, and to perform a comprehensive research program on it. Professor
G. Chase and a graduate student of the University of Akron will spend two months
at Eastman Chemical laboratory to set up the experimental facility in
collaboration with J. Kanel of Eastman Chemical Co. Experiments will be run in
parallel at the Eastman Chemical Co. and at the University of Akron, where a
second apparatus will be assembled for the undergraduate laboratory. It is
expected that this project will provide useful scientific and applied results,
as well as the basis for a long-term relationship between the respective
university and industry. The main output from the proposed apparatus will be
results on the cake resistance and local cake porosity, which can be used as
reference for model development, and testing data in industry. The involvement
of graduate and undergraduate students will be another benefit of this
collaboration. The proposed project will accomplish well the goals of the
"Engineering Faculty Internships Initiative". Matching funds are provide by
Eastman Chemical Co. ($16,947) and the University of Akron ($3,800).
