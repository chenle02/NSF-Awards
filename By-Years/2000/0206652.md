A grant has been awarded to Dr. Robert Jansen and Mr. Timothy Chumley at the
University of Texas at Austin to research the biogeographic and evolutionary
history of the plant genus Menodora in the olive family. It has an unusual
distribution in the temperate arid regions of North America, South America and
southern Africa, and is most closely related to the economically important
jasmines, a group strictly of the Old World. There have been relatively few
studies of the biotic connection between Africa and North America, and most of
these have focused on tropical rather than temperate disjunctions. The small
number of species and lack of ecological diversity make Menodora an excellent
system for examining questions of the geographic spread, divergence, and
radiation of species across continental scales. In attempting to determine the
origins and geographic history of the genus, it is also necessary to understand
the historical relationships of its species. This is complicated by the
possibility that morphological similarity between species may be the result of
ecological selection rather than shared ancestry. In some cases as well, species
boundaries are by no means clear. The goals of this study are to: 1) examine
relationships within Menodora using morphological and DNA sequence data, 2)
explore hypotheses of its origin and biogeography, and 3) produce a new
classification of its species and a monograph. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study
will add substantially to the body of knowledge of an economically important
plant family, and provide a base for future work in that group. The study of
disjunction in Menodora will provide new insights into the relationship of the
temperate floras of the New World and Africa. These insights may serve to
identify biogeographic patterns that are shared with larger, more diverse groups
or groups at higher taxonomic levels that present less tractable
problems.&lt;br/&gt;
