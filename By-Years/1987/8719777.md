During the summer of 1984 a thunderstorm experiment was conducted near Langmuir
Laboratory, New Mexico Institute of Mines and Technology in central New Mexico.
One primary objective of this field experiment was to understand thunderstorm
electrification. Presently the cloud charging mechanisms and the relative
importance of different currents in reducing the electrical energy of
thunderstorms are not well understood. Professor Marshall made electric charge
measurements by releasing instrumented balloons through the thunderclouds.
Preliminary work indicates that falling precipitation creates a substantial
electric current inside the sampled thunderclouds. Under this grant Professor
Marshall will continue analyzing the electric field soundings collected during
the New Mexico experiment. His results, together with Doppler radar analyses of
the thunderstorms carried out by other participating scientists, should improve
our understanding of thunderstorm electrification.
