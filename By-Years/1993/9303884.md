9303884 Vanyo The PI will measure liquid motions in a filled oblate spheroid
having the Earth's core-mantle boundary ellipticity during spin and precession
scaled to the luni-solar induced precession of the mantle. Experimental
techniques will trace interior (3-D) flows and surface secondary flows due to
Ekman layer pumping. Instabilities and development of turbulence will be
delineated. An equivalent diameter sphere will also be developed to approximate
the observed flows, and the resulting data will be compared to buoyancy induced
convection and to analytical geodynamo requirements. ****
