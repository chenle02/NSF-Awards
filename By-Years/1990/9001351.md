Acquiring a transmission electron microscope would greatly strengthen research
opportunities in cell, molecular, and developmental biology at Wright State
University. Students taking our research-oriented course in electron microscopy
or doing a research project using electron microscopy will have the opportunity
to use modern equipment that is flexible, reliable, and comparable to facilities
available in commercial laboratories or major research institutions nationwide.
Specific research opportunities for undergraduates include the projects outlined
in this proposal: (1) the influence of gravity on plant growth and development,
(2) cuticular and gut ultrastructure of Sarcoptes scabiei from susceptible and
resistant hosts, (3) growth and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, (4)
morphological adaptation of avian osmoregulatory organs to changing
physiological demands, and (5) secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in
the central nervous system.
