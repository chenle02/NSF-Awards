Computerized educational software holds promise as a supplemental means of
providing individualized instruction. The Phase I Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) study established the technical basis for proceeding with the
Phase II research by demonstrating that it is possible to develop a working game
that entails the combination of a well-designed intelligent tutoring system
rooted in cognitive psychology with a game format. The objectives of the Phase
II research focus on (1) filling in and experimentally testing the Phase I
Intelligent Tutoring Game (ITG) framework in order to provide feedback as to the
soundness of the teaching concepts upon which the framework of the project is
based; and (2) developing and experimentally testing a full-scale ITG for middle
school probability and statistics/scientific reasoning in order to assess the
soundness of implementing the instructional approach of the project in an ITG
format. The project aims to provide the students using the software with the
benefits of individualized instruction in a game environment that maintains
student interest and enthusiasm. While there exist games that are poor tutors
and tutors that are poor games, i.e., they are no fun, the proposed project
would fill this gap by developing a research-based framework to develop tutors
that excel both from instructional and enjoyment perspectives.
