The Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) is the leading international conference
in the science and technology of LTP (Low Temperature Plasmas) combined with
collision physics (CP). The conference has been the venue of the first
presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTP and CP
topics including advanced combustion systems, lighting and lasers, plasma
materials processing of relevance to the semiconductor and photovoltaics
industry, and plasma application in biomedicine. The invited speakers represent
the world's leading scientists in these fields. The future of any field depends
upon attracting bright young people. The GEC has a strong tradition of
encouraging and promoting student participation. The GEC has an enviable
reputation of being the first conference that many of the leading members of the
community presented their first research results as graduate students. This
award pays partial travel support for PhD students to attend and present the
results of their work at the meeting.

The intellectual merits of this proposal include the opportunity for peer to
peer collaboration with researchers from around the world. The GEC, being a
moderate size conference of approximately 400 attendees, presents an environment
where not only are new discoveries shared among peers, but collaborate research
efforts and future endeavors are often initiated.

The broader impacts of this proposal include the opportunity for young
scientists to attend one of the preeminent conferences in their field. They will
have the opportunity to observe first-hand the scientific and cultural diversity
of the field, and establish what will hopefully be career long collaborations
with their international counterparts. The GEC makes a special effort to support
graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities.
