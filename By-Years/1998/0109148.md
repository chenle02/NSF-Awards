Webb&lt;br/&gt;0190148&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies differential equation
models of&lt;br/&gt;structured populations. The structured models arise
in&lt;br/&gt;considering four applications: (1) models of tumor
cords&lt;br/&gt;structured by the cell cycle, (2) models of blood cell
production&lt;br/&gt;systems with proliferating and quiescent compartments
structured&lt;br/&gt;by cell maturity, (3) models of replicating prion
populations&lt;br/&gt;structured by polymer length, and (4) models
of&lt;br/&gt;vancomycin-resistant enterococci epidemics in dialysis
clinics&lt;br/&gt;structured by the time since patient admission.&lt;br/&gt;
This project applies theoretical mathematics to biological&lt;br/&gt;and medical
research involving population interactions. The&lt;br/&gt;specific goals are to
identify the behavior of proliferating and&lt;br/&gt;quiescent cell populations
in the micro-architecture of&lt;br/&gt;vascularized tumors, to differentiate,
qualitatively and&lt;br/&gt;quantitatively, the development of normal and
abnormal blood cell&lt;br/&gt;population lines, to evaluate hypothetical
mechanisms involved in&lt;br/&gt;the polymerization processes of prion
population growth in&lt;br/&gt;transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (mad
cow disease), and&lt;br/&gt;to predict the epidemiological effects in dialysis
clinics of&lt;br/&gt;health care worker hygiene, patient-health care worker
ratios,&lt;br/&gt;and screening of temporarily absent patients. Benefits
to&lt;br/&gt;society are the project's contributions to the
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of biological and health
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
