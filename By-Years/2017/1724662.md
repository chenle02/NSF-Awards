The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from the
fact that pharmaceuticals and herbicides have been detected in some water
supplies at concentrations that may have the potential to affect human biology.
Furthermore, these contaminants continue to accumulate. Current water bottlers
and home filtration systems do not typically remove these chemicals, and the
approaches that do sufficiently purify water are expensive and generate large
volumes of polluted water as a by-product. There is a significant opportunity
for safe, inexpensive, and easily used method to purify water. The innovation is
expected to be eventually developed as inexpensive, reusable water filters for
home, civic, and commercial use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will
evaluate the commercialization potential of materials developed in the lab that
specifically bind and remove pharmaceutical and herbicide contaminants from
water. The material has a unique ability to be functionalized with active
proteins by gene fusion, without compromising either materials assembly or the
activity of the added protein. These functionalized protein-based materials can
specifically remove bioactive contaminants and pharmaceuticals from water. By
adding new ligand binding proteins to these materials, the filters developed in
this work can be readily adapted to bind a wide variety of chemicals and even
toxins with very high affinity and specificity.
