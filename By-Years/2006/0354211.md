This proposal for theoretical and computational work has two components, both
related&lt;br/&gt;to the properties of cold atoms. The goal of the first part is
to extend our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of phase correlations in Bose condensates
at zero temperature to double (and eventually&lt;br/&gt;multiple) well
configurations. The objective is to learn to what extent phase correlation
persists&lt;br/&gt;through a barrier, as a function of barrier height, atom
number, and interactions. &lt;br/&gt;The second part addresses a bottleneck in
attempts to produce electronically, vibrationally,&lt;br/&gt;rotationally and
translationally cold molecules by starting with cold atoms.
Namely,&lt;br/&gt;even if the multiple lasers can be assembled and stabilized,
the intermediate frequencies are&lt;br/&gt;not known for many alkali diatomics
because the molecular structure, being highly perturbed,&lt;br/&gt;has not been
analyzed. RbCs is of especial interest because both atoms can
be&lt;br/&gt;efficiently cooled with laser light, and because there are
presently efforts at Yale to produce&lt;br/&gt;ultracold ground state RbCs
molecules. We have assisted in this effort by providing&lt;br/&gt;information on
the lowest excited states from our recent analysis of RbCs spectral
data.&lt;br/&gt;
