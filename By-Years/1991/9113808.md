Two broad topics will be investigated - the synthesis of highly reduced carbene
complexes of transition metals in negative oxidation states, and pericyclic
reactions of reductively activated aromatic ligands. The principal objective of
the studies is to answer three broad questions: 1) What range of pi-acceptor
ligands is capable of stabilizing complexes of metals in negative oxidation
states?, 2) How wide is the range of accessible complexes for those classes of
ligands which do prove to be capable of stabilizing negative oxidation states?,
and 3) Will pi-back-donation of electron density from highly reduced metal
centers to the (typically unsaturated) pi-acceptor ligands activate the ligands
towards electrophiles, coupling reactions, or other unprecedented reactivity
modes? An important secondary objective is the development of new reactions with
potential applications in organic synthesis. %%% In this project in the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Program of the Chemistry Division,
Dr. N. John Cooper of the University of Pittsburgh will synthesize and study the
reactivity of complexes containing transition metals in negative oxidation
states. These very unusual and highly reactive compounds may have applications
in organic synthesis.
