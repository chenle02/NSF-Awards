9405507 Lindgren An experimental program will be carried out at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory's Laser Electron Gamma Source using high energy polarized
photons. The emission of correlated pion and nucleons, and nucleon pairs, will
be used to explore the pion production mechanism and short range nucleon-nucleon
correlations. The polarization degree of freedom provides enhanced sensitivity
to exchange currents and other short-range phenomena. New tests of theory will
be afforded. ***
