Avramov is investigating problems arising at the boundary of algebra, algebraic
geometry, and algebraic topology. The basic objects of study are homological
invariants of commutative noetherian rings that reflect geometric propertied of
algebraic varieties. Special attention will be focused on the geometric meaning
of the vanishing of Hochschild cohomology, on it finite generation as an
algebra, and on the vanishing of Andre-Quillen homology. Asymptotic vanishing of
classical homology and cohomology over complete intersections will be studied by
geometric methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project in the areas of
mathematics known as Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. Commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of as studying solutions of many
equatons in many unknowns when, typically, the solution is not unique. The set
of solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but it is often best encoded into
a family of functions defined on this set. The abstract version of such families
of functions are called commutative rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
