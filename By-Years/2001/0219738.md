Continuing support via the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will permit U.S.
ocean scientists in the academic research community to participate in specific
activities of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)
and the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR). These activities are
of particular interest to the ocean sciences community and the National Science
Foundation. ICES is an intergovernmental organization that coordinates data and
information exchange regarding scientific research, management of fisheries,
environmental monitoring, and oceanographic research matters that are of common
interest to countries bordering the North Atlantic. SCOR serves primarily as an
organization to facilitate international collaboration of ocean research through
the formation of working groups and publication of findings on various marine
topics. Under this award U.S. academic research scientists will participate in
selected ICES and SCOR activities in 2002-2004.&lt;br/&gt;
