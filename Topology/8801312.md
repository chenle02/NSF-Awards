F. Thomas Farrell, in collaboration with L. E. Jones (of S.U.N.Y. at Stony
Brook), hopes to make surgery theory a reasonable method for calculating the
homotopy-topological structure set of a compact manifold M provided its
fundamental group is a matrix group and the dimension of M is greater than 4.
(Stronger constraints on the fundamental group may be necessary; e.g., that it
is torsion-free and is an arithmetic subgroup of a semi-simple algebraic group
defined over the rationals.) A second (and related) problem is to make
Waldhausen's work the basis of a reasonable method for calculating.
