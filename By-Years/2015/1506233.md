It is well known that nuclei are made from protons and neutrons. In heavy
nuclei, there are more neutrons than protons, and this gives rise to the
theoretical prediction that heavy nuclei have an outer "skin" of neutrons.
Measurements of the neutron excess in heavy nuclei also have applications to
astrophysics, where objects called neutron stars are known to exist. The
thickness of the neutron skin for heavy nuclei bears directly on the theoretical
calculations of neutron matter and hence the composition of neutron stars. This
award will support research on an experiment that will directly measure the
neutron skin thickness, which is poorly known today, with high enough precision
to test different theoretical models of neutron matter. A significant fraction
of the research will involve undergraduate students from the Temple University
community, accompanied by a recruitment effort that seeks to attract students
who wish to remain in the city as science teachers.

This experiment relies on a large collaboration of physicists from a number of
universities, as well as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.
Each group plays its part for a successful measurement, and this award supports
a specific effort to precisely measure the polarization of the electron beam.
This is the fraction of electrons, given one beam setting or another, with spins
pointed in one direction as opposed to the other. The goal is to determine the
polarization to about 1% accuracy, and this requires careful attention to a
number of different details. For example, the technique involves precision
determinations of magnetization of thin iron foils in high magnetic fields.
