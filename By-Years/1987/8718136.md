The objective of this research is to probe the mobility of polymers at well-
characterized single solid surfaces. By measuring the kinetics with which
polymers first adsorb to a surface and then exchange with labelled polymers
originally in free solution, we will seek to understand the characteristic rates
and mechanism of mobility of polymers in thin interfacial regions. Experimental
variables of interest will include molecular weight, solvent quality, solution
concentration, and polymer topology. The self-exchange of polymers with the same
number of segments will be a special concern. The method of investigation is
infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection. The results will be
correlated with modern physical theories of polymer behavior, and may find
application in chromatography, colloidal stability and flocculation,
lubrication, and film formation.
