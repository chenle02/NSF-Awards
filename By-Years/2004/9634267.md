*** 9634267 Daughton This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will demonstrate the integration of Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR)
isolation devices with control and power electronics, which will result in a
high performance integrated solid state relay (SSR). Current SSR technology
suffers from several technical drawbacks, including large relative size, slow
switching speeds, and wear-out mechanisms due mainly to the technical
limitations of opto-isolation technology. Opto-isolation construction precludes
integration with power electronics, due to integrated circuit (IC) process
incompatibility, is relatively slow, and can wear-out through light-emitting
diode (LED) failure. In addition to demonstrating a fully integrated device,
Phase II will concentrate on power electronics research with the objective of
reducing the relative size of the device for a given power level. Phase II will
continue the successful hybrid demonstrations of Phase 1. The emphasis of Phase
II will be on low voltage solid state relays having blocking voltages of less
than 60 volts and on-current capacities of 1 ampere or less. In addition,
various contact resistance devices under 1 ohm will be pursued. Commercial
applications are expected in SSR, opto-isolator, and reed switch replacements
for the computer, telecommunications, consumer electronics, and automotive
industries.The complete integration of GMR-isolation, control, and optimized
power electronics will allow the design of GMR-isolated SSRs which would be
smaller, faster, and more reliable than existing opto-isolated SSRs, thus
allowing SSRs to function in applications presently not suitable. ***
