This project focuses on the fundamental challenges of modeling, analysis and
computation for nonlinear models in applied sciences involving hyperbolic
balance laws, kinetic models, and mixtures of simple and complex fluids. The
project has two primary components: (a) The investigation of complex flows with
emphasis on fluid-particle interaction models and polymeric fluids. Issues to be
addressed include large-data existence theory for physical systems, issues of
stability and asymptotic analysis, hydrodynamic and diffusive limits as well as
aspects of regularity. (b) The investigation of multidimensional systems with
focus on hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and models of compressible
fluids with dispersive effects. Issues to be addressed include large-data well-
posedness theory for physical systems, the investigation of the structure of
solutions as well as the analysis of singular limits.

Advances in this interdisciplinary research will rely substantially on the
development of new analytical techniques in nonlinear partial differential
equations. Analytical and numerical methods in this field have developed
together; analytical understanding contributes to the construction of accurate
and efficient numerical schemes, while numerical experiments often lead the
theoretical analysis. Progress in this research program will contribute to the
successful investigation of a wide variety of important physical systems arising
in biology and materials science as well as to the design of high performance
computational algorithms. Furthermore, this project will contribute to the
development of the scientific workforce by providing mentoring and advanced
training for young researchers and by organizing a framework for
interdisciplinary interactions with researchers from related fields.
