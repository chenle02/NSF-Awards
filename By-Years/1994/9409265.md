9409265 Anderson Research will be carried out in nucleon and nuclear structure
via electron and proton induced reactions. Polarization transfer in neutron-
proton charge exchange reactions will be used to probe the medium effects on the
nucleon-nucleon potential. The charge- structure of the neutron will be probed
in polarization transfer studies of electron-induced neutron knockout reactions.
A high- efficiency neutron polarimeter will be assembled and calibrated for
these purposes. The charge exchange reactions will be carried out at the Indiana
University Cyclotron Facility, while measurements of the neutron's charge
structure will be carried out at the MIT/Bates lab and at CEBAF. Other related
experiments will also be carried out at these laboratories. ***
