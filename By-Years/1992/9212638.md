The implementation phase of STEP is beginning to take shape on a wide
international scale. Satellites AKEBONO, SOLAR-A, and UARS are in orbit, and
major national programs, such as CANOPUS (Canada) and CEDAR, GEM, MAX-91 (USA)
are in place. Community services such as the US STEP Newsletter and Japan's STEP
Simulation Promotion Office are beginning to play a crucial role in
communications and scholarly exchange. Recognizing the importance of STEP and
the need to assure participation of all space missions, the International
Council of Scientific Unions recently extended the formal duration of STEP until
1997. In view of the increased demands for international coordination, and to
assure continuity of the operations, the Bureau of the Scientific Committee of
Solar-Terrestrial Physics recently appointed the Principal Investigator to
another year in his functions as the International STEP Coordinator. Support is
requested to enable the PI to continue his tasks in that capacity. His continued
participation will be of benefit to the STEP scientists in the United States,
because through his office, a close link to the international STEP-related
information and activities will be assured.
