This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test the
feasibility of a new production technology for affordable near-net shape
components of a class of advanced refractory metal intermetallic composites.
Niobium (Nb)-based intermetallics will permit a revolutionary increase in
operating temperatures for many very high temperature applications. Phase I will
employ an innovative reactive metal investment casting method to create a cost-
effective and robust process for manufacturing complex shapes. Phase II would
explore strategies for producing actual components.

Anticipated commercial applications are those at very high temperatures, such as
turbine airfoils now made of single crystal nickel-based superalloys.
Unprecedented levels of fuel efficiency and thrust-to-weight ratio are expected
for future aircraft systems.
