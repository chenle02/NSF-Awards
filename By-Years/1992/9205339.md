Concomitant with the decline of established manufacturing regions in the U.S.
has been a rise in both output and employment in service industries. Of these
producer services, the financial service industries have undergone substantial
change as a result of intensified competition, domestic deregulation, and
technical change. Financial services are important employers, and they influence
the competitiveness of most other industries by virtue of their control over the
money supply and the credit system. As world financial markets have become more
international, the coordination and control of financial flows is concentrating
in a few select centers of banking and commercial capital. After London, Tokyo,
and New York, Los Angeles has risen to a position as the financial center of the
west coast in terms of employment, assets, deposits, and loan activity. This
research investigates how the restructuring of financial services since 1970 has
affected the demand for, and the composition of, labor in Los Angeles. The
research will link changes in forms of competition and regulation, technical
change, and industrial organization with changing employment strategies in
commercial banking. Analysis of secondary data will be complemented by semi-
structured interviews with senior bank management in order to establish how
commercial banks reorganize their internal and external operations to remain
competitive, to uncover the strategies they use to restructure labor and lower
costs, and to determine whether restructuring affects different labor pools in
terms of wages, hours worked, turnover, and job security. An examination of
changing employment practices in commercial banking will extent an understanding
of how industrial restructuring affects different groups of labor. It will also
inform broader theoretical and policy debates about the growth of tertiary
employment in the face of a decline in manufacturing employment in U.S. cities.
