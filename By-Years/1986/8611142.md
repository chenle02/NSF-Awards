This travel grant supports international travel for invited participants form
the USA to participate in the International Symposium and workshop on the local
approach of fracture. The Symposium addresses several areas of high priority
research in fracture mechanics, including analytical and numerical aspects of
fracture initiation and propagation. The program on local appraoches of fracture
that are based on micro-mechanical models and continuum damage models will be
discussed at this meeting.
