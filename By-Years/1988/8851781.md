This project utilizes a laboratory with graphics capabilities to display the
effects of algorithms on data structures. Using animation, data structures are
displayed as they are manipulated by algorithms so that students may understand
the data structures and algorithms from a conceptual level apart from their
representation in a particular language. The algorithm visualization laboratory
has six (6) Macintosh II microcomputers participating in a local Appletalk
network. One of the six systems serves as a gateway to an Ethernet network
linking the Macintosh II's to the University's VAX 11-780 and MicroVAX. Most
algorithm software development is done on the MicroVAX and then transmitted to
the Macintosh computers for graphic display. The lab uses an overhead projection
system capable of presenting an interactive Macintosh session on a large screen.
Real-time display allows the instructor to demonstrate concepts of algorithm
performance and it allows students to experiment with algorithms and data
structures on an individual basis - they learn about algorithms by watching them
perform. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
