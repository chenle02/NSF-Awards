This project supports a two week Summer Institute on Advanced Computing at the
San Diego Supercomputer Center. Twenty students will attend with selection based
on peer review of applications. Additional industrial participants will be
included on a fee basis. The Institute will consist of lectures and workstation
sessions, commencing with lectures on supercomputing basics and progressing to
advanced topics. Special emphasis will be placed on advanced computing
techniques. Students will learn and practice varied techniques including
vectorization, optimization and multitasking on projects related to their
personal research interests. Each student will be conducted by SDSC faculty and
experienced consultants will assist the students in their research programs.
