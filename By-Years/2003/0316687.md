The role of sexual selection in the loss of a sexually selected male trait Molly
R. Morris

The role of sexual selection (female mating preferences and male-male
competition for mates) in producing exaggerated or conspicuous male traits has
been well documented, and yet recent comparisons of closely related species have
suggested that loss of these male traits may be more common than gains. This
project examines the roles of both male-male competition and female choice in
the loss of the pigment pattern "vertical bars" found across several species of
Xiphophorus fishes. By comparing the responses of males and female to the bars
in closely related species it will be possible to determine when the bars were
lost in relation to the loss of female preference and male response. The
reliability of comparative studies ultimately depends on the reliability of the
information about the relationships among the species. Therefore, this project
will resolve the relationships within this group of fishes by comparing
extensive DNA sequence data for all 22 species of this model system of fishes.
This project will provide training for one postdoctoral fellow, two graduate
students and one undergraduate student at Ohio University, as well as
invitations to students at the Instituto de Biologia in Mexico City to go on
field trips.
