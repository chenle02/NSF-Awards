9408701 Marder This renewal award is made in the Advanced Materials and
Processing Program in support of the research of Dr. Seth Marder and Dr. Joseph
Perry. Support is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research.
The goals of the research are to develop an understanding of the factors
affecting both second- and third-order nonlinearities, assess the fundamental
limits for the hyperpolarizability coefficients that can be achieved with
organic molecules and polymers, and to develop synthetic strategies that will
lead to molecules where nonlinear response is optimized. An integrated program
of synthesis, structural, linear and nonlinear optical characterization, and
theoretical studies will be carried out. Materials with nonlinear optical
properties are key to optical processing and storage of data and images. This
research will result in molecules and optical materials with greatly enhanced
nonlinear optical properties compared to those currently available.
