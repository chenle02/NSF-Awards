This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to demonstrate the
feasibility of using semiconductor nanocrystals to produce a resist that
responds quadratically to the exposure light intensity for optical lithography.
More specifically, this project will develop semiconductor nanocrystals embedded
in a polymer binder, together with an acid generator, as a resist for deep
ultra-violet (DUV) manufacturing. This resist will improve the resolution of the
lithography process and enable double exposure, which is urgently required in
order to extend optical lithography beyond the 45 nm
mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of this resist for 193 nm
semiconductor wafer manufacturing will improve resolution and increase the
single-exposure process window. More importantly, it will enable a cost-
effective double exposure strategy, allowing fabrication of features beyond 45
nm with optical lithography, keeping the industry on the well-known Moore's law
curve. A double exposure strategy keeps the industry from a disruption of
Moore's law at the 32 nm node, and possibly beyond. It saves the industry from
switching to more expensive and unreliable alternatives, such as extreme ultra-
violet (EUV) lithography.
