9451053 Juhl This project introduces students from two technician education
programs to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) through an
interdisciplinary environmental monitoring project. In a collaborative study of
the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, Chemical Laboratory Technician and Hazardous
Materials Technician students analyzes water samples for various organic and
inorganic constit- uents using GC/MS, Ion Chromatography (IC), wet chemistry
techniques, and field testing equipment. The project requires groups of students
to create objectives, identify and implement procedures, follow protocols
standard to industry and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and report
analyses to certain state and conservation agencies. The GC/MS is used to
determine the presence of specific pesticides and volatile organic compounds in
the river due to heavy agriculture in the river's drainage. Availability of a
GC/MS allows authentic environmental monitoring following EPA guidelines,
acquaints students with a critical analytical tool routinely used in industry,
introduces computer operated instrumentation, and provides experience with data
base searching and quantitative software. The collaborative nature of the
project also provides students unique opportunities such as supervising and
teaching colleagues in a closely related field and interacting with professional
organizations.
