Current problems in approximation that are driven by applications in science and
engineering, are formulated in very high dimensions. This project involves the
study of different objectives related to high-dimensional approximation, that
arise in a large number of applications including neutron, tomographic and
magnetic resonance image reconstruction, uncertainty quantification, optimal
control and parameter identification for engineering and science applications,
as well as important energy and material science applications. The approaches
used in this work will result in substantially improved and mathematically well-
founded methodologies for computer simulations of solutions to real-world
problems. The project will also involve the interdisciplinary training of
graduate students on computational data sciences and engineering. The results
obtained will be disseminated through journal articles, conference talks, a
collaborative website, and by the research and training activities of the junior
participants.

In this effort we propose to develop novel mathematical techniques for
approximation of high-dimensional systems from a limited amount of sparse and
noisy data. The results of this effort will enable scientists to understand what
are the number realizations of a nonlinear manifold that required to recover the
entire high-dimensional solution map, with optimal approximation guarantees and
minimal computational cost. Our rigorous mathematical approach includes: Novel
weighted convex optimization and iterative thresholding techniques for optimal
polynomial recovery, established via an improved estimate of the restricted
isometry property; and Advanced multi-index methods that alleviate complexity
and accelerate convergence of solutions by constructing model hierarchies with
the use of reduced-basis techniques.
