For this MUSES planning activity, the University of Washington, in collaboration
with Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, will undertake a set of workshops to
generate a coordinated, binational plan for research and education in the area
of the interaction of materials processing and use with the environment in our
regions. The project will build teams on both sides, which on the faculty level,
incorporate expertise in materials science, design for the environment,
computational approaches to environmental modeling, and economics and social
science. Significant roles for undergraduate and graduate students in the
research and educational planning process are incorporated in the program
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will support two planning workshops,
one in Seattle and one in Chengdu, in which the binational teams will come
together to more fully develop the research and educational agenda. There are
three main foci for the collaboration 1) Design of comprehensive regional
industrial ecology models for the effect of the materials processing industry on
the environment. The regions of focus for this study are the Puget Sound Region
and the Sichuan basin 2) Creation of a collaborative plan for research on
materials for fuel cells, with a particular focus on the transportation sector,
and; 3) Collaboration on the more effective incorporation of environmental
issues in materials science curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a concrete
result of the workshops, detailed plans for ongoing partnerships will be
generated which can be incorporated in proposals for more comprehensive funding
to national research organizations in both countries, to private foundations,
and to the industrial sector&lt;br/&gt;
