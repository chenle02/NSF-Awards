The project aims to develop robust, efficient, and transferrable deep learning
algorithms for prediction and anomaly detection in human spatio-temporal
dynamics. This will be a fundamental step in providing reliable and speedy
decision support for mitigating infectious diseases and countering threats in a
time varying and spatially complex environment. The project shall advance recent
computational tools (deep neural networks) in adversarial conditions and on
resource limited (low cost, low energy) platform, thereby contribute to
information technology in adversarial learning, mobile computing and effective
decision making. A broad range of applications include threat detection and
prediction for traffic and public transportation networks, security and privacy
critical data analysis and prediction, threat detection and error correction for
hydraulic, electrical and nuclear power systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approaches to be used involve novel techniques in high dimensional non-smooth
non-convex optimization and graph representation. Specifically, the project
shall study (1) multi-scale graph-structured recurrent neural networks for
spatio-temporal data modeling, prediction and anomaly detection; (2)
adversarially robust, accurate, and transferable deep learning algorithms based
on advection-diffusion equations; (3) efficient quantization algorithms under
adversarial conditions to reduce the latency of deep networks. The projects
shall train a diverse body of graduate and undergraduate students at the Irvine
and Los Angeles campuses of University of California through collaborative
education and research activities in applied mathematics, computer science, data
science and social science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
