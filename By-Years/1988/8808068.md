This grant is to support a field program to study the processes controlling
mixing in the Chesapeake Bay. Short period, small-scale processes control the
fluxes of momentum, heat, salt, and nutrients in the Bay. Itsweire will use a
new profiling and microstructure techniques to measure the turbulent events and
calculate their contribution to the flux problem.
