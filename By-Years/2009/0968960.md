Full Center Proposal (Phase III) for an I/UCRC for the Center for Advanced
Processing and Packaging Studies (CAPPS)

0968960 Ohio State University; Steven Schwartz 0968955 North Carolina State
University; Kandivan Sandeep CAPPS is proposing a Phase III support (third five-
year period) for the Center, including support for center personnel, evaluation
and research. The proposed Center is a multi-university Center comprised of the
Ohio State University (lead) and North Carolina State University (NCSU).

CAPPS was initiated in 1983 as an NSF IUCRC program, and since 2003 has been
operating solely with industry member support. The major objectives of the
Center include: enhancing the knowledge base in developing new and novel
emerging food processing/packaging technologies; conducting research to ensure
the safety of implementing non-thermal and novel processing technologies within
the US; addressing industrially relevant food processing and packaging problems
facing the industry; and, training students and other personnel to meet the
future needs of the US food processing/packaging. Although the University of
California at Davis is not actively seeking support as an official site, it will
remain active within the Center contributing research expertise and facilities.

CAPPS will create a program focus in food processing and packaging. With NSF and
industry support, the Center anticipates that the collaborative efforts among
faculty within the Center will result in advances well beyond what individual
laboratories or a single institution could achieve. Participation by industry
will require that fundamental advances in food processing and packaging be
translated to in-house industry research or possess potential commercial
applications. CAPPS will continue to retain company memberships, recruit new
industry members and obtain participation from under-represented groups.
