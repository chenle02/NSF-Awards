Penicillium marneffei is a fungus capable of growth either as a multicellular
filament (mould) or as a single-celled entity (yeast). The temperature of
incubation dictates the particular shape that P. marneffei forms. At 25C (room
temperature), the mould phase of the fungus is produced, whereas incubation at
37 (body temperature) causes P. marneffei to grow as a yeast. We hypothesize
that there are specific proteins responsible for causing or maintaining growth
in either of the two cell types. To test our hypothesis, we will develop a
profile of all the proteins produced by the mould and yeast phases of P.
marneffei, then determine which proteins are uniquely present or absent. To make
the profile, we will employ the technique of two dimensional gel electrophoresis
to separate proteins based upon size and electrical charge. Unique proteins will
be isolated and subsequently subjected to mass spectrometry, a technique that
can help determine the potential identity and function of a protein. By
discovering the purpose of these unique proteins, key metabolic pathways
important to cellular development in P. marneffei may be detected. Overall, this
scientific approach should provide data leading to a better understanding of the
underlying basis controlling growth not only in P. marneffei and related fungi,
but perhaps in other microbes as well.
