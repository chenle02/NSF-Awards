Insect cell cultures offer potential advantages over mammalian cell cultures for
production of proteins from recombinant DNA. They also offer advantages over the
use of larvae for the production of viral insecticides. Efficient large scale
process strategies to exploit these potentials need to be developed. Two key
barriers are an inadequate understanding of how cellular growth and viral
reproductive mechanisms respond to changes in culture conditions, and an
inability to translate such knowledge into the design and operation of easily
scalable bioreactors. An integrated research effort is proposed to reduce these
barriers. Fluid dynamic and kinetic models are also to be developed and
verified.
