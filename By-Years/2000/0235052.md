ABSTRACT: Positive feedback has been proposed as a mechanism that results in
the&lt;br/&gt;stable persistence of alternative states of an ecosystem. Such
feedback&lt;br/&gt;may operate through plant-induced alterations in soil
microbial&lt;br/&gt;communities, which in turn alter plant communities through
changes in&lt;br/&gt;nutrient dynamics. The recent replacement of native
understory plant&lt;br/&gt;communities in eastern deciduous forests by
apparently stable communities&lt;br/&gt;of exotic species provides an excellent
model system in which to test the&lt;br/&gt;presence of soil-mediated positive
feedbacks. Previous studies of this&lt;br/&gt;system have shown that the recent
shift in community composition is related&lt;br/&gt;to changes in both nutrient
cycling processes and microbial community&lt;br/&gt;composition. I propose
greenhouse microcosm and field plot experiments to&lt;br/&gt;test whether plants
drive changes in soil-based ecosystem processes by&lt;br/&gt;altering the soil
microbiota, and whether these changes in turn promote the&lt;br/&gt;dominance of
the exotics. The proposed studies will explicitly contrast a&lt;br/&gt;litter-
driven above-ground mechanism with a root-driven below-
ground&lt;br/&gt;mechanism. &lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: If the hypothesis of
plant-soil positive feedback created by&lt;br/&gt;altered nutrient cycling is
supported, it would both demonstrate a&lt;br/&gt;plausible mechanism for the
persistence of alternative stable communities&lt;br/&gt;and help explain the
establishment of dominance by some exotic plant&lt;br/&gt;species. In addition,
this project will train at least 1 graduate student and 3
undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;
