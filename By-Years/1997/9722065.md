A setting for quantum mechanics will be sought that avoids the notorious
problems that beset the foundations of the subject. Such a formulation would
rely on no prior concept of measurement or observer, would describe individual
systems and not just ensembles, would make sense for small systems uncoupled to
an environment, and would satisfy an appropriate locality condition. Two
elementary but insufficiently noticed recent theorems raise the possibility that
it may be possible to satisfy all these requirements in an interpretation of
quantum mechanics based on the view that the physics of an isolated system is
nothing more or less than the study of all the correlations that exist among its
subsystems. The goal is to arrive at an elementary, unmysterious, unambiguous,
paradox-free, and pedagogically useful interpretive framework for the quantum
theory, as a natural language for describing an inherently probabilistic world.
In an independent study the origins of certain misconceptions about special
relativity held by physicists and/or sociologists will be traced to some lapses
in the traditional pedagogical approaches to the subject. Alternative routes to
the special theory will be developed that avoid these pitfalls.
