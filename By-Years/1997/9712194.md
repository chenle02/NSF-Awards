9712194 Weiss This research is directed at the characterization of the
interactions and phase behavior of ionomer/homopolymer blends and specifically
the following objectives: 1. to understand the macrophase and microphase
behavior of blends in which miscibility results from strong attractive
intermolecular interactions or repulsive intramolecular interactions; 2. to
define the role of the ionomer counterion, ionic concentration and polymer
molecular weight on the phase behavior and properties of the blends; 3. to
determine the effect of strong attractive or repulsive interactions on the
spinodal decomposition kinetics and the resulting morphology of critical
mixtures; and 4. to determine the interfacial behavior of these blends. Two
systems will be investigated: (I) blends of lightly sulfonated polystyrene (SPS)
and a methylated polyamide and (2) SPS and bisphenol A polycarbonate. The former
is an example of a blend with specific attractive intermolecular interactions,
and the latter is a blend for which miscibility occurs due to intramolecular
repulsive effects. The specific experimental techniques that will be employed
include light scattering, small angle neutron scattering, small angle x-ray
scattering, neutron reflectance and rheological analyses. %%% An ionomer blended
with another polymer represents a special class of copolymer/homopolymer blends
in which one of the components carries a charge. The presence of the ionic
species may permit very strong, attractive intermolecular interactions with
another polymer and/or strong intramolecular repulsions within the ionomer.
Either phenomena may induce miscibility of two otherwise immiscible polymers.
