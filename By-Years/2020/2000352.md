Operator algebras is a branch of mathematics that arose in the mathematical
rigorization of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and has since blossomed into an
area touching many other parts of mathematics. The Graduate Summer School in
Operator Algebras in Ottawa is an event that helps to inform and advance the
careers of young researchers (primarily Ph.D. students and postdoctoral
researchers). It consists of three lecture series delivered by renowned
researchers in diverse areas of operator algebras, as well as a career talk and
opportunities for participants to deliver short talks. Through these activities
and networking opportunities, the summer school is designed to be very
beneficial to the research program and the careers of the participants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of the lecture series are
internationally relevant and timely, yet will be presented at a level that is
accessible to the graduate student and postdoc participants. The topics are: (i)
the classification of C*-algebras, with an emphasis on von Neumann algebra
techniques, (ii) operator algebraic aspects of quantum information theory, and
(iii) group amenability and its connections to operator algebras. This award
supports the travel of US based Ph.D. students and post-docs to participate in
this event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
