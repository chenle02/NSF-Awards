This project will support a conference entitled Summer Conference on General
Topology and Applications. It will be held June 14-16 at the C.W. Post Campus of
Long Island University. The goals of the conference are (1) to facilitate
communication and collaboration among topologists from a wide geographic area,
(2) to improve communication between topologists and mathematicians in related
fields, (3) to bring to the participants the leading researchers and latest
developments in the field, and (4) to expose advanced graduate students to the
excitement and intense research activity of this conference. The principal
speakers are A.V. Arhangel'skii, B. Banaschewski, W.W. Comfort, Gruenhage, B.
Mandelbrot, and S. Watson. The proceedings of the conference will be published
by Marcel Dekker.
