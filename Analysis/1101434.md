This project is concerned with the motion of water waves in both two and three
space dimensions. The particular mathematical problem under investigation is
that of the motion of the interface separating a two- or three-dimensional,
inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational fluid, under the influence of
gravity, from a region of zero density, neglecting the effects of surface
tension. The questions the principal investigator seeks to answer focus on the
later-time behavior of surface waves in the open ocean for initially small wave
disturbances. In particular, her primary objectives are (1) to identify those
initial data that lead to finite time blow-up of the interface and to understand
the nature of the singularities that develop in the interface and (2) to
identify the largest set of initial data that lead to situations in which blow-
up is avoided for all time. The principal investigator also seeks to justify
rigorously the modulation approximations of the two- and three-dimensional water
wave problems.

Rogue waves are relatively large surface waves that are observed in deep ocean
waters. Often appearing in perfectly clear weather without warning, they are
blamed for the damage and inexplicable disappearance of numerous large ships and
ocean liners. With the resolution of the questions under study in this project,
the principal investigator hopes to provide insights into effective designs of
computational and laboratory simulations of water wave motion and thereby to
advance our understanding of the causes of natural phenomena associated with
such waves, including the behavior of rogue waves. The analytical tools
developed to carry out the research may also serve to shed new light on related
problems in mathematical physics. The proposed research will involve graduate
students.
