MCB9728262 Cattolico, Rose Ann Chloroplast Signal Transduction in Marine
Chromophytes Lay Summary Management of coastal ecosystems has recently become a
major topic for the national news media. There is a new awareness of the
contribution by phytoplankton to a balanced marine ecology. Part of this
awareness has been gained from observing the devastating effects of algal blooms
off the coast of the United States. Phytoplankton, however, also serve as the
keystone of aquatic food webs and produce fascinating compounds of biomedical
importance which can be "mined" from the sea. Algae live in a precarious
environment and must respond rapidly to changing environmental cues (e.g.,
light, temperature, and nutrients) to ensure survival. Our study analyzes a
mechanism by which a potentially toxic photosynthetic alga perceives these cues
and transduces those signals into metabolic commands. Specifically, we will
study the effector component of a prokaryotic-like signal transduction system
that is localized in the chloroplast. This component modulates gene expression
by affecting transcription. We have sequenced the gene that produces the
effector protein. Next we will overproduce this protein in a bacterial
expression system and then analyze the genes that are targeted by the protein.
Finally, we hope to identify the receptor of this signal transduction cascade.
This research when completed will provide reference information for a taxon
(Chromophyta) that is ecologically important yet has received only marginal
scientific attention.
