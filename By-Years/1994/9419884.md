Willis 9419884 Little is known about the genetic basis in plants of inbreeding
depression, the decreased success, or fitness, of inbred offspring when compared
to offspring produced by cross-fertilization. The objective of the proposed
research is to experimentally analyze the genetics of inbreeding depression in
the monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus. The primary goals are to determine 1) the
relative contribution of major and minor harmful mutations to inbreeding
depression, 2) the effects of these mutations on other components of an
organism's fitness, and 3) the average degree of dominance of minor harmful
mutations. The results of this research will provide important information on
how inbreeding depression is purged by self-fertilization and will help explain
how selfing evolves in spite of apparently strong selection against it. The
results also will aid in the breeding of economically important varieties of
plants and animals that experience inbreeding depression and in the conservation
of rare and endangered species.
