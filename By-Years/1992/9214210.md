The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will renovate an existing building
on the campus for use as a high energy physics detector research, development
and construction facility. UTA has recently launched a major new initiative in
high energy physics research to take advantage of the unique opportunity offered
by the proximity of the campus to the SSC laboratory. A large part of the high
energy groups initial research activity will be the development and construction
of major components of the SDC detector. Due to the size and complexity of these
components, a large amount of space is needed for their
development/construction. The initial research program to be carried out in the
renovated building will center on the SDC detector muon system. This research
program offers excellent opportunities for the involvement and training of
graduate students from small scale prototype work through major component
construction. The program will also involve a close interworking with many other
institutions in SDC and will thereby ensure highly productive use of the
renovated facility by both local physicists and support staff and visitors who
will combine activities at the facility with their work directly at the
neighboring SSC laboratory.
