9614016 Kaler Participant support is requested for approximately 10 US
participants in an international workshop on OSolubilization and Reconstruction
of Libid Bilayers and Biological MembranesO, to be held June 16-17, 1996 in Kfar
Blum, Israel. Topics of the conference are the structural aspects of
solubilization and reconstitution, the action of sub-solubilizing concentrations
of micelle forming surfactants on membranes, and aspects of membrane phase
transitions. There are applications of these ideas to several technologies,
including protein purification and material synthesis. Participation by US
scientists is essential if the US is to match the pace set in the last decade by
European, Israeli, and other scientists in many areas of complex fluid research.
All attendees will present papers and/or take part in panel discussions. ***
