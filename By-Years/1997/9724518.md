The proposal seeks support with a major investment in a servo-hydraulic
instrumentation system (actuators, pump, hoses, computerized control system,
support hardware, and force and displacement measurement transducers) to be used
for medium load-range testing of structural members, components, and assemblies.
It will enable more aggressive experimental and performance analysis and
innovation in materials and system design. The horizons for educators and
scientists in the departments of Forest Products and Civil Engineering will be
elevated from single parts or small subassemblies tested under static loads to
assemblies and complete light-frame structures tested under static and dynamic
loading regimes. This experimental direction is essential to make progress
toward improved structural performance and safety, mitigation of structural
damages given natural hazard loadings, optimization of structural systems,
continued innovation of bio-based composite materials, and advanced
understanding of plant physiological/mechanical functions.
