Field Museum requests $1,033,456 from NSF for the geological and biological
science portions of the new, 14,000 square-foot multidisciplinary exhibit on
Africa. This $3.45 million permanent reinstallation will capitalize on Field
Museum's extensive African collections. We intend to use these collections and
other presentational strategies, broad scientific and community input to develop
a sensitive and appealing exhibit that will advance central scientific themes in
anthropology, geology, ecology, and conservation. A variety of techniques will
be used to appeal to the individual interests, needs and learning styles of our
diverse audience. Project director will be Michael Spock, Vice President for
Public Programs at Field Museum. Co-developers will be Karen Hutt and Fath
Ruffins. Exhibit consultants and advisors include Field Museum scientists and
educators, and experts in the fields of biology, zoology, and conservation from
outside the Museum. An estimated 14 million children and adults will be reached
by this ehibit over the next 20 years, and extensive documentation of the
exhibit development process will serve as a model for development of other
comprehensive exhibits throughout the world.
