The fossil vertebrate collections of the Museum of Paleontology, University of
California, Berkeley, are among the world's most important. These collections
comprise more than 140,000 catalogued specimens, and they provide one of the
most complete representations of the history of the North American vertebrate
fauna available today. The University's Department of Paleontology has recently
become part of a new Department of Integrative Biology, and the collections will
be moved into renovated quarters in the Life Sciences Building, along with the
Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Combining the zoology and paleontology faculties,
and juxtaposing the fossil and Recent vertebrate collections, will make the new
department a center for the study of vertebrate evolution. Dr. William Clemens
will oversee the transfer of the collections to new compactorized storage areas.
Accessibility to specimens will be improved greatly, and the new quarters will
support many years of continued collection growth. Collections of fossils are
the libraries in which the history of life can be studied. Growth and
improvement of these collections is vital to evolutionary studies, and to our
understanding of the history of life on earth. The proposed collection
improvement will benefit paleontologists, geologists, vertebrate zoologists,
biogeographers, and evolutionary biologists around the world.
