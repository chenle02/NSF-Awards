This award will support collaborative research on the topic of algebraic
permutations between Dr. Andrew Glass, Bowling Green State University and Dr.
Peter Neumann, Mathematics Institute, Oxford University. The project will focus
on the theory and structure of the free groups generated by real translations
and power mappings. Both the US and British investigators have considerable
expertise on the proposed topic of research. Dr. Neumann is one of the world's
leading specialists in the area of infinite permutation groups. Dr. Glass has
made a number of contributions in the area of ordered permutation groups and
lattice-ordered groups. The results of this research may bring new and creative
ideas to free group problems.
