Scattering measurements of the cross section for the excitation of metastable
atoms are carried out using a variety of techniques including a novel approach
using ultracold Rubidium atoms in a trap. Partial support for the funding of the
instrumentation portion of this proposal has been provided by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of MPS.
