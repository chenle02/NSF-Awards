9353895 Salah Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) seeks to initiate a
three-week summer, commuter, Young Scholars program with extensive follow-up
activities during the academic year for 48 students entering grades 8 and 9. The
students will engage in classroom discussions, group activities, research
projects, and field trips from three different disciplines: astronomy, physics,
and mathematics. The program activities will apply physics and mathematics to
experimental observations and studies of astronomical sources of radio emission;
measurements of distances, velocities and vectors, analysis of plate motion data
and studies of earthquakes; and investigations of the earth's atmosphere, its
variations and human effects on the environment. Each student will have an
opportunity to work with a scientist or mathematician who will serve as a
mentor.
