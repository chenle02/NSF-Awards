9526905 Wahr This research is to study the possible effects of upper mantle
phase transformations, for example at depths of 410 and 660 km, on seismic
motions, especially the free oscillations of the earth. Preliminary estimates
suggest that during seismic motions, material in the vicinity of a phase
boundary could change phase as it oscillates. For example, perturbations to the
eigenfrequencies of free oscillations due to the 660 km boundary could be
anywhere from a few tenths to several percent, well within the observational
uncertainties of the eigenfrequencies. The objectives are to study whether the
inversion of free oscillation data for spherical structure could provide useful
information on the 410 and 660 km discontinuities; and to judge whether the
inclusion of phase transformation effects into the inversion process might
improve the inversions for other parameters. For the latter, the work will focus
especially, though not exclusively, on implications for the density profile in
the transition zone, and on the bulk dissipation models that have been inferred
from observations of radial mode attenuation. *** ??
