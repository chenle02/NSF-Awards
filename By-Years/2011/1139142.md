The goal of this project is to demonstrate the functionality of a ground-based,
high-resolution, high-throughput portable spectrograph for dedicated aeronomic
investigations. The Compact Echelle Spectrograph for Aeronomical Research
(CESAR) was constructed by SRI International with prior support from NSF to
provide the finest-resolution wide-bandwidth spectra. Through this project,
CESAR will collect simultaneous data over a broad spectral range and enable
aeronomic investigations about relationships between spectral features that may
be separated by hundreds of nanometers. The system is designed to be operated
remotely during all dark nights. Initially sited at Poker Flat, CESAR will be
co-located with Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR)--an NSF-funded, SRI-
operated, phased-array incoherent scatter radar.
