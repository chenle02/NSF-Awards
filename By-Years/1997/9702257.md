This project joins two efforts: The Tom's Creek Bridge Rehabilitation and
Durability Field Site: We will employ a unique opportunity to study composite
material performance in a low risk field site. The author has lead a successful
effort to incorporate commercial composites box 1 beams in the Tom's Creek
Bridge as structural members. Our ultimate objective is to provide an organizing
structure in which to assimilate a methodology to define and predict composite
performance in an actual infrastructure environment. This approach will help
address our present lack of practical understanding of composites durability in
the infrastructure, even with the large sets of lab data that already exist.
This program will study the critical processes that influence composite.
Broadening our Definition of Underrepresented in Engineering and Science: The
object in this program is to bring disadvantaged/underrepresented youth to
Virginia Tech for a summer of structured education/introduction to the
engineering and science and research on the Tom's Creek Bridge test site. The
underrepresented youth in this case are not defined by sex or ethnic background,
but selected from a group that can defined as `at-risk` due to economic status
or an ineffectual environment.
