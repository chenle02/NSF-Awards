This project seeks to achieve a fundamental understanding of surface reactions
and related processes during selective silicon epitaxy by chemical vapor
deposition. Experiments will make use of a low pressure, high temperature
emission chemical vapor deposition infrared cell, a variable angle attenuatated
total reflectance cell, and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. In situ
emission experiments are designed to provide new information on the role of
surface species such as hydrides, chlorides and oxides on silicon substrates
under epitaxial growth conditions. New qualitative and quantitative
understanding of fundamental processes important to surface science, and having
technological relevance to the microelectronics industry is expected.
