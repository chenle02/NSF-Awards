This research addresses issues of image registration, texture image
segmentation, and quantification of minor differences between texture patterns,
for example in medical images. The premise behind the outlined algorithms is
that 2-D image registration cannot counteraffect 3-D positioning differences.
The problem of precise image registration is surmounted by comparing regions, in
a manner similar to analysis done by medical experts. The criteria for region
identification include location and intensity characteristics. The selection
procedure is divided into: (i) selection of control points in two images
(external markers and/or selected internal points that have unique
characteristics) to determine locations of centers of regions to be compared,
and (ii) determination of region extent by image segmentation, thus ensuring
that the comparison is carried out between statistically homogeneous regions.
Hierarchical region splitting is proposed as a means of achieving region size
sensitive to subtle intensity changes. Both intensity statistics and texture
measurements are included in region comparison procedure and decision making
about a region status. The results of these basic investigations should be
valuable in attacking the problem of early breast cancer detection based on
comparison of different screenings of the same patient.
