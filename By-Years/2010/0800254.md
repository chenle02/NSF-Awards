This GOALI project is a collaboration with Ford Motor Company on the mechanical
impact performance and energy absorption capabilities of composite materials
formulated from natural fibers embedded in synthetic and natural polymeric
binding resins. The goal is to develop understanding of the energy dissipation
and failure mechanisms of these bio-composites at the micromechanical level, for
the purpose of increasing their use in impact safety applications. Various
natural materials will be treated in the research including bast, prairie grass
and cellulose fibers, and soy based resin. Composite formulations of the
materials will be manufactured and laboratory tested to determine their
mechanical response and fracture characteristics when impacted at high rate.
Based on the test results and scanning electron microscopy of test samples, a
micromechanical finite element model will be developed to investigate the
relationships between failure mechanisms, energy dissipation mechanisms, and
material design of these bio-composites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful
completion of the research will yield a general understanding of the impact
response and failure behavior of bio-composites, facilitating their design for
impact safety applications. These materials could serve as replacements of
traditional glass/vinyl ester composites in an increased range of applications,
and offset some of the petroleum consumed in the manufacture of the traditional
composites. General knowledge will result on high rate measurement techniques,
appropriate interpretation of the resulting data, its connection to energy
absorbing behavior and micromechanical modeling techniques for impact
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
