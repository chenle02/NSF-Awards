SciTech Clubs for Girls, a three year old program, aims to encourage continuing
interest in science and mathematics among 9-14 year-old girls. It gives them an
experience in building a hands-on science exhibit for display at SciTech, a
hands-on science center. Based on recent research, this program strikes at four
major forces that keep girls out of the pipeline to careers in mathematics and
science. Mentors by female professionals, the girls learn the safe use of tools,
a principle for science, confidence in building things, and the pride of
building and exhibit for use by tens of thousands of visitors yearly. Recently
SciTech received a $125,000 grant from Youth ALIVE| A National Initiative of the
DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to continue the program for 3-years and to
expand it. We will reach 20 clubs of girls each year from organizations that
serve girls. The program will reach older and younger girls and their female
leaders. We will also reach into the intercity of Chicago to serve more minority
girls. Under the YouthALIVE| grant we will carefully evaluate results and begin
to disseminate the program to other museums nationally.
