Abstract University of Missouri-Columbia - J. Mitchell Connection to NSFNET
Proposal No. NCR-9417227 The University of Missouri-Columbia Health Sciences
Center (HSC) requests support to provide Internet access to its outlying health
care facilities in the city of Fulton. This access will be provided by means of
a high speed extension of the internal backbone at the Center. The Health
Science Center network is in turn connected to the Internet through the MU
campus backbone, so its extension to the remote facilities will provide users at
those sites access to the full array of both Internet and HSC resources. The
Fulton location is especially significant for the HSC in that it will serve as a
model for network communication to many other remote sites in the future. The
satellite facility in Fayette, described in this document, similar to the
operation in Fulton and would be the next location to be brought into the HSC
backbone network with the technology outlined in this proposal in a phased
approach.
