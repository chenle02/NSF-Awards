This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
novel 360° video surveillance camera which provides a simultaneous panoramic
360° field of view (FOV) using optical unwrapping, instead of digital
unwrapping. The company's proprietary imaging technology can provide 70% greater
image resolution than conventional cameras using the same sensor chip, and
employs no moving parts. Not only can it acquire 360° video of a surrounding
scene, but also such 360° video images can be viewed directly, for the first
time, without need of external computational hardware/software for unwrapping.
The proposed camera would perform video surveillance with unprecedented
panoramic 360° field of view that eliminates blind spots, and greatly enhances
image quality. The directly viewable 360° video would also enhance
visualization, communication, and response time in surveillance practice.

The proposed imaging technology developed under this SBIR program is a platform
technology with numerous potential applications. As a breakthrough optical
imaging technology, it will lead many researchers and practitioners to rethink
the way video images are captured and spawn commercial ventures to bring it to
various commercial markets. In addition to enabling video surveillance products,
e.g., 360° box camera, pen-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera, miniature camera, etc., this
technology will lead to commercial applications in areas such as medical and
industrial endoscopes, pipe inspection, turbine engine diagnosis, automotive
safety devices, navigation, mobile robotics, video conferencing, and internet
webcast. The company has selected three vertical markets in which to develop
innovative product(s) offering significant value propositions. These three
vertical markets are: (1) video surveillance cameras (~$13 billion), (2)
automotive safety products, e.g., rearview mirrors and parking sensors, (~$13.4
billion), and (3) medical and industrial endoscopes (~$4.3 billion).
