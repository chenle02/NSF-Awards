9732405 Datye The University of New Mexico will continue a Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Center for Microengineered Materials.
Undergraduate students will be recruited from colleges and universities that
offer degrees in chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science and
ceramics. Students will participate in interdisciplinary research projects on
advanced materials, including sol-gel synthesis, thin films, microfabrication of
electronic materials, catalysts and adsorbents, and vapor phase synthesis. In
addition, REU participants will give presentations on their work and will visit
the national labs and nearby industries that are partners with the Center. %%%
The interdisciplinary nature of the research projects and close liaison with
industry and national laboratory associates will provide a valuable experience
to the undergraduate students participating in the program. ***
