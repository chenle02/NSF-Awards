This work will address a variety of theoretical subjects related to or inspired
by the collision of high energy heavy- ions; including a model for studying
cluster distributions, correlations and fluctuations; a model for hadronizing
the quark-gluon plasma in analogy to ferromagnetic phase transitions; and
exactly solvable statistical mechanics models of fragmentation.
