Probing Fluids, Fractures, Faults, and Strain with PBO Borehole Data

Duncan Carr Agnew Andrew J. Barbour

We are studying the how the uppermost part of the Earth's crust behaves when it
also contains fluids such as water, using data from the borehole strainmeter
(BSM) network operated by the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) component of
Earthscope. This network includes measurements of ground deformation (strain)
and fluid pressure at sites throughout the western United States, some of them
in an active fault zone: the San Jacinto fault in southern California. We are
examining how the strain and fluid pressure change because of changing air
pressure acting on the ground, seismic waves from distant earthquakes, and the
tidal motions of the Earth's crust. We are combining this information with data
on the fractures around each borehole to estimate hydraulic properties of the
surrounding material, and relate these to large-scale features (such as fault
zones) in each region of the network. At one site we are also looking at how
groundwater pumping (which we monitor) affects two strainmeters nearby. We are
developing methods to correct these and other BSM data for nearby pumping or
other groundwater changes.
