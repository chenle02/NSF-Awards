This one year, full-time award enables a cultural anthropologist to develop his
capabilities and new career interests in the social and historical study of
technology. His research concerns the role of late 1960s and early 1970s San
Francisco Bay Area culture in shaping the social construction of personal
computer technology. The host institution is Stanford University. To gain formal
training in techniques of historical investigation, this investigator will work
with an historian and a computer scientist there. Professor Joseph J. Corn,
whose research interests in the history of technology emphasize the role of
culture in shaping technological innovation, will guide and advise Prof.
Pfaffenberger's study of historical sources and administer a reading program,
which will focus on issues in the interpretation of technology-related
historical sources. Professor Terry Winograd will examine and critique
Pfaffenberger's account of the impact of culture on the technical content of
personal computer technology and, in addition, will guide his study of the
latitude for social choice in the design of microprocessor chips. The project
will result in a book. This project addresses a central issue in science,
technology and society studies: the impact of context on development and use of
technology. The investigator and his host specialists and host institution are
uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project; collaborative
efforts are likely to continue after the period of the award. Results are likely
to be appropriately disseminated and useful. An award in the amount of $43,000
is therefore recommended.
