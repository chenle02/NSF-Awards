This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of Tennessee to acquire an optical
parametric oscillator laser system. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) studies of laser photodetachment of
a doubly charged anion, (2) the growth, structure, and dynamics of thin metal
film, (3) detailed electronic properties of surfaces and (4) changes on an
atomic scale. A laser can provide important information about chemical
reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
properties of reactivity and non-reactivity of molecules..
