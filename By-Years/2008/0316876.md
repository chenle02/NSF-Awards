Cell division and expansion are fundamental processes, however the relationship
between them has been little studied. In a developing organ, it is not
understood how the zones of division and rapid expansion are delimited; nor is
it understood how rates of elongation and division are coordinated. Based on
preliminary data, the PI hypothesizes first, that division ends well before
rapid expansion begins; second, that the abrupt onset of rapid expansion is
caused by a synchronous up-regulation of proton efflux and hydraulic
conductivity of cell membranes; and third, that division and expansion are
regulated reciprocally, so that a change in one elicits a proportional change in
the other. The specific aims of the proposal are to test these hypotheses. To do
so, The PI will use the plant root because of its linear organization,
indeterminate growth, and experimental accessibility. The PI developed a
kinematic method to quantify the spatial profiles of velocity, relative
elongation rate and cell division rate. Profiles of velocity, relative
elongation rate, cell division rate, and fluxes of selected ions will be
quantified for conditions and genotypes that affect root growth, including
development and water deficit. The PI will then perturb elongation and division
and will quantify how the measured parameters change. Supporting or refuting the
hypotheses will increase our understanding of fundamental growth processes in
higher plants.&lt;br/&gt;
