The objective of the project is to develop and to analyze a robust adaptive
finite element method for the Darcy-Stokes-Brinkman model with extremely
variable or discontinuous parameters. The proposed research include: developing
a robust adaptive H(div) finite element method; conducting a priori error
analysis; deriving efficiency and reliability bounds for a posteriori error
estimators; proving convergence of adaptive mesh refinement procedures;
developing a computer program for implementation of the method.

The Darcy-Stokes-Brinkman model has wide range of applications such as surface
and sub-surface water interaction in geoscience, blood circulation in health
science and, fuel cells, filtration problems in environment science. Solving
these problems has attracted a lot of attention from mathematicians and
engineers, and many works have been done in developing and analyzing numerical
algorithms for Darcy-Stokes-Brinkman model. Majority of these works treat
viscosity and permeability as either constant or near zero jump. However, for
the practical relevant problems, these physical parameters are either
discontinuous or highly variable. Singularity caused by the highly varied
physical parameters creates tremendous difficulty in development of numerical
algorithms. There is a great interest in obtaining efficient and robust
numerical methods to simulate these real word problems.
