The goal of the Doctoral Consortium in Pervasive Health Care is to support the
doctoral students through constructive remarks and feedback on their research
from prominent researchers and through interaction with other students. Student
participants will be from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that
inform pervasive computing, including biomedical informatics, computer science,
information science, engineering, clinical sciences, law, and related fields.
The student participants should be well into their dissertation research and
will be expected to give short presentations of their work during the
Consortium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Consortium will be held in conjunction
with the 8th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for
Healthcare in Oldenburg, Germany. PervasiveHealth is a premier international
forum with specific focus on technologies and human factors related to the use
of ubiquitous computing in healthcare and wellbeing. The participants will be
mentored by faculty members and provide a longer term supportive mentoring
network to help new researchers navigate the challenges of interdisciplinary
research. The DC will take place on the weekend prior to the PervasiveHealth
conference. This will allow students to also participate in the overall
conference as well.
