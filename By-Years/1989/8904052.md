This research investigates the cause of major earthquakes on the volcanic
island of Hawaii, a timely and controversial question. The seismic method is to
record on both permanent and temporary seismometers the waves from local and
distant earthquakes to outline the extent of the buried sediment layer at the
volcanic pile-ocean crust interface. If this layer coincides in depth with the
low-angle-faulting earthquakes observed in the Kaoiki Fault Zone, the results
will support the hypothesis that major earthquakes are slips along this zone.
Because this research deals directly with earthquake hazard, it is a
contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
