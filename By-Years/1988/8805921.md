This project is to investigate questions of uniqueness, stability, consistency,
asymptotic behavior and analytic and numerical inversion of operators that arise
in mathematical models of several inverse problems. While the research is
motivated by reconstruction problems in medical radiology, the operators under
study (Radon transforms, x-ray transforms and generalization) are of importance
in numerous other applications. The main topics for investigation are: the
further development and testing of a computationally efficient cone beam
reconstruction algorithm with sources on a circle; the study of stability
effects of data truncation in the algorithm and the cone beam reconstruction
problem in general, and a singular value analysis of operators arising in this
problems; a group theoretic study of filtered backprojection inversion and
approximate inversion formulas in, and applications of wavelet theory to,
integral geometric inverse problems. Successful completion of the project should
lead to a computationally efficient algorithm for cone beam reconstruction, a
mathematical understanding of the stability of the algorithm and the inherent
stability or instability of the problem. Other benefits include a theoretical
understanding of the underpinnings of filtered backprojection inversion formulas
and the structure of operators arising in integral geometric inverse problems.
