A monolithic three-dimensional integrated circuit (M3D IC) is a promising
technology to meet future computational demands as transistor density increases
due to the vertical dimension. This project addresses one of the primary design
challenges associated with the M3D IC technology to realize energy-efficient and
compact integrated chips. The project is facilitating further advances in M3D IC
technology by providing novel device models and design strategies for integrated
chips to the research community. The investigator is developing a participation
plan to involve students from the underrepresented groups in the field of
integrated circuits through this project. The techniques developed in this
research are intended to be used to develop computer-engineering courses and
also to be presented in technical seminars for industry
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In M3D IC technology, the substrate layers
are realized sequentially, and these layers are connected through metal inter-
layer vias (MIVs). This project aims to develop small footprint and efficient
M3D IC designs by opportunistically utilizing substrate area around MIV to form
MIV-devices specifically MIV-capacitor and MIV-transistor. This brings in new
challenges for designing and characterizing MIV-devices to optimize the form
factor and efficiency. These challenges are addressed by this project through 1)
developing SPICE models for proposed MIV-devices in M3D-IC technology, and 2)
utilizing these MIV-devices for on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM) and
dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) to enable compact and power-efficient M3D
ICs. The techniques developed in this research are providing future
opportunities for M3D IC technology at all design levels â€“ device, circuit, and
computer-aided design. The results of this project are intended to lay a
foundation for a design framework for full-scale M3D IC designs to meet future
computational requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
