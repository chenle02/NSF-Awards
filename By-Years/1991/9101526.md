Professor Trow will conduct research in the area of symbolic dynamics, a branch
of dynamical systems. His research will be primarily concerned with factor maps
between shifts of finite type. These maps are continuous, surjective, shift-
commuting maps. They are the sliding block codes of information theory.
Professor Trow is interested in the question of existence of these maps, and
their possible degrees. These questions are closely related to topological
conjugacy of shifts of finite type, the central problem of symbolic dynamics.
The objects of study in symbolic dynamics are sets (called symbol spaces) whose
elements are bi-infinite sequences of symbols, together with a the shift map.
These spaces are natural models for a large class of dynamical systems. They are
of great interest to ergodic theorists and information and coding experts.
