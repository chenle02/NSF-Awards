9503274 Ziurys Dr. Ziurys will carry out a joint laboratory and observational
investigation of molecules containing refractory elements that are of
astrophysical interest. The laboratory program entails the measurement of the
pure rotational spectra of such molecules at millimeter/submillimeter
wavelengths, while the observations include astronomical detection and
subsequent study of these species in interstellar clouds and circumstellar
envelopes of late-type stars. The molecules of particular interest are simple
metal-bearing carbide and nitride radicals.
