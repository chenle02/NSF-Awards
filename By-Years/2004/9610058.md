Abstract - Chan CTS-9706706 A thin-filament pyrometry system is assembled from
components. The system combines the nonperturbing qualities of laser-based
diagnostics with the simplicity of thermometive probes. The system permits time-
dependent, simultaneous measurement at all locations along a line through a
transient flame. The pyrometer system will be used in research on turbulence-
radiation interactions in flames, overshooting of flamelet structure for
turbulent radiating flames, and the ignition and extinction of alternative
fuels.
