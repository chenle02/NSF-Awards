Toole/Robbins&lt;br/&gt;This project is intended as a continuation of an attempt
to synthesize a broad picture of the three-dimensional circulation of the
Pacific using observations of deep hydrography and nutrients from the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) together with data from subsurface floats.
The approach to be taken will divide the Pacific into approximately 70 boxes and
use a linearly constrained inverse estimation technique to deduce a circulation
that best fits the observations while conserving mass and tracer
fluxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
