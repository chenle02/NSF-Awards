This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a product platform based on polymer cushion coated glass slides with
controlled surface charge density for membrane protein microarray fabrication.
The key technical objectives for Phase II research are : (a) to complete
quantitative studies on surface charge density in the formation of supported
phospholipid bilayer (SPB) from charged lipids , (b) to develop the chemistry
for the grafting / adsorption of polymer cushions, (c) to measure the activities
of membrane proteins in SPBs, and (d) to fabricate membrane protein microarrays
based on surface pre-patterning using soft lithography techniques.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of protein
microarrays for use in disease diagnostics and for drug discovery research. The
proposed technology will enable development of therapeutics aimed at membrane
protein targets.
