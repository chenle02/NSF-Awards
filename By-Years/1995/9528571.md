An understanding of spatial patterns of density requires information on factors
that influence habitat selection. This project involves a large experiment
designed to test several hypotheses regarding the effects of food availability,
risk of predation, interspecific competition, and density on movement and
performance of two species of voles in relation to habitat type. Clusters of
large experimental pens will be established that differ in plant cover and food
availability. Predators will be able to enter and leave the pens at will. Data
collected will document movements between pens and the body growth, survival,
and reproduction of voles that reside in each pen. Voles play an important role
in grassland and tundra ecosystems. They provide a major food source for a wide
variety of predatory mammals, birds, and snakes. At high densities voles can
have a substantial impact on the structure and composition of vegetation. The
results of this experiment will not only provide insight into the link between
habitat selection and spatial patterns of density of animals in general, but
also produce valuable information for application to issues of conservation and
management of grassland ecosystems.
