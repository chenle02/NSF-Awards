Weathers 9320368 This is a three-year cooperative research project proposed by
Drs. Duncan Weathers and Jerome Duggan, University of North Texas, and
Professors E.K. Lin and Yueh Chung Yu, Academia Sinica. This proposal is to
conduct study to understand the M-shell ionization of rare earth elements by
incident carbon, oxygen and silicon ions at the energies between 1 and 15 MeV
using the accelerator facilities in Taiwan and at the University of North Texas.
The project plans to make 5,400 cross section measurements of which 2,700 will
be made interaction, which is fundamental to the development of most modern
technologies. This project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan
National Science Council (NSC), which provides major support for laboratory
operation. The modest support from the NSF in this case is extensively leveraged
by the NSC.
