This research will develop direct micromechanical simulation techniques to
model damage accumulation in composite materials. Tools will be developed that
are capable of evaluating the composite material deformation, fracture, damage
accumulation and failure based on the underlying microstructural defects and the
evolution of the microstructural state under multiaxial loading. These
simulations will establish a direct relationship between the evolution of the
microdamage accumulation and the loss of load-carrying capability of the bulk
composite material.
