This award funds research on two distinct topics in economic theory. The first
project develops new approaches to the modeling of decision making subject to
temptation. The idea is that a person views his/her own future self as driven by
currently unknown 'desires' which may conflict with the person's current view of
what he wishes to consume. Surprisingly, this approach turns out to be
mathematically equivalent to alternative recent approaches where the person
expects his future self to choose what to consume to maximize his current
utility subject to certain 'self control' costs. The second project studies
implementation with evidence. More precisely, the PI and his collaborator
consider the optimal design of social institustions when agents may posess
evidence to back up their claims. They show that the use of evidence has
dramatic effects on what can be achieved via appropriately designed
institutions. Since virtually all work on this topic has ignored the possible
availability of evidence, these results have important implications for
rethinking the theory of optimal institutional design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is basic research in economic theory. It has broader impacts because it
adds to a toolkit that researchers in economics, business, political science,
and law can use to build models that incorporate important aspects of human
behavior.
