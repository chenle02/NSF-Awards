The New York Hall of Science will develop a major exhibition on quantum theory--
one of the most important developments in physical science in this century and
one which has not been significantly treated by science museums. This exhibition
will be the first major museum program to introduce quantum theory and its
applications to the public. Elements of the exhibit will include models of the
atom, the puzzle of light, applications of the theory and, finally, the human
story of the creation of a new theory. Numerous participatory exhibits will be
developed in conjunction with the project so that visitors can learn by doing.
Formative evaluation will be an integral part of this exhibit. This technique
has recently been adopted by museums as a way to test exhibit prototypes with
museum visitors and then redesign as necessary. A workshop will be held for
museum personnel and a guidebook, Improving Exhibits Through Formative
Evaluation, will be produced. This book will be the first complete description
of the formative evaluation process and will be a valuable addition to the
museum field.
