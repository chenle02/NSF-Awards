Objective of this project is to design, build and test a short-base deep sea
tiltmeter. The program will involve the use of adaptation of proven components
from land based systems for use with ocean bottom seismometers. The primary
goals are to evaluate (and reduce) noise expected from the gimballed mounting
and different methods of ground coupling. %%% If we are to understand more fully
intrusive and extrusive processes that create new crust at mid ocean ridge
volcanoes, we need to make more direct observations of the processes. One of the
most fruitful techniques for obtaining the necessary observations is the
measurement of ground deformation--especially tilt--with a network of
instruments. This project represents the first step toward developing such a
network.
