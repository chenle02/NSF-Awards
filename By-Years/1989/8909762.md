The Synthetic Organic Program supports the work of Yoshito Kishi. Kishi,
Professor of Chemistry at Harvard University, is involved with a broadly based
program of natural products chemistry. Included is a continuation of work on the
synthesis of palytoxin, one of the most complicated organic compounds known. As
a consequence of these efforts, new approaches to examine the shapes of complex
molecules, and answers to fundamental questions about factors controlling the
shapes of sugars are being developed. New methods for understanding the
phenomena of bioluminescence and syntheses of compounds responsible for natural
bioluminescence are also being undertaken. The major objective of this work is
to make significant contributions to organic chemistry through investigations
into eight research topics including: the total synthesis of palytoxin, the
local conformational analysis of palytoxin, the conformational analysis of C-
and O- glycosides, preparation and chemistry of helical oligopeptides,
bioluminescence chemistry of dinoflagellate and krill systems and the
bioluminescence of mushroom systems.
