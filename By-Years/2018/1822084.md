This NSF award provides partial support for the 2018 Stochastic Networks
conference, to be held June 25-29, 2018, at the International Centre for
Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) in Edinburgh, and the preceding Summer School in
Applied Probability, June 18-22, 2018. The 2018 Stochastic Networks conference
is interdisciplinary, bringing together mathematicians, engineers, physicists
and operations researchers to discuss cutting-edge research on Stochastic
Networks. The conference will emphasize new model structures and new
mathematical problems that are motivated by contemporary developments in various
application domains, as well as new mathematical methods for random graph and
stochastic network analysis. Research in this area is strongly motivated by
applications arising in diverse domains, ranging from the traditional areas of
telecommunications and manufacturing to service operations, biological and
social networks, neural and neurological networks, revenue management, and
healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conferences on Stochastic Networks are
highly interdisciplinary and bring together mathematicians and applied
researchers who share an interest in stochastic network models. The 2018
Conference will continue the tradition of featuring talks on key developments at
the cutting edge in stochastic networks, ranging from the development of new
mathematical techniques in currently active areas of research such as infinite-
dimensional scaling limits, rare event simulation, dynamics on random graphs,
and graphical models, to applications in diverse areas including distributed
systems and cloud computing, biochemical reaction networks, revenue management,
randomized algorithms in computer science and statistical physics. In addition,
the 2018 edition of the conference also has the special characteristic that it
will be preceded by a special Summer School in Applied Probability, which will
feature courses on spatial stochastic models, energy systems and measure-valued
scaling limits of stochastic networks. &lt;br/&gt;The conference website is at:

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
