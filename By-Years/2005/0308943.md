This project concerns a mathematical description of how mammals process some of
the most elementary characteristics of the visual scene, such as orientation and
spatial frequency. This processing takes place in the primary visual cortex
(V1). In particular, experiments, which measure the response of neurons in V1 of
a macaque monkey observing a screen with a drifting, standing, or randomly-
flashed sinusoidal grating, will be described and analyzed with the aid of a
coarse-grained neuronal model of V1. This model is a nonlinear integral
equation, whose properties will be studied analytically as well as
computationally. The coarse-grained model incorporates vital anatomical
information, including the architecture of the orientation- and spatial-
frequency-preference neuronal maps of V1, the sizes and strengths of the
cortico-cortical neuronal connections, and the detailed layout of the neural
input into V1. The orientation and spatial-frequency tuning of V1 neurons as
functions of time will be computed and compared with the experimental data, with
an eye on determining which cortical achitecture better describes the true
biology: feed-forward (which assumes no importance of the cortico-cortical
interactions), or feed-back (which assumes that cortico-cortical interactions
contribute crucially to the spatio-temporal evolution of the neuronal tuning
curves). The work will be performed in collaboration with neuroscientist Robert
Shapley and applied mathematicians David McLaughlin and Michael Shelley at New
York University's Center for Neural Science, in the framework of a year-long
visit by the PI, Gregor Kovacic.
