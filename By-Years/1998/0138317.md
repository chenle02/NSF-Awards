AST-0138317&lt;br/&gt;Gary, Dale E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2 year study to
investigate the technical challenges for constructing a new technology,
frequency agile solar radio telescope called FASR will be conducted. The science
measurement requirements for three key science areas: 1. coronal magnetography,
2. solar flares 3. particle acceleration, and space weather will be used to
develop the instrument system functional requirements. The proposal contains
detailed task lists, personnel assignments, areas of study, and an initial
management plan. An initial design study is the deliverable. Products from the
design study will be an improved cost and schedule estimates and a better
understanding of the engineering and technology scope of FASR telescope and
instrument system. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
