9408545 Iwasaki When humans reason about the behavior of the physical world,
reasoning with images plays a crucial role. However, artificial intelligence has
so far mostly ignored visual reasoning, concentrating instead on the use of
propositional representation methods, which are not necessarily suited for
representing primarily spatial information. The proposed work aims at developing
techniques for making use of diagrammatic reasoning techniques in the context of
predicting behavior of spatially interacting objects. A general architecture for
diagrammatic reasoning systems will be designed and programs based on
architecture that solve such problems using a diagram in a way similar to that
of humans will be implemented.
