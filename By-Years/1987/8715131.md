This award will support ongoing collaborative research between Professor Mary K.
Gaillard of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Pierre Binetruy,
Laboratoire d'Annecy-le-Vieux de Physique des Particules (LAPP) in Annecy,
France. The research program will focus on the study of quantum corrections to
effective non-renormalizable field theories. The primary goal is to understand
supersymmetry breaking in the observable sector of effective four-dimensional
field theories suggested by superstring theories. Previously developed covariant
loop expansion techniques will be generalized and extended. Implications of the
results for inflation and other aspects of cosmology will also be studied. The
U.S. and French research groups have collaborated extensively in the past. This
project will contribute to increased exchanges between the two groups on this
topic, which addresses issues at the forefront of elementary particle theory.
