9353304 Parrish The Cleveland City School District will implement a self-study
assessment and planning project to define the needs, set priorities, improve
coordination of existing programs and design a comprehensive science and
mathematics reform program. This effort will be built upon a broad based vision
for educational reform and school improvement developed through the
collaborative efforts of the City of Cleveland, the Superintendent, the Board of
Education and key community stakeholders. Two groups, The Commission for
Systemic Reform in Mathematics and Science Education and The Steering Committee
will direct the self study and planning initiative. An advisory council will
assure continued constituent participation and information exchange. ***
