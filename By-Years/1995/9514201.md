In human vision, it is not clear how the visual system maintains the sense of
relative brightness under widely varying conditions of lighting. This work
exploits an approach using "induction", where a neighboring field affects the
perceptual quality of a target field; for example, a gray area next to a dark
background looks bright, while the same gray area against a light background
looks dark. This illusion works whether the overall illumination is at high or
low levels. A novel technique based on this property is used here, where the
target is a band and on each side of the band there are both dark and light bars
forming a grating, which induce an illusory grating of varying brightness to
appear within the band itself, which really has a single constant brightness.
Standard matching techniques are used to measure how of dependent the effects
are on mechanisms for contrast, and on global (wide-field) vs. local (narrow
field) spatial brightness mechanisms. Results from this work will help unravel a
fundamental problem in vision, and will have an impact beyond visual
neuroscience to perceptual physiology in general, and could be important in the
design of visual displays for many applications.
