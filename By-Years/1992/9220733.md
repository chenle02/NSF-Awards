Theoretical research will be conducted on various aspects of systems which have
topological quantum numbers. Research on the quantum Hall effect will be
continued and the question of where the current is generated in a Hall device
should be clarified. Work on the analogy between the quantum Hall effect in a
two-dimensionally modulated system and the theory of phase transitions will also
be continued. New work on the motion of quantized vortices in superfluid helium
at very low temperatures is being started. A comprehensive review of topological
quantum numbers will be written. %%% Theoretical research will be conducted on
the meaning and cause of various quantum effects. Systems to be investigated
include the two-dimensional electron gas and its manifestation through the
quantum Hall effect and superfluid helium. The influence of various defect
structures, such as vortices, will be the focus of this work.
