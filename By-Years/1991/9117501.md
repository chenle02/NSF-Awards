The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project under the Hungary
Joint Fund between Dr. Denes Berenyi, Institute of Nuclear Research of the
Hungarian Academy of Science, and Dr. John Tanis, Western Michigan University,
is to investigate fundamental two-electron processes in ion-atom collisions.
Two-electron processes involving continuum states can play an important role in
the dynamics of ion-atom collisions, and, therefore, provide insight into the
few-body problem. This project will work to determine the mechanisms responsible
for continuum-electron emission and to evaluate the role which the electron-
electron interaction plays in giving rise to continuum electrons. Studies will
be conducted for several ions colliding with neutral gas targets over an energy
range from a few keV/u to several MeV/u. Individual processes will be isolated
and investigated using coincidence techniques in which continuum electrons are
recorded in coincidence with projectile ions emerging from the interaction
region in specific charge states. This project in nuclear energy fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
