The photochemical and photophysical consequences of attaching reactive
chromophores to the hydrohpobic tail of amphiphilic molecules will be
investigated. The thrust of the program will be to define the structural
features of the microheterogeneous systems which dictate the resultant reaction
processes. The reactive groups to be investigated include styryl and stilbene
moieties. Bifunctional phospholipids will be utilized in order to provide
molecular species which have spatially exact geometries. These geometries place
reactive functional groups in favorable positions for reactions such as
cycloadditions. Interactions between reactive groups such as stilbenes,
styrenes, and polyenes will be studied in dilute, mixed, and pure dispersions in
an attempt to separate intermolecular and intramolecular processes. %%% This
grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor David Whitten at the University of Rochester. The studies will be
directed to establishing a better understanding of the factors which control
chemical reactions in heterogeneous systems. The systems to be investigated are
unique molecules which have both hydrophilic (attracted to water) and
hydrophobic (repelled by water) properties. By incorporating reactive chemical
groups that are responsive to light as an integral part of these molecules, it
is possible to produce a variety of reactions which might otherwise fail to
occur. Implications for the medical and materials areas of science are numerous.
