Goldbring proposes to continue the use of techniques from logic, specifically
model theory, to answer questions about structures in analysis. More
specifically, he plans on: (1) using the techniques of nonstandard analysis to
investigate problems in infinite-dimensional Lie theory and geometric group
theory; and (2) continuing the development of continuous logic and model theory
for metric structures. In regards to item (1), he plans on investigating how one
can use the technique of hyperfinite approximation in infinite-dimensional Lie
theory by embedding infinite-dimensional objects inside of hyperfinite objects
in the hopes that the finite-dimensional theory will apply to the hyperfinite
objects and the infinite-dimensional objects embedded in them. In regards to
(2), Goldbring plans on continuing the study of foundational aspects of
continuous logic, including definability of sets and functions and the behavior
of independence relations in various metric structures.

Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies what properties of
mathematical structures can be described in terms of first-order logic. This
understanding can often lead to solutions to problems in various mathematical
areas by taking general model-theoretic facts and interpreting them in specific
contexts. This approach has been most successful in discrete situations, such as
algebra and combinatorics. Recently, a model theory has been developed for
structures arising in analysis, namely those for which a natural notion of
distance exists. This model theory could then prove useful for solving problems
in areas where classical model theory has yet to be able to help. That being
said, model theory, in the form of nonstandard analysis, has found applications
in analysis by providing a rigorous notion of infinitesimal and infinite
numbers. Nonstandard analysis has found applications in such diverse areas as
number theory, probability theory, and economics. This project proposes to use
nonstandard analysis to answer questions in Lie theory, which is a very
important mathematical area used in physics and engineering.
