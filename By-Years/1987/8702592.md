Atomic Absorption/Flame Emmision (AA/FE) spectrometry is a technique that has
found wide-spread use in the analysis of trace metals. It is a ubiquitous
experimental method cutting across all the physical and biological sciences.
Access to AA/FE instrumentation is crucial to a modern chemistry department. The
Department of Chemistry at Southeast Missouri State University will use an award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to help purchase an AA/FE
spectrometer and high performance liquid chromatograph with a conductivity
detector for trace element and anion analysis. The teaching and research
capabilities of the Chemistry Department of this RUI institution will be
enhanced materially by acquisition of the instrumentation which also will serve
as a resource for the departments of Agriculture, Biology, and Earth Science.
Areas of research in chemistry that will be enhanced center around studies in
trace metal analysis of soils and aquatic organisms and trace anion studies
related to acid rain and acid phosphatase activity.
