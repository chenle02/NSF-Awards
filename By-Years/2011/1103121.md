This workshop highlights recent developments and future directions in the field
of nonlinear dynamics, with an emphasis on fluid processes. This is an
interdisciplinary field that not only addresses significant issues of
fundamental scientific importance, but also involves numerous applications to
many technical problems facing society today. The workshop will bring together
people with wide interests in nonlinear dynamics in a small, intimate setting
that is conducive to one-on-one and small-group interactions. A major emphasis
is to provide young investigators (undergraduates, graduate students and post-
doctoral fellows) with an opportunity to learn about the range of studies being
done by leading experts in the field. Another reason for this workshop is to
highlight the value of research at undergraduate institutions and research
experiences for undergraduates. In fact, a few of the invited speakers are
currently at predominately-undergraduate institutions, and several speakers at
research institutions also work frequently with undergraduates. The NSF grant
will provide stipends to help cover the expenses for students and postdocs who
are attending the workshop.
