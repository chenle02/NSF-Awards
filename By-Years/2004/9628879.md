9628879 Morgan The PIs propose to test core-mantle exchange in the Earth using
the Pt-Os isotope system to study rocks which are believed to have been brought
to the Earth's surface in mantle-derived plumes. If succesful, 1860s anomalies
in plume-derived materials may provide the only direct test of core-mantle
interaction. The proposed study of Os and Pt isotopic systematics will be made
on an array of mantle-derived rocks as well as on mantle and crustal rocks that
may be recycled into the mantle, to determine if excess Os in plume-derived
materials can be used as a test of core-mantle interaction. ***
