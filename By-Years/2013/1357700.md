The Conference on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME) holds a series
of annual conferences on research issues in economic theory and statistical
methods for the analysis of economic data. The purpose is to stimulate
discussion and research in these areas, and to investigate the application of
cutting edge mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to economic
research questions. The conferences focus on six topics, three in statistical
methods and three in economic theory. Each topic conference meets once each
year. The conferences are broadly interdisciplinary, including researchers from
mathematics, operations research, and computer science. They also facilitate
communication between academic scholars and government economists, since the
statistical methods covered are important for macroeconomic
policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference topics include Bayesian Econometrics,
Forecasting, Microeconometrics, Time Series Analysis, Decentralization, and
Mathematical Economics/General Equilibrium. There is a special series of
econometrics sessions aimed at young scholars. Conference locations include
universities around the United States.
