This project has constructed three Profiling Current Meters and deployed them
as part of the TROPIC HEAT moored Intensive Array (Dec 1984-July 1985). Data
from these deployments is being analyzed to understand equatorial wave- mean
flow interaction at low frequencies and the statistics of shear and
stratification fluctuations in relation to mean Equatorial Undercurrent
structure at high frequencies.
