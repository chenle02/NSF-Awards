This grant is for support of a Chapman Conference in "magnetospheric substorms"
in Hakone, Japan. Chapman conference are topical meetings sponsored by the
American Geophysical Union and are designed to promote opportunities not
normally available through the format of large meetings. The funds will be used
to partially support the travel expenses of some US graduate students and
scientist. The site has been chosen to encourage international participation,
especially from Asian and Australian scientists. The main objective of the
proposed conference is to provide an opportunity to present the results of
recent progress on substroms and to build up a focused picture on this topic.
