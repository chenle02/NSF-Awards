Institution: Hope College&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0353566&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Herbert L. Dershem&lt;br/&gt;Title: REU Site: An Undergraduate Research
Participation Program in Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
establishes an REU site in several fields of computer science, including
bioinformatics, algorithms, wireless networks, and programming environment
research. The site will build on Hope College's 12 years of experience in
hosting summer undergraduate research interns. Research projects available to
the interns include: automated animation of abstract data types; text formatting
to enhance code understanding; field programmable gate arrays; measures of
software complexity; functional modeling of genes and cellular processes; etc.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site will support 8 students per year for 10 weeks
in each of the 5 years of the project. Recruitment will target women and
underrepresented minority students and at least 4 of the 8 will be non-Hope
College students. The interns will meet graduates of the Hope Summer Research
program currently in graduate school, and will visit research labs at a major
university where they will meet professors and graduate students.
