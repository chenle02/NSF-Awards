Elevated convection, in which thunderstorms draw on their energy from
instability focused well above the earth's surface, is impactful in terms of its
capacity to produce heavy precipitation yet often poorly forecast. Such events
are particularly common during the warm season over the mid-Mississippi basin,
in close proximity to the principal investigator's home institution. The primary
objective of this effort is direct observation of the upper atmosphere prior to,
during and after episodes of elevated convection through analysis of special
serial radiosonde observations and other means. Radar observations will be
exploited to describe storm life cycles, while a variety of observations (both
routine and specially collected) will be analyzed and ultimately assimilated by
simulations using the WRF (Weather Research and Forecast) community model to
further explore and describe processes responsible for creating environments
conducive to outbreaks of elevated convection. Comparative examination of
resulting successful and unsuccessful forecasts (including hit, miss, and null
events) will serve to more clearly identify sources of forecast error and
required improvements, with an emphasis on heavy rainfall and snowfall events.
Broader impacts will include uniquely detailed observations of a variety of
high-impact precipitation events and direct interface with the forecasting
community. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in a wide
array of data collection and analysis activities, and result will be integrated
across an array of university courses.
