This project supports residents to use government data to document and examine
patterns of health and wellbeing in their communities. Using health data that
has been collected by government agencies enables community members to answer
some of the questions they may have about illness in relation to the places they
live. By working with residents to analyze and interpret official data, the
residentsâ€™ own insights about their health and environment will be augmented by
the science they are helping to produce. The project will build researcher,
community, and institutional capacity to continue collaborative science work on
environmental health justice and health equity beyond the project. The results
of the project will be disseminated by public events in which residents are key
speakers as well as in press conferences, social media, blogs, and articles. The
project team will initially analyze data from government sources, such as cancer
registries and Medicaid databases, to produce initial health data about patterns
of health and illness. In partnership with communities, open collaborative
workshops will be held where local people will discuss the initial data and ask
additional health questions for the team to try to answer with the data, which
the researchers will then share in a follow-up workshop. This iterative workshop
method enables local community members to participate in the analyses and
interpretation of government-generated health data, making the science more
relevant to their lives. The scientific reports produced from these public
workshops may be used by local residents to support their health claims towards
regulatory and policy change. This process of using community-based
collaborative workshops to analyze and interpret government data to answer local
questions can be replicated for many kinds of data and a variety of community
questions. To facilitate this, the final project deliverable is an online manual
explaining how residents in other states or regions can replicate this process
to produce their own data analyses from government sources.
