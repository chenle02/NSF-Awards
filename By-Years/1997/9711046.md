SummerScape is a two-week science and engineering summer experience targeted to
middle school girls and teachers . It is designed to help girls experience
confidence and success in science and engineering tasks and to provide teachers
with equitable teaching methodologies. Before and during the camp experience,
teachers methodologies will be assessed. While at camp, they will be provided
with experiences designed to build equitable science teaching pedagogy and
practice. Single sex and mixed sex environments will be used to assess
difference in quality or quantity of teacher-student interactions during the two
weeks of camp. Data will be collected to determine if the training makes a
difference in attitudes and achievement of middle school students and in
teaching practices after the summer experience.
