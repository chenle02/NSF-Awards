The 2009 Georgia International Topology Conference will be held at the
University of Georgia in Athens, GA, from May 18 - 29, 2009. Since 1961,
topologists at the University of Georgia have organized and hosted a major two
week long international topology conference every 8 years. The 1961, 1969, 1977,
1985, 1993 and 2001 conferences came at times when fundamental new ideas were
surfacing that set the direction of research in topology in the following years.
Our conferences highlighted these ideas and focused attention on new promising
directions of research. We aim to do the same with the 2009 conference, by
highlighting exciting new developments, including advances in Heegaard Floer
homology, contact and symplectic topology, broken Lefschetz fibrations,
hyperbolic three-manifolds, applications of Ricci flow, quantum invariants of
knots and links, and other new developments.

The purpose of the 2009 conference is to have the most important results
obtained during the last few years in geometric topology and related geometry
presented to a wide topological audience and to be a place for communication and
interchange of new ideas. Our conference has historically generated great
interest among established researchers, but also among graduate students and
recent PhD's. We have always paid special attention to inviting young
researchers in topology to speak. The combination of speakers and topics to be
presented will offer students and fresh PhD's a great opportunity to listen to
and interact with the leaders in the subject as well as with successful
mathematicians at the beginning of their careers. We will publish a proceedings,
similar to those published by Prentice-Hall in 1961, Markam in 1969, Academic
Press in 1977, Dekker in 1985, AMS and International Press in 1997, and AMS in
2003. Previous proceedings of the Georgia Topology Conference have been among
the best of any conference proceedings. To continue the tradition, we will
invite all speakers to submit articles, and we will enlist conference
participants to help review submitted articles for the proceedings.
