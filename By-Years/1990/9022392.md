Dimension driven Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems hold great promise for
enhancing productivity and competitiveness of the early conceptual stages of
mechanical engineering design. Current systems suffer one of two sets of
deficiencies. Variational Geometry systems suffer from speed problems and
problems controlling which solutions their geometry solution mechanism converges
to. Constructional or "parametric" systems, while fast, have a less intuitive
user interface and a less flexible geometry representation. The objective of the
research is to develop a new graph-theory based technique to convert a
variational geometry description to a constructional system. Preliminary
research in two-dimensions has indicated the prospect of dramatically increasing
the speed of variational geometry solution, and thus increasing the range of
problems to which it may be applied. Successful implementation in a mechanical
design package will greatly expand the utility of conceptual design software to
the mechanical engineer.
