The work to be carried out comprises the following topics: 1. The experimental
Study of metastable helium atoms and molecules at extremely low temperatures. 2.
Interactions of helium metastables with liquid helium surfaces. 3. Magneto-
optical trapping of atomic helium metastables. 4. Penning ionization dynamics.
5. Further development of polarized electron sources.
