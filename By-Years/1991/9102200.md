This study is devoted to those coupling processes which determine the
dynamical, thermal, and chemical structure of the lower thermosphere (ca. 90-150
km): dynamical coupling with lower atmosphere regions due to upward propagating
gravity waves, tides, and planetary waves; and vertical and latitudinal
transport of O, NO, Na, and other minor neutral and ionized species due to
dynamical/electrodynamic interactions in the lower thermosphere. A range of
dynamical models will be utilized to address such problems as self-consistent
interaction between gravity waves, tides, and the mean flow; convective
instability arising as a result of such interactions; seasonal/latitudinal and
local time variations in turbulent mixing and "tidal mixing" on the transport of
minor species; and the role of gravity waves as a momentum source for the
thermosphere. In addition, a newly developed method of assimilative data
analysis will be applied to global measurements of tidal winds and temperatures
to provide (a) self-consistent global predictions of tidal winds, temperatures,
and densities; and (b) realistic tidal boundary conditions for the NCAR
Thermosphere-Ionosphere General Circulation model to study tidal effects on the
dynamics and minor consituent chemistry of the atmospheric region above 100 km.
