Dr. Kritsuk and his team study dynamics of magnetized turbulence and star
formation in molecular clouds with numerical high-resolution simulations. The
computations are done with the Enzo code, an Adaptive Mesh Refinement and grid-
based hybrid code (hydrodymamics and N-body), which is designed to do
simulations of astrophysical and cosmological structure formation. The self-
consistent computations model effects such as gravity, differential rotation,
and radiative transfer on the self-organization in compressible magneto-
hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the multiphase interstellar medium. The models
here incorporate more complex physics, a higher dynamic range of resolved
scales, and employ improved numerical methods. In particular, the modeling
includes the scaling of multiphase MHD turbulence and its change with the
turbulence magnetization. The simulations for the dynamic range of MHD models
for molecular cloud formation utilize petascale computational facilities and
attempt to resolve the inertial range of supersonic magnetized turbulence in the
multiphase interstellar medium. This will test competing star formation models
and phenomenological theories when the simulations are compared to observations.
More broadly, a better understanding of turbulence is also needed for
understanding the acceleration and propagation of energetic particles, transport
of momentum and energy in various astrophysical systems. As part of this
project, one graduate student will be trained in the development of numerical
methods for modeling supersonic MHD flows, in large-scale parallel computer
simulations, and in methods for statistical analysis and visualization of
magnetized multiphase turbulent flows.
