This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for two years for a T1
wireless connection between the Potsdam Central School and SUNY's residence
halls. This arrangement allows them to share a T1 link to the Internet, taking
advantage of the high school's use of the link during the day and the university
residence halls' use of it during the evenings and nights.
