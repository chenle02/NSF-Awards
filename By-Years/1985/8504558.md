Linear multivariable feedback systems possess many properties not present in
single-loop systems which pose great difficulty in design. One such difficulty
is that multivariable systems can have radically different stability margins
depending on where the loop is broken. An even greater difficulty is that a
multivariable feedback system may possess good stability margins against
uncertainty appearing at only one loop breaking point, yet may be destabilized
by small perturbations appearing simultaneously at more than one point. The goal
of this research is to understand how feedback properties, e.g. performance and
robustness, at one point of a multivariable system are related to those
properties at other loop breaking points and to investigate how properties of
the plant and compensator affect this relation. The techniques used in the
research include a method for approximating closed loop from open loop
properties. This research should prove useful in developing methods for solving
multivariable control system design problems.
