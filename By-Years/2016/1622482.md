This proposal provides funding for the third GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups in
Security Research workshop, which will held in May 2017, in San Jose CA. This
day-and-a-half-long workshop intended for women and underrepresented minorities
in computer security and privacy, will be co-located with the IEEE Computer
Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the workshop is to increase the
number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security research.
Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating system
security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal and
policy issues. The goal of the organizers is to encourage Ph.D. students who are
female and from underrepresented groups to choose security as their field of
specialization. Their approach is to show the wide range of problems within the
field and how women and underrepresented groups are working towards solving
those problems.
