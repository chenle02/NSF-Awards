This research will 1)determine the provenance, depositional environment, and
mechanics and direction of sediment transport for volcaniclastic sandstone
bodies within the uppermost Gazelle Formation 2) determine more accurately the
age of the uppermost Gazelle Formation by generating a conodont biostratigraphy
3) to better constrain the timing of amalgamation of the Yreka-Callahan terrane
and the Trinity Ultramafic Complex by: a) evaluating contact relations between
the Gazelle Formation and the Trinityh Ultramafic Complex and b) U-Pb dating of
zircon from a pluton that cuts a thrust contact between the two terranes. This
work will provide important constraints on three competing models for the
accretionary history of lower Paleozoic eugeoclinal terranes in California and
Nevada. In addition, the study will bear directly on any evaluation of the
hypothesis that supracrustal terranes in the eastern Klamath Mountains occur
within extensional allochthons. In doing so, research will fill a conspicuous
gap in reconstructions of Devonian paleogeography. Existing reconstructions
simply label regions in California and western Nevada as "island arc"
environments. We must provide better resolution via well-constrained local
geologic histories if we are to evaluate further the existing models of tectonic
development outlined above.
