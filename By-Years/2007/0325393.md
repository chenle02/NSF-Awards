&lt;br/&gt;PRAM-On-Chip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
magnitude of the algorithmic knowledge base that has been developed for the PRAM
(Parallel Random-Access Model, or ``Machine'') algorithmic model makes it a
serious alternative to the serial algorithmic theory. The following concrete
open problem is addressed in this research. Can a breakthrough high-end parallel
computer be built, through truly designing a machine that can look to a
programmer like a PRAM? Eluding a solution for several decades, the problem of
building a general-purpose parallel computer that is significantly faster than
its serial counterpart has been a major open problem for computer science since
the inception of the field. This proposal will provide the research backbone in
the research and development of a holistic computation framework, called
Explicit Multi-Threading (XMT) that seeks to resolve this long-standing open
problem. The proposal also has an educational outreach component. Technical
activities include the following: architecture studies including memory systems
and interconnection networks, improving XMT compiler analysis, enhancing XMT
optimizations, automatic extraction of parallelism for XMT, prototyping
performance of several APIs, as well as some modern software architectures, on
XMT. The education outreach component will involve the development of a computer
organization course on XMT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
