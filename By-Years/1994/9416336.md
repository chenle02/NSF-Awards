9416336 Agnew This research is to develop and install 5 high-stability geodetic
monuments in a 15 station expansion of the GPS (Global Positioning System)
permanent network in southern California around the area of the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. The stability of unanchored geodetic monuments is estimated to be
the major factor in the quality of data from this network at some sites. This
work will enable the study of the stability of 5 of the sites and produce plans
that well enable future construction to be contracted to external sources. Major
funding for the array expansion is to come from NASA, USGS, and the Southern
California Earthquake Center in addition to this grant. This project is a
contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is
supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
