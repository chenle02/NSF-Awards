The goal of this project is to develop innovative, experimental teaching
laboratories through the collaborative efforts of recent alumni currently
enrolled in doctoral programs and the principal investigator. Alumni, acting as
consultants to an institution and curriculum that they understand, are
contributing their expertise in cutting edge research to the development of
laboratory exercises in developmental physiology, mobility, hormonal signalling,
ion pumping, immunology, cancer physiology, and neurobiology. The equipment
acquired includes: laminar flow hoods, an environmental shaker, an incubator,
and inverted microscopes for maintaining and examining tissue cultures, a time-
lapse video recorder to monitor cellular migration, and microplate washer and
reader for ELISA assays done in immunology and cancer biology laboratory
exercises.
