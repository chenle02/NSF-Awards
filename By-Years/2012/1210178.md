This action funds Mary Southern of University of Minnesota to conduct a research
project, entitled "Intelligent agent-based disaster simulation," during the
summer of 2012 at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan. The host scientist is Dr.
Tomoichi Takahashi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is advancing research in search
and rescue by modeling evacuation behaviors of people after a disaster, such as
an earthquake. Modeling people's behaviors is being done in the context of the
RoboCup Rescue Simulator, an open source software tool used to study strategies
for disaster and emergency management in large cities. This modeling enriches
the simulator and increases understanding of the dynamics of many simulated
people in disaster situations. The visualization provided by the simulator helps
students understand graph search algorithms. Implementing different path finding
algorithms on the large city maps used in the simulator shows students how
different algorithms affect performance in realistic situations. There is also
potential in the future for this simulator to become a tool to assist rescue
workers in developing plans for large-scale disaster response.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
