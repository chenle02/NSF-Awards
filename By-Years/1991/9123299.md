The Rochester Youth Development Study is a longitudinal examination of the
causes and correlates of serious delinquency and drug use. Phase I of the study,
funded primarily by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
(OJJDP) with some supplemental support from the National Science Foundation and
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), followed a sample of high risk
youth from the seventh and eighth grades until their eleventh and twelfth grades
at six month intervals. This grant provides partial support for Phase II which
will follow the youth to early adulthood. The objectives of the study are to
understand the social and psychological factors associated with different stages
of criminal careers, especially the termination of careers for many offenders
during early adulthood, and the continuation and escalation of criminal behavior
for others. Since much of the data collection for Phase II will continue to be
funded by OJJDP, the NSF support will be used for data analysis and
dissemination of findings. Two major theoretical models that are being tested,
interactional theory and network theory, will be analyzed. Also, issues such as
onset, specialization, desistance, and the link between delinquency and drug use
will be examined. A number of publications are planned as a result of this work.
This project provides the most extensive delinquency data set assembled to date
and already has contributed significantly to a better understanding of the
factors that contribute to, as well as insulate against, serious involvement in
crime and delinquency. We have relatively little information about criminal
involvement at the transition from adolescence to adulthood and virtually no
information relating contemporary factors at these ages to earlier attitudes and
behaviors. Doing so allows for a fuller description of criminal careers and
extends theoretical understanding of factors associated with continution of or
desistance from deviance. The results of this research promise to influence the
study of delinquency for years to come.
