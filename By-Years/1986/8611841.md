The use of polyhedral methods in integer programming has proven to be
significant both on theoretical and a practical grounds. The scheduling of
airline crews is a typical example of an important problem which seeks better
solutions and is dependent upon advances in the field. Professor Cook will
investigate new polyhedral results which currently appear to offer significant
potential for major breakthroughs.
