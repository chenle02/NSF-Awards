The main objective of this project is to provide urgently needed knowledge in
the field of wind engineering on the effects of extreme wind (hurricanes,
typhoons) on man-made structures and to study the dynamic response of these
structures. Field work will be conducted in Shanghai. Results from the Shanghai
field work will be beneficial, contributing to improved building design and
advancing scientific knowledge and research in both countries.
