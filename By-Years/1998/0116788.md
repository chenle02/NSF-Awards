Food web dynamics of benthic and pelagic ecosystems are driven, in large part,
by communities of prokaryotes and micro-eukaryotes. The phylogenetic diversity
of the micro-eukaryotes range from protists to various adult and larval stages
of invertebrates. Many of these species are difficult to identify due to their
inability to grow in culture media or due to their indistinguishable
characteristics. Molecular techniques have been instrumental in unraveling the
complexities and activities of these communities. The purpose of this research
is to explore the use of ion-paired reversed phase (IP-RP) UPLC for nucleic acid
fragment analysis, which is a system that is successfully used in biomedical
research. If this technique is adaptable to marine research, the time required
to identify and quantify populations will be reduced from days to minutes. IP-RP
HPLC will be tested with four diverse research programs: presence of uncultured
fungal populations in marine habitats; distribution of plant and animal
pathogenic bacteria and fungi in African dust; community structure of copepod
larvae in the Florida Bay food web, and genetic dispersal of Caribbean corals
and reef fishes.
