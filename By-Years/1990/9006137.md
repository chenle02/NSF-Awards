The fundamental goal of this research is the development of the science base
necessary to reduce the time and effort required to assemble and use computer
tools for simulation and analysis of physical systems. Most existing simulators
solve a limited range of problems, are difficult to modify, and are difficult to
integrate because each uses its own representation scheme. The research will
address these issues and build an environment that automates many of the steps
in creating a simulator. Defining a simulator requires; choosing equations to
model the behavior of the physical systems, choosing and implementing
computational methods for solving the equations defining mechanisms to handle
the complex control flow of simulations, and choosing representation schemes for
physical objects, their properties, equations, etc. Currently, these steps are
carried out implicitly, without computer aid. The researchers will design a
software architecture that allows simulators to be described in terms of
equations and mathematical properties naturally suited to the problem. The
research will develop: a model representation system for representing the
quantities and laws that describe the physical behavior in a given analysis
model; and analysis specification system, a language for defining the behavior
of a simulation in terms of the laws and quantities; a scene editor; and a low
level interface for integrating existing modules such a numerical packages or
finite element codes.
