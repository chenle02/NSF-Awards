The main objective of the project is to develop a research plan in the area of
parallel algorithm design aiming to gain a better understanding of how and when
parallel computers can help solve problems faster than sequential ones.
Efficiency of parallel algorithms for a given problem is measured by the ratio
of the time needed by the best known sequential algorithms for the same problem
and the product of the time and number of processors used in the computation.
When the ratio is a constant, the parallel algorithm is called efficient. An
emphasis of the research is to design efficient parallel algorithms for some
graph problems.
