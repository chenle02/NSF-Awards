This project, BREEZEFS, aims to build a specific set of six file system
transformations that expose new capabilities to ease the development of future
cloud systems and the adoption of multistore devices. Historically, the job of
the OS is to provide common functionalities and thus speeding up innovations at
the application layer. For this project, the focus will be the cloud system. By
targeting the cloud and multistore era, the vision is to ease the development of
future cloud systems and the adoption of multistore devices. This will be
accomplished by developing new common functionalities into the in-kernel file
system stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed software artifacts will be
shared widely with the open source community and with various industry partners
to help shape the next generation storage systems. This is the era of Big-Data
computing, and storage systems are one important core. Users from many areas
(science, healthcare, business, education, military, and government) may benefit
from this work.
