This grant will support research in the synthesis of new high temperature
superconducting compounds. By identifying new classes of materials which exhibit
this unusual behavior, the common features that are identified in the different
materials may provide insight into the nature of the physical mechanism
responsible for this phenomenon. This grant was selected from more than 260
proposals submitted in response to a solicitation for proposals in High
Temperature Superconductivity in April, 1989. The research is supported by the
Solid State Chemistry program with a significant contribution from the
university.
