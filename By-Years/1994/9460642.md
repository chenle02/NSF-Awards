9460642 Brower This Small business Innovation Research Phase I project
investigates a method to monitor the mechanical response of civil engineering
systems by use of fiber-optic sensors. The effect of forces exerted on
structures during natural catastrophes -- such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
tornadoes, floods, or severe storms could be measured. These devices will be
rugged, low-cost, and will provide monitoring of strain in real time -- allowing
a constant vigilance of the state-of-stress during aging and changing loading
profiles. This would increase the ability of the engineer to assess the safety,
state of repair, and expected lifetime of the structure. The ultimate goal of
this research effort is to commercialize a fully developed optical sensor that
can be used throughout the construction industry. The commercial sensor systems
will contain "proven" low-cost optical-fibers, hardware, software, memory
display, and support equipment. This will be achieved through research, and
application of a new approach, that uses innovative ideas built on existing
fiber-optic interferometric sensors. If successful, it will be possible to
accurately measure the mechanical response properties of civil engineering
structures in any desired location. Strain from long-term and transient loads
can be measured and recorded. The sensors could be used in structures that use
concrete such as buildings, parking garages, or bridges. Currently, large civil
engineering structures are visually inspected. Extensometers or mechanical
measuring devices are used on a periodic basis to evaluate the structure.
Unfortunately, visual inspections usually occur after a structural problem has
already manifested itself. Presently there are no sensing devices on the market
that provide constant monitoring of the state of the structure.
