A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment on the R/V
Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic
capabilities. The vessel is owned by NSF and operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University under a cooperative agreement. The Langseth
is different than other vessels in the Academic Fleet in that it is a designated
National Facility. It provides a unique combination of capabilities for imaging
the oceans, the seafloor and the solid earth beneath the sea. It is the only
vessel in the word dedicated to academic research that is capable of conducting
3D seismic surveys as well as extended offset 2D surveys. The tuned, linear
source array, consisting of up to 36 air-guns, with a total capacity of 6,600 cu
in is also unique asset of this vessel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015, R/V
Langseth completed 194 days, 130 (67%) of which were NSF funded. In 2016, the
schedule shows 165 days, all of which are for NSF. SSSE requested in this
proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furuno Doppler Speed Log FS-80
$15,945&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Support for upgrade of the Wet Lab
$46,895&lt;br/&gt;Engineering support Water Closet on navigating bridge

$372,200&lt;br/&gt; $470,245&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
