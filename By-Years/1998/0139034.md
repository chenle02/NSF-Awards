This award provides support for an REU Site in Cognitive Development at Yale
University. The goal is to provide undergraduates with an interest in
developmental psychology from a cognitive science perspective to gain mentored
research experience over the summer. The intellectual focus of the research will
be on how children and adults grasp the causal structure o the world around
them. Students will be involved in experimental design, data collection, data
analysis, and presentation of results of various studies. Weekly laboratory
meetings as well as several forms of training and small group meetings form an
instructional component to the internship. Six to eight students, recruited
nationally, will be involved in the 12-week program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented
students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
