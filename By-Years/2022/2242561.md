This project is aimed at environmentally benign conversion of biomass to high
value products. The significance of this project lies in converting biomass to
activated carbon that offers significant increase in value for a wide range of
applications, including water purification, air pollution control and energy
storage. Currently the activated carbon is produced from fossil resources that
are not only limited but they also produce harmful pollutants. Fundamental
issues to be addressed include basic reaction mechanisms in producing activated
carbon using supercritical CO2 (called sCO2). The project will provide a broader
impact in the field to produce high value activated carbon, as well as support
STEM education and diversity to benefit society with the availability of high
value activated carbon using biomass and sCO2. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
University of Maryland team will develop an advanced and environmentally
responsible biomass-utilization technology using supercritical CO2 (called sCO2)
to produce sustainable solid materials of enhanced value and application without
any economic and environmental impediments. The sCO2 treatment process will be
explored to increase the value of char produced with targeted applications
including energy storage materials, high-porosity sorbents as activated carbon
for water purification and air pollution control, carbon catalysts and high-
quality solid fuels. Fundamental investigations on reaction mechanism and
kinetics of high-pressure biomass conversion in sCO2 will be carried out to
understand solubility and thermodynamic properties of supercritical CO2 systems
for seeking versatility and control of product
characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
