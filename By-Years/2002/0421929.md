Rod and cone cells contain closely related but distinct photoreceptor proteins
called opsins, which have diverged to meet the differing requirements of night
and day vision. A recent study describes the first evidence for an exception to
that rule. The tiger salamander SWS II, P432, a cone-like pigment, is expressed
in both the blue sensitive cones and green rods. The promoter for the tiger
salamander SWS II gene has been cloned and shown to be functionally active in
photoreceptor cells. One goal of this research is to identify and characterize
the unique regulatory elements in the SWS II promoter. An additional goal is to
clone and sequence the SWS II, P434 opsin promoter from the closely related
frog, Xenopus. By comparing the salamander and Xenopus promoters, as well as
other promoters that drive rod or cone specific expression, the study will
contribute to the understanding of how the cell type specific expression is
achieved at the molecular level. The data will test the hypothesis that the
promoter of the tiger salamander SWS II, P432 opsin gene contains both rod and
cone-specific elements, driving opsin gene expression in both rods and cones.
This research will provide the basis for an undergraduate molecular genetics
course, for undergraduate genetics labs as well as undergraduate independent
research projects. Undergraduate biology majors and pre-service science teachers
in these courses will gain exposure to science as a process by participating in
classroom laboratory exercises designed around this research. Independent
research students will be encouraged to present their data at local and national
meetings. These opportunities are critical in the development of students as
scientists and science educators.
