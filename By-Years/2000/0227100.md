This Americas Program collaborative research project will support investigations
by Nicholas Hanges of CUNY H. H. Lehman College together with Paulo Cordaro of
the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil to study the impact of the lower order
terms on degenerate elliptic operators. The main interest is in analytic
regularity for partial differential equations with a focus on degenerate
elliptic operators as well as on complex first order perturbations of such
operators. Analytic hypoellipticity will be studied in the usual sense, in the
global sense and in the sense of germs. These properties are influenced by the
lower order terms and by the existence (or absence) of bicharacteristics (Treves
curves). The PI has discovered an operator that has an infinite number of Treves
curves over the origin, yet is analytic hypoelliptic at the origin in the sense
of germs. However, this operator is not analytic hypoelliptic in the usual
sense. This shows that Treves' conjecture, at least in the sense of germs, is
false. One of the goals is to understand the influence of the lower order terms
in the tradition of the work of Gilioli and
Treves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Degenerate elliptic partial differential equations
arise in many different areas of mathematics, and thus the resolution of
problems tackled in this project will have significance in several areas of pure
and applied mathematics in which one is interested in establishing that
solutions are analytic. There may even be applications in such distant fields as
economics and thermodynamics. The Brazilian PI and his institution are very
strong in the area of this investigation. As a result, U.S. students will have
the opportunity not only to become involved with cutting-edge problems, but
through these exchanges they will also be exposed to and begin to participate in
international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
