Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AWS)
network, first commenced in 1978, is the most extensive meteorological observing
system on the Antarctic continent, approaching its 30th year at many of its key
sites. Its prime focus as a long term observational record is vital to the
measurement of the near surface climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere. AWS
units measure air-temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal
surface height of 3m. Other parameters such as relative humidity and snow
accumulation may also be taken. Observational data from the AWS are collected
via the DCS Argos system aboard either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites
and thus made available globally, in near real time via the GTS (Global
Telecommunications System), to operational and synoptic weather forecasters. The
surface observations from the AWS network also are often used to check on
satellite and remote sensing observations, and the simulations of Global Climate
Models (GCMs). Research instances of its use in this project include continued
development of the climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere and surface wind
studies of the Ross Ice Shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AWS observations benefit
the broader earth system science community, supporting research activities
ranging from paleoclimate studies to penguin phenology.
