Three topics in mathematical quantum theory of systems of many degrees of
freedom will be investigated in this project. Of main interest are problems
related to the structure and stability of matter. First, rigorous estimates will
be established on the effects of correlations between many electron on the
binding and ionization in atomic and molecular systems. Second, the structure of
matter on the surface of a neutron star under large magnetic fields will be
mathematically analyzed. This study involves the fairly new area of
semiclassical analysis in the presence of a magnetic field. Third, are problems
related to the statistical mechanics of quantum spin systems, especially the
systems with continuous symmetry. Quantum mechanics is probably one of the most
successful attempts to give a mathematical description of the world around us.
However, while many complex quantum mechanically systems are fairly well
understood at a somewhat heuristic level, a complete mathematical analysis of
these systems is very difficult and very often lacking. The lack of a detailed
mathematical analysis of these systems is not separate from a lack of complete
understanding of the underlying physics. The mathematical analysis of a series
of these complex physical systems will be attempted and it is the hoped that new
mathematical as well as physical insight will emerge.
