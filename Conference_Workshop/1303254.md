Three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings are planned for the year 2013-2014.
The first conference is scheduled to be held at Davidson College (Davidson, NC)
on September 21-22, 2013. A second conference is planned for December 7-8, 2013
at Clemson University (Clemson, SC). A third conference will be held at the
University of South Carolina (Columbia, SC) in Spring 2014, currently scheduled
for April 12-13, 2014. Further information for these meetings will be linked to
the conference pages http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html and
http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/. The primary goal of these meetings
is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast the opportunity to
hear about recent research in number theory, pure and applied. The meetings
attract prominent number theorists outside the region. They also provide
regional mathematicians, particularly graduate students and junior faculty, with
an opportunity to speak about their research.The frequency and regularity of the
meetings promotes collaboration and strengthens working relationships between
participants.

The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings consist of two main conference series.
Initiated in 2006, the Palmetto Number Theory Series is a series of number
theory meetings managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of
South Carolina. The SouthEast Regional Meeting On Numbers is a larger regional
meeting that has been in effect since 1988. These meetings inspire collaboration
and broaden the scope of existing research interests within the general subject
of number theory. Meeting participants include mathematicians of all levels:
undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, junior and senior faculty. The
meetings have, in particular, provided an invaluable opportunity to students and
young researchers in this region working in number theory, strengthening their
knowledge of this research area and allowing them to disseminate their work
while at the same time obtaining constructive criticism from other participants.
These participants come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose
highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only
baccalaureate degrees. The organizers will also continue to attract a
demographically diverse participant base, including women and other
underrepresented groups.
