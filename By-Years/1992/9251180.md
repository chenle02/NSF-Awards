Future improvements in computer performance will rely on parallel computing,
creating a demand for programmers who can design and implement algorithms for
parallel architectures. The Parallel Computation Laboratory to be created under
this project will enable the institution to integrate parallelism into the
curriculum over a three-year period, and will support an upper-division elective
on parallel computation.The laboratory will be implemented using the Inmos
transputer, a relatively low-cost processor designed to cooperate with other
processors by exchanging messages over high-speed links. Sixteen transputers are
housed in Computer Systems Architects' SuperSet Plus, a platform that enables up
to four users to simultaneously use the transputers. Each user can specify a
processor interconnection network. The SuperSet will be connected to a SUN 4/110
host and will be remotely accessible via a local area network.
