Birman anticipates the development of an algorithm which will begin with two
oriented links L and L', represented by closed n and r-braids respectively (or
alternatively by arbitrary link diagrams with n and r Seifert circles
respectively), and which will decide whether these links are isotopic. For the
special case where L' is the standard representative of the r- component unlink,
she expects that the algorithm will be a polynomial-time algorithm. Morgan plans
to study compactness questions for families of hyperbolic n-manifolds, and more
generally the problem of compactifying such families. He intends to study the
C-infinity classification of algebraic surfaces using new ideas introduced by
Donaldson involving gauge theory. Hodgson's research deals mostly with the
investigation of 3- dimensional manifolds using geometric methods. His main
projects will involve the study of the hyperbolic Dehn surgery spaces introduced
by Thurston. By using techniques including Hodge theory and analysis of
geometric limits he hopes to obtain new results on the local and global
structure of these Dehn surgery spaces. This would lead to new methods for
constructing geometric structures on certain 3-manifolds, for example surface
bundles over the circle. He also intends to continue his investigations into the
variation of geometry as hyperbolic structures are deformed, especially the
kinds of degeneration that can occur: including degeneration to lower
dimensional limits and splitting along incompressible surfaces. This will
include some computational studies involving the construction of geometric
structures on 3-manifolds. He will also study the new invariants of 3-manifolds
defined recently by Casson and Floer.
