This project is a three-year exploratory study on schools that have low- and
high- retention rates in an urban school district. This research will address
low teacher retention for science and math teachers by comparing the policies
and practices of high- and low-retention middle and high schools, and by
examining the explicit and hidden costs associated with teacher turnover. The
specific goals of this project are to (1) identify school and district policies
and practices associated with high retention rates, (2) determine whether there
are differential effects of successful retention policies for middle and high
school science and math teachers, and (3) develop a comprehensive model of the
cost of teacher turnover. The anticipated outcomes of the project include: 1.
Profiles of the six high- and six low-retention middle and high schools included
in the study, 2. A cross-school analysis that describes the policies and
practices associated with high- and low- retention schools and how they
differentially affect math and science teachers, 3. A cost-of-turnover analysis
that includes the specification of the explicit and hidden cost categories
associated with teacher turnover and the application of the derived formula to
the district, and 4. A plan to replicate this exploratory study in four to six
urban districts across the country in order to test its findings.
