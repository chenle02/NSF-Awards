97-06624 Mao The PIs propose new experiments on the elasticity and equations of
state of mantle and core materials (eg. periclase, stishovite, ringwoodite,
majorite, Mg-Fe silicate perovskite, FeO, Fe) to address a broad range of
problems in geophysics. Recently developed techniques, including new diamond-
anvil cell (DAC) design, high-temperature laser-heating and resistive-heating
techniques, synchrotron single-crystal and polycrystal x-ray diffraction, and
Brillouin scattering spectroscopic techniques will be used to study a wide array
of materials of importance in studies of earth's mantle and core. ***
