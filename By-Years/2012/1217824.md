Testing is an extremely important part of any software development effort,
especially for programs that have access to sensitive resources (personal
information, sensor data, etc.) and that can be reached through the Internet.
The PIs' work will improve the state of the art in software testing for mobile
applications running on the open source Android platform, resulting in fewer
bugs and reduced testing effort.

The foundation of the PIs' work is random testing, where random numbers are used
as inputs to an algorithm for constructing test cases. Although random testing
has been shown to be highly effective for discovering serious bugs in complex
software systems, it suffers from various problems including the fact that it is
very difficult to engineer a random tester that doesn't spend a lot of time re-
exploring the same application behaviors over and over again. The PIs will build
upon their "swarm testing" work, which has been shown to be an inexpensive way
to increase the diversity of random test cases, and also to increase their
effectiveness in discovering bugs. Additionally, the PIs are investigating how
to marry random testing with modern symbolic execution methods, and how to use
feedback from executions of the software under test in order to improve the
efficacy of random testing.

The development of more efficient and effective testing techniques and tools
will lower the cost and raise the quality of software. Test coverage is a
challenging, open problem that is being addressed here in a novel way.
