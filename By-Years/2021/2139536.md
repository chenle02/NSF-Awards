The goal of this project is to select, study, and transform a set of
Characteristic Science Applications (CSAs) to enable next-generation science on
the NSF Leadership-Class Computing Facility (LCCF). The CSAs were chosen to
represent a broad range of science domains and computational approaches, and
each CSA will comprise one or more computer codes and a challenge problem to be
solved on the LCCF. The set of CSAs will enable the project to verify the design
of the LCCF and validate that the facility is applicable across the broad range
of science disciplines supported by the NSF when it is constructed. Furthermore,
the transformations made to the codes and workflows in the CSAs will provide
best practice models and implementation exemplars that will inform training
materials, tutorials, and other educational content. This will ensure that the
nation's science and engineering research community will be effective on the
LCCF from day one of operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to
evaluate a broad selection of science applications and challenge problems,
laying the foundations for a transformation of the computer codes in a way that
will support the LCCF broad goal of enabling a ten-fold or more time to solution
performance improvement over NSF's current leadership computing resource,
Frontera. This capability improvement will come from a combination of increased
scale of the LCCF primary computing system(s), increased capabilities of the
components (on-node I/O bandwidth, inter-node I/O bandwidth, disk and memory
bandwidth, access speed, cores, etc.) that make up the computing instrument, and
improvements in the software codes that make up the set of science applications
used to demonstration ten-fold performance
improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
