9404786 Hudak This project is in the area of programming language design and
implementation. The project will develop new methodologies and tools for the
design and implementation of domain specific languages (DSL). The project will
apply the following ideas to the embedded language design. Extensible Language
Design. Since a large portion of every language design effort is concerned with
the design of the syntax, and other minor issues such as conditional statements,
boolean and arithmetic operators, the project will investigate the use of
generic syntax for the design of DSL's. The idea is to extend the generic syntax
in a modular fashion to meet the needs of specific domains. Rapid DSL
Realization Using Partial Evaluation. In order to develop DSL compilers quickly,
the project will explore the use of partial evaluations. Although the resulting
compilers will be less efficient than hand-crafted compilers, they will be
constructed quickly and automatically, and they are provably correct with
respect to the interpreter specifications. First-Class Tools. The project will
apply the methodologies developed by the PI for specifying language tools such
as debuggers and profilers, to the development of tools for DSL. ***
