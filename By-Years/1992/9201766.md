Neither neo-classical economics--human capital theory--nor the neo-
structuralist approach alone explain the patterning of labormarket outcomes.
Both approaches overlook the organizational level process which not only
embodies structural influences, whether due to sectoral segmentation, industrial
effect, or class position, but also recognizes that these influences mediate
labor market outcomes. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the
nature of organizational effects on wage policy using Occupational Wage Survey
data and Manufacturing Sector Wage Survey data pertaining to Korea. This project
will contribute to sociological and social scientific understandings of the role
of organizations in labor markets by analyzing and drawing on the elements of
the neo-classical and neo-structuralist paradigms in order to develop a single
coherent theory. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
