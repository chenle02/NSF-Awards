The 2018 Shared Facilities Operations Workshop will serve to assemble a group of
Senior Investigators and Staff Scientists/Facilities Managers to discuss
critical issues in the running of Shared Facilities, particularly as they
pertain to the advancement of the materials research infrastructure in the
United States. The participants will be drawn from projects supported by three
different National Science Foundation Division of Materials Research programs:
The Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC), the Partnerships
for Research and Education in Materials (PREM), and the Materials Innovation
Platforms (MIP). The Intellectual Merit of the proposed Workshop is based on the
anticipated outcomes of how Shared Facilities at universities can be run more
efficiently to advance materials research and innovation. In particular, there
will be a focus on how instrumentation distributed across the country can be
most effectively and efficiently employed in a manner that avoids the
establishment of redundant instrumentation. The Broader Impacts of the proposed
Workshop include making freely available all of the presentations and discussion
notes of the Workshop to interested parties, including the suggestions of best
practices for how to run efficient Shared Facilities that help university and
industry researchers advance the gamut from fundamental understanding and
readying products for the marketplace.
