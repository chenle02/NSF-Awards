This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor Sita
at the California Institute of Technology who will provide new experimental data
on polystannanes that can be used to test the accuracy and reliability of
predictions at the ab initio level of theory concerning the structures,
stabilities, and properties of these group 14-heavy-atom analogs of organic
molecules. New types of protecting groups will be developed that can be used in
conjunction with the Sn-Sn bond forming hydrostannolysis reaction for the
programmed construction of complex polystannane structures that include linear
oligomers, branched dendrimers, propellanes, prismanes, and bicyclic structures.
%%% In this project Professor Lawrence R. Sita will develop new and expand
current strategies to synthesize linear oligomers, branched dendrimers,
propellanes, prismanes, and other bicyclic polystannane structures. The targeted
organo-tin compounds have the same tin- framework as the carbon skeletons in the
lighter hydrocarbon analogues. Sita's study will catapult organo-tin chemistry
to the forefront by providing valuable insight into its scope and limitations
that will be important to materials applications and theoretical insight alike.
