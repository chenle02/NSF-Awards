Under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a provision of the Food Security
Act of 1985, the federal government pays more than a billion dollars annually to
landowners who have agreed to retire more than 25 million acres of cropland.
Little is known, however, about the efficiency or equity of this program or its
role in shaping land use in America. Using a geographical perspective, this
project will involve the use of map-based documentary evidence and intensive
fieldwork, including interviews conducted in 16 study areas. It will integrate
data from disparate elements of the discipline of geography, including detailed
information on the subtle gradients in agricultural land use and practices,
micro-spatial patterns of soil productivity and erodibility within individual
landholdings, and the influence of regional perceptions on landowners as they
respond to changing economic and political conditions. The primary focus of this
project is at the heart of geography, that is, the recording of patterns of land
use and the subsequent identification of factors that help explain those
patterns. Such an analysis in this context has the potential to lead to the
development of new theory encompassing long-run dynamic effects of how farmers
act in anticipation of government policies.
