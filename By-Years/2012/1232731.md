The research objective of this award is to connect structure to plastic
deformation in bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Experiments with fluctuation
electron microscopy (FEM) will be used to measure nanoscale medium-range order
in BMGs. The FEM data will be combined with an empirical interatomic potential
in a hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo structural refinement, producing models with
realistic short- and medium-range structure. Research on Pd-Si BMGs will provide
an essential test of the generality of a recently proposed structural model for
Zr-Cu-Al BMGs that consists of nanometer-regions with crystal-like and
icosahedral-like internal structure. If crystal-like nanometer scale regions are
a general feature of BMG structure, it could have significant impact on models
of their plastic flow.

If successful, this research will lay the fundamental scientific groundwork for
expanded applications of BMG alloys, by eventually assisting design of new
alloys with desired mechanical and glass-forming characteristics through
detailed understanding of their structure and its connection to plasticity. The
research team will involve undergraduate and graduate students, especially from
under-represented groups, and will engage the general public and K-12 students
in the excitement and outcomes of the research.
