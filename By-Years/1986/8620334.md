A fundamentel understanding of soil behavior under cyclic loading conditions
such as in machinre foundations and construction siting conditions under heavy
vehicular traffic is, at best, inadequate. A high safety factor is generally
used in large construction operations due to the inability to quantitatively
predict the soil behavior under these conditions. The research develops a model
of granular soils based on a particulate mechanics approach for a wide range of
strains and incrementel loading conditions. Specific quantitative models will be
developed and verified under laboratory conditions and from field data. The
research makes systematic efforts to develop soil models and compares the
macroscopiv ptedictiond and relates the results with the micromechanic phenomena
at grain and contact levels. The results will provide quantitative verification
of the densification phenomena developed by the investigator. Large scale
experiments for this research will be carried in a unique test facility, in
cooperation with the University of Texas. The principal investigator is a
recognized expert in this research area. A grant is recommended.
