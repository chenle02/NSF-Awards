Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference on Multiscale Effects in Material
Microstructures and
Defects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much
progress has been made over the past several decades in understanding the
effects of microstructures and defects on the macroscopic properties of a wide
class of technologically important materials. The goal of this conference is to
bring together mathematicians, engineers, and scientists working on analytical
and computational problems related to microstructures and defects in materials
and multiscale modeling techniques in general. The conference will provide an
opportunity for established researchers, recent Ph.D.'s, and advanced graduate
students to interact, share novel ideas, and possibly initiate new
collaborations. The organizers of this conference aim at attracting a large pool
of advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s. Emphasis has also been placed
on ensuring the active presence of female investigators and students in an
effort to promote the participation of underrepresented groups. Abstracts of
delivered talks and a summary of the open discussion session (in which new
directions of research will be discussed) will be posted on the conference's web
page.&lt;br/&gt;
