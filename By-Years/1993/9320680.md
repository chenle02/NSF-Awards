9320680 Taylor STRATEGIC PLANNING'S ROLE IN ESTABLISHING UNIVERSITY POLICIES AND
PLANS FOR TEACHING, RESEARCH AND SERVICE Universities are under pressure to
contain costs as a result of declining revenue growth and competing priorities.
Also, universities are being criticized by the public for neglecting
undergraduate students in favor of research activities. With cost containment
and reallocation counterpoised against calls for research investment, and with
old assumptions being questioned, higher education officials are searching for
techniques to maintain the quality of their programs while stabilizing or
downsizing their institutions and controlling costs. This study seeks to extend
earlier research by determining the role institutional planning plays with
respect to fundamental mission issues affecting graduate, research universities.
The study will examine a set of issues and planning processes at the
institution, college and department levels at ten Carnegie Classification
Research I universities, five public and five private. Data collection will
include institutional planning documents, research policies, organizational
charts, annual reports from engineering and science departments, and related
documents. Selected institutional officials will be interviewed concerning
planning approaches and institutional mission. A survey will be repeated
(Larson, 1987) to detect any changes in planning organization, policies, plans
and attitudes that facilitate or detract from engaging in strategic planning. A
content analysis approach will be used to analyze the data collected from the
interviews and institutional documents. A test of statistical differences will
be applied on all survey items for any significant changes between the Larson
survey and the survey in this study.
