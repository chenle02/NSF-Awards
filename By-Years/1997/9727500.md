This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program
provides continued support for studies of fundamental reactions of coordinated
ligands by Dr. Joseph L. Templeton, Department of Chemistry, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Research will be carried out in three areas all
involving the synthesis of organometallic complexes utilizing the tridentate
hydridotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate ligand, Tp'. The strategy for each area
is to explore fundamental reactivity patterns of coordinated substrate ligands.
The first area extends the chemistry of chiral d4 complexes of tungsten
previously shown to successfully control stereochemistry at ligand beta-sites. A
cationic methylene carbene complex will be used for stoichiometric and catalytic
reaction studies of substrate ligands. For example, catalytic aziridine
formation occurs by reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with imine adducts. Single
enantiomer studies will be pursued. The second and main area of the project
involves the use of a new high oxidation state d2 tungsten oxo system which
simultaneously accommodates both pi-acid and pi-base ligands. New d2 tungsten
complexes should yield chiral organometallic derivatives that contain sigma or
pi bound organic ligands. Preliminary results show interesting and different
reactivities such as ligand coupling reactions (C-C bond formation) and proton
addition at the oxo group converting W=O to W-OH, a rare example of an
organometallic terminal hydroxo ligand. These reactions will be extended to seek
catalytic transfer of nitrene and carbene ligands and to generate chiral d2
complexes suitable for promoting Lewis acid assisted organic transformations.
The third area involves the preparation of chiral Tp' derivatives of Pt(IV) from
known hydrido complexes in order to generate vacant sites for electrophilic
activation of organic substrates. This work has potential for great impact
because it may give insight into how C-H bond activation reactions work in
electrophilic, late transition metal complexes. This project will increase our
fundamental knowledge of transition metal mediated reactions of organic
substrates. In addition, these and related compounds may have applications in
promoting or catalyzing important organic transformations, including ones of
interest to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
