Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
connect Americans with international collaborators in engineering education
research by recommending research areas most likely to benefit from American-
international collaboration and by hosting a workshop to facilitate this
interaction. Within traditional engineering research areas, international
collaborations have developed around specific topics but, since engineering
education research is a relatively new area, international collaborations have
not yet developed. The project team is analyzing conference publications to
identify specific engineering education research areas that would benefit from
strong intellectual collaboration and partnerships between researchers in the
U.S. and one other nation or region. The two or three areas are being selected
through a comparative publication analysis, and this analysis also is being used
to identify one international location with complementary research strengths for
the 2-day international workshop. The project is providing support for nine
American researchers to travel to the international location. A small initial
advisory board is reviewing the publication analysis results to recommend the
workshop topics and research experts; then a different, content expert advisory
board is planning specific aspects of the workshop including agenda, invitees,
assessment, and dissemination. Evaluation efforts are using participant surveys
at the end of the workshop and long term tracking of co-authorship and proposal
patterns. Results are being disseminated by a publication in the Journal of
Engineering Education describing the comparative document analysis and through
the American-international collaborations around specific engineering education
research areas leading to joint publications and proposals. Broader impacts
include the resulting international collaborations, dissemination of the results
through publications, and specific efforts to involve individuals from
underrepresented groups on the advisory board.&lt;br/&gt;
