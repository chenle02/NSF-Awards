This National Science Foundation award provides partial support towards travel
and accommodation of U.S. based students and early career researchers attending
the Geometric and Asymptotic Group Theory and Applications (GAGTA) conference
2017, being held at the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain, July
3-7, 2017. The annual conferences in this previously funded series attract the
world's leading researchers in geometric and asymptotic group theory. This year,
for the first time there is a pre-conference week for students and young
researchers that features three mini-courses by experts, several talks by young
researchers themselves, and time for informal interaction, with the goal to
prepare these early career researchers for full participation in the conference
the following week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GAGTA conferences cover a variety
of areas in geometric and combinatorial group theory, including asymptotic and
probabilistic methods, as well as algorithmic and computational topics involving
groups. Specific areas of interest include group actions, isoperimetric
functions, growth, asymptotic invariants, random walks, algebraic geometry over
groups, algorithmic problems and their complexity, generic properties and
generic complexity, and applications to non-commutative cryptography. Like its
predecessors, GAGTA 2017 will bring people from group theory and computer
science together and strengthen the connections each field has with the other.
