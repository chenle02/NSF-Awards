The conference is to bring together the world leaders of mathematicians with
interests in nonlinear partial differential equations. We will focus on
nonlinear elliptic equations, motions of surfaces, fluids dynamics and equations
from mathematical physics. We expect the meeting to be a place in which many
discussions and collaborations are initiated.

Almost all physical phenomena, such as those in Quantum Mechanics, Fluid
Mechanics and Superconductivity, are described in mathematical terms by partial
differential equations. One theory of high temperature superconductor can be
described by a nonlinear elliptic equation. Analysis of this equation will lead
us to a better understanding of the physical phenomena. In the last year of the
20th century, it is a good time to focus our minds on what we have accomplished
and on new challenges that will face us in the next century. The aim of this
conference is to review the progress and, more importantly, to discuss new
challenges and new applications of nonlinear partial differential equations
