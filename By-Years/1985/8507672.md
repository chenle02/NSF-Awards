Base isolation systems offer an attractive method to mitigate the effects of
earthquake loadings on structures. By partially decoupling the structure from
the earthquake ground motion, the inertial forces within the structure can be
reduced, thus significantly decreasing the potential for damage to the
structure. The base isolation concept is receiving considerable attention
throughout the world as a design strategy. This research project will develop
guidelines that will help the practicing engineer to decide whether the base
isolation system strategy is appropriate for a particular structure. The project
will develop a comprehensive state-of-the-art summary, determine the dynamic
response characteristics of various base isolation systems, and develop
guidelines for the use of base isolation systems. This information will then be
systematically catalogued for use by engineers.
