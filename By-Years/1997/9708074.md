Hilbish 9708074 The PIs have been conducting a detailed analysis of a hybrid
zone between two species of marine mussels, Mytilus edulis and M.
galloprovincialis that are sympatric in Europe. The PIs' have shown that 1)
strong directional selection occurs within hybrid populations that eliminates
Mytilus edulis and M. edulis-like hybrids, 2) directional selection is offset by
immigration from pure populations of M. edulis, 3) the balance between dispersal
and selection is presently stable, and 4) hybridization has been an important
feature in the evolutionary history of these species. These studies focus future
research in a new direction: the primary issue in understanding the dynamics of
this hybrid zone is to determine how pure populations of M. edulis are
maintained. The maintenance of pure populations of Mytilus edulis is an
essential element of the dynamic equilibrium between dispersal and directional
selection that maintains and shapes this hybrid zone. The PI will propose to
test the hypothesis that M. edulis has a superior physiological capacity to cope
with silt in its diet and that pure populations of this species are selectively
maintained in estuarine environments where silt concentrations are high. This
hypothesis was suggested by the observation that pure populations of M. edulis
are associated with estuaries that have high silt loads and preliminary results
from separate studies that indicate that M. edulis may have a much greater
absorption efficiencies when exposed to diet containing high concentrations of
silt. The PI will also propose a combination of laboratory and field experiments
to test this hypothesis. Laboratory experiments will test for the proposed
physiological differences between M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis while the
field experiments are necessary to demonstrate that these differ ences have
significant consequences in nature.
