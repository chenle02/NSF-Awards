John Stanton of the University of Texas is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply new theoretical methods for
the treatment of radicals and biradicals. The methods are based on coupled-
cluster theory, which emphasizes highly accurate treatments, and the
applications are transient molecular species, which require a balanced
description of several electronic configurations. In addition, models for the
treatment of electronic spectra that involve nonadiabatic vibronic coupling
effects will be developed, and accurate calculations of vibrational levels on
excited state potential energy surfaces will be
performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radical species play a central role in many
areas of chemistry, included organic chemistry, combustion processes, and
atmospheric and interstellar chemistry. The new techniques developed in this
research project will allow extremely accurate and reliable predictions of the
properties of these species. Easy-to-use computer programs will be developed
that incorporate these new techniques and that allow for future, routine
application to related problems.
