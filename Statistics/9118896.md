This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support a reexamination of the
roles and uses of statistical theory and methodology in the field of geophysics.
One objective is the identification and initial formulation of statistical
theoretical questions arising in paleomagnetism and in estimating fields of
distortion or motion. A second objective is to identify needs for new
statistical methodology or for substantial modification and extension of
existing methodology for specific kinds of analysis frequently presented by
geophysicists in their research.
