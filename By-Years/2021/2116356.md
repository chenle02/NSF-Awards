granted systems of belief about language, are often implicit in discourse. What
is considered "standard language", "correct" or "appropriate" is a product of
the current time and societal forces at work, yet can also be contested. This
dissertation project examines language ideologies among individuals and
community organizations regarding gender labels, pronouns, and other linguistic
practices that are understood as having important implications for different
identity groups. It examines how individuals both reproduce and challenge
broadly circulating ideologies about language in the United States.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study consists of a year of participant-observation
among community organizations along with the analysis of a select number of
interviews. These methods allow the investigators to identify community members'
strategies of rationalizing language choices, including appeals to language
ideologies. Additionally, this project analyzes a corpus of Twitter data in
order to offer insight on how local discussions relate to those that circulate
broadly on social media. The linguistic description that results from this
project sheds light on how individuals negotiate their identities through their
language choices, how they make sense of these choices, and how novel language
practices may shape and become shaped by broader cultural
change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
