9218370 Shor In this project the PIs will examine the problem of how subduction
initiates at the Macquarie Ridge complex, which occurs 1500km south of New
Zealand and separates Pacific and Australian plates (Triple Junction with the
Antarctic plate isn't too far either). The P.I.s argue that this is the best
place in the world where to study this process. The field program includes side-
scan sonar/bathymetric swath (Hawaii MR1), 6-channel seismic reflection, and
gravity measurements aboard Moana Wave. The P.I.s will determine the deformation
process and test two different models of subduction initiation.
