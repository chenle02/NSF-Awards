A key ingredient in technological innovation is the capability of the available
workforce. The systems for educating and then professionally developing
technical personnel vary among leading industrialized countries. A systematic
examination of these similarities and differences can lead to a better
understanding of how to make this vital process more effective. Also the U.S.
engineering community is currently experimenting with differing curricular
approaches. This conference will bring together the experience from many parts
of the world and it is an ideal mechanism for a systematic and timely
examination of the education and professional development process in the U.S.
The result of the conference is expected to be a better understanding of other
approaches to this problem and this information will be able to be used to
strengthen the U.S. system.
