Professor Hull is engaged in an investigation of two separate projects: the
first concerns criteria for selection of taxonomic principles; the second
concerns the processes by which science itself develops. While seemingly
unrelated, Professor Hull is using the first study as a case for exemplifying
his arguments concerning the processes of scientific development. Although the
distance between alternative principles of biological classification and
anything that might be considered "evidence" for them is great, empirical
considerations can be brought to bear on the decision to choose one set of
principles of classification over others. Professor Hull argues that the
taxonomic principles that result in classifications that facilitate the
discovery of natural regularities are preferable to those that do not facilitate
such discoveries. Dr Hull is examining the recent literature in evolutionary
biology to see what sorts of classification aid either phylogenetic
reconstruction or the discovery of regularities in the evolutionary process. The
results of these investigations will in turn be used to support the contention
that the use that scientists make of each others work is central to the ongoing
process of science.
