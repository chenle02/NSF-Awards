9619405 Vohra The University of Alabama at Birmingham in collaboration with
Birmingham Southern College and Samford University will establish a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site for experimental and computational
materials research. Undergraduate students will be recruited from the
southeastern states, with a recruitment focus on four-year colleges and
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The students will be
involved in experimental research activities which include high pressure
synthesis and microwave plasma processing of electronic and optical materials;
computational research projects include electronic structure calculations and
molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, REU participants will visit
facilities in national laboratories and will be offered a course in scientific
communication. %%% The REU site, with a regional focus whereby high quality
undergraduates will be recruited from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and
Tennessee, and with an emphasis on four-year colleges and minority institutions,
has potential impact on underrepresented sectors of the undergraduate student
population in the sciences. ***
