The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has established the UNC Charlotte
49er Teach Noyce Scholars Program to prepare 12 high-school chemistry and
physics teachers with content expertise. Through a strong partnership among the
Departments of Physics and Chemistry, the College of Education, and the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, this high-quality teacher preparation program
uses the Learning Coach model to engage the best chemistry and physics students
in peer instruction, supported by faculty mentors. Those selected to become
Noyce Scholars enroll in pedagogy courses, attend seminars enriching their
knowledge of both science and pedagogy, attend state and national meetings on
science education, have summer internship opportunities, and are supported by a
three-person team of mentors, one each from the science faculty, the education
faculty, and a classroom teacher. Having completed the certification program,
new teachers continue to be mentored and supported during their first three
induction years. This project's success rests on its seamless collaborations
among disparate disciplines, strong administrative support, and the well-
developed Learning Coach model. It addresses a key need for well-trained high
school chemistry and physics teachers, particularly in underserved areas such as
rural North Carolina.
