The development and use of X-ray computed tomography was proposed in order to
perform measurements and optimize the air-sparged hydrocyclone (ASH). X-ray
tomography was previously applied in medical area. Development of calibration
standards and image reconstruction computer tomography for multiphase flow is
the primary objective of the research. Another objective is to correlate the
flow visualizations obtained on ASH with the separation efficiency. The ASH was
developed with the support from NSF, as a industry-university cooperative
research activity. It is expected that the proposed work will advance our
understanding of the X-ray non-destructive imaging tool for multiphase flow, and
will provide data on the flow structure in a relatively new separation
equipment.
