This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in marine
geology and geophysics. The U.S. investigators are W.D. Wilcock, University of
Washington; M.E. Dougherty Boise State University; D.R. Toomey, University of
Oregon and the French investigators are B. Ildefonse and D. Mainprice,
Monpellier University. The investigators will conduct seismic field studies in
the Oman ophiolite, which is an exposed ancient ocean surface. The primary
objective of the research is to study bulk physical properties and subsurface
structure. The field work and data interpretation will be conducted in
collaboration with the French group, in order to take advantage of their
structural and petrophysical knowledge of the Oman ophiolite.
