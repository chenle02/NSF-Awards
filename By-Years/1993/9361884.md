9361884 Anthony In-service performance of treated wood products depends on
consistently inducting specified quantities (retention) of preservative
chemicals to require depths (retention) of preservative chemicals to required
depths (penetration) within the wood. Quality control procedures to ensure
adequate penetration and retention currently rely on the removal of increment
cores from a subset of all treated members for subsequent laboratory analysis.
The proposed research will examine the feasibility of magnetically tagging wood
preservatives to enable simple nondestructive evaluation of penetration and
retention of preservative chemicals in treated wood. In magnetic tagging, a
small amount of extremely fine "sensor" particles is uniformly distributed
throughout the preservative prior to treatment. When subsequently interrogated
by eddy current nondestructive evaluation, the tagged wood responds with a
characteristics signature than can be related to preservative distribution. a
feature of eddy current testing involving magnetically tagged materials is that
electromagnetic energy can penetrate significant thicknesses of conducting
tagged materials. This permits the volumetric characterization of tagged
materials. The technical objectives of the Phase I research are (1) to evaluate
the feasibility of introducing ferromagnetic particles into preservative
chemicals and achieving penetration of the magnetically tagged preservative into
wood, and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of measuring penetration and retention
of magnetically tagged preservative with eddy current. ***
