This award will provide partial (25%) funding for the acquisition of a scanning
electron microscope and x-ray analysis system by Southwest Missouri State
University. The equipment will be installed in the Department of Geosciences and
used primarily by researchers in that department and the Department of
Biomedical Sciences. Research projects that will utilize the new system include:
Cambro.Ordovician conodont evolution and stratigraphy, the study of factors
affecting attachment of pancreatic necrosis virus to salmon embryos, and the
geochemistry of weathering processes in rocks.
