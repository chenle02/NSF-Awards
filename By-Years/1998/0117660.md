0117660&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hebert/URI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an
attempt to get direct information about isopycnal dispersion and property fluxes
in the ocean, over scales from O(1) Km to O(100) Km, by deploying clusters of
isopycnal RAFOS floats. Over their two-year missions, these floats will map out
the turbulent flow along two different density surfaces in a region of the
eastern, tropical Atlantic, roughly 1400Km west of Africa. The floats will
measure position, pressure, temperature and oxygen. Data on the trajectories of
the floats, together with data from a hydrographic survey carried out at the
time of float deployment, will be analyzed to provide estimates of absolute and
relative dispersion rates as well as strain, vorticity and mean flow. Fluxes of
temperature and oxygen will also be estimated. The experimental region coincides
with the edge of a tongue of low oxygen water that stretches westward from the
African coast. A secondary objective of the work is to obtain a better
description of the low oxygen tongue and, by obtaining data about flow and eddy
fluxes, determine the processes responsible for its structure. &lt;br/&gt;
