Migration within and across borders has important political, social, and
economic implications. This project will analyze migration corridors as a
conceptual process. As a consequence, this research will alter theories of
migration based on relevant laws and policies, media discourse, and trade
agreements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this ethnographic study employing a mixed
methods approach including interviews and macro-level analyses, this project
will examine the development and shifting formation of migration corridors. In
doing so, this research will analyze the often intersecting travel itineraries
of female migrant workers. By examining migration as a process within and across
migration corridors, this project provides an advance in theoretical
understanding of migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
