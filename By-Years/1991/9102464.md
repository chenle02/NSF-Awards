An efficient high speed computing environment is essential for protein and virus
crystallography. X-ray data collection, data processing, phasing of structure
amplitudes, constructing molecular models and structure refinement are all
computationally intensive procedures. This award will continue the support of
the computing specialists in the crystallography group at Purdue. In particular
the group will pursue the following specific computing objectives: generalizing
codes to make programs machine independent, develop detector and computer
independent software for analysis and processing of X-ray data, continue
software development for the determination of phases of structure factors.
