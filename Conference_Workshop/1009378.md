A constant theme in the research of Victor Klee and Branko Grunbaum has been the
discovery and development of surprising and powerful connections between
combinatorics and discrete geometry and other branches of mathematics. This
conference is aimed to be both a retrospective on these developments and an
educational opportunity for the younger generation who will be exposed to a
survey of the wide-spread contributions of the honorees. A second important
component of the conference will be three 1-2 hour long problem sessions spread
through the three days that will discuss open problems arising from the work of
Klee and Grunbaum.

Victor Klee and Branko Grunbaum founded several branches of modern combinatorics
and discrete geometry and spent their long careers (a total of 100 years between
them) at the University of Washington in Seattle. Their contributions has also
made an impact on several areas connected to mathematics such as optimization,
computer science, statistics, and the life sciences. This conference is intended
to be a world class celebration of the illustrious careers of these mathematical
giants.
