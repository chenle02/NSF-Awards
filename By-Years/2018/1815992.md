This project presents a collaborative research and education effort in graph
signal processing where interesting phenomena in nature can often be captured by
graphs since objects and data are invariably interrelated in some sense. Social
networks, ecological networks, and the human brain are a few examples of such
networks. A feature that these networks of interest have in common, is that they
define very large graphs. Algorithms used to compute properties of complete
graphs, rapidly become impractical when the graphs under study become very
large. Graph sampling thus becomes essential. The research explores a somewhat
radical departure from the prior work on graph sampling and is based on the
notion of stochastic sampling in irregular sampling grids. In concert with the
advancing the scientific goals of the project, the investigators will also
jointly develop a short course on graph signal processing and its applications
so as to introduce this emerging field to a broad set of
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While fixed-time sampling is well known, this
project focuses on stochastic sampling theory to graph signal processing and, in
particular, graph sub-sampling with and without knowledge of the signal. In the
case of sampling without signal knowledge, investigators intend to design
optimal sub-sampling grids that minimize low frequency energy in a binary signal
where investigators intend to develop low computational complexity dither
algorithms that closely mimic the ideal patterns. In the case of sub-sampling
with signal knowledge, the developed adaptive sub-sampling algorithms will
adjust the sampling rate based on the local frequency content of the signal to,
thereby, sample at just above the Nyquist rate of the sample within a small
region of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
