9514180 Abolins This grant supports a program of research in elementary-
particle physics with an international collaboration that studies properties of
proton-antiproton interactions at 2 GeV produced in the Fermilab Tevatron
colliding-beams acceleratop complex. Topics of interest include production and
decay of top quarks, precision measurement of parameters important for detailed
investigation of the validity of the "standard model" theoretical framework.
Included is support for instrumentation development to improve the capability of
DO and future detection apparatus. ***
