Modern multicores are designed around complex memory hierarchies that achieve
high performance with a high cost in design complexity and efficiency. The
reason is that delaying the memory access just a few cycles has an unacceptable
performance impact. This proposal decouples the memory operations in non-
critical and critical. The critical component is allowed to be incorrect which
results in a system with power savings, simplifications in the memory hierarchy,
and even the removal of complex memory coherence. The proposed sequential
consistency model allows simple programming models without performance or power
consumption impact.

This proposal addresses the challenge of excessive complexity in modern
multicore memory hierarchy. This complexity results in a power waste and
difficult programming models. For modern systems, the memory hierarchy
represents over half of the power. The proposed decoupled execution allows an
energy efficient implementation by moving the complex operations out of the
critical path. Furthermore, the proposed memory hierarchy allows for simpler
parallel applications because it avoids complex consistency models commonly
used. This proposal solution allows for an efficient implementation of the
simplest consistency model available. Overall, the PI hopes to make fundamental
advances toward energy efficient and simpler to use memory hierarchies.
