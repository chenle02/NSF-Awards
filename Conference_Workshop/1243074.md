The "Interactions between Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry" conference
will be held at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, October 20-21,
2012, as a special edition of the Route 81 conference series that has rotated
annually among Cornell University, Queen's University, and Syracuse University
for over two decades. This conference will bring together leading experts, young
researchers, recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in Commutative Algebra and
Algebraic Geometry from across the United States and Canada and from around the
world. The topics of focus are secant varieties, properties of fat points, and
homological invariants.

The conference will highlight many aspects of the strong interplay that exists
between Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra in the focus areas mentioned
above, enabling participants to gain a better understanding of current research
and recent advances on these topics. By providing travel and lodging support for
US-based participants, this grant will promote the career development of
graduate students and early career researchers from the US by bringing them into
contact both with peers and with leading experts from the US, Canada and abroad,
in an exciting atmosphere of intellectual engagement designed to stimulate the
exchange of ideas and to foster research collaborations among the participants.
