The Gorda Ridge is part of the global system of mid-ocean ridges along which
new ocean floor is created. The southern third of the ridge extends for a length
of about 120 km off the northern California coast and is characterized by a deep
axial valley covered by thick sediment fill. At least five volcanic centers rise
above this sediment cover at an average spacing of 15 km. These volcanoes
provide a unique opportunity to study the frequency of volcanic activity at mid-
ocean ridges, since the products of this volcanism should be recorded in the
accumulating sediment. The present project will use a set of previously
collected cores from this area to examine the episodicity of discrete volcanic
events and the chemical evolution of discrete magmatic centers in the rift
valley.
