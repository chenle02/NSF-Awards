9304601 Ross A loss network consists of a collection of resources to which calls
arrive at random times. An arriving call is accepted into the network when
sufficient resources are available; otherwise is lost. An accepted call sojourns
in the network for the duration of its holding time which is also random. This
research will include original work in the area of loss networks including the
development of: exact and approximative mathematical methodologies for solving
large loss networks; loss-network models for telecommunication applications such
as telephone networks with state-dependent routing, mobile cellular radio; and
ATM at the connection layer. ***
