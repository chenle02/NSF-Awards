The movement and redistribution of lipids among cells and tissues are essential
for normal growth and development. However, little information exists regarding
lipid transport during mammalian embryogenesis where dynamic remodeling of
tissues and systems occurs. Post-birth, lipoproteins, abundant in interstitial
fluid, blood, lymph and cerebrospinal fluid, transport water-insoluble lipids
throughout the body for utilization and storage. Apolipoproteins, the protein
components of lipoproteins, are suited uniquely to the reorganization and
transport of lipids. Expression of several apolipoproteins, including
apolipoprotein (apo) AI and apoE, has been observed during isolated stages of
development. However, their function(s) in embryogenesis have not been
investigated. Dr. de Silva will undertake two complementary approaches to
investigate the role of apoE and apoAI in lipid transport and redistribution in
the developing embryo. A mouse model will be used because of well-characterized
developmental stages and readily available apolipoprotein null mutants. First,
Dr. de Silva will describe and quantitate the apoE and apoAI mRNA expression by
in-situ hybridization in staged embryos and compare these results to the protein
distribution pattern obtained by immunocytochemistry. She will also examine and
quantitate the lipid-protein complexes secreted by staged mouse embryos. The
second approach is to evaluate the compensatory mechanisms that occur in double-
knockout mice generated by homologous recombination that lack functional apoE
and apoAI genes. Dr. de Silva will quantitate the lipids and proteins present in
lipid-protein complexes in these null mutants to understand the role of other
apolipoproteins (and proteins) in early lipid transport.
