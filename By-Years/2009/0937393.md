This research carries out an integrative, comparative synthesis and compilation
of known data among hydrothermal sites along the mid-ocean ridge at the
RIDGE2000 focus sites on the East Pacific Rise, the Juan de Fuca Ridge, and the
Lau Basin and extensively studied geothermal areas in Iceland. Analysis of the
resulting co-registered bathymetric/ topographic, morphological, geological, and
hydrothermal vent fluid chemistry and vent location data allow generation of a
detailed picture of the distribution of vents and vent sites with respect to
mapped and imaged structures, volcanic features, and hydrothermal deposits. Data
from repeat surveys and/or long-term monitoring provide detail on changes in
vent distribution and behavior over time to provide a clear picture of the
short-term evolution of hydrothermal activity at each location. Results shed
light on the interplay between heat sources, fluids and permeable pathways in
the ocean shallow crust which has direct implications for the transport of heat,
alteration of the crust, and distribution of hydrothermal products/ore deposits
(both active and fossil). Broader impacts of the work include postdoctoral
training and international collaboration with Icelandic scientists. Public
outreach to K-12 classrooms will also be carried out.
