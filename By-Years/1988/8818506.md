Among the many important changes which occur in the physiology of serum-
starved cells is the accelerated lysosomal proteolysis of many cytoplasmic
proteins. It has been demonstrated that ferritin is spared this fate in serum-
deprived K562 erythroleukemia cells. The absence of a specific recognition
sequence which codes for protein uptake by lysosomes during serum starvation may
account for the phenomenon. The proposed work will directly test this hypothesis
by detailed evaluation of ferritin physiology with serum deprivation and by the
creation of site-directed mutants of ferritin which can be used in cell
transfection experiments. The normal steady-state uptake of ferritin into
lysosomes may mediated by a specific receptor protein on the organelle. They
will construct modified ferritin cDNAs which contain the amino acid sequence
KFERQ which enhances the uptake of ribonuclease A from cytoplasm into lysosomes
with serum deprivation, determine whether any relationship exists between
ascorbic acid and serum starvation as concerns ferritin degradation, and use
isolated ferritin and lysosomes to explore the effects of serum starvation on
variables important to ferritin turnover such as cytoplasmic aggregation of the
protein and the interaction of ferritin aggregates with lysosomes. Also,
purification of a lysosomal membrane receptor for ferritin will be attempted.
