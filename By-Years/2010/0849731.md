This project examines the inmate grievance system in the California Department
of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) whose thirty-three adult prisons house
the largest prison population in the United States. Treating inmate grievances
as disputes, this research examines the dynamics of conflict resolution in the
extreme hierarchical setting of prison. The focus is on the meaning of the
grievance process from the point of view of inmates and prison officials, how
these meanings get inscribed in the written grievance narratives, their links to
different institutional locations, and their interactive quality. The research
hypotheses incorporate expectations that most inmate grievances fail as legal
maneuvers, and that the process is heavily asymmetrical; that prisoners have
various incentives for filing a grievance; that inmates' narratives shift and
evolve over time in interaction with officials' responses, while official
narratives tend to be more stable and reflect institutional strategies for the
containment of disruption; and, that while the internal grievance system may
represent a narrow and individualizing method of prisoner contestation,
nonetheless it may be empowering at a subjective level. The data are from CDCR
annual reports; the CDCR's Offender Based Information System; a random sample of
456 inmate grievance forms; and, semi-structured interviews with prison
officials and inmates in three California men's prisons. The research will add
to the theoretical literature on legal consciousness, disputing, and conflict
resolution. It will shed light on issues of profound constitutional and human
consequences, with the larger hope of revealing areas for improvement in the
principal process whereby inmates contest conditions of confinement.
