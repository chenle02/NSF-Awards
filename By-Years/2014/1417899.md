SuperMAG is a project to provide the Geospace community with high quality ground
magnetic field observations. It serves an important purpose in space physics
research by providing data necessary for solving many space weather and general
space physics problems. SuperMAG is headquartered at the Johns Hopkins
University Applied Physics Laboratory that has an excellent outreach program to
high school and undergraduate students.

The data available through the SuperMAG system are calibrated magnetic field
data from approximately 300 observatories around the world. The data have had
noise signatures removed as well as the signatures of current systems other than
those in and between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The data can be
rotated into geomagnetically useful coordinate systems. SuperMAG operates a web
site which provides ready access to the data in either digital form or as plots.
This grant will continue the operation of SuperMAG.
