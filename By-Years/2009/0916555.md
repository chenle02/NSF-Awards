The goal of this research is to develop new methods for improving the
performance of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. In particular, the
PI investigates "iterative contextual modeling", an approach to OCR in which
high confidence recognitions of easier document portions are used to help in
developing document specific models. These models can be related to appearance--
for example a sample of correct words can be used to develop a model for the
font in a particular document. In addition, the models can be based on language
and vocabulary information. For example, after recognizing a portion of the
words in a document, the general topic of the document may be detected, at which
point the distribution over likely words in the document can be changed. The
ability to modify character appearance distributions and language statistics and
tune them specifically to the document at hand is expected to produce
significant increases in the quality of OCR results.
