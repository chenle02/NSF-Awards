9452852 Hudson ABSTRACT Twin Cities Public Television proposes to develop, test,
and distribute a comprehensive multimedia collection and learning system which
will accompany the Newton's Apple television production. The multimedia
collection will consist of videodiscs, matching videotape of selected Newton's
Apple segments, CD ROMs, educator support materials, and computer software. The
project also will include a component which will train educators to integrate
the program into local curriculum. The materials are designed to be a
comprehensive learning system that focuses on the acquisition of fundamental
science concepts and skills which are adaptable to a wide variety of
instructional situations and the motivation of learners to study science. The
Newton's Apple Multimedia Collection will be disseminated through the National
Geographic Society, Inc. and special interest group such as the National Urban
League, the National Association for Bilingual Education and the National
Council of La Raza. Summer institutes and short courses will be co-sponsored by
the Sciene Museum of Minnesota and the National Science Teachers Association. .
