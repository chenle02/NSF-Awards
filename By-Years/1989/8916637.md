Nitrogen is the mineral element that plants require in greatest amounts and
whose availability often limits growth in agricultural or natural systems.
Plants obtain nitrogen predominantly in the form of ammonium or nitrate ions.
Although the absorption of ammonium and nitrate from the soil and assimilation
of these ions into organic compounds should theoretically be among the most
energy-intensive processes in life, no direct measurements of the energy costs
associated with these processes have been made. The proposed research would use
newly developed plant material and instrumentation to assess these energy costs.
The results of this research should improve the energy efficiency of fertilizer
applications.
