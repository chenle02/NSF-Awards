This award will support a research collaboration between Professor J. L. Menaldi
of Wayne State University and Professor Maria Garroni of the University of Rome,
Italy. The investigators intend to study various research problems in stochastic
control and related classic analysis. Their study should lead to an enhancement
of our basic theoretical knowledge and expand the range of applicability of
several areas of modern stochastic control theory. The proposed project builds
on a successful prior collaboration and has the potential to make a solid
contribution to the field. For this study the underlying probabilistic models
are described by stochastic differential equations related to diffusion,
possibly with jumps, in finite dimensions. Mathematically this is a relatively
well-developed area that permits an in-depth analysis of model problems. For
optimal control, a dynamic programming principle is adopted as a unifying
approach. This gives rise to nonlinear partial differential equations, and
variational or quasi-variational inequalities.
