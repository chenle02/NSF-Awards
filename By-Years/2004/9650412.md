The purpose of this project is to create a new interactive computer laboratory,
dedicated to the visualization, manipulation, and analysis of Earth Science data
for MSU undergraduate students. It is important for students, as future
teachers, scientists, and citizens, to know how to work with and analyze
quantitative data. The equipment purchased would allow the Department: I ) to
provide hands-on experience, education, and training for Geoscience
undergraduates in quantitative geography, geology, geophysics, remote sensing,
Geographic Information System (GIS), and computer mapping; 2) to give more
stimulating and improved learning experience through modern educational
technology to students enrolled in general education and science electives,
particularly pre-service teachers and introductory Geoscience students utilizing
state-of-the-art hardware and software; 3) to provide more productive education
and experience in the senior year for Geosciences undergraduates than presently
available; and 4) to establish a bridge between undergraduate and graduate
curricula of the Department. Geoscience introductory mapping and image
interpretation courses have recently been modified to introduce students to
digital image processing and GIS. The new equipment will be used in those
beginning courses; a new, digital processing-based, intermediate level
Geoscience course, and senior courses in remote sensing/GIS/computer mapping.
Planned evaluation and dissemination of the impact of the project are discussed
in the proposal. Implementation of this plan will impact both majors in
Geosciences and non-majors with regard to modern technologies associated with
the rapidly growing fields of remote sensing, GIS, and computer mapping.
