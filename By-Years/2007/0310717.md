The Engineering Research Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Science and Technology
at Colorado State University (CSU) in partnership with the University of
Colorado (CU), the University of California, Berkeley, and the Center for X-Ray
Optics, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The P.I. and Center Director is Dr. Jorge
Rocca, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at CSU. The vision of
the ERC is to inexpensively harness the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), soft x-ray
range of electromagnetic radiation to image and measure small features,
particularly in the metrology of VLSI masks and the microscopy of biological
specimens. These functions currently are performed using synchrotron radiation
sources. EUV wavelengths can image nanoscale features, making the deliverables
of this ERC useful in manipulating and producing nanoscale objects. The ERC is
based on a partnership with microelectronics firms and will prepare a diverse
workforce of physicists and electrical engineers needed to advance and implement
EUV and nanoscale science and technology
