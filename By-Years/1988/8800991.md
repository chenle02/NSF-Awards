This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to investigate the dynamics and energy levels of isolated gas phase molecules.
This knowledge is pivotal to the understanding of chemical bonding and the
mechanisms of chemical reactions. The ions and the kinetic energy distribution
of the electrons produced by ultraviolet laser induced ionization will be
monitored using time of flight methods. Supersonic beam technology is used to
cool the species studied, thereby simplifying the rotational structure attendant
upon the electronic transitions studied. The time dependence of intramolecular
vibration relaxation and electronic relaxation will be studied. The results of
this research will be both novel and complementary to that obtained using
conventional absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Among the species to be
studied are p-difluorobenzene, benzene, benzaldehyde, biphenyl, and several
diatomic molecules.
