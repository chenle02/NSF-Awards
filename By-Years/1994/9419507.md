9419507 Jasin The repair of chromosomal DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in
mouse cells by homologous recombination will be studied. The hypothesis to be
tested is that one pathway in the repair of DSBs in mammalian cells is
homologous recombination, and that DSBs will stimulate gene targeting and
interchromosomal recombination. The approach involves the introduction of
chromosomal DSBs in cultured cells through the expression of rare-cutting, site-
specific endonucleases. The first objective of the proposal investigates the
repair of DSBs in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In particular, it will be
determined if chromosomal DSBs will stimulate gene targeting. The second
objective investigates whether DSBs will stimulate interchromosomal
recombination. %%% The repair of DNA double stranded breaks is crucial for the
maintenance of genomic integrity in all organisms. Altered repair processes and
the inability to repair double stranded breaks will result in mutagenesis and
oncogenic transformation, and ultimately cell death. Both homologous and non-
homologous processes are expected to be involved in the repair of such breaks in
mammalian cells. The understanding that is gained about normal cellular repair
process and homologous recombination will have a broad and long-range impact on
health, medicine, and basic science. ***
