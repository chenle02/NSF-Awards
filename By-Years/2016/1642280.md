The last decade has seen the growth of extremely large, unstructured, and
dynamic data sets, loosely termed Big Data. However, there is a growing desire
to extract not just specific properties of collections of such facts, but also
relationships between the underlying entities in that data. Examples come from a
broad swatch of modern life: bioinformatics, financial, recommendation systems,
cyber and national security, and social networks. Graphs have emerged as a
valuable and productive paradigm for expressing such problems, where a graph is
a collection of a set of objects (vertices) where some pairs of objects are
connected by links (edges) that represent some relation between the two.
&lt;br/&gt;In the last decade there has been an explosion in support for graphs,
with widely differing execution models and targeted applicability. Although
numerous graph benchmarks have been proposed, only one has had a rigorous
accumulation of performance data from multiple platforms (www.graph500.org).
Computation is over a whole static graph, whereas the real world sees
applications where update data is streaming into large persistent graphs, and
very many small targeted queries may be in progress at once.&lt;br/&gt;Given the
expected productivity increase of using a graph programming paradigm over
conventional programming, especially for parallel systems, it is of growing
importance to have common mini-apps that can be used for cross-paradigm
comparisons. Also, given the continued increase in graph sizes, it is important
to understand how the underlying graph engines scale both in the size and type
of the target graphs and in the amount and mix of parallelism and concurrency
they can support.&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses this need. In collaboration
with commercial and government research labs, the primary objective is on
defining a set of mini-apps that reflect complex real-world applications more
sophisticated than today's simple benchmarks, converting these mini-apps to the
existing major graph packages, and then running them on a wide range of parallel
systems. &lt;br/&gt;The wider impact can be significant. Identification of
relevant mini-apps and how they perform across different systems will provide
insight into both how to write more complete graph applications in more scalable
ways, and which aspects of which programming systems and platforms are best
suited. It is also expected that not all mini-apps will be expressible in all
the current paradigms, providing insight to the developers of those paradigms on
expressibility issues. Given the relative infancy of such graph packages such
insight now can radically improve their applicability to real applications in
the future.
