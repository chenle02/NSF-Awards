9522611 Brand This project establishes a Network Information Center at two
campuses of the Navajo Community College, and will work toward developing a
virtual campus linking all seven campus sites in the Navajo Nation. The eventual
goal is to enable "attendance" at Navajo Community College at any of the 111
communities within the Navajo nation. Connectivity to the Internet for the
Community College is being provided by Westnet and New Mexico Technet under
another award. Duration of this award is two years.
