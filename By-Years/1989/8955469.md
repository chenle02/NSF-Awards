The University of Kentucky will initiate two-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in Engineering for 20 students in the 12th grade. This project
introduces participants to the engineering profession, encouraging them to
pursue careers in engineering fields. The program consists of discussion
sessions, a team project, laboratory experiences, field trips, and lectures to
thoroughly acquaint the students with varied engineering disciplines, career
opportunities, required educational preparation, and ethical practices of the
engineering profession. Students receive daily instruction in a computer
laboratory and in basic engineering physics. Students are expected to complete
an individual project during the fall semester at their home school and then
return to campus for seminar presentations of those projects in late February,
1991, to coincide with National Engineers' Week. Community recognition for
program participation and continuous communication between the students and the
University enhances follow-up activities.
