The Engineering Foundation will convene the Fifth Conference on Risk Based
Decision Making in Water Resources" to be held in Santa Barbara, California,
November 3-8, 1991. The major goal of the conference is to integrate information
derived from technological risk assessment with that of social risk acceptance
within a common set of multiobjective water resources planning problems, e.g.,
in dealing with floods and droughts. Current risk assessment issues, areas of
uncertainty, procedures currently used by government agencies, evaluation of
simulation models and mechanisms for information exchange will be some of the
topics discussed during the conference. The participation of engineers, physical
and social scientists in this activity will promote exchanges that are of great
benefit to this research field.
