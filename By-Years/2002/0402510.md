0402510 &lt;br/&gt;Rittmann &lt;br/&gt;Using an AOP to partially transform
recalcitrant compounds into biodegradable products allows for a cost-effective
and robust overall treatment scheme. Prior research into integrated systems has
focused on sequentially coupled systems, or those that have the biological and
chemical treatments in separate stages. However, because AOP reactions are rapid
and indiscriminate, they produce a large range of products, including those that
are too oxidized, toxic themselves, or unavailable for biodegradation. Thus,
integration could be improved if a single- stage -- or intimately coupled --
treatment system could be employed. If the bacteria were in close proximity to
advanced oxidation, biodegradable products could be removed from solution as
they are produced, focusing the chemical oxidant only on the recalcitrant
compounds. In the past, intimate coupling has seemed impossible, because the
reactants used in advanced oxidation are severely toxic to bacteria. The
proposed research will investigate a novel photo-bio system that can achieve the
ideal of intimate coupling, a truly unique and untested concept within the
emerging field of coupled chemical-biological treatment.&lt;br/&gt;
