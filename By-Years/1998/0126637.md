This award is establishing a digital imaging and data analysis center of
networked computers and image acquisition equipment for use at all levels across
the science curriculum. The facility is modeled after a successful digital
imaging laboratory in the Department of Biology at Franklin and Marshall College
(DUE 9750430) and is adapted for our interconnected science departments. The
award is (1) engaging students in an active manner in the process of scientific
inquiry through digital imaging, (2) promoting collaborative research between
students through instant data exchange and projection, and (3) demonstrating the
inter-relatedness of scientific disciplines by linking courses that share
imaging as an experimental approach. In order to achieve these aims, faculty who
represent all science departments and in whose courses greater than 60% of all
students in the College are enrolled are utilizing the facility each year.
Several of the courses are incorporating cross-disciplinary laboratory
exercises. This project is impacting in a positive fashion student performance
in science, student perceptions of science, and recruitment of students into
science majors. Results of this project will be widely disseminated through
workshops, poster presentations, publications, and websites.
