The New York Hall of Science is the only major science center in the New York
Metropolitan Area and serves a rapidly growing audience with both public and
school-based programs and exhibits. Low income families and members of diverse
minority communities are a major part of its target audience. The present award
will support a major 3,000 square foot permanent exhibition on microbiology and
microscopic organisms organized around themes of disease, its causes, prevention
and cure, benign and beneficial microbial agents, and the nature of microscopic
life. The exhibition will make extensive use of new microscopic display
technologies for interactive exhibitry, with extensive formative evaluation and
testing of principal exhibit components. Professional publications, an exhibit
monograph and low cost videotapes will be used in national dissemination and a
classroom kit based on the exhibit will be circulated widely throughout the New
York Metropolitan area. This innovative project will form a significant part of
the permanent exhibits of this newly reorganized science center. NSF support
will constitute approximately 28% of the $ 1.3 million total project cost.
