ABSTRACT EEC-9731524 SCHWARTZ The food industry is a very important component
of the U.S economy and its processing and packaging technology is developing
rapidly. This award is for a planning meeting to determine the feasibility and
viability of Ohio State University becoming a research site of the multi-
university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Aseptic
Processing and Packaging Studies. North Carolina State University and the
University of California-Davis are the Center's current research sites. The Ohio
State University research site proposes to expand the current Center's research
agenda with the following projects: 1. Validating Sterilization Efficiency of
Aseptic Packaging Systems 2. Modeling of Pulsed-Electric Field Processes 3. PEF
Bactericidal Effect Visualized by High Speed Microscopic Imaging 4.
Decontamination of Food-Contact Surfaces by Ozone and Potential Application in
Aseptic Fillers 5. Microbial Control of Fluid Foods with Microfiltration and
Combinations of Microfiltration with other Non-Thermal Processing Methods 6. An
Improved Safe Cheddar Cheese from Raw Milk 7. Process Development of Single Step
Microbial and Colloidal Stabilization for Fermented Beverages The Principal
Investigator and his colleagues are internationally recognized experts in their
fields and are well qualified to run their planning meetings.
