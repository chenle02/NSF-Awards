Digital filters find extensive use in a variety of communications and signal
processing applications; they are critical to proper system performance. Much
engineering research has been done on linear digital filters and this
investigation is a logical extension to implement nonlinear or digital filters.
Nonlinear filters are required in certain important applications, especially
where noise is not signal independent and/or additive.
