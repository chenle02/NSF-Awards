This Presidential Young Investigator Award provides general research funds for
Dr. Amasino's studies of the mechanisms that control plant growth, development
and differentiation. He is currently studying crown gall tumor formation by
Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a model system for studying gene regulation and the
control by cytokinins of plant cell proliferation. Other areas of interest
include the role of DNA methylation in plant gene expression, and the
photoperiodic induction of flowering in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
