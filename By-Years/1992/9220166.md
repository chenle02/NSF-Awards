The focus of this research is the preparation and synthetic use of
allenylmetallic reagents of tin, boron, titanium and chromium. Particular
attention will center on SE' additions to aldehydes as a route to
enantioenriched propargylic and allenic carbinols. Among the issues to be
addressed include: the configurational and regiochemical stability of chiral
allenyl and propargyl organometallics, the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of
the SE' additions of these reagents, the effect of chiral ligands on the
enantioselectivity of the SE' process, and possible applications of these
reagents in natural product synthesis. %%% With this Renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. James A. Marshall of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina. Professor
Marshall will focus his work on developing optically active organometallic
reagents for possible use in the synthesis of a variety of natural products.
