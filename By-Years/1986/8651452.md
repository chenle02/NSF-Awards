The purpose of this proposal is to improve the teaching of physical science for
30 elementary school teachers of grades 4, 5, and 6 in the Tidewater area of
Virginia. The teachers will be selected in pairs from six-cooperating local
school districts to participate in an intensive six-week workshop at Old
Dominion University with monthly follow-up seminars during the academic year.
Project staff will visit the participants' schools on a regular basis to assess
the impact of the program on the students in their classrooms and to consult
with science supervisors and principals.
