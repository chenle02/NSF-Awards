EIA 0130900-Michael Arbib-Biological Information Technology Systems-BITS: Neural
Computing, Round 3 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been two main rounds of
neural computing to date, the first focusing on adaptation and self-
organization, the second on compartmental modeling of the neuron. This project
will catalyze a third round of neural computing: Analyzing the architecture of
the primate brain to extract neural information processing principles and
translate them into biologically-inspired operating systems and computer
architectures. This project will focus on analyzing and further developing
computational neuroscience models concerned with grasping, recognizing and
executing actions, and describing those actions with language, in terms of basic
information processing principles. The intention is to create a new research
effort, applying the latest advances in computational neurobiology to the design
of a new generation of machines. In particular, the proposed research will
catalyze research and development of unusually robust, versatile, and adaptive
computer architectures, that can easily adapt, correct themselves, and blend
diverse styles of processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
