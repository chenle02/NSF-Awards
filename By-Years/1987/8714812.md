The research will develop new reliability models of load testing that use
information on the performance of series-produced or similar structures, success
or failure in different test and service modes, risk of test damage, load
history of a structure, and other structural indicators such as stiffness and
permanent deformation. In the approach planned, a first estimate of strength or
reliability is combined statistically with new information from a load test or
other source, such as the observed performance of a related structure. A revised
estimate is obtained containing both new and old performance information, that
can be used in subsequent evaluation of the structure. The quality of
information, which varies from high, for actual proof tests of a structure in
all important service modes, to low, for completely subjective evaluations of
performance, will be reflected in model development. The expected value of
information to be gained from a test or non- test alternative will be balanced
against its cost (difficulty), and against the performance of other competing
options. Current load testing procedures will be reviewed and compared to model
characteristics, and examples and case studies will be used to compare model
performance in a variety of load testing applications. The research will have an
important impact on safety verification, risk management and maintainability of
structures, screening of gross errors and deterioration, and many other decision
problems in structural engineering.
