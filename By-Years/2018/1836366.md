This award is to assist US-based graduate students to attend the 38th Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on
Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2018) in Vienna, Austria. Participation in
ICDCS and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate
school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with
more senior researchers, and exposes students to leading work and practical
industry practices in this important area of research. The long-term merits of
this program's impact on distributed computing research is well established.

The conference will be held in Vienna, Austria, July 2-5, will span four days
and will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, industry
presentations, posters, and demonstrations. It will also feature keynote
speeches from leading researchers and practitioners in the field.

Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not
otherwise be able to attend the conference and students who are not already
scheduled to present a paper, paying particular attention to diversity and
relevance of the student's research interest.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
