9532004 Wilsdorf The expected effect of lubricants on metal amorphization in
severe tribocontacts will be studied by shearing of stacks of pure metal foils,
or powders, in a high pressure Bridgman anvil apparatus in a lubricated
environment. The tests will start with copper and silver foils and later extend
to copper and iron foils and powders. The lubricants to be tested include
paraffin oil, an additive-containing oil, and a high pressure synthetic oil. The
shear resistance will be measured and X-ray analysis will be performed to
determine the extent of amorphization. Microstructure of the near-subsurface
material will be determined by electron microscopy. It is hoped that the study
will lay the foundation for the characterization of the materials behavior which
controls the microscopic contact volumes under typical tribological asperity
contacts. ***
