This award will provide partial support of a workshop titled, "Data-at-Risk:
Developing a Plan for Preserving Astronomy's Archival Records". The goal of the
workshop is to bring together the world's experts on non-electronic astronomy
archival data where they will develop a Plan of Action that will promote the
preservation of irreplaceable data. The PI notes that there are over 3 million
glass plates or films currently in archives with over half of that data being
stored in North America. These archives contain both imaging and spectroscopic
data that extends back roughly 120 years. The archives represent a rich resource
for long-term variability studies and offer scientific information that cannot
be otherwise obtained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless positive action is
undertaken soon most of the data in these archives, particularly those being
stored in non-optimal conditions, will simply not survive the next decade. The
broader impacts of the proposal are inherent in the preservation of the data
archives. The impact of data preservation has the potential to affect all facets
of observational astronomy.
