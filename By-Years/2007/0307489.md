&lt;br/&gt;AST-0307489&lt;br/&gt;Mendez&lt;br/&gt;Planetary nebulae (PN) are
easy to detect and measure in early type galaxies, and make valuable test
particles for studying the angular momentum and dark matter content and
distribution in these types of galaxies, an otherwise notoriously difficult
problem. This research uses a recently developed and very efficient
observational technique for PN radial velocity measurements, combining narrow
band imaging with slit-less spectroscopy. Now that this technique has been
successfully demonstrated, the researcher will investigate a much larger sample
of galaxies, studying rotation and dark matter, improving the distance
determinations, and exploring the possibility of abundance studies. He will also
add the capability to, and test its efficacy on, a wider range of telescopes
than before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will introduce a new technique and
train students in its use, and produce an enormous amount of PN kinematic
information for many early type galaxies, both isolated and in nearby galaxy
clusters, which will impact basic problems in modern astrophysics. The results
are likely to become a new standard of reference for this kind of astrophysical
research.&lt;br/&gt;
