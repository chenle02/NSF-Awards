Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the
participation of graduate students and young postdocs in the 2021 Low Energy
Electrodynamics in Solids (LEES) international conference, June 27th to July
2nd, at the Westin in Portland, Maine. The objective of the conference is to
provide a forum for exchange of ideas, novel concepts, and unpublished results
in the interdisciplinary research on low-energy electrodynamics in solids and in
exotic condensed phases. Experts in a wide range of theoretical and experimental
techniques focused on the electrodynamics of quantum materials will join with up
and coming junior researchers. The program is organized to allow for a range of
interactions and discussions, as well as opportunities for junior participants
to share their work. Fifteen invited speakers are graduate students, postdocs or
new faculty. The organizers are making significant efforts to have participation
from members of underrepresented groups including providing support for child
care, diversifying the organizing committees and speakers (ten invited speakers
are women, three are LatinX).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Scientifically, there will be an emphasis on the electronic
and magnetic properties of quantum materials and their applications for future
technologies. Discussion will encompass both theoretical and experimental
methods including: broadband, time-resolved and near-field optical and
photoemission spectroscopies, nuclear magnetic resonance, inelastic
neutron/X-ray scattering, and scanning tunneling microscopy. It is highly timely
to hold such a conference with a focus on coordinating the unprecedented ability
to create, probe and control topological and correlated states of matter.
Indeed, many of the unique states of quantum materials result from the
entanglement of magnetic, lattice, and electronic properties. As such no single
technique can unravel their origins, let alone control them for future
incorporation into cutting edge devices. This conference will bring together a
wide range of disciplines and focus on both theoretical and experimental
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
