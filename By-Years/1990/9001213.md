Taste is a very important sense because it is involved in food selection and
preference, and related to hunger, ingestion, and nutritional aspects of
behavior. Most studies of taste have involved rodents, which have aspects of
physiology and behavior very different from humans, and there are few data on
gustatory processing to compare human sensory capabilities with rodent
physiology. This study utilizes a novel approach of chronic recording from a
behaving animal to explore how activity in the cortex of a primate brain
correlates to behavior. Response characteristics and functional organization of
the cortex will be explored, to determine how well data from human
psychophysical studies are matched by electrophysiological data. This novel
approach will provide data important for chemosensory science, for comparing
functional organization of gustatory cortex with other sensory cortical areas,
and for further understanding how brain activity underlies perception and
behavior.
