This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project targets conversion of a
technique perfected for washing hydrocarbons in the oil industry, fiber film
reactor (FFR) technology, into a production organic synthesis technique. A FFR
will be constructed in Phase I and two reactions studied- an epoxy polyol
reaction and an epoxy synthesis. Feasibility will be proven by demonstrating
producible conversion yields. FFR is an elegant, economical, and environmentally
friendly approach to production-scale organic synthesis. Both PTC-based and
conventional processing methods will benefit from FFR technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial market value of FFR processing is enormous
- over 3 billion pounds annually of organic production could potentially benefit
from FFR. The environmental advantages are compelling - a waste factor due to
emulsion in DGEBA production of just 0.05% would add 250,000 pounds to our
national waste streams- and the added costs to the manufacturer in materials and
time are equally huge. These two factors will drive FFR demand. &lt;br/&gt;
