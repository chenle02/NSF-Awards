This proposal is concerned with the construction of a new soft x-ray (SX)
emission spectrometer and SX spectroscopy end station associated with an
undulator beamline at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory. The undulator and high performance spherical grating monochromator
will provide 40 times greater photon fluxed and 200 times higher brightness that
will be used to enhance the intensity and/or resolution of the exciting
radiation. The spectrometer and end station will greatly extend the present
spectral range measured in emission, allow measurement of emission both
perpendicular and parallel to the polarization direction of the exciting beam,
allow measurement of both absorption and emission spectra, greatly enhance in-
situ sample preparation and characterization facilities, and permit joint SX
spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy studies with other users of the beamline.
The construction project involves scientists at the University of Tennessee, Oak
Ridge National Laboratory and NIST. This group will jointly operate this
undulator beamline at the ALS with an IBM group from both Almaden and Yorktown.
