Factors affecting metal mobility in and near the low pressure supercritical
region of seawater will be investigated in two specific areas of research: (1)
The effect of temperature, pressure, pH, dissolved Cl and redox intensity on the
thermodynamic stability of base metal (Fe, Pb, Zn and Cu) and Au-ion complexes.
Results of recent experiments have unambiguously demonstrated the highly
significant role of pressure on the relative stability of Fe- chloro complexes
at elevated temperatures for fluids of seawater dissolved Cl. It is essential
that these data be extended to higher temperatures and especially involve fluids
of higher and lower dissolved Cl concentrations. (2) Phase equilibria
constraints on dissolved concentrations of neutral species such as H2 and H2S.
On-going research has clarified greatly the role of temperature and pressure on
activity-concentration relations and "salting-out" behavior involving H2(aq) and
H2S(aq) for fluids of seawater dissolved Cl concentration. These results need to
be extended to higher temperatures, and especially higher and lower pressures
and dissolved Cl concentrations. Dissolved H2 and H2S activities, and activity-
concentration relations, constrain metal mobility, and can be used for some hot
spring systems to reveal subseafloor temperatures and pressures.
