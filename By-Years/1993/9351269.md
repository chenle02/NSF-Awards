Concordia College plans to transform the teaching of science to general
students, pre-service teachers and science majors by developing integrated
course curricula involving computers and video technology. This revitalization
of the curriculum will enhance scientific literacy among the general student
body, bring science majors in step with the rapidly advancing technologies, and
prepare teachers willing to use scientific methodologies in their elementary and
secondary classrooms. Computerization of the empirical process makes knowledge
much easier to attain and eliminates much of the tedium associated with routine
activities in science. The addition of video- interactive capabilities to the
development of courses for potential majors and for pre-service teachers will
also increase the attractiveness of the scientific process, hopefully resulting
in more individuals becoming scientifically literate. The interaction generated
between science majors and non-major students as a result of the development and
implementation of computer-based data gathering and analysis should also enhance
the understanding of non-scientists of the scientific enterprise and sensitize
scientists to the preconceptions and limitations of the general public.
