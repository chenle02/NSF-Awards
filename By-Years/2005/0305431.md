AST 0305431&lt;br/&gt;PI: Bruce Carney&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bruce Carney, in
collaboration with John Laird of Bowling Green State University, will carry out
a suite of projects that are aimed at developing a better understanding of the
stellar populations in our galaxy. They will pursue research activities in four
broad areas: 1) following up on their recent observations that suggest that the
surprisingly high fraction of field red horizontal branch and red giant branch
stars that rotate may be linked to planet accretion, 2) the exploration of the
mass-luminosity relationship for binary stars to constrain the stellar helium
abundance, 3) a study of metal-poor subgiant stars to refine metallicities and
determine ages, and 4) a study of local G dwarfs to investigate the chemical and
dynamical evolution of the thin and thick disk populations in the solar
neighborhood, and their full metallicity distribution functions, from which
follow-up studies will provide details on the element-to-iron ratios as a
function of [Fe/H].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students
will be involved in the research. The PI plans to expand the mentoring of
graduate students through improvement of their teaching skills through team
teaching of regular courses and to expand the hands-on outreach activities at
Morehead Planetarium. Students at UNC will also be involved with remote use of
the 4-meter SOAR telescope. &lt;br/&gt;
