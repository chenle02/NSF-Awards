9724126 Chappell Plant isoprenoids comprise a structurally diverse group of
compounds that can be divided into classes of primary and secondary metabolites.
Isoprenoids that are primary metabolites include sterols, carotenoids and growth
hormones, secondary metabolites include monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and
diterpenes, compounds that are important mediators of plant-environment
interactions. The work will continue biochemical/physiological studies of the
secondary metabolites in tissue culture. The focus will be on the regulation and
activity of two enzymes in the pathway, squalene synthase and sesquiterpene
cyclase which are located at branchpoints at which the biochemical pathways
diverge leading to different compounds. The analysis also includes analysis of
the genes and transcripts for these enzymes.
