This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education
research award to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in
collaboration with University of Tennessee Knoxville will study learning,
knowledge sharing, and participation in open-source communities to better
understand how to encourage newcomer participation in cyber-learning educational
environments. The work will address important social and educational aspects
related to acceptance and use of cyber-enabled learning environments. It will
explore the relationship between participation and learning, and the results
will significantly advance understanding of collaborative learning in
engineering education. On-line learning, distributed working teams, and social
networking in cyberspace are rapidly growing components of engineering education
and professional practice, and successful students must be able to participate
effectively. Understanding the aspects of tools, methods and practices which
promote participation and learning are essential to increasing participation in
engineering and to preparing engineering students for jobs the modern workplace.
