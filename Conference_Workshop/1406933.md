This award supports the participation of US mathematicians in the 'Algebraic Lie
Theory and Representation Theory' conference hosted by the International Centre
for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland during the week of September
1-5, 2014 and the accompanying LMS-CMI Research School for graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and other young researchers hosted by the University of
Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland during the week of August 25-29, 2014. In recent
years there have been many exciting developments within algebraic Lie theory
which provide significant advances and insights to the field. These innovative
methods involve a mixture of combinatorial, algebraic, geometric, and
topological tools. However, the rapid progress made possible by this diversity
of techniques means that even experts are not familiar with all facets of the
field. The workshop is designed to bring together leading researchers and young
mathematicians from the US, Europe, and Asia so that these methods may be
shared. The research school is designed to bring young mathematicians up to
speed on some of the most fruitful areas of current research. The current
schedule for the school features lecture series by Iain Gordon, Andrew Mathas,
and Catharina Stroppel.

Lie groups and Lie algebras have been a central theme in mathematics since their
origins in the work of Sophus Lie in the late 19th century. They find profound
applications in diverse areas of mathematics and physics. Their ubiquity and
importance led to the expansion of Lie theory into many new areas. This expanded
area is now known as algebraic Lie theory. Leading researchers can now be found
in the US, Europe, and Asia. The workshop and research school provide a unique
opportunity for researchers from around the world to disseminate the latest
results and techniques in algebraic Lie theory. Both the workshop and research
school place a strong emphasis on encouraging international collaboration and
the involvement of up-and-coming researchers. In particular, this grant will
allow participation by US based mathematicians who are young researchers, from
underrepresented groups, or who would otherwise be unable to attend. It will
provide a rich opportunity for US mathematicians to learn of cutting edge work
and initiate international collaborations. We anticipate this grant will have a
significant impact on US based students and researchers in this exciting field.
