This Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in
Engineering (BRITE) project will advance the ability of autonomous machines to
inspect critical infrastructure with minimal human assistance through novel
research in areas of machine learning, optimization, and computer vision. This
objective will be achieved through a mentored and rigorous program comprised of
classroom learning and focused research tasks intended to advance the ability
for a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or “drone”) to remotely and
autonomously inspect a new, unknown, and cluttered infrastructure environment to
find a potential threat using computer vision. By educating and training a group
of civil engineering researchers in cutting-edge theory and methods of machine
learning, optimization, and computer vision, this project will enable future
research in a wide range of exciting and societally transformative topics
related to autonomous infrastructure and smart cities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without autonomous inspection, monitoring, and
reconnaissance solutions, engineers are bottlenecked by humans in the loop. This
research addresses the critical gap by exploring means for aerial robots to
autonomously navigate in, model, and inspect cluttered urban environments.
Computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence will be used to
improve reconnaissance of infrastructure before and after natural and/or man-
made hazards. The potential for machines to autonomously and intelligently
contribute to the safety and functionality of our society will not only improve
the economics of monitoring society’s infrastructure, but it will also improve
the quality of life for its residents by helping to maintain a more functional
and safe society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
