Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis of new ribosomes, the cell's protein
producing machinery, is an energetically costly and highly regulated process. It
is also a dynamic process that requires molding of the RNA and binding of
ribosomal proteins into the final functional three-dimensional structure of the
ribosome. The complexity and importance of producing ribosomes requires that
multiple accessory factors guide and regulate processing. This project focuses
on a ribosome processing factor, Nep1, a protein required for the proper
assembly and maturation of the small subunit of the ribosome. The studies
address the mechanism by which Nep1 guides the binding of the ribosomal protein
S19 into the small subunit of the yeast ribosome, and the changes in RNA
structure that occur as a result. The results of this project will provide a
more detailed molecular understanding of Nep1 function, and more broadly,
address the role of RNA dynamics in ribosome assembly.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact&lt;br/&gt;Training in structural biology and an understanding of
molecular structure provides scientists with a roadmap to important biological
questions. The educational portion of this project will focus on training
university students in structure-based approaches to biological and biochemical
research, and providing the necessary skills to produce macromolecular crystals.
Structural biology, especially using macromolecular X-ray crystallography, is
fairly embryonic at University of Maryland at College Park, and there is much
interest on campus for incorporating structural approaches in research. To meet
that interest and enhance education in this area, this project will incorporate
a yearly workshop in practical macromolecular crystallography for students who
are interested in generating X-ray crystal structures as part of their research.
This will allow the research community to utilize excellent on-campus facilities
for structural data collection and firmly establish structural biology research
at this university.
