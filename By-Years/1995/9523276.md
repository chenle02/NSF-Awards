9526411 Brown Recent studies have shown that zirconium nitride can protect
stainless steel against seawater corrosion. It appears that the effcct is due to
natural conversion of a thin layer of the nitride to hydrated zirconium oxide.
Under an SGER award a study will be made of various other refractory nitrides
for their potential use as corrosion protection coatings. Pourbaix diagrams will
be constructed and candidate materials for testing will be chosen from those
that have stable oxides or hydrated oxides at the pH and open potential levels
of seawater. The selected nitride coatings will be deposited by plasma arc
methods and tested for corrosion resistance by electrochemical techniques. The
results may make it possible to replace chromate conversion coatings with the
environmentally more benign nitride coatings. ***
