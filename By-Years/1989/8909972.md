Research will investigate scheduling control problems of queueing networks that
arise in production systems, and computer and communication networks. Despite
much attention, a systematic approach to the scheduling control of general
structured networks is not available. The investigator should solve the
scheduling control problems by using a simple and highly aggregated model,
namely, a fluid model. The viewpoint taken is that the simple model often
provides the insight to the complicated problem, the solution to practical
problems, and the basis for studying more complicated models. Recent work has
shown that the fluid model approach can reduce a scheduling control problem to
solving a set of linear programming problems, and in some cases the solution
when properly interpreted can be optimal for the queueing system. Research will
be performed in four steps: (1) modeling queueing system by fluid model, (2)
solving the scheduling control problem of the fluid model, (3) interpreting the
solution into the control rule for the original queueing system, and (4) testing
the solution by simulation.
