Theoretical predictions indicate that a pressure wave of low amplitude will be
generated by the sudden onset of heat transfer from a surface to a compressible
fluid. The energy exchange that results from this thermoacoustic wave and its
subsequent surface reflections provides a mechanism for energy transport to both
the fluid and the cooled surface. This heat transfer enhancement mechanism will
be experimentally quantified by pressure and thermal measurements. No prior
experimental work has been identified on these enhancement phenomena. Analytical
work on this heat transfer enhancement indicates that the resultant energy
transport will be many times that of simple conduction. This research seeks to
experimentally confirm and quantify this unexplored phenomena.
