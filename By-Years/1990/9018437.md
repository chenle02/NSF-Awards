Through preliminary studies, loci of magmatic transitions (e.g., from high Ba/Nb
Steens-like lavas to low Ba/Nb alkalic basalts) have been identified in north
central Nevada (near Winnemucca, East of Fallon, and between Kane Springs Wash
and the Lunar Crater volcanic field). However, compositions of these magmas
could also be influenced by lateral variations in basement (including
lithospheric mantle) age and composition. This project will carry out a detailed
geochemical study of mafic lavas from roughly north-south and east-west
transects across north-central Nevada to evaluate source characteristics. Age
determinations will be made for selected samples to establish the chronology of
magma source transitions. These data will provide important constraints on
mantle involvement during the Cenozoic regional extension of the Cordilleran
region.
