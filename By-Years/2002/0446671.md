Molecular parasites, such as transposable elements, are segments of DNA that
integrate into chromosomes and proliferate to become highly repetitive within
the genome. This proliferation is often harmful to the genome and creates strong
selection pressure to counter their activity. In the fungus Microbotryum
violaceum a genomic defense mechanism ("repeat-induced point mutations") acts to
change the DNA sequence of molecular parasites thus destroying their ability to
proliferate. Empirical and theoretical studies will investigate the evolution of
molecular parasites as they appear to engage in an arms race with the host
genome in order to elude its defensive mechanisms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular parasites are highly influential components of
the genomes of nearly all organisms, with effects upon such fundamental traits
as genome size, mutation rates, DNA structure, and mating systems. The activity
of molecular parasites has also been implicated in many human-inherited diseases
and chromosome rearrangements. Therefore, investigation into which factors limit
the evolution of molecular parasites will advance our understanding of genome
structure and of particular threats to genetic stability. This research also has
broad theoretical implications because it addresses the unique nature of DNA-
based parasitism that allows for co-evolution between the molecular parasites
and the genomes they inhabit.&lt;br/&gt;
