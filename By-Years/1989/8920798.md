The objective of this project is to study the applicability of resilient-
friction isolator devices in protecting equipment, machines, and components
attached to the building or superstructure. Different equipment-superstructure
models will be considered including continuous as well as multi-degree of
freedom discrete systems. Dynamic response analysis as well as statistical
studies of the response will be performed. The high frequency effects of the
slip-stop friction mechanism will be investigated. The study will determine the
viability of the resilient base isolation for internal equipment protection
against seismically induced motion of the primary structure.
