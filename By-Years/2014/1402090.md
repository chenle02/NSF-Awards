This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and
graduate students to participate in the PACIFIC 2014 Symposium. This symposium
will focus on the latest developments at the interface of particle physics,
astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding
fundamental interactions.

It will be held September 15-20, 2014 at the University of California Richard B.
Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French
Polynesia.

For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and
graduate students. To make the symposium more accessible to the general public,
the organizers have integrated a public lecture by one of the symposium speakers
into the schedule.
