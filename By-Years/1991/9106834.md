Analytical equipment for molecular/cellular bioengineering research is to be
provided by this award. A spectrofluorometer and a scintillation counter will be
used for quantitation of specific macromolecules inside cells, on cell surfaces,
and on solid substrates. A Coulter counter will be used to obtain statistically
significant measurements of cell numbers with high sample throughout. Each of
these instruments is necessary to provide essential data for at least three of
five ongoing research projects.
