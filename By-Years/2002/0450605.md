This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a solid state photodetector with ultimate sensitivity and wide dynamic
range at room temperature, capable of efficiently seeing signals from a single
photon to trillions per second, featuring high speed, zero dead-time, high
reliability/reproducibility, solid state robustness/compactness, and a large
photosensitive area. The Phase I project proved the practicality of compatibly
combining these features, and demonstrated compound semiconductor materials 1000
times quieter electrically than silicon. The project plans to model, design,
layout, fab, package, test, and analyze a series of prototypes, resulting in a
complete photodetector prototype for detailed evaluation and customer review;
and will engage students in for-profit industrial R&amp;D.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to revolutionize the $10 billion
industrial sector for ultra-low-light analytical instruments by obsolescing
bulky glass, high voltage, photomultiplier vacuum tubes ($500 million) and
microchannel plates ($400 million); improving scientific instruments dependent
on them; enabling altogether new instruments; and making new applications of the
instruments affordable and accessible.&lt;br/&gt;This product has been sought as
the holy grail of photodetection for fifty years. It could make detecting light
with ultimate sensitivity so practical, affordable, and ubiquitous that
important scientific research and industrial instruments needing to sense
extremely low light levels could be microminiaturized to eliminate bulky,
thousand volt, multi-thousand dollar, high-voltage vacuum tubes, written
operating plans, and the expertise &amp; proven track record of its
managers.&lt;br/&gt;
