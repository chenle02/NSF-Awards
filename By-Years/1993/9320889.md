9320889 Kiefer The operation of markets and the determination of prices are
central issues in economics. Efficient operation of capital markets, in
particular, is crucial to the efficient allocation of resources. The stock
market is key to the allocation of capital in the U.S. and other developed
countries. In the U.S. system, the market maker, the specialist assigned to a
particular stock or group os stocks, is responsible for maintaining the market
in those stocks. The market maker quotes bid and ask prices, and adjusts these
in the light of market activity. The market maker accumulates information by
watching the order flow. The purpose of this project is to develop and estimate
a model of the order flow process and the market makers's behavior using trade
by trade data. In particular the information content of trade size will be
measured in order to assess the effects of "cream skimming" in financial markets
and the interaction between liquidity and information will be examined. ***
