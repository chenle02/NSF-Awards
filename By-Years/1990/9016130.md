Research and development will be carried out towards producing a high
efficiency neutron polarimeter based on wave shifting fibers imbedded in long
plastic scintillators. A hodoscope stack of such devices coupled to charge
coupled devices or silicon photodiodes will provide tracking information for
recoiling protons from elastic neutron-proton scattering within the hydrogenous
scintillator material. Order of magnitude increases in efficiency are possible
over traditional double scatter methods (0.3% efficiency), with a much more
compact and versatile detector. Such developments will be important for use at
high energy nuclear physics accelerators under construction because of
diminishing cross sections with increasing energy.
