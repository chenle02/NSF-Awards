This project will construct a high-resolution seawater 87Sr/86Sr reference
section from ODP Site 758 in the southern Bay of Bengal. This will significantly
improve the temporal resolution and accuracy of Sr isotopes as a
chronostratigraphic tool, increase our understanding of the relationship between
oceanic 87Sr/86Sr and the erosion of the Himalayan\Tibetan Plateau region, and
better constrain models of Sr isotope change.
