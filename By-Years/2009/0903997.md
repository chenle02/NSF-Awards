scales in computational simulations, this research team will develop a fully
implicit solver based on a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) approach with an
appropriate preconditioner for FLASH, a multiphysics code framework used widely
in the astrophysics community. FLASH provides a block-structured adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) parallel simulation grid and explicit solvers based on Eulerian
hydrodynamics as well as N-body astrophysics. It was originally developed for
simulations of Type Ia supernovae and related phenomena. Although FLASH has been
successfully applied to a range of problems allowing different length scales
using its AMR technology, its explicit scheme is of limited use for problems
that are stiff in time. This weakness occurs because explicit compressible
solvers are extremely inefficient for resolving disparate time scales in the
stiff system. The main goal in this project is to develop a time accurate JFNK-
based implicit solver and combine it with the current second-order accurate
unsplit explicit MHD solver in FLASH. We will use the combined hybrid
(explit/implicit) solver to perform cutting-edge simulations addressing the
heating of the solar corona problem whose nonlinear physics is dominated by a
stiff system of equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This development will fully
leverage the existing professional management of the FLASH code, and its wide
user base, to reach the computational physics community. FLASH is an
astrophysics community code available online without cost.
