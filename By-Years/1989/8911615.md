The PI proposes to engage in activities that will enable him to study epoxide
hydrolase. This enzyme functions in detoxifying epoxide metabolites of
xenobiotics. It is found in liver microsomes and in a cytosolic fraction in
mouse cells. The PI wants to investigate the structural differences among the
various forms of the enzyme by cloning the genes in order to study the synthesis
and processing of the mRNAs. During the planning period, the PI proposes to: 1)
Organize and setup a laboratory. 2) Prepare cDNA probes. 3) Screen cDNA clones
4) Clone epoxide hydrolase genes 5) Study the synthesis and processing of the
epoxide hydrolase.
