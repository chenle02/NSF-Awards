9624234 Leeb The proposed research seeks to develop diagnostic, load use, and
power quality monitoring technologies for electrical loads in commercial and
industrial settings by continuing development of a Nonintrusive Load Monitor
(NILM) incorporating an advanced transient event detector. The NLM identifies
and determines the operating schedule of the major electrical loads in a
building from measurements made solely at the electrical utility service entry.
Career funding would also contribute to the development of a novel
interdisciplinary "capstone" course be offerred to seniors in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and also Mechanical Engineering.
This class is an exciting experiment to introduce industry and cross-
disciplinary particpation into the late undergraduate, early graduate part of a
student's experience in my department. Each student in the class will be
challenged with a term-length project derived from an actual problem in
industry. ***
