This dissertation grant proposal is a comparative analysis of the mortuary
practices of Inuit groups from prehistoric times up to the influence of
Christianity. Although Inuit groups are geographically disperse, they share many
cultural similarities. However, methods of corpse disposal are varied. The study
combines ethnographic and archeological descriptions and data with folklore
accounts from museums and libraries in the United States, Canada, and Denmark in
an effort to document the range and nature of the variability. The project will
produce a fuller understanding of historic and pre-historic Inuit groups and
arctic hunter-gatherer mortuary practices.
