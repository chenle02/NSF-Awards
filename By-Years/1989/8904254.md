Stomata regulate gas exchange in leaves, thus affecting productivity and the
water balance of the plant. Stomatal control depends on sensory transduction by
guard cells of internal and external stimuli, translating information about
prevailing conditions in the leaf environment to modulation of the size of
stomatal apertures. The overall objective of this research program is to
understand the signal perception, metabolic transduction, and aperture
regulation during the movements of stomata in response to light. Recent studies
have shown that light activates proton pumping at the guard cell plasmalemma via
two different transduction pathways, one activated by a blue light photoreceptor
and the other by the guard cell chloroplast. The aim of this proposal is the
detailed characterization of the sensory transduction steps involved in pump
activation. Using the electrophysiological technique of patch clamping,
metabolic and photobiological features of the two pathways will be investigated,
including critical concentrations of ATP and other cofactors, fluence-rate
dependence, specific pharmacological properties, and interactive features
between the two pathways in connection with the guard cell response to solar
radiation. The identity of the blue light photoreceptor will be investigated by
spectroscopic analysis at low and room temperature. Gas exchange techniques with
intact leaves will be used to correlate resolved features at the subcellular and
cellular level with stomatal performance under physiological conditions. Stomata
are pores in the surface of a leaf which regulate the passage of water and
gasses into and out of the leaf's tissue. Proper traffic through the stomata is
vital for the plant's ability to conduct photosynthesis and maintain its water
balance. The stomata open and close in response to environmental stimuli. The
results of this research will enhance our understanding of the cellular
mechanisms which regulate the movements of stomata, and more generally, will
increase basic knowledge of the mechanisms of sensory transduction and ion
transport in plant cells.
