*** 9760170 Lockert This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
develop a mechanically reinforced Commingled Recycled Plastic Lumber (CRPL) with
an efficient cross-sectional geometry. Reinforcements include chopped natural
fibers and continuous synthetic fibers oriented both isotropicly and
anistropicly. Efficient cross-sections are used to maximize geometric stiffness
while minimizing material requirements. CRPL's inherent long life expectancy
augmented by significant increases in mechanical properties would allow this
innovative product to cost effectively replace wood in civil infrastructure
projects. The research has strongly interactive process development,
experimental, and computational (finite element) components. The latter provides
a "mechanics of reinforced plastics approach" in specifying reinforcements and
optimal profiles. Process flexibility allows the hybrid profile to be designed
for the application as opposed to finding an application meeting the product's
capabilities. CRPL's superior bio-degradation resistance provides a wide range
of potential commercial applications including where pressure-treated wood is
currently used. Applications include residential and commercial construction,
e.g., building framing, fence and sign posts, guard rail posts, retaining walls,
bulkheads, pilings, pallets, railroad ties, concrete forms, etc. If the research
is successful, the potential for intelligent use of reinforcement and optimal
structural profiles should result in mechanical performance and service life of
CRPL far superior to wood in many civil infrastructure projects.
