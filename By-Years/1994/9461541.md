This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of a Giant Magnetoresistance Ratio (GMR) tunneling transistor. GMR
tunneling devices can potentially have a room temperature magnetoresistance of
50% (many times the magnetoresistance of simple two-layer magnetic sandwiches)
with a high impedance and high areal density, and can operate with small
magnetic fields (one Oe). These devices can be configured for memory, field
sensors, magnetic amplifiers, and magnetic logic, which can, in turn,
miniaturize electronics and greatly reduce power consumption for a wide variety
of applications. The fundamental GMR tunneling device consists of two
ferromagnetic films separated by a very thin ((20 () insulating layer. The
tunneling current depends on the relative magnetic states of the magnetic layers
in a fashion similar to that indicated by recent work on GMR materials. For the
tunneling transistor, an additional metal line is used to produce the magnetic
field required to modulate the magnetic states of the two magnetic layers.
Characterization of device current with respect to applied voltage, material
properties and film thicknesses, and magnetic states will be used to refine an
existing model. The tunneling transistor will be breadboarded to illustrate
memory operation, magnetic field sensing, magnetic amplification, and magnetic
logic.
