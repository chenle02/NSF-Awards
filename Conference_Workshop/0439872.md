Abstract

Award: DMS-0439872 Principal Investigator: Mark L. Green, Stanley Osher

The Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) is a national research
institute that focuses on fostering interactions that bring together researchers
in the mathematical sciences with scientists and engineers. The Institute
operates without permanent faculty or research staff. IPAM conducts semester-
length programs, short workshops, a summer research program for undergraduates,
graduate summer schools, outreach programs, and workshops to develop and enhance
the careers of researchers from groups underrepresented in the mathematical
sciences.

The IPAM web site at http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/ describes upcoming and past
programs, solicits ideas for future programs, and offers application forms for
Institute activities.
