9525751 Currie The goal of this project is to design a framework for an
integrated management tool to quantify the costs associated with technological
development at varying levels of complexity. In addition to direct costs, these
costs include the unmeasured costs of lead time, training, learning, resistance
to change, created bottlenecks, and quality costs, as well as the lack of a
system's view from researcher to product idea and then from supplier through
post-sales support. Specific cost data from previous design change experiences
at three manufacturing companies will be analyzed. These and other known case
studies will be used to build a general model that includes the relationships of
organizational functions of a firm to total product design life cycle costs. The
research should result in a preliminary Internet-based implementation for
concurrent design and costing. The significance of the work will offer a general
approach to estimating and tracking costs in the product design phase. The
integrated cost model will be validated with empirical data to provide a firm
basis upon which to develop management tools for determining appropriate
design/cost tradeoffs.
