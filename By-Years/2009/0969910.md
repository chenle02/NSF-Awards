For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely
investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics. This is true chiefly
because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of
unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and
electromagnetic). Results from string theory have also spilled over into many
other branches of physics, leading to improved understanding of gauge theories,
condensed-matter physics, and heavy-ion physics. String theory has also led to
powerful new insights in mathematics. In this project, Professor Blanco-Pillado
aims to apply string theory to cosmology. Specifically, he proposes to study the
cosmological implications of a certain class of string models (so-called ``flux
compactifications''), paying particular attention to the effects of the complex
structure moduli part of the four-dimensional potential.

This project will also have significant broader impacts. Beyond the
interdisciplinary reach of the proposed research --- connecting high-energy
physics and cosmology through the paradigm of string theory --- this project
will also involve the training of a graduate student to conduct research in this
cutting-edge field of study.
