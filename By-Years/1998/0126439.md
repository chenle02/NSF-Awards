Physics (13) The Open-Source Physics Education, OPEN, project is a synergy of
curriculum development, computational physics, and physics education research
based on the Principal Investigator's current WebPhysics project. Material from
the OPEN project is being incorporated into three new texts: Gould, Tobochnik,
and Christian's Computer Simulation Methods, the Principal Investigator's Open-
Source Physics, and a topical Physlets workbook that can be used with a variety
of standard texts. The OPEN project makes a large number of Java simulations
available for physics education using the GNU Open-Source model for the source
code. In addition, it entails the creation and maintenance of a website for the
distribution of compiled applets and examples of interactive curricular
material. The OPEN project plans two one-week summer workshops and full- and
half-day workshops at national and regional professional meetings. A formal
assessment of students' cognitive gains is being undertaken. The OPEN project
impacts science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education nationwide
through the distribution of a wide variety of class-tested interactive computer-
based materials using both commercial and non-commercial distribution. The OPEN
project is studying the conditions under which these materials can increase
student learning. This assessment is of interest to all researchers studying the
effectiveness of animation and simulation in teaching and learning.
