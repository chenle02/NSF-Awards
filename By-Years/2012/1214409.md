This grant funds the research activities of Professor Jeffrey Harvey at the
University of Chicago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this project, Professor
Harvey plans to pursue several directions at the forefront of string theory.
Specifically, he will investigate new connections between the mathematics of
automorphic forms, the counting and structure of black hole states in
supersymmetric string theories, the properties of supersymmetric states, and the
representation theory of sporadic groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Harvey plans to
integrate his research into undergraduate and graduate courses. He also intends
to mentor graduate students and postdocs. His public outreach activities
typically include occasional appearances on local radio and TV programs, public
lectures at local theatres and schools, and the opportunity for postdocs to
present the Compton Lecture Series, a series of Saturday morning lectures on
physics to the general public.
