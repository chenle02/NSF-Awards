Title: REU Site: REU in Virtual Reality, Visualization, and Imaging

This project establishes an REU site focusing on research experiences for
undergraduate students in virtual reality, visualization, and imaging. This site
will be established in a lab originally and partially funded by an NSF Major
Research Instrumentation (MRI) award to the PI. The research projects will
include developing virtual reality software for education, therapy, and basic
research into human motor control; development and implementation of algorithms
to improve image interpretation; and analysis and visualization of three-
dimensional fractal trees.

The projects will be collaborative and multi-disciplinary. Three students will
be initiated into the research projects in the Spring quarter, and they will
then serve-along with the participating faculty-as mentors for six new interns
during the Summer ("peer-mentoring"). The project will offer undergraduates an
immersion in team research, and experience in working with peers from other
disciplines on a common problem without known outcomes.

This project will be supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with
the NSF REU program.
