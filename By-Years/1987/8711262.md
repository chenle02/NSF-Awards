Embryos of the glossiphoniid leech Helobdella triserialis are well suited for
studying cellular events in early development, because they are large, hardy,
and contain identifiable cells that are accessible for many sorts of
experimental manipulations. These embryos exhibit many phenomena that are of
general significance in the development of higher eukaryotes, including
cytoplasmic determinants, directed movements of nuclei and mitotic spindles,
distinct phases of cleavage and stem cell divisions, epiboly, separable
instances of lineage dependent and position dependent fate determination, and
epithelial interactions. The research proposed here would employ a variety of
techniques, such as: the microinjectin of cell lineage tracers, photosensitizing
dyes, drugs and radiochemicals; in situ hybridization; immunohistochemistry; gel
electrophoresis; autoradiography; time lapse video recording; and low light
fluorescence microscopy. From these studies, a more detailed description of
various developmental processes and the mechanisms by which they operate should
be generated. In addition, by examining a number of developmental processes in
parallel in the same species, it is hoped that some understanding of the higher
order mechanisms by which the basic cellular and developmental processes
interact will emerge. For example, one part of this project would study the
formation of specialized cytoplasmic domains prior to first cleavage and how
they might influence the symmetry of the first cleavage. Another part would test
the hypothesis that inherited RNAs regulate a change in cell division pattern.
The question of how individual cells acquire their specific fates during early
embryological development is a basic problem of developmental biology. Dr.
Weisblat, using the leech as a model system, proposes a series of experiments to
define what influences cell lineages of the embryo.
