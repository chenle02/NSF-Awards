9453776 Wolf The Museums of the Rockies will develop a 2450 sq. ft. exhibit
titled Landforms/Lifeforms and complementary educational materials including
teacher enhancement activities, outreach trunks, and other programming. The
exhibit will serve as the pivotal experience for visitors as they engage the
museum's theme One Place Through All Of Time and it serve to introduce all other
permanent exhibit galleries. Using the important and spectacular geological and
paleontological resources of the region and the museum's collections, the
exhibit will bring to life the concept of the evolution and diversification of
life in response to changing geological conditions from the Precambrian to the
end of the Mesozoic. Visitors will experience the Northern Rocky Mountain Region
and the life supported by that region over time. Critical thinking skills of
visitors will be stimulated with the purpose of enhancing their overall science
literacy. The exhibit is designed to promote adult-child interaction. Special
attention is being given to attracting a rural audience. Complementary
programming aimed at K-12 students and teachers will be developed. The content
of these activities will address the goals set forth in Montana's systemic
initiative and the Systemic Teacher Excellence Preparation program. The
educational materials will also be shared with member museums in the Mid-
Continent University Natural History Museum Consortium.
