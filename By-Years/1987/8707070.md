The project will employ automated electron-beam instruments to determine the
chemical compositions, sizes, and shapes of individual particles from
tropospheric aerosols. Such particles are important because of their impact on
solar radiation balance and climatic stability of the atmosphere. Samples from
the mid-troposphere and planetary boundary layer will be obtained from remote
sites, primarily in the North Pacific and Arctic regions, in order to study
several significant aspects of global tropospheric chemistry. Resulting data
will allow identification of component particle types and will be applied to
problems such as long-range transport of particles and the nature of Arctic
haze. Methods for unattended, automated analysis of individual particles using
the scanning electron microscope and electron microprobe will be modified to
enhance the routine analysis of submicron particles. Advances in the analytical
methods combined with the selected aerosol studies will result in better
definition of the particle sources and new insights into the role of particles
in the troposphere.
