Hypersaline environments are conditions where salt concentrations are five to
ten times higher than seawater, such as those found in the Great Salt Lake and
the Dead Sea. Only certain interesting microscopic organisms, from all three
domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya), and their viruses can live under
this extreme condition. These organisms are known as halophiles. The conference,
which is multidisciplinary, international, and focused on microbes, has been
holding triennial meetings since 1978. Its mission is to explore all aspects of
biology in salt-enriched environments and to draw on expertise from numerous
disciplines in order to catalyze advances in understanding life in hypersaline
habitats. The objective of this award is to provide support for young US
researchers, especial graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, to attend
and participate in this unique international scientific gathering. A special
effort will be made to recruit members of underrepresented groups in science.
