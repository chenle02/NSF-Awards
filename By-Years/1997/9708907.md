This conference among U.S. congressional scholars and scholars specializing on
legislatures outside the United States will draw the implications of recent
research findings on the U.S. Congress for research on legislatures outside the
United States especially in the emerging democracies. Papers are presented
assessing the results of research on seven major aspects of legislative
behavior. The papers are written to inform congressional scholars of findings on
other legislatures and to inform students of non-American legislatures of the
models and methods developed by congressional scholars. The objective of the
conference is to overcome a series of recognized obstacles to cross-national
legislative research at a moment witnessing a remarkable proliferation of
democratic legislatures and parliaments. The result of the conference will be a
volume of papers and commentaries to facilitate cross-national legislative
research employing equivalent concepts and measures.
