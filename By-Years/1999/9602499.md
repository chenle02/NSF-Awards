9602499 Lidsky This award supports a 12 month Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. David Lidsky at the Institute of
Solid State Physics at the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Lidsky will
work with Dr. Mahito Okomoto, Professor of Physics, on a research project
entitled, "Non-Perturbative Approaches to the Many- Body Problem". The proposed
research will elucidate the quantum mechanic origins of yet unexplained states
of condensed matter, specifically high-temperature superconductors. It will
analyze the Coulomb interactions between electrons and the explicit effect of
the scattering rate of microscopic charged particles and temperature dependence
on materials, both of which significantly influence the resistivity and
effectiveness of superconductive activity. The traditional theoretical approach
to studying the effect of electron- electron interactions has been perturbation
theory, in which one starts with non-interacting theory and treats the
interaction as a correction. One of the main goals of the proposed research is
to develop non-perturbative techniques in which one does not start from a free
theory, but rather emphasizes electron-electron interactions and their effect at
the outset on the experiment. ***
