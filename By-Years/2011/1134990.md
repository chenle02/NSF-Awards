The project supports graduate student participation in the ACM SIGKDD Conference
on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2011). Specifically, the project
supports travel to the conference for students who might not otherwise be able
to attend the conference because of financial reasons. The recipients of student
travel fellowships will have an opportunity to attend the conference, associated
workshops and tutorials on emerging research topics, as well as a doctoral
consortium that provides a venue for the students to have one-on-one discussions
and receive mentoring from some of the leading researchers in data mining,
machine learning, and related topics. The project offers natural integration of
research and education and contributes to the training of a new generation of
researchers in an area of growing importance and impact in not only Computer
Science but also a variety of data-driven disciplines.
