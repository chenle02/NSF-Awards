PROJECT ABSTRACT

This empirical study applies the learning progression perspective to the
teaching of evolution, posting an initial progression for the conceptual
underpinnings of evolution for second and third graders. The centrality of
evolution makes it a prime target for strategic long-term coherent knowledge-
building. Two curriculum models?one in animal behavior and one in botany?support
the learning progressions. These modules build on the PIs? prior work,
scaffolding primary grade children?s scientific inquiry in these domains. The
research team studies the curricular enactment and student learning in two kinds
of sites, (1) a project-run summer enrichment program, and (2) inner-city public
school classrooms.
