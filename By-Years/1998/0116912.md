0116912 Oerther The objective of this research is to develop culture-based
Biomedical Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (BioMEMS) chips to identify,
enumerate, and characterize microorganisms in environmental samples. The
specific objectives of this research are: (1) developing fundamental science to
establish the novel concept of scaled-down, culture-based identification and
quantification of Gram positive, mycolic acid containing Actinomycetes (e. g.
mycobacteria and nocardioforms), and (2) demonstrating scaled-down, microbial
culturing using a proof-of-concept BioMEMS chip device. This research could
eventually lead to a rapid, cost-efficient technology for microbial monitoring
of environmental samples. ***
