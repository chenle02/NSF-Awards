This project is from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and
extends and expands their existing I-Corps Site for another three years. NSF
Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at
universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to
transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide
infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest
funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into
becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of
I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions
that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request
funding for up to five years. Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by
institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may
request funding for up to three years. UIUC's first Site award, funded in 2014,
was highly successful. Many of their teams went on to the national I-Corps
Program and many teams launched startups from their local Site. The PI and Co-PI
have been not only been active in the National Innovation Network, they serve as
catalysts for national activities and assist other Sites during their startups.
The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign previous site has been exemplary.
Their proposal documents their successes and includes additional features that
did not exist in their original Site.
