This award supports research in three areas of commutative algebra. The first
part of this work is directed at studying linkage. The principal investigator
will study a numerical condition on the graded resolution that might imply that
an ideal is licci. He also will study the relation between several possible
definitions for a local ring to be licci. The second part of his work is
concerned with symmetric algebras of modules and Vasconcelos' Factorial
Conjecture. The third part of his work is aimed at understanding reduced and
irreducible projective curves in terms of their general hyperplane sections.
This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in theoretical
computer science and robotics.
