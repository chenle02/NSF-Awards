In many areas such as signal processing, control, statistics, learning, inverse
problems, and management, "large" data sets are often processed to find "small"
solutions, those depending ultimately upon a small number of factors. Since
these solutions tend to be sparse in a way, it is possible for methods that pick
out the sparse solutions to find them from a reduced number of indirect
measurements compared to what are usually considered necessary. This is the
emerging technology of compressed sensing (CS). In this research, the PI
proposes to study a broad range of issues and techniques to advance CS. His
proposed reseach includes the introduction of new methodolgies for exploiting
solution sparsity to accelerate CS computation, the development of algorithms
that utilize operations requiring low storage and maintain robustness to noise
and errors in data, and the discovery of efficient methods for minimizing the
l1-norms of wide classes of functions such as first and higher-order
differences. This project will include an integrated educational program
involving a new course, one Ph.D. student, and the participation in the Rice-
Houston AGEP program in producing competitive women and minority graduate
students.

The new emerging technology of "compressed sensing" is a complement to
traditional data compression. While the traditional technology encodes digital
data using fewer bits in order to save storage and transmission time, the new
technology can significantly reduce the time, energy, and cost associated with
the acquisition of digital data. This is achieved by acquiring digit information
of an object of interest from a reduced number of obervations than what is
usually necessary. For example, the life of an aeriel such as a space telescope
can be greatly extended due to a lower sampling rate (and thus a lower power
demand). Hyperspectral and infrared imaging devices can produce the same images
with smaller sensors, or if with the same sensors, images at higher resolution.
As such, the new technology can lead to breakthroughs for applications where the
bottleneck lies in the high cost of data acquisition.
