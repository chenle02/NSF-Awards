The Rosensteil School of the University of Miami will receive renewed support
for "Operation SWAB." Upon request from a ship or laboratory operator, personnel
from the U. of Miami tritium laboratory will travel to and test the facilities
for radioactive spills at very low levels. A detailed report on background
contamina- tion will be provided and advice will be offered on how best to clean
affected areas. The aim is to provide safe and effective operation of on-board
and on-site sampling for radioactive tracers. The methods are 100 times more
sensitive than safety and health-related radiation control regulations require.
This sensitivity is necessary because of the extremely low levels of trace
radioactivity in ocean, atmospheric, and polar ice core samples. Operation SWAB
can assure facility operators and users that background radiation levels are
appropriate for conducting a range of NSF-sponsored investigations involving
natural and anthropogenic isotope distributions in the oceans, atmosphere, and
polar ice caps.
