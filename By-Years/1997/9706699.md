9706699 Kusky A long standing problem in plate tectonics relates to how mafic-
ultramafic complexes become incorporated into subduction melanges. Several such
bodies are particularly well exposed and preserved in the Kenai Penninsula,
Alaska. The Alaskan bodies are even more intriguing because they represent
pieces of broken up lower crust. This project will address this issue of the
origin of ultramafic rocks by the multi-faceted approach of field work,
structural analysis, geochemistry, and geochronology. The results will reveal to
what extent large scale klippen can be involved in hundreds of km of
transportation in an overthrusting event that brings such rocks to the surface,
or whether they were part of the subducting oceanic slab that were caught up in
the malenge.
