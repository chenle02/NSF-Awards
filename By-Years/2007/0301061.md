The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University hosts a
10-week summer research program for undergraduates (REU) from early June to mid-
August for 11 undergraduate students who are interested in working on physics
and astronomy research projects with professors in the department. These
students will join a large number of BYU students for a summer of research
coupled with social and outdoor activities in the Rocky Mountains of Utah.
Research areas include computational and experimental plasma physics, high-power
laser physics, x-ray and extreme ultraviolet sources and optics, observational
astronomy, acoustics, nanotechnology, experimental and computational condensed
matter physics, the manipulation of atoms with lasers, and solar energy. Women
students, underrepresented minorities, and students with disabilities are
especially encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will
receive a stipend, living expenses, and paid travel to and from Provo, Utah.
Students will experience the excitement of research in physics as they work
closely with faculty mentors. Participants will also receive training in
computation, vacuum techniques, electronics, laser diagnostics, etc., and will
also have an opportunity to develop their presentation skills as they report on
their work to other students involved in summer research at BYU. Funds are also
available to pay for selected students present their work at national and
regional conferences in the following year.
