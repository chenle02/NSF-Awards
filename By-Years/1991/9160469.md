The proposed program is aimed at developing aluminum gallium nitride
heterostructure devices for high temperature sensor and electronics
applications. We will focus on the high electron mobility transistor (or HEMT)
for use as a high temperature microwave device or as a sensitive ultraviolet
detector. Gallium nitride has a large bandgap of 3.2 eV which gives it a greater
breakdown voltage and a higher saturated electron velocity than gallium
arsenide. In addition, it is stable in air to around 800oC which makes it ideal
for high temperature HEMT device use. HEMT devices are excellent for both power
and low noise amplification since they posses a high carrier concentration and
enhanced carrier mobility. Their power and noise performance increases with the
potential barrier at the heterostructure interface. A Phase I program is
proposed to produce high n-doped good optical quality films using a unique
atomic layer epitaxy approach. All the present day growth and doping procedures
cannot produce low resistivity epilayers. A successful Phase I program combined
with our demonstration of high quality films and enhanced electron mobilities in
heterojunctions with aluminum concentrations less than 20% will form a strong
basis for a Phase II HEMT fabrication effort.
