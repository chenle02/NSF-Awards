Appendage morphology and numbers are the keys used to define arthropod
subgroups and on that basis, insects are thought to have evolved from a
myriapod-like animal which had identical limbs on each of many trunk segments.
In a dipteran insect, Drosophila melanogaster, a gene named distal-less (Dll) is
expressed in developing limbs. A homologue to that gene was cloned from Precis
coenia, a lepidopteran insect. That gene is also expressed in all developing
limbs, except the mandible, but in distinct patterns in different limb types.
These results suggest that Dll could be a useful probe with which to examine the
relationships between the appendages of different arthropods and to determine
the origin of appendages in arthropod ancestors. Representative myriapod and
crustacean species will be chosen. Homologues of Dll will be cloned from each
species chosen and the expression pattern of these genes in developing embryos
and appendages will be determined. %%% Although we have some understanding of
how simple molecules might have evolved to more complex forms, there is complete
mystery surrounding the evolution of complex structures such as limbs or wings.
The results of this work should give insight on appendage (and arthropod)
evolution and, perhaps, suggest mechanisms for the evolution of such structures.
Review Analysis Form 7 BIR 9411213 Grace R. Panganiban Dr. Sean Carroll is
striking out in a new direction in his interest in molecular evolution of
appendage development. He is an outstanding scientist and this is an excellent
environment for Dr. Panganiban to continue her studies in this area. She has
been in his lab for 2 1/2 years, first working on a molecular study of
neuroblast formation and then switching to this project. (She is tied to this
area for personal reasons.) Her references were all positi ve and this is an
exciting and novel area of research. The one panelist that was relatively
lukewarm in his assessment of this proposal felt that "this proposal lacks a
compelling evolutionary motivation" but his colleagues disagreed. Support is
recommended.
