9722458 Romsted This award will support Dr. Laurence S. Romsted of Rutgers
University and Dr. Clifford A. Bunton of The University of California, Santa
Barbara to go to Brazil to work with Dr. Iolanda Cuccovia at Universidade de Sao
Paulo and Dr. Dino Zanette at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina on the
study of properties of submicroscopic interfaces. This research will lead to
better understanding of the interfacial forces which control chemical reactivity
and aggregate stability in complex multicomponent association colloids. Two
research groups from the U.S. will join three groups from Brazil, along with two
sets of graduate students from both sides to pursue this research problem. Many
industries depend upon the properties of organized systems and their interfaces
including: cleaning, agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, enhanced
oil recovery, dyes and dyeing, solar energy storage, and environmental clean-up.
