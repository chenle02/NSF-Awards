The proposed project will analyze original data systematically collected
between 1975 and 1989 on free-ranging chimpanzees in the Gombe National Park,
Tanzania. The data records are housed in Dar es Salaam and must be reviewed
there. The purpose is to test the hypothesis, generated in studies of captive
animals, that there is a correlation between the degree of social contact and
the pattern of genital swelling in wild female chimpanzees. It is well known
that human females who live together tend to synchronize their menstrual cycles
(the dormitory effect), suggesting that social contact is the significant factor
regulating synchrony. Laboratory experiments have indicated that synchronous
onset of estrous swelling in chimpanzees is also mediated by social contact.
This project will determine whether similar synchrony can be demonstrated under
natural conditions, thus adding to our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in
the reproductive life cycles of chimpanzees.
