Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center The Maricopa Advanced Technology
Education Center(MATEC) will be operated by the Maricopa County Community
College District (90,000 students), the nation's second largest community
college system, in partnership with ten semiconductor manufacturing/supporting
industries, including giants like Intel, Motorola, SGS-Thompson, and Microchip
Technology; two Tech Prep consortiums with 13 secondary school districts (60,000
students); Arizona State University, the nation's largest public university
(43,000 students); three other Community College Districts (Arizona/Oregon); and
Albuquerque Technical-Vocational Institute. Primary objectives are 1) to create
new curricular systems/materials which reduce the gap between what is taught and
learned in schools and what is needed by technicians in semiconductor
manufacturing/related supporting industries; 2) to provide technical support,
instructional support, and access to resources that faculty/trainers who are
preparing students for careers as technicians need to ensure continuing
relevance to workplace needs; 3)to increase the number of students, especially
women and minorities, who prepare for and become employed as technicians in the
semiconductor manufacturing/supportive industries. Targeted programs are
Semiconductor Manufacturing/Processing Technology, Circuit Design Technology,
and Facilities Maintenance Technology. MATEC's three components are:
Curriculum/Materials Development, Staff Development/Support, and Workforce
Development Support. Examples of strategies are Computer-Based Instructional
Design System, Continuous Quality Curriculum System, Multimedia "Virtual"
Materials, Electronic Resource Center/Form, On-line Q/A, Faculty Internships,
Scholarships, and Workshops/Seminars for a national audience. Outcome evaluation
uses gap reduction model with measurement instrument to be developed by American
College Testing based on specific job profiles of skill levels necessary in
workplace.
