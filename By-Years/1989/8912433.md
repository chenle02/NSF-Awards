Although microorganisms have often been considered the catalysts of organic
matter mineralization in sediments, little consideration has been given to the
relative significance of microbial biomass, either from a static or dynamic
perspective. In fact, microbial biomass is regarded as a negligible or
inconsequential component of total sediment organic matter. This view has not
been substantiated and may well be incorrect. Several lines of experimental
evidence suggest that biomass may have been previously underestimated, that
biomass and biosynthesis may be significant compared to annual organic inputs,
and that to a large extent, sedimentary organic matter may be an intermediate or
endproduct of biomass formed during the mineralization of inputs from
phytoplanktonic or other sources. This view is substantially different from
accepted dogma which treats mineralization solely as a function of the lability
of different fractions of a the original algal detritus inputs. This lability
hypothesis will be tested by determining 1) the kinetics of downcore
mineralization and 2) the extent of organic burial or preservation.
