The NMC 2013 Workshop will disseminate international research and catalyze
innovation in micro and nanotechnology for chemical, biological and physical
applications with long term benefit for homeland security and health to
materials research for computing and energy systems. The Workshop will provide a
forum for discussing results, techniques, and devices while simultaneously
promoting commercialization in the field. This Workshop will allow attendees to
network within the multidisciplinary nanomechanical sensing community including
electrical and mechanical engineers as well as chemists, physicists, and
material scientists. Additionally, this forum will address the needs for
commercialization of novel technologies and standardization through the
interaction with entrepreneurial specialists, industry members, and NIST. The
Workshop is open to both U.S. and international attendees.
