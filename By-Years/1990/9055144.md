Old Dominion University will initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Applied Physics and Engineering for 22 students entering grades 9,10.
This project will (1) provide enrichment and hands-on experiences to enhance
participants' knowledge of applied physics and engineering, (2) offer
participants the opportunity to explore careers in several disciplines involving
substantial applications of physics, and (3) foster meaningful interactions
between participants and scientists/engineers working in these fields.
