The overall goals of this research are to improve the application of spin
trapping to phagocyte cells and to better understand the free radical biology of
phagocytic cells. Using the spin trap 4- POBN, the investigators have
demonstrated that 1-3% of oxygen radical formed can be trapped as hydroxyl
radical in a myloperoxidase-mediated reaction. These results will likely resolve
a conflicting body of literature. The next aim will be to complete work with
4-POBN. A second goal is to clarify the localization of spin trapping agents.
This will be determined by using fluorescent spin trapping probes with confocal
microscopy. Finally, during the course of the coming year, studies of the role
of lactoferrin in hydroxyl radical formation will be completed. This research
will continue development of techniques for the application of spin trapping to
the study of biological systems and will contribute to understanding of free
radical events within phagocytic cells.
