Joel Bowman of Emory University is supported by an award from the Chemical
Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop fully-flexible
potential energy surface and dipole moment surfaces for water, based on the
highest level of ab initio theory. This predictive model for water uses the most
accurate two-body and three-body interactions that are obtained and represented
using novel mathematical representations having the property that they are
invariant with respect to permutation of the identical H atoms. This potential
and dipole moment surface is used to predict the quantum properties of water and
ices including their infrared spectra, their response to external electric
fields and general interactions with solutes. The properties of the hydrated
proton, a notoriously challenging problem, is being studied in detail.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the results of this research
are applicable to the many ways that water affects the health and wellbeing of
society. The software to perform quantum vibrational calculations for pure water
and mixed solvent-solute systems will be made freely available to the scientific
community through a website. The database of roughly 40 000 three-water molecule
ab initio energies will be also be made available to the community for purposes
of developing efficient mathematical representations of this data as well as
testing a variety of approximate electronic structure methods. A workshop on the
software will bring together researchers, especially younger ones, from both
theoretical and experimental backgrounds. Workshop and research results will be
communicated to the public via a website.
