The University of Alabama-Huntsville will initiate a 2-week residential Young
Scholars project for 18 students in grades 10-12 in engineering. This project is
a broad based engineering program intended to promote enthusiasm for technical
careers. The project will allow the students to participate in research
activities in the fields of civil, electrical, and chemical/mechanical
engineering, thus presenting several options for technical careers. Follow-up
activities include exposure to industry and design projects to foster
creativity.
