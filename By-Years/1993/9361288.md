9361288 Holland This project will develop the Software Implemented Fault-
Tolerance (SIFT) Layer for the purpose of enhancing the reliability and
availability of applications running on massively parallel computers. The SIFT
layer will handle the requisite detection, reconfiguration, routing, and
recovery techniques necessary for the protection against hardware faults,
transparent to user application. This project could lead to a cost-effective
solution to unreliability in massively parallel computers for business and
scientific applications. ***
