A number of young labor economists in Western Europe are currently applying
modern econometric techniques developed in the U.S. for studying the effect of
taxation on labor supply. They have been extending these techniques to introduce
additional features such as life-cycle behavior and labor market constraints. At
the same time, interest has grown in Western Europe and the United States in tax
reform. The conference to be funded by the present award will take advantage of
this surge of research and policy interest by drawing together economists from
most industrialized countries who are working on the relationship between
taxation and labor supply. The conference will center on providing estimates for
various countries from a common model, and providing a forum for innovative
research aimed at extending the model in different directions. The results of
the conference will be published in a special issue of an international journal.
