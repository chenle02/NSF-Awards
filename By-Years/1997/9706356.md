9706356 Bilham East Africa is breaking apart as a result of plate tectonic
activity. The goal of this project is to measure the velocity of east Africa
relative to west Africa across the African Rift zone. The speed and direction of
easternmost Africa determines the productivity of volcanoes and earthquakes near
the rift zone, and the formative kinematics of sedimentary oil reservoirs within
the rift. The PI and collaborators hypothesize that east Africa slips NE in the
same direction as India and Arabia. In 1991 they discovered from measurements of
historic markers in Ethiopia, that Somalia is not moving to the SE more than 1 m
per 1000 years (a very slow rate), but they were unable to estimate its NE
component of slip. In 1997 the team will re-measure the very precise markers
that were installed in 1991 in Ethiopia, and measure a 90-year-old British
survey in Uganda, both of which are sensitive to NE motion. The measurements
employ Global Positioning System (GPS) methods accurate to 3 mm, permitting
estimation of 1997-1991 velocities to an accuracy of 0.7 mm/year, and 1997-1907
velocities which include less accurate traditional survey methods, to
approximately 2 mm/year. ***
