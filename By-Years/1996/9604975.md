9604975 Bruno This Americas Program award will provide support for U.S.
participation in "The Fifth International Conference on Coastal Ocean Space
Utilization" to be held in Argentina. The coordinators on the U.S. side are Drs.
Michael S. Bruno and Robert B. Abel of Stevens Institute of Technology, and Dr.
Charles Ehler of NOAA. For the Argentine side, the coordinators are Dr. Ascensio
Lara, Mr. Alberto Lonardi, and RADM Alfredo Jung (Argentinian Navy). This
conference will bring together leading ocean experts from science, technology,
industry, and government to consider questions of how to effectively use ocean
space. The basic theme of this meeting is that the world is using up all the
available space on land and needs to now consider how we can make use of the
ocean. This particular component of the Symposium series is especially
significant because it represents the first such forum for Latin American
scientists and engineers to meet their North American and other colleagues on
matters of special concern in South and Central America. ***
