Potassium channels are important for encoding electrical messages in the
nervous system. The goal of this research project is to identify genetic
mutations, alterations in the genetic code, that affect potassium currents in
the fruit fly Drosophila. More than forty mutations have been identified on the
basis of behavioral defects which enrich for mutations that disrupt the
functioning of ion channels. These mutations will serve as the resource material
for the project. Membrane currents recorded from the mutants will be compared
with those from normal currents for physiological properties. Mutations that
exhibit alterations in one or more of the four known potassium currents in
Drosophila will be characterized genetically and studied to determine the
specific potassium current affected and the nature of the effect. Because of
strong similarities between ion channels from different species, information on
Drosophila potassium channels will aid in studying potassium channels in other
organisms, including humans. Analysis of potassium channels will help in the
understanding of potassium channel function in several cellular processes
including learning and memory, cardiac pacemaker activity, repetitive firing and
mediation of therapeutic action drugs.
