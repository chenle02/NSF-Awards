This project is designed to provide 30 need-based scholarships for academically
talented undergraduates majoring in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth
and Environmental Sciences, or Mathematics at the college. Three cohorts of
students are being recruited through site visits, partnerships with high
schools, open houses, and electronic networking. Selection of applicants is
based upon aptitude for success and interest in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Students in each cohort live in the same
residence hall, take classes together, and engage in collaborative,
multidisciplinary research. Faculty and Career Services specialists are creating
workshops and a network of STEM professionals to assist students with career
placement. Annual surveys and interviews with recipients explore attitudes about
academic support, advising, teaching, and depth of commitment to STEM careers.

Intellectual Merit: Adapting methods used in successful cohort programs at the
college, the project focuses on small-group and inquiry-based learning. Improved
educational opportunities include individualized mentoring, early research
training, utilization of modern laboratory and computing equipment, and the use
of the college marine research vessel. These opportunities provide scholarship
recipients with educational experiences that leverage them into STEM related
employment.

Broader Impact: This project contributes to a broad understanding of how to
attract and, especially, how to retain academically talented students in STEM
disciplines at a small, private liberal arts college. Recent graduates in STEM
majors at the college include 18% minorities and 65% women. Thus, this project
builds on a college program designed to assure the participation of historically
underrepresented groups. The project culminates in a state-wide conference at
the college to share findings on retention with the STEM community.
