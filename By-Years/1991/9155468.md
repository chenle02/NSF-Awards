The Irvine Unified School District (California), in partnership with McDonnell
Douglas Corporation, has proposed a project to improve the science literacy of
youth in grades 4 - 8 through activities to increase the amount of science in
the curriculum, integrating applications of science into other courses and areas
of study, and involving in particular female students. Activities include, inter
alia:: (1) after-school "Science Little League;" (2) Saturday morning tours and
lectures; (3) in-house tours; (4) guest speakers; (5) development of hands-on
lessons; (6) a Cable TV show; (7) development of a Project Dissemination
Handbook. The partnership is shouldering 51% of the anticipated costs of the
project.
