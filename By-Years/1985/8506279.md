The proposed research projects using the combined AES/ESCA techniques include:
study of metal contacts on oxygen-chemisorbed III-V compound semiconductors,
study of MISFET structures with III-V compound semiconductors, and application
of ESCA to polymer surfaces. Efforts will be directed to understanding the
effects of placing well-controlled amounts of oxygen on the clean, contaminant-
free surfaces of those III-V compounds prior to the exposure of metals, through
the comparison with no oxygen present at the semiconductor surface. Bonding
information can be acquired via ESCA, which will be also utilized to observe the
variation of surface band bending. Investigation of chemisorption,
interdiffusion, and reaction effects can be accomplished by the combined
AES/ESCA techniques. Trapping centers and impurity in insulator can produce
large shifts in the C-V characteristics and in the flat band voltage. The
effectiveness of reduction in the surface state density would depend on the
bonding of the dielectric layer to the surface of semiconductors. Both processes
can be carefully studied by the application of ESCA and AES techniques. Fatigue
behavior will be examined as a function of surface composition and structure for
polymer composites and blends.
