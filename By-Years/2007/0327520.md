This project is a collaborative effort to use recent mathematical developments
to improve numerical modeling of the World Ocean by considering how to
parameterize how ocean currents interact with topography. Theories based on
statistical mechanics calculations predict the flows that occur as the system
evolves towards a state of maximum entropy. These flows will be used to develop
parameterizations of how the flows interact with topography in coarsely resolved
models and these models will then be compared to highly resolved models. The
results will be used to develop parameterizations for the widely used POP and
MOM models of ocean circulation which are widely used in climate prediction
studies.
