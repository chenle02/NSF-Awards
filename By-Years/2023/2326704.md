The University of Virginia (UVA) ADVANCE conference project will support a
convening on the issue of failure disclosure in the sciences, with particular
attention given to inequalities of failure as experienced by women faculty in
STEM. Potential topics for the convening include, equitable approaches to
failure and failure disclosure at the institutional level; unexpected outcomes:
reporting/publishing failed research; and ethical dimensions of failure
disclosure for women in STEM. The in-person conference is planned for 2024 and
includes pre and post conference components to support outreach and
communication of findings from the conference. Conference participants will come
from across the US and include different STEM disciplines, faculty ranks and
appointment types, and institution types. UVA will strategically partner with
the Society of STEM Women of Color (SSWOC) and the Women in Research group
(WinR).

The existing literature on research failure reporting in STEM and the potential
benefits of increasing reporting research failure does not sufficiently examine
the different consequences of failure disclosure based on the underrepresented
status of the person doing the disclosing. This work rarely considers what can
occur when failure disclosure is done uncritically, especially when it ignores
questions of power, gender, race, and the competitive context in which academic
science is practiced. The conference thus will seek to ensure relevant questions
are raised about the equity of failure reporting by consulting with STEM faculty
women of color such as: Who is permitted to fail, for whom is failure safe, and
why? Who has gained the institutional credibility to publicly engage with
failure? Whose failure stories inspire, and whose invite blame and negative
evaluation?

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
