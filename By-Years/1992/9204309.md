The proposed research is concerned with control design for systems with
uncertainties. For parametric uncertainties the investigation will focus on both
stability and performance issues with the purpose of reducing the computational
complexity associated with such measures. The systems subjected to structured
norm-bounded perturbations will be investigated for robust stability under
different modeling assumptions on the perturbations from both the signal spaces
and structural properties points of view. The investigation will include, the
problem of designing adaptive controllers using the techniques of sensitivity
analysis, and slowly varying systems. This approach allows greater flexibility
in the plant and controller parametrization. Self-adapting systems designed on
the basis of sensitivity analysis have proved to be very successful in many
applications. However, a complete theoretical analysis of such systems is not
available, and the performance requirements encounter many parametric obstacles.
