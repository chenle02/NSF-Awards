Insects must periodically secrete a new cuticular exoskeleton and shed the old
confining one to complete development to the adult stage. Tanning or
sclerotization of the new cuticle with catecholamine metabolites, hardens
selected regions of the exoskeleton for protection, locomotion and a diversity
of other vital functions. This project focuses on identifying the reactive
catecholamine metabolites or tanning agents and determining how they interact
with the structural polymers of protein and chitin to form the hardened
exoskeleton. The new non-destructive technique of solid-state NMR is being used
to determine how the structural molecules are linked together by catecholamine
metabolites to produce a cuticle with unique mechanical properties. The PIs also
are characterizing the enzymes that are necessary for regulating cuticle tanning
and the action of potential enzyme inhibitors of the process. The disruption of
any step in the sequence can block further development and consequently may
provide highly selective approaches to insect pest control.//
