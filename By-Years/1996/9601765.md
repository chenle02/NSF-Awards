The purpose of this research is to analyze the dynamics of innovation and
technological diffusion in the world economy. One component of this research is
to specify and to estimate a model of productivity differences and patterns of
trade, given the allocation of technological knowledge across countries and
sectors. The model implies that, given the distribution of technical knowledge,
trade can influence observed measures of productivity, so that these measures
reflect underlying access to technology indirectly. Using the model's
implications for trade flows and productivity, the parameters of the model will
be estimated with international data on these magnitudes. The second component
of the research is to specify and to estimate a dynamic model of sectoral
innovation and technology diffusion underlying this static trade model.
Different countries may serve as the major innovators in specific industries,
and the speed of diffusion may depend on the technology in question and the
countries involved. The model incorporates the decision to innovate and to
patent innovations in different countries. This model can be used to infer the
sources of innovation and the direction of technology flow from sectoral data on
research input, productivity, and international patenting. Together, the two
components of the research have implications for: (i) which countries are the
major innovators and contributors to productivity growth in different sectors;
(ii) the extent to which other countries benefit from these innovations, either
through diffusion or through trade; (iii) how innovation and technology
diffusion affect observed patterns of productivity and trade; and (iv) how
barriers to trade affect productivity and growth.
