THERMEC 2011 is an international conference devoted to the processing and
manufacturing of advanced materials. The emphasis of this meeting is on
processing, fabrication, properties, and applications of advanced materials.
This is the 7th conference in the series of THERMEC international conferences,
the six previous ones having been held in Japan, Australia, USA, Spain, Canada
and Germany. Financial support from NSF is being requested to support 30
graduate students from European countries, Japan and Korea, as well as the USA
and Canada. The meeting is co-sponsored by 14 professional societies in North
America, Brazil, Asia and India. NSF has supported this Conference in the past
on 4 of the 6 previous occasions. It is expected that graduate students in
materials science in different academic institutions will be exposed to the
latest developments in the topical areas covered in the meeting, where leading
experts with different specializations will be presenting invited lectures. The
students will have opportunities to interact with their peers as well as with
renowned scholars during the conference. Every effort will be made to encourage
the participation of women and underrepresented groups.
