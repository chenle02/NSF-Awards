9733629&lt;br/&gt;Martin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was submitted in
response to the CAREER Program solicitation. It is a five-year career
development plan that integrates research and teaching goals.&lt;br/&gt;The
major scientific objective is to provide a quantitative process model for the
phase changes (solid or liquid) of internally mixed inorganic atmospheric
aerosol particles. The model will consider water-soluble compounds (e.g.,
ammonium sulfate) and water-insoluble chemical substances (e.g., titanium
dioxide). A series of laboratory experiments will be carried out to provide
empirical input to the process model. The investigator will study the
efflorescence, the deliquescence, and freezing properties of the mixed-phase
aerosol particles. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) will be used to investigate phase
transformations of the internally mixed aerosol systems.&lt;br/&gt;The
educational plan consists of three goals: (1) curriculum development to produce
two new courses; (2) instructional tool development to consist of an electronic
teaching module on surface chemistry that is linked to the internet; and (3)
undergraduate research training. Two innovations proposed as part of the
teaching activities are: (1) a summer research experience for two undergraduate
students; and (2) incorporation of internet-based technology as part of the
course content. The summer research experience will include a summer short
course on research methodology. Results from the summer research will be linked
directly in electronic format to the new courses.&lt;br/&gt;
