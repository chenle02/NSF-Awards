9724312 Kawalec The Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine is a non-Ph.D. granting
institution and one of only seven podiatric colleges in the nation. This small
proposal requests $36, 050 to purchase an MTS Model 858 Low Force biomechanical
test system which measures the mechanical and fatigue properties of various
materials. One area where the equipment will be used is in testing pyrolytic
carbon as a material for replacement of the small joints in the foot. In one
study, atomic oxygen will be used to produce a porous surface on the carbon
which should increase the strength of the graft-bone interface. Another research
area is the determination of the pull-out strengths of various suture anchors.
These anchors are used to reattach tendons and ligaments to bone. ***
