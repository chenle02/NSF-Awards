Dr. Bierbaum is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to study the reactivity, mechanism and product distributions of ion-
molecule processes as a function of translational energy. She has been
instrumental in the design and construction of a new and very powerful apparatus
which is capable of making sensitive high resolution measurements of ion kinetic
energy distributions. These experimental techniques provide a firm foundation
for a better understanding of chemical reactivity at a molecular level. The
newly developed instrument which is known as a Tandem Flowing Afterglow-SIFT-
Drift apparatus provides exceptionally high sensitivity, resolution and chemical
versatility for the study of ion-molecule reactions in the gas phase. The new
instrument will be employed to study a variety of chemical systems comprising
five areas of investigation: 1) Studies involving reactivity, mechanisms and
product distributions of ion-molecule processes as a function of translational
energy; 2) Kinetic isotope effects in reactions of alkyl halides; 3) Relaxation
and reaction of vibrationally excited ions; 4) Generation and characterization
of novel negative ions; and 5) Studies of ion-plasma processes. These studies
will provide kinetic, mechanistic and thermochemical data for a wide variety of
important ion-molecule reactions.
