RNAs are intimately involved in a wide variety of biological activities. During
the process of gene expression, they serve as both the informational molecules
and as part of the decoding machinery. Biological molecules, including RNA, must
fold into the correct 3-dimensional shape to acquire their active-functional
form. The ability to predict of RNA structure from sequence will improve our
understanding of RNA and its biological role. The specific aim of this project
is to characterize the thermodynamic stability of RNA bulge and hairpin loops.
These studies will combine both thermodynamic and structural characterization of
the RNA duplexes to achieve a better understanding of the nature of RNA bulge
loops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will perform all of the
investigations, including the selection of sequences to be investigated,
providing them with excellent training and valuable research experience.
Allegheny chemistry students have an excellent track record for attending
graduate and professional schools after obtaining their BS degrees. From the
last five years, nine of these students are attending graduate school in either
chemistry or biochemistry and five are attending medical school. The graduate
programs attended by students include Yale University, University of Rochester,
Penn State University, Duke University and University of Illinois Urbana
Champaign.&lt;br/&gt;
