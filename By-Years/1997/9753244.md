This Visiting Professorship award at the California Institute
of&lt;br/&gt;Technology will allow the investigator to broaden and
strengthen&lt;br/&gt;her research.&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted in two
areas of mathematics, combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;and cryptography. Both of these
fields are interdisciplinary and&lt;br/&gt;fall in the intersection of
mathematics and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;They have important applications in
Information Theory.&lt;br/&gt;The research projects in combinatorics are on
existence problems&lt;br/&gt;in combinatorial design theory and applications of
decompositions of&lt;br/&gt;edge-colored complete graphs in design theory. The
emphasis is&lt;br/&gt;on explicit constructions using both recursive and direct,
efficient&lt;br/&gt;computational methods. Applications of combinatorial designs
can be&lt;br/&gt;found in cryptography, scheduling, coding theory,
statistics,&lt;br/&gt;computer science, and molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;The
projects in cryptography are of two types. The first is research&lt;br/&gt;in
the intersection of combinatorics and cryptography: an
investigation&lt;br/&gt;of combinatorial constructions for authentication
schemes and of&lt;br/&gt;designs which provide important cryptographic
properties. The second&lt;br/&gt;is to expand and broaden the investigator's
research in cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;Areas of particular interest for research
include applications of&lt;br/&gt;finite field theory, finite geometry, and
other combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;constructions used for public key
cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;An extended visit to the new Center for Applied
Cryptographic Research&lt;br/&gt;at the University of Waterloo will provide a
unique opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and research in cryptography.
This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS&lt;br/&gt; Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;
Sciences (DMS). &lt;br/&gt;
