This project focuses on lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake. The project will be a longitudinal, comparative case
study of sheltering and housing in the aftermath of the earthquake. It will
specifically address the sheltering/housing needs and problems of low- income
Hispanics as compared to a non-Hispanic community. The methodology will be based
on in-depth interviews with local, state, and federal officials and within
Hispanic community organizations. All phases of post-disaster sheltering and
housing will be studied. The study sites will be Watsonville and Santa Cruz,
California.
