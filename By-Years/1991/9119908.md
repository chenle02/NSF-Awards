The purpose of the proposed workshops will be to assess the state- of-the-art in
deformation process simulation and identify those areas central to the
improvement of simulation capabilities. Further, on objective of the workshops
will be to strive to foster joint activities to further advance the modeling of
industrial forming processes and to bring state-of-the-art capabilities into
commercial usage. The participants will be chosen from active researchers in the
U.S. and France, as well as other countries such as Germany, Canada, and the
U.K.
