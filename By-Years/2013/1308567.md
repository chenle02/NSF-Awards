TITLE: Integrating acoustics, behavior, and radio telemetry to develop a novel
technique of measuring acoustic amplitude in unrestricted, free-living animals

Acoustic communication plays an integral role in mediating the behavioral
interactions of many species. Research aimed at connecting variation in acoustic
signals to their intended functions and effects on fitness has focused almost
exclusively on differences in signal structure while largely ignoring the role
of variation in amplitude (loudness). Measuring amplitude is challenging because
amplitude varies depending on the distance between the signaler and the
microphone and the orientation of the signaler in relation to the microphone.
Consequently, current knowledge of the functional significance and fitness
implications of amplitude modulation is based solely on non-quantitative
observations or measures of absolute amplitude collected from animals restricted
to a specific location or arena in the lab or field. Research supported by this
proposal will develop a novel technique for measuring amplitude in free-living
animals using microphone-transmitters, a type of radio-transmitter that enables
a microphone to remain a relatively fixed distance from a mobile, vocalizing
animal.

The fellow will be trained in the physics of sound production and propagation
while developing skills for assaying the directionality of acoustic signals,
computer programming, and calculating mathematical correction factors to account
for changes in acoustic frequency (pitch) and the posture of the signaler. This
research will contribute to the training and mentorship of diverse
undergraduates in both laboratory and field techniques in biology and physics.
In addition, the research will foster a new inter-departmental collaboration
between UC Davis and UT Austin. All results will be disseminated broadly through
public lectures to local Audubon Societies, publications in scholarly journals,
and presentations at national and international conferences.
