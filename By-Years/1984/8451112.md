The overall purpose of this project is to combine transport phenomena analysis
and well-characterized experiments to establish a fundamental framework for
understanding problems associated with the processing of electronic and
electrochemical materials. The synthesis of electronic materials by chemical
vapor deposition of silicon and boron is extended to elucidate more complex
processes including autodoping phenomena and the production of new compound
semiconductors from organometallic reactants. In a second area of research, a
quantitative evaluation is conducted of solid-gas-solid interactions in the
manufacture of ferrites and ceramics and in gas phase catalysis. Finally,
studies are underway that will be used to improve our understanding of porous
electrodes of semiconducting polymers, electrocatalysts, and other new materials
for electrochemical applications.
