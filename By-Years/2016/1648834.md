This STTR Phase 1 project enables the development and validation of a fully
operational hydraulic Power Conversion Chain (PCC) designed specifically for an
ocean Wave Energy Converter (WEC). A WEC's PCC is responsible for converting
absorbed mechanical power to electrical power. Ocean wave energy is currently an
underutilized resource that has the potential to become an important part of a
renewable energy mix providing power up to a third of the US while reducing
carbon emissions alongside with wind and solar power. However, device
survivability is a key challenge that has thus far held the wave energy industry
back. This project includes the testing and validation of various hydraulic
safety mechanisms, advancing the PCC as part of a broader strategy for WEC
survivability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase 1 project will
directly support the development and validation of a Power Conversion Chain
(PCC) as part of a larger effort to design, construct, and test a full-scale
Wave Energy Converter (WEC) prototype in an ocean deployment. The PCC will be
tested using a hardware-in-the-loop approach, in which a computer simulation of
the WEC is coupled directly to the physical PCC elements. This real-time
feedback will allow the PCC's performance to be evaluated for realistic ocean
wave climates, and will facilitate rapid testing of critical safety mechanisms
using the actual components in a safe laboratory environment. Results from the
tests will be compared with a high-fidelity computer model of the PCC to
validated performance. Once proven, the PCC will be incorporated into a
revolutionary WEC design, which offers superior storm survivability and power
consistency.
