High dimensional data are becoming increasingly available from a wide
&lt;br/&gt;range of scientific investigations, including genomics,
bioinformatics, &lt;br/&gt;engineering, and climate studies. Sound analysis of
such datasets poses &lt;br/&gt;many statistical challenges. It calls for new
statistical theory and methods &lt;br/&gt;as well as new technical tools. In
this collaborative research project, the &lt;br/&gt;investigators will first
develop results and technical tools in random matrix &lt;br/&gt;theory and then
take a unified approach using the technical tools developed &lt;br/&gt;to study
several important problems in high dimensional statistics &lt;br/&gt;as well as
applications in signal processing, physics, and mathematics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistical and scientific objectives outlined in this
proposal are interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;and will establish connections among
different fields - random matrix theory, high &lt;br/&gt;dimensional statistics,
signal processing, physics, and mathematics. The research &lt;br/&gt;will also
provide technical tools as well as methodology, to researchers in other
&lt;br/&gt;scientific fields who collect and analyze high dimensional data.
These include, &lt;br/&gt;but are not limited to, genomics, biostatistics, and
electrical engineering. The procedures and algorithms developed in this project
will be implemented and softwares developed will be made freely and publicly
available on the web as open source&lt;br/&gt;code along with the associated
research reports so as to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge.
