9302526 Fintushel Since the 1982 work of Simon Donaldson, the principal
investigator and R. Fintushel have applied gauge theory to study homology
3-spheres and smooth 4-manifolds. The current project follows in this tradition,
utilizing the recent work of the principal investigator and R. Fintushel and the
recent work of Taubes, the work of Morgan, Mrowka, and Ruberman, and the work of
Kronheimer and Mrowka to determine those operations on a given smooth 4-manifold
which preserve its homeomorphism type and alter its diffeomorphism type.
Further, exotic smooth structures will be investigated for those manifolds which
have no Donaldson polynomials, i.e. manifolds with Euler characteristic plus
signature not divisible by 4. The major thrust of this project is to classify
smooth simply-connected 4-manifolds, i.e. objects that are locally modeled on
4-dimensional space. Relativistic space-time is, of course, the best known
example of such a manifold. Although the precise global structure of space-time
is not known, many such manifolds can be described as solutions to systems of
complex polynomials. Only recently have there been discovered examples which
cannot be so described, thus dashing immediate hopes of classifying 4-manifolds.
Because of these examples, there is no intelligent conjecture as to what form
this classification might take. It is the fundamental purpose of the current
project to investigate these and other "exotic 4-manifolds" further and to place
them in a larger and less ad hoc framework. ***
