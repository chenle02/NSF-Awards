This proposal is for partial support of group travel and publication of a
conference proceeding. The conference is on the subject of precise measurements
in power systems in particular on synchronized phasor measurements, precise
timing, and digital recording systems. This relates to a new and promising
development in the operation of power systems. If the technology can be worked
out and the analytical techniques to support it can also be made available, the
ability to control power systems would be greatly enhanced.
