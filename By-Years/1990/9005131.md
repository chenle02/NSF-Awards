This project will assist NSF in compiling, standardizing and analyzing updated
data on the stock and employment of scientists and engineers in the
industrialized countries of France, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and Japan.
Foreign census and labor force data will be used to provide estimates of
scientists and engineers wherever possible by detailed fields and selected
characteristics such as sex, age, educational qualifications and branch of
economy and industry. The National Science Foundation has primary responsibility
within the Government for collecting and providing statistics and analysis of
information on scientific and technical personnel resources. NSF has established
a data base of such information for four large industrialized countries--Japan,
West Germany, France, and the United Kingdom (agreement number SRS-8813944) and
has started efforts to collect such data for selected additional countries of
Italy, Canada, Sweden, Taiwan and South Korea (agreement number SRS 8907725).
This project will make use of new data which is expected to become available
during the next year to increase the data base and further enhance the analysis
of trends. This type of information is sought by decisionmakers in the pubic and
private sectors and is needed for Congres- sionally mandated reports such as
Science and Engineering Indicators as well as the increasingly important report
International Science and Technology Data Update.
