Digital data is the driving force behind much of our modern technology. Cellular
phones and compact discs are ubiquitous examples of the need to handle
information accurately, efficiently, and robustly. This research addresses these
three criteria by introducing finite frames and coarse quantization ideas
(providing redundancy and precision, respectively) so that together they
minimize information loss in the case of noisy environments and machine
imperfections, as well as ensuring numerical stability. The combination of
frames and coarse quantization, as envisioned in this research, will generally
produce small energy error differences between given signals and their quantized
versions, which are constructed by higher order Sigma-Delta recursion schemes.
The exceptions to the proposed general theory lead to a host of arithmetic-
geometric problems. The technology for the theory requires a careful study of
invariant sets closely connected with delicate tilings of Euclidean space. The
first order Sigma-Delta analysis by the researchers proves its superiority over
pulse code modulation methods for many applications. Further, the error
estimates arising in this research will be analyzed in the case of the
multidimensional discrete Fourier transform, which is a workhorse in any
spectral analysis. In this setting, number theoretic problems, associated with
residue number system processors, arise. A major goal of this research is to
develop algorithms that provide reliable transmission of data over so-called
erasure channels such as the internet. The methods that we are developing will
also be used for multiple antenna code design that will guarantee clear, steady
reception of messages in mobile wireless communications. Further, our proposed
finite frame Sigma-Delta quantization methodology is a natural component in the
emerging multifunction environment technology associated with the unified
treatment of radar and communications. A natural application is to reduce a
ship's signature in a hostile environment. Other applications of the methods to
be developed, especially for the research dealing directly with finite frames,
are of a geometric and number theoretic nature. For example, the vertices of the
Platonic solids are finite frames with very desirable properties associated with
sphere packing problems and spherical codes.
