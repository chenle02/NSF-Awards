9619132 Ohme Each year of this 2-year project 27-secondary school teachers from
the Atlanta area take part in 8-week summer research experiences. Nine go to
Emory University and 18 go to Georgia Tech and other research partners. They
begin with a 3-day research skills mini-institute. Then teachers go to their
research sites and work with a mentor or team of mentors on a part of the
ongoing work of the laboratory. Midway through the summer all teachers meet to
share research experiences and network. This is repeated in two day meetings at
the end of the summer and twice during the ensuing academic year. Teachers are
expected to develop a project applying the knowledge and processes to enhance
their students' scientific literacy. They apply for the program in teams of two
or three from a school or district. They may earn 5-recertification credits upon
completion of the summer program. Follow-up work by the mentors includes at
least two classroom visits during the academic year. Mentors are prepared for
their role in mentor orientation sessions along with school administrators. The
project is guided by a large Advisory Council which meets quarterly.
