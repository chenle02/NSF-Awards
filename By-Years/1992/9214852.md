The long term goal of this research is to achieve a better understanding of
microstructure formation during solidification. Experimental studies are
conducted on mushy zone solidification to create improved models of the process.
The emphasis is on mushy zone evolution, particularly in the early phases of the
mushy zone formation, and how this structure couples with the large-scale
transport processes associated with alloy solidification. Nucleation and grain
fragmentation is observed under various flow conditions. Effects of forced
convection, solute concentration, and undercooling on the fragmentation process
is determined. Experiments are planned to determine how the final solid phase
formation interacts with the mushy zone. %%% Success in this approach would
permit development of a predictive theory for real casting and solidification
processes down to the mesoscopic (0.1 - 100 micron) scale.
