Measurements of fine-structure intervals will be carried out in helium-like
ions Ag45+ Gd62+ and Au77+, using accelerator produced ion beams at GANIL
(France) and GSI (Germany), where high density beams are available. The
separations are determined by a novel technique from measurements of the
hyperfine - quenched lifetime of the 23P0 states in isotopes with nuclear spin
I>0. It is also planned to measure the 23P0-23S1 intervals in helium-like Xe52+
and U90+. These measurements will provide precise tests of theories of the two-
electron atom at high-Z where relativistic effects and quantum electrodynamic
effects are very large.
