The project develops and analyzes a new model of choice under uncertainty. The
standard rational choice model for uncertain situations is the von Neumann
Morgenstern Expected Utility model. While economists and other social scientists
have used this model as the foundation for a great deal of research, the model
does not do a good job of predicting how individuals make decisions in ambiguous
situations. The Subjective Expected Uncertain Utility (SEUU) model is simple and
is also suitable for analyzing how people make decisions under
ambiguity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model has a novel event-assessment criterion
called semiprobabilistic sophistication, reduces acts into gambles called
bilotteries, and evaluates these gambles according to an expected utility
criterion. This framework can easily be used to analyze ambiguous events and
uncertain consequences. The basic feature of the model is that betting on an
ambiguous event yields an uncertain gamble. The individual may or may not prefer
such an ambiguous gamble to a bet on an unabiguous event depending on how likely
the two evets are, how ambiguous they are, and his/her attitude towards
uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research provides an axiomatic foundation
for the new theory, develops and analyses appropriate measures of uncertainty
and risk aversion and relates them to properties of ambiguous situations, and
identifies ways to empirically test this model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will have broader impact because a tractable model of ambiguity will be
applicable to many research and policy questions in macroeconomics and financial
economics.
