A combination of sputter coating and ion bean implantation will be used to
produce beta phase intermetallic compounds on the surface of base metals. The
superelastic properties of the beta phase are expected to severely limit the
nucleation and propagation of low cycle fatigue cracks. In the first phase of
the study, NiTi superelastic microalloys will be prepared by sputtering thin
films onto Cu and Ni substrates. Their composition, transformation temperature
and crystallography will be determined. In the second phase of the study
adherent films of superelastic material will be produced on base metal specimens
by ion beam mixing. The effects on low cycle fatigue properties will be studied.
