This three-year project will serve all of the 81 middle school mathematics
teachers in the Pittsburgh Public Schools. By deepening their understanding of
mathematics content, changing their beliefs and attitudes about mathematics,
expanding their awareness of applications, and enhancing their teaching
techniques, it seeks to transform the participants into teachers who are, and
who see themselves as, "mathematics professionals." During each year of the
project, each teacher will attend five days of workshops during the academic
year and a one-week workshop during the summer. Follow-up will be provided by a
master teacher who will assist participants in introducing new content and
implementing new techniques. In addition, after- school meetings and tours of
business and industry will be arranged. The school district is contributing in
cost-sharing an amount equal to 90% of the NSF award.
