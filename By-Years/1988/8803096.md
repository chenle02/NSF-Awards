Rocks undergoing deformation in metamorphic environments commonly develop
mineral fabrics that are preserved in resulting metamorphic rocks. Comprehensive
interpretation of these fabrics relies on knowledge of the mechanisms involved
and the history of fabric development with increasing strain. Laboratory fabric
experiments on rock-forming minerals, while conceptually straight- forward, have
the disadvantage of requiring development and main- tenance of high temperature
and pressure. Technically these conditions restrict the ability to directly
observe fabric development. This project extends an alternative approach that
uses low-melting temperature materials as analogs of rock-forming minerals that
can be deformed under room temperature and pressure conditions. Fabrics can be
directly observed throughout a strain history. This work aims to extend prior
studies principally on recrystallization of camphor and para-dichlorobenzene to
studies of materials that undergo simultaneous deformation and chemical reaction
and to modify apparatus to permit stress control and measurement. Results are
providing insights into the significance of microstructure, crystallographic
fabric and phase distribution in deformed metamorphic rocks.
