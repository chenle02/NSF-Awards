0121726 Orcutt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to integrate disparate
efforts in both the Earth sciences and information technology to develop a model
approach for modern data collection and integration. The approach is to build
upon existing sensor networks and wireless communications to develop the
hardware and software needed for supporting research of the future and to make
information available for emergency response, informed decision-making, outreach
and education, and enhanced scientific discovery. In particular the existing
southern California scientific and educational wireless network will be extended
along the coast from San Diego to Santa Barbara and to the oceans beyond the
Channel Islands. Because of southern California's reliance on water from the
Sierra snow pack and the dependence of this source of water on climate, we will
extend the network to include Yosemite National Park.&lt;br/&gt;Using this test
bed the requirements and utility of wireless networks for collecting and
streaming environmental sensor data in real-time will be demonstrated.
Multidisciplinary data sets (e.g. earthquake, ocean current,
hydrometeorological, and ecological) will be integrated to advance our
understanding and management of coastal, ocean, riparian, and terrestrial
geophysical phenomena and ecosystems in Southern California and well off shore.
The software tools which must be developed for this integration do not exist,
although limited prototype systems are available.&lt;br/&gt;In particular,
existing concepts in object ring buffers (ORB) for collecting disciplinary data
to virtual ORBs (VORB) for managing multiple connections to multiple field
sensors will be extended. These VORBs will not only provide data to multiple
users in real time, but will provide interfaces with archival ORB and more
traditional databases. Many of these interactions will be mediated through XML
wrappers which will provide the basis for data discovery. A rule-based
programmable interface will be developed to dynamically reconfigure and
prioritize data capture and analysis from this multiplicity of sensor networks.
This approach should be scalable as network speeds increase and data volumes
grow, likely geometrically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided under the
Information Technology Research Initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
