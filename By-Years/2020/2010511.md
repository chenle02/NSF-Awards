This project will investigate the phenomenon of avalanche ionization. One of the
earliest and most impressive feats of the laser, soon after it was invented, was
the demonstration that focusing laser pulses with a lens into air could generate
a loud and very bright ‘breakdown spark’, in which the molecules were broken up
and ionized, with the air strongly heated to temperatures approaching that of
the Sun. While this result has stimulated much theory and modeling work over the
decades and underlies several important technologies, detailed experimental
investigation of the onset of this "avalanche" process has never been done --
mainly because the advanced laser-based diagnostic tools that would enable such
an investigation were not available until
recently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breakdown sparks proceed by avalanche ionization,
in which a single seed electron is multiplied exponentially into a strongly
heated cloud by a driving laser field. The experiments of this program will use
the latest Univ. of Maryland-developed high resolution diagnostics to
investigate the detailed time and space development of the avalanche proceeding
from a single electron, and the interaction of the rapidly growing hot plasma
cloud with the surrounding gas. In addition, avalanche breakdown will be
investigated as an ultrasensitive detection technique for trace
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
