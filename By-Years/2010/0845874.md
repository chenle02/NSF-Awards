This research advances the knowledge and capability for
securely&lt;br/&gt;performing general-purpose computation and communication on
zero-power&lt;br/&gt;devices that rely on harvested energy stored in extremely
small&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs such as capacitors. A type of zero-power
device,&lt;br/&gt;computational RFIDs (CRFIDs) harvest RF energy and endure
continual&lt;br/&gt;interruptions to power. Complete loss of RAM on the order of
every&lt;br/&gt;second makes the notion of a computational checkpoint
fundamental to&lt;br/&gt;this model of computing. A significant problem is how
to perform&lt;br/&gt;effective computation and checkpoints in a secure
and&lt;br/&gt;privacy-preserving manner. The most fundamental question is: how
to&lt;br/&gt;securely make forward progress of computation on zero-power
devices?&lt;br/&gt;The exploration of checkpointing strategies that exploit
the&lt;br/&gt;energy-centric properties of computational RFIDs will lay a
solid&lt;br/&gt;foundation for designing secure software and systems for
pervasive&lt;br/&gt;devices. Beyond security and privacy, the research seeks to
discover&lt;br/&gt;what kinds of computational problems can be solved in a
practical&lt;br/&gt;sense on extremely resource-constrained devices. While
the&lt;br/&gt;experiments focus on computational RFIDs, many of the techniques
will&lt;br/&gt;apply broadly to devices with batteries as
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this work will lead to improved
security for computation&lt;br/&gt;in low-power, untrusted infrastructure. The
expected results will be&lt;br/&gt;published in venues at the intersection of
security &amp; privacy and&lt;br/&gt;low-power computation. Potential
applications include improved&lt;br/&gt;security and privacy for (1) implantable
medical devices and (2)&lt;br/&gt;sensors embedded in concrete components of
bridges and roads.&lt;br/&gt;
