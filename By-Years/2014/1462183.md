Seismic risk assessment frameworks support risk-informed decision making in
planning strategies for disaster prevention and mitigation. Such frameworks rely
on intensity measures (IMs) to represent the strength of earthquake events, and
to predict the behavior of key infrastructure components and their cascading
effects on network performance and socio-economic systems. However, the current
practice of adopting hazard intensity measures based on integer order
derivatives or integrals of the ground motion time history is not ideal to
predict infrastructure performance, and may induce significant uncertainties in
the final outcome of regional risk analyses. In order to release the limitation
of discrete integer order differential operations for IM characterization, this
research will use new classes of spatially correlated earthquake intensity
measures for regional risk assessment of infrastructures termed "รก-order IMs"
based on concepts from fractional order calculus. The methodology and tools
provide more accurate probabilistic predictions of the seismic response of
structures and infrastructure components by significantly reducing
uncertainties, thus increasing the confidence in seismic reliability and risk
assessment of complex systems. This achievement will offer broad impacts to
owners charged with managing risks to large distributed infrastructure systems,
and the public at large who benefit from associated risk-informed decisions on
mitigation and response strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use
derivation of novel fractional order ground motion responses to characterize
earthquake intensity, including identification of computationally efficient
algorithms to conduct the fractional order operations. The optimal demand model
form and รก-order for the IMs will be identified to enable probabilistic response
prediction of a wide range of complex infrastructure constituents anticipated
across a regional portfolio. The project will also develop correlated ground
motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for the fractional order IMs and quantify
the resulting reduced uncertainty in risk estimates (e.g. network performance,
economic losses) for distributed infrastructure systems. The advancements
offered by this research will afford more robust analytical methods for
probabilistic characterization of earthquakes across a region, efficient
modeling of the physical demand imparted on infrastructures, and increased
confidence in resulting risk estimates. The overall uncertainty reduction can
advance risk-informed decision making targeted at reducing human casualties,
economic losses, and loss of function of infrastructure in seismic zones.
