Abstract

Partial travel and conference fee support is requested for some of the graduate
students and young faculty who shall make presentations at the "Particles 2001"
International Conference to be held on 24-27 February 2001 in Orlando, Florida.
The purpose is to advance the interdisciplinary state of the art in the
synthesis and characterization of particles and also in particle-based materials
synthesis. These challenges involve most often processes at the nanoscale range,
e.g. self-assembly, templating or force field approaches. Three plenary speakers
of international recognition have been chosen from the disciplines of
engineering, chemistry and physics. Approximately 180 specialists have accepted
invitations to speak in a series of symposia which shall focus on basic particle
processes, on materials, pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, etc...80
more papers have been contributed for oral presentation. Two poster sessions
will enable still more people to share their concepts and results. A very
detailed listing of titles and speakers is available and kept up to date through
the webside "nanopaarticles.org". The focus on the role of nanoparticles in such
areas as advanced materials, particle formation and characterization seems to be
enough of a discipline overlap to generate an interdisciplinary stimulus.
