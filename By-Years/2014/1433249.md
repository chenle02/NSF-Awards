This award will support the travel and lodging of participants in the
Paleoecology of Subarctic Seas (PESAS) working group to attend the Ecosystem
Studies of Subarctic Seas (ESSAS) Annual Science Meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark,
April 7-10, 2014. This working group will present research syntheses related to
the paleoclimateology, paleoceanography, paleoecology, archaeology, and history
of the subarctic North Pacific and North Atlantic. This group will then meet for
two days at the end of the conference to work out the logistics, themes, and
intellectual responsibilities for preparing a collaborative synthesis volume on
the Paleoecology of the Subarctic North Pacific and North Atlantic Seas by 2017.
Funds are requested to support the international travel and per diem of 13
participants, including five students.
