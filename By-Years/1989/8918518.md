This research concerns applying the linear RC modeling technique to model
empirically timing delays in CMOS circuits. A tool, which automatically
characterizes effective resistances and capacitances of MOSFETSs, is being
designed for use in switch level timing simulators or analyzers based on linear
RC delay models. Focus is on assessment and improvement of accuracy limitations
in the model, namely: linear resistance approximation of the nonlinear MOSFET
characteristic; single time constant approximation of the multiple pole network
function; and step input waveform approximation. Techniques include: exploiting
nonlinear body effect in the transmission gate to improve linear resistance
approximation; using a simple single time constant model with an option for
using a more accurate two time constant model; and using a piecewise linear
characterization of the input rise/fall time effect.
