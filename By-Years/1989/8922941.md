Professors Gross and King will conduct research in the areas of harmonic
analysis and geometrical quantum field theory. Professor Gross' research will be
in the flourishing field of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities which he will
attempt to prove in various untried circumstances including some infinite
dimensional situations. Professor King's research will involve quantum field
theory and its relation to geometry and topology. In particular he will use
ideas of quantum field theory to investigate the theory of knots, links, and
braids in Euclidean three space. Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities have been
useful in many areas of mathematics ranging from the theory of smooth surfaces
and how they vibrate to how fast systems of various kinds reach equilibrium. The
theory of knots, an area within the branch of mathematics called topology, was
recently shown to be connected to other formalisms in physics and mathematics,
in particular the theory of quantum fields.
