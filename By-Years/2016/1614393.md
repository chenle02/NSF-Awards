Phylogenetic methods are essential tools that allow for an understanding of
evolutionary relationships and can provide a possible explanation for origins
and changes in geographic ranges. This award support research to investigate
geographic origins and evolutionary relationships of Asian Iris. The project
will focus on series Chinensis, small irises that are distributed mainly in
northeast China, but also found in Korea and Japan. The number of species in the
series is unknown because authors have not agreed on the inclusion of some
species. Our understanding of the distribution of these and other Chinese
species is limited because recent systematic work in Asia has focused on the
Flora of China project, which surveyed existing databases from major Chinese
herbaria to produce an overall account of taxa present. This research will
investigate the biogeography of series Chinensis through fieldwork, and analyses
of new and existing distributional data. This research will be conducted in
collaboration with Professor Xiao-Quan Wang at the Chinese Academy of Science
Institute of Botany in Beijing, China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using phylogenetic
approach, the project will investigate: 1) which Asian species should be
included in series Chinensis; 2) phylogenetic relationships among series
Chinensis species; and 3) the origin, dispersal and diversification of the
series in China. Molecular markers will be applied to test phylogenetic
relationships and these results will be used to test hypotheses about geographic
distribution. Nuclear and chloroplast DNA makers will be sequenced for phylogeny
reconstruction using maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical methods. The
resulting phylogeny will be used as a framework for testing hypothesis on
patterns of geographic diversification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under
the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by
