The acquisition of a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometer is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. Professor Hercules and his
students at Vanderbilt University will use this instrument to study problems
such as the characterization of diverse polymer systems, the rapid qualitative
and quantitative analysis of thin-layer chromatography plates, the quantitative
analysis of FKBP binding proteins to better understand its role in calcium
homeostasis, and the detection of aflatoxins. This instrument is central to this
research program and it will replace a failing fifteen year old instrument. A
replacement mass spectrometer is being purchased with the capability of doing
highly sensitive and selective analysis of complex organic and biological
materials. The materials being studied cover a wide range of polymers and
include important biological compounds such as the binding protein FKBP and the
highly toxic aflatoxin B1. A very broad range of applications and methods of
analysis will be developed using this instrument. Important components of this
mass spectrometer include matrix assisted laser desorption ionization sample
introduction and time- of-flight mass analysis.
