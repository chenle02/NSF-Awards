Current research on immigrants' social, cultural, and economic adjustments have
been dominated by theories that were developed in studies of immigrants more
than 50 years ago. However, there are potentially important differences both in
immigrants and in their host countries that utilization of these theories tends
to overlook. Specifically, current immigrants tend to be from third world rather
than European countries, and current immigrants can receive welfare and
assistance benefits that were not available to earlier immigrants. This study
will examine Indochinese refugees in France and the United States. The
Indochinese experience is generalizable to many other third world refugees and
the two nation comparison will highlight the role of governmental policies
toward immigrants. Data for the analyses will be obtained from personal
interviews, fieldwork, and the analysis of archival records in both France and
the United States.
