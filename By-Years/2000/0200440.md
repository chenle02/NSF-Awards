Freeze/thaw cycles can damage concrete by causing internal cracking or
superficial scaling. The physical mechanisms responsible for these two types of
damage are apparently different, but the details are controversial. The purpose
of this project is to examine the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the
damage, and to test novel methods for preventing it. Concrete is conventionally
protected from frost damage by introducing surfactants that create air voids
with diameters on the order of 50-100 um and spacing of about 200um The voids
serve as sinks into which water can flow when ice forms in the pores of the
cement paste; this prevents development of destructive hydraulic pressures
created by the expansion as water transforms to ice. However, the voids do not
protect the paste against crystallization pressure when ice forms in the
surrounding mesopores. We intend to examine the relative importance of
crystallization pressure and hydraulic pressure with respect to internal
cracking. To control the occurrence of crystallization, we will introduce
nucleating agents for ice into the air voids, so that ice forms preferentially
in those open spaces, where it can grow without creating stress. If effective,
such nucleating agents could be incorporated into concrete along with the
surfactants that create the voids. To examine surface scaling of concrete, we
will employ a novel experimental approach. A pool of liquid is established on
the surface of a plate of cement paste, and the system is cooled until freezing
occurs. As the ice forms, internal stresses develop that are revealed by warping
of the plate; by measuring the deflection with an optical probe, we can study
the kinetics of stress development. Preliminary experiments have revealed
several stress-generating mechanisms: thermal contraction of the pore liquid
relative to the solid paste, transfer of pore water toward the ice at the
exterior surface of the body, and thermal expansion mismatch between the
superficial ice and the paste. The relative importance of these mechanisms will
be quantified, and we will explore the effectiveness of air voids, nucleation
control, and other methods for minimizing the damage.&lt;br/&gt; This research
will be the subject of a doctoral thesis, and will be integrated into the
undergraduate curriculum by having parts of the study done as senior theses and
independent research projects. Freeze/thaw testing will use special facilities
and expertise in the labs of the W.R. Grace Corporation. We will also
collaborate with Prof. Leo Pel (Eindhoven) to obtain magnetic resonance imaging
of the freezing process within the concrete
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
