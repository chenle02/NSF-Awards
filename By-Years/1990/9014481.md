Within the past few years it has become increasingly common for electrical and
optical systems to involve signals that vary on time scales of a few picoseconds
or less, and the development of techniques which can reliably and economically
produce, model, and measure such pulses is a matter of considerable practical
importance. In spite of this activity, however, the majority of short pulse
optical systems are still only partially and qualitatively understood, and the
laser literature contains numerous experimental observations which have not yet
been interpreted. The purpose of the theoretical and experimental studies in our
proposed research is to develop a more rigorous understanding of the dynamical
behavior of short pulse laser systems. The specific systems to be studied
include dye lasers, which are the most common sources for picosecond pulses. In
addition, dynamical models will be developed for the commercially important but
incompletely characterized semiconductor diode lasers. The increased insight
resulting from this program will lead to more efficient and reliable sources of
short optical pulses, means for eliminating those pulses when they are
undesirable, and perhaps to pulses with characteristics that are not now
available.
