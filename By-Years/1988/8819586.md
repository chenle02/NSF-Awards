This project is aimed at providing a basic understanding of optimal control
problems and development of numerical techniques for solving those of a
piecewise linear-quadratic nature. Because many optimal control problems involve
non-smooth functions, the investigation will be partially directed towards
furthering theoretical developments in generalized gradient theory.
