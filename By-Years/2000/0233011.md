This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop high-
efficiency, high-quality dense hydrogen separation membranes based on
nanocomposites of a stable proton conducting ceramic and a metal phase. The
proposed effort would result in highly conductive, chemically stable and
mechanical robust membranes for hydrogen separation in high temperature, high
pressure, and corrosive environments. In Phase I, basic composition-processing-
microstructure-property relations of the membranes will be established through
characterization of the microstructure and the performance of the
membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ceramic hydrogen separation membranes have wide
applications in integrated gasification combined cycle and in fuel reformer for
PEM fuel cells. This technology will benefit the on going efforts in increasing
hydrogen-to-carbon ratios in transportation fuels, decreasing pollute emissions,
and use of alternative fuels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
