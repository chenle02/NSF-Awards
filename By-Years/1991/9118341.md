Minerals in biological systems are deposited in an organic and matrix and
assemble into calcareous structures or skeletons. The organic matrix consists of
soluble and insoluble components containing lipids, carbohydrates and
glycoproteins. The matrix is important in calcification, and in crystal
formation and regulation. Invertebrates are good systems to study calcification.
This project uses an octocoral, a colonial cnidaria commonly known as a sea
whip, which forms microscopic spicules of calcium carbonate crystals associated
with a matrix. The colonies are large enough to provide a sufficient amount of
organic matrix for biochemical analysis and isolation of antigens for antibody
preparation. This organism is an excellent system to probe the mechanisms of
biomineralization.
