With funds from a private donor the University of Nebraska department of Physics
and Astronomy has been able to purchase a CCD with photometric head and a
computer. It is not able to be used to its full potential because the telescope
which the department has on campus is inadequate. In this project a permanently
mounted 16" Cassegrain/Newtonian telescope is used to allow the CCD system to be
permanently mounted and readily available for use by a wide range of classes.
The telescope allows long exposures which let undergraduates get hands on
experience observing just about every class of astrophysical object. This
enhances the astrophysics major program in the following three ways: first, it
greatly improves the teaching of observational techniques by allowing students
to try things on their own and at their own pace; second, it allows the easy
introduction of relevant observational activities into all of the other courses
for majors; and third, it lets students carry out an enormous range of
independent research projects with relatively little supervision.
