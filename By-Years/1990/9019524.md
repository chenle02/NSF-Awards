Precise laser spectroscopy of H2 and atomic helium is carried out to determine
fundamental physical properties of these systems and to investigate their
excited state dynamics. Studies include (1) molecular states very near the
dissociation limits, (2) attainable limits in far-UV spectroscopy, (3)
measurement of the two-photon 11S-21S interval in atomic helium, (4) the Stark
effect in molecular Rydberg states, and (5) predissociation and autoionization
in small molecules.
