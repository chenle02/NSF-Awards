This award provides support for upgrading the University of Utah field system
for magnetotelluric sensing. Natural variations in the Earth's magnetosphere
send electromagnetic (EM) signals into the solid earth that can be used to
measure conductivity and other electromagnetic properties and, in turn, to build
models of geological structure at depth. The University of Utah EM field system
is considered to be one of the leading instrumental systems for EM geophysical
sounding in the U.S., and the upgrade involved in this project will provide an
improvement in their signal-to-noise ratio and will allow continuous E-field
profiling capabilities.
