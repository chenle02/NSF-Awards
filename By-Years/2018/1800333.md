This award provides funding for the Mid-Atlantic Seminar On Numbers (MASON) for
three years. MASON is a nascent regional conference in number theory whose main
goal is to promote and sustain communication and collaboration among number
theorists from the Mid-Atlantic region (defined to include the states of
Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, plus
the District of Columbia). The Mid-Atlantic has a growing and diverse community
of number theorists. The need for a regular meeting like MASON is especially
acute among students (both graduate and advanced undergraduates) and researchers
at the many comprehensive and primarily undergraduate institutions in the
region. MASON conferences will bring members of these groups in contact with one
another and with distinguished number theorists. Thus, the meetings will be an
important venue for professional development and networking for Ph.D.
candidates, junior mathematicians and faculty at primarily undergraduate
institutions. Moreover, MASON meetings will provide opportunities for the
recruitment of students into graduate programs and for contacts between academic
and non-academic mathematicians with interests in number theory. The award will
be used primarily to support the traveling expenses of students, postdocs, and
faculty without institutional travel support to the next three MASON
conferences: MASON II in April of 2018 at Towson University; MASON III in the
spring of 2019 at James Madison University; and MASON IV in 2020 at Gettysburg
College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MASON meetings will feature plenary lectures by
leading experts in number theory and parallel sessions of contributed talks by
participants. Each MASON meeting will feature also a problem session. The
scientific focus of the conference will be on the following areas within number
theory: algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry,
automorphic forms and L-functions, elementary and combinatorial number theory,
modular forms, and the theory of partitions. The plenary lectures will introduce
the audience to recent breakthroughs in these areas, which represent--in broad
strokes--the spectrum of interests of researchers in the region. In the
contributed talks, participants will have the opportunity to report on their own
research and to learn from each other. MASON meetings will also be venues to
forge future research collaborations, both among number theorists and between
number theorists and research mathematicians in related mathematical fields.
