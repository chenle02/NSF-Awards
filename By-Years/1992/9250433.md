This project will create innovative laboratory experiments utilizing the theme
of amateur radio and satellite signal reception and processing to help improve
undergraduate software engineering instruction.The projects will require the
students to engineer semi-formal requirement specifications, architectural and
detailed designs for systems that predict amateur satellite locations, control
orientation of signal antennas from a microcomputer, receive, store and decode
amateur satellite telemetry data, and collect and process radio packets of earth
snapshots from amateur satellites, using well- accepted principles and
techniques of structured analysis/design and object-oriented analysis/design.The
projects will improve undergraduate software engineering instruction in that
they are not the usual business applications commonly found in standard
textbooks, they illustrate the rationales behind software engineering principles
and techniques presented in lectures, they will educate the students in the
process of gaining domain knowledge in a field where they were not formally
trained and they provide an enjoyable and challenging environment.
