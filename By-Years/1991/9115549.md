Pelagic, feeding larvae of marine invertebrates invariably develop from small
eggs that contain little yolk. In order to complete development, larvae must
feed on suspended food particles in the surrounding seawater to supplement the
reserves provided in the egg. In this project, the amount of material available
for development to the initial feeding larval stage will be experimentally
manipulated by altering the number of cells in the early embryo. The effect on
initial larval morphology (size, shape, feeding structures) at the onset of
feeding will be quantified. Subsequent larval growth and development will be
evaluated under limiting and nonlimiting food conditions. This research project
seeks to elucidate the important functional and developmental consequences of a
change in the level of parental investment. The results apply to predictive
models of life history ecology and evolution in marine invertebrates and
foraging by pelagic suspension feeders.
