The School of Mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech.) will
purchase a UNIX workstation, to be used for scientific computation in dynamical
systems, as part of a new graphics and animation lab. This workstation will be
used for several ongoing research projects, including in particular: (1)
parallel wavelet transform, (2) image compression and (3) optimal IFS
generation. These research projects are applications of iterated function system
(IFS) dynamics, which was developed at GA Tech. by Michael Barnsley. They
involve extensive graphics and digital picture processing.
