The content of this proposal concerns a broad array of questions on singular
integral operators, a central area of interest in harmonic analysis. The
operator which distinguishes positive and negative frequencies of a function is
the prototype of a singular integral operator. Good estimates for it in a
variety of spaces and the tools developed in the process enjoy applications to
many parts of modern harmonic analysis that have experienced rapid growth and
widespread recognition in recent years. The investigator is going to tackle the
famous problem concerning sharp bounds for the Beurling operator in Lebesgue
spaces as well as dimension-free bounds for its multidimensional analog on
forms. A broad array of weighted questions will be considered as well, both in
the classical setting of kernel oparators as well as in the non-kernel case.

Finally, the PI conducts research in the area of harmonic analysis in product
domains and its applications. This area has opened up a broad array of questions
and has enjoyed significant growth in recent years. Only recently have harmonic
analysis tools been brought to bear these difficult questions. The range of
questions pursued by the investigator will require the development of new
techniques in Harmonic Analysis.
