Benthic carbon oxidation, denitrification, and benthic fluxes will be studied
in continental slope and deeper continental margin sediments off the Pacific
Northwest coast and the coast of western Mexico. Previous work off Washington
State indicates that a significant amount of the expected carbon rain to shelf
sediments is swept off the shelf and is not accumulating or being oxidized on
the upper slope. Others have suggested carbon oxidation in sediments near the
base off the continental slope is anomalously high and that these sediments
account for a major portion of the total ocean basin sediment metabolism. As
high sedimentary carbon oxidation is frequently accompanied by denitrification,
denitrification in slope and deeper sediments could be important in the marine
combined nitrogen budget. Specific questions to be addressed are: 1) What are
the carbon oxidation rates and associated benthic fluxes in slope and deeper
continental margin sediments, are rates anomalously high, and are there
relationships between flux and variables such as depth, distance from shore, and
dissolved oxygen? 2) What is the magnitude of denitrification in these
sediments? and 3) What is the magnitude of the isotopic fractionation during
denitrification and does it depend on whether the denitrification takes place in
the sediments or in the water column?
