The objective of this proposal is to address various search problems in group
theory. Decision problems in group theory have been studied for over 100 years
now, since Dehn put forward, in the beginning of the 20th century, the three
famous decision problems now often referred to as Dehn's problems: the word
problem, the conjugacy problem, and the isomorphism problem. In general,
decision problems are problems of the following nature: given a property P and
an input O, find out whether or not the input O has the property P. On the other
hand, search problems are of the following nature: given a property P and an
input O with the property P, find a proof (sometimes called a "witness") of the
fact that O has the property P. This is a substantial shift of paradigm, and in
fact, studying search problems often gives rise to new research avenues in
mathematics or computer science, very different from those prompted by
addressing the corresponding decision problems.

The potential broader impacts of the proposed research are extensive; the impact
on the general area of information security can be singled out. The difficulty
of several well-studied problems, e.g. integer factorization and the discrete
logarithm problem underlie most current public-key cryptographic protocols used
in real-life applications. Developing public-key protocols based upon other
search problems, e.g. the conjugacy search problem whose difficulty has been
well studied by group theorists, is prudent from the standpoint of robustness,
particularly if factorization or related developments threaten the security of
current protocols. The complexity of non-abelian infinite groups is a promising
fertile ground for new protocols and there is a great deal of preliminary work
required such as that proposed here.
