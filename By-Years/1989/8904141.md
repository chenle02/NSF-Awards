An investigation of the molecular mechanisms which underly the stimulation of
Na,K-pump activity by thyroid hormone should further the basic understanding of
several physiologically significant processes. The Na,K-pump plays a fundamental
role in all animal cells in maintaining the correct intracellular concentration
of sodium and potassium which is crucial for normal cell activity. One well-
known regulator of the pump is thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is a small
molecule which is absolutely required for normal growth and development. However
it is not presently understood how thyroid hormone functions. It is anticipated
that an examination of thyroid hormone effects on Na,K-pump activity will begin
to reveal some of the molecular details of the action of this important hormone.
Finally, these studies might also provide insight into some general features of
regulation of gene expression which may be of significance in normal growth and
differentiation.
