Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a method used to detect the
presence of an antibody or an antigen.This project outlines a research plan to
develop microfluidic devices that can significantly increase the sensitivity of
ELISA methods when compared to currently available systems. This will be
achieved by selecting the concentration of ELISA reaction products in a trapping
zone. Because the trapping zone in the microfluidic devices has a volume of the
order of nanoliters or less,entrapment of a small number of product molecules in
this region results in a relatively large concentration within it, thereby
significantly enhancing the sensitivity of the assay. In addition to
characterizing and optimizing the performance of the devices described above, we
will also extend their applicability to simultaneous detection of two analytes.
Moreover, we will explore new protocols that could significantly simplify the
fabrication and operation of the outlined microfluidic systems, thereby making
them available to researchers across several disciplines and leading to a broad
impact of this research on the scientific community. The performance of the
ELISA devices described above will be evaluated by side-by-side comparison with
current ELISA methods in use by collaborators on this project (Dr. James Mecham
from the USDA-ARS-ABADRL, Prof. Derek Smith from the Department of Kinesiology
and Prof. Mark Stayton from the Department of Molecular Biology at the
University of Wyoming). We anticipate determining concentrations of protein
biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction and oxidative stress in serum
samples, and monitoring of virus-cell receptor interactions for blue tongue
virus. Besides training graduate and undergraduate students, educational
activities aimed at disseminating the results of our research to a broad range
of audiences, as well as directly involving high school students in research
activities will be pursued as part of this project. This will include
incorporating ELISA methods into a graduate level chemistry course at the
University of Wyoming, and initiating a summer research apprentice program for
high school students. At the same time, the PI will also develop an outreach
program with the Central Wyoming College that has about 20% Native American and
80% first-generation college student population to broaden the participation of
minorities and underprivileged communities. The research findings from this work
will be published in scientific journals and presented at national/international
conferences. In addition, the PI will also post some of the project outcomes,
including protocols for carrying out the new assay methods at his research group
