The University of Florida will be connected to the Suranet by a 56 kilobit per
second dedicated communication line. The connection will be implemented by the
Suranet management using the TCP/IP communication protocol suite. This will
provide the University of Florida with a medium speed connection to the NSF
Backbone network allowing potential access to all six supercomputer centers
supported by this foundation. It will also provide an interconnection to other
researchers nationwide which will greatly increase the ability of dispersed
scientific researchers to collaborate on large, multidiscipline research
projects.
