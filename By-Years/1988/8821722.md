This project is designed to analyze the supply, factor demand, and productivity
responses of different manufacturing industries to changes that occurred in the
economic environment between the early 1970's and the mid 1980's. The data used
to perform the analysis will be the Longitudinal Establishment data set which
includes information on the entry and exist of plants. An important feature that
distinguishes this study from previous ones is that this analysis allows for
systematic differences among firms, so that firms can react differently to the
same change in the economic environment. Exit of a firm from an industry will be
modeled as an optimal response of a firm to the evolution of its own, and the
industry's environment. Industry response to economic change will be estimated
by summing the responses of all existing firms and new entrants. By explicitly
modelling the diversity of firm responses, it will be possible to produce a much
richer analysis of industry dynamics. Of particular interest, will be
predictions of the model's estimated parameters with respect to the response of
industry investment, output, measured productivity, and job turnover rates, on
the one hand, and to technical developments on the other. This research is
important because there are anomalies that have occurred in all of these
responses during the period under study that traditional models have not been
able to explain.
