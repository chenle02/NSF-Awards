9601361 Kuo This is a 24 month award proposed by Dr. T.T.S. Kuo, SUNY at Stony
Brook and T.S.H. Lee, Argonne National Laboratory; and Dr. Yiharn Tzeng,
Academia Sinica and Dr. S.Y. Tsay, National Taipei Institute of Technology. This
proposal requests funds for travel to Taiwan to work jointly with Taiwan
scientists on the dynamics of hadron systems. The research activities include
two major components: (1) calculation of a pion equation of states at high
density and/or high temperature and (2) studies of hypernuclei with three body
forces. The scientists from the U.S. and Taiwan will work together to see
whether a mathematical model can be developed which can better describe the
results derived from the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator (CEBAF) and the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) experiments. This study is timely and
relevant to the understanding of the important experiments on the Continuous
Electron Beam Accelerator and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The project
is jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science Council and the NSF.
