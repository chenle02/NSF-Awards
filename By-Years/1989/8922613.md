This proposal by the National Society of Professional Engineers will support
MATHCOUNTS-- a math coaching and competition program for seventh and eigth grade
students. Such support will aid in providing a community based solution to the
engineering pieline problem. It will allow MATHCOUNTS to attract a greater
number of volunteers to the program as well as more attention from the public.
