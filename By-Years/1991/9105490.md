Summitville is a classic example of the acid sulfate type of ore deposit, but
deep drilling shows that there are "porphyry-type" vein stockworks and
alteration at depth beneath. The deep mineralization has not been carefully
studied or dated. This project is to describe in detail the veins and alteration
of the deep mineralization and to date them (K-Ar on sericite and alunite) and
the shallow alunite associated with gold. It should be possible to establish the
nature of the relationship of the "porphyry-type" mineralization to the shallow
copper-gold and the relation of both to other occurrences of enargite-covellite
lodes such as those in Butte, Montana. Another aspect is numerical modeling of
covellite-enargite-gold precipitation by the newly recognized process of boiling
with decreasing pH. Magmatically-derived waters with admixed meteoric waters
will be used. It is also planned to model processes of mixing and wall rock
reaction. A clear understanding of the processes of ore precipitation and wall
rock reaction in acid-sulfate-type epithermal ore deposits should be
established.
