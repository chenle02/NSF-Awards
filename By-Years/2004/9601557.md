9601557 Gaddam This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Ms. Pranitha Gaddam at the National
Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.
Ms. Gaddam will work with Dr. Keiichi Tanaka, Director of the Process Synthesis
Laboratory, on a research project entitled, "Titaniumdioxide Films as an
Efficient Photocatalyst for the Degradation of Organic Pollutants in Waste
Water". The proposed research will examine how catalytically-active high-surface
area titaniumdioxide films act as an efficient photocatalyst for the degradation
of organic pollutants. Although titaniumdioxide powders are used widely for this
purpose, there has been complications using catalyst powders in slurry
photoreactors as a result of filtration problems. One of the main objectives of
this research will be to improve the surface area distribution of the catalyst
so as to improve its relative effect in the degradation process. The primary
goal of the research is to develop a viable catalyst that would effectively and
immediately mineralize environmentally harmful pollutants, volatile
hydrochlorocarbons in particular, to harmless chemicals. ***
