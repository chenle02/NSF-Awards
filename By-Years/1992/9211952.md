This project focuses on the historical role of law in the formation of peoples'
political and social identities (e.g., citizens of a given nation-state; members
of an ethnic group) in a multi-ethnic society, particularly Sri Lanka. It posits
that such identities cannot be taken for granted. Rather, they are constructed
in the course of a historical process and in that process, law and legal systems
play a part. Also, the project focuses on how law, as a crucial force in shaping
identities, influences ethnic conflict in this multi-ethnic state. Drawing on
archival records related to customary law and the complexity of legal systems
experienced by the people of Sri Lanka, the study provides a unique historical
perspective of the combination of local and transnational forces triggering
ethnic conflict in this nation-state. Further, this historical analysis provides
the basis for introducing a general theoretical perspective for advancing
understanding ethnic conflict, focusing on the indirect role played by changing
legal orders. Finally, the study shows that the influence of global sociolegal
phenomena on nation building has historical antecedents and therefore, is not
unique to contemporary events in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.
