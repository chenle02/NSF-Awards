Hildebrand 9303103 This experiment will deploy a broad-band seismic instrument
at the Ocean Seismic Network- 1 site, a borehole site chosen to test
instrumentation and noise levels for future deployment of a permanent seafloor
seismic observatory. The instrument uses both long period and short period
seismic sensors as well as a long period differential pressure gague and a
conventional hydrophone. The deployment will provide signal and noise records
relevant to future use of the site, and would occur during an already planned
borehole wireline re-entry expedition.
