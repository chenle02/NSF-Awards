The Second Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium will be held at the University
of Chicago March 27 and 28, 2009. The conference will consist of four sessions
of two talks each and an evening poster session. Speakers who have already
accepted invitations are Peter McCullagh, Beth Andrews, Charles Geyer, Keith
Worsley and Ed Ionides. Funds from NSF will be used to defray the travel costs
of speakers and of graduate students and other new researchers. It is our
intention that the Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium becomes an annual
event serving to disseminate the best research being done in the region and to
support intellectual exchanges in the community.

The Midwest possesses a large number of strong statistics departments. To
encourage interactions between these departments and the broader statistical
research community in the region, a number of these departments sponsored the
First Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium, held at the University of Chicago
in March 2008. The investigator, together with the organizing committee, seeks
to follow up with a second meeting in March, 2009. The day and a half meeting
includes talks on a wide array of topics in theoretical and applied statistics
and a poster session for graduate students and other new researchers. The
regional nature of the meeting will allow many graduate students to carpool to
the meeting, thus allowing many students to attend at modest cost. In addition,
we will be encouraging direct interactions among the graduate students to get
them started building the personal and intellectual relationships among their
peers that will nourish them throughout their careers.
