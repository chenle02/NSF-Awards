This project is a multidisciplinary approach to examination of network
intrusion. Prior models have relied heavily or exclusively on traffic analysis
and detection as the basis for NIDS [Network Intrusion Detection Systems]. The
project extends that concept by adding two elements that have not been part of
an NDIS previously: combining sociometric analysis and organizational patterns
using mathematical techniques based on nonlinear and non-monotonic models.
Project outcomes include a draft model, which will have two benefits: an ability
to detect intrusions more quickly and to act as guide for development of
software, middleware, and hardware to deter or to deny
intrusions.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project extends and enhances the
knowledge of both intruders and the tools [hardware and software] they use. The
knowledge gained will enable researchers in the social sciences, computer and
information sciences, and security experts to understand more clearly the
impetus for, the techniques used, and the possibilities for deterring or denying
network or system intrusions. There is significant social, economic, and
institutional benefit to increasing our knowledge in this
area.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Computer and network security is critical to
government, industry, and individuals. The greater the knowledge of intruder
activity and techniques, the greater the potential for deterrence or denial of
such activities. The economic impact resulting from such intrusions and the
economic impact of planning for and attempting to stop such intrusions is direct
cost to any institution. Mitigating such drain is clearly a broader impact of
this project. This is an NSA funded project.&lt;br/&gt;
