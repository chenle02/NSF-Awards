This award is for support for a study to log temperature as a function of depth
in pre-existing boreholes on a transect from Taylor Dome, through the Dry
Valleys to the Ross Sea. Paleo- temperature will be derived from the data sets
by formal inverse methods. A comparison will be made between the oxygen-isotope
proxy record from the Taylor Dome ice core with a true thermal record in order
to calibrate the oxygen-isotope proxy record. Vertical strain rate will be
measured in an existing 130 meter dry hole to allow correction for firn
compaction and ice advection. The data will provide a direct thermal measurement
of climate warming, if any, in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica, and when
combined with existing Dry Valleys climate records and indicators, should
provide information about past regional coherence of climate factors of
cloudiness, air tempeature, and wind patterns.
