This is a project to continue analyses of samples recovered from the Mid
Atlantic Ridge near the equator. Analyses will focus on trace element analyses
and Sr and Nd isotopes on the same samples already analyzed for Pb. Data should
provide insight into effects of shear (cold spot) and hot spots on the
geochemistry and petrology of basalts. %%% A fundamental problem in the
petrogenesis of oceanic crustal rocks is understanding the diversity of chemical
composition and mineralogy. Tectonic effects such as mantle plumes (hot spots)
and fracture zones (cold spots) are thought to play a role. Dr. Schilling's
analyses of rocks from parts of the oceanic crust where these effects are
present should shed light on the important problem of magmatic diversity.
