Proper brain development involves elaboration of a network containing billions
of neurons. This complex process requires the precise initiation, and subsequent
maturation, of trillions of synaptic connections between these cells. This
research project aims to improve our understanding of the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that regulate the developmental maturation of cortical synapse
structure and function. These studies focus on the role of a unique
neurotransmitter receptor, the n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. NMDA
receptors, which sense glutamate released from other neurons are known to
regulate changes in synaptic strength that underlie learning and memory in the
adult brain. However, the role of these receptors during synapse development is
less well understood. Interestingly, the protein subunit composition of these
receptors is tightly controlled during development. NMDA receptors are
heteromultimeric structures formed by association of two NR1 and two NR2
subunits. Heightened synaptogenesis, during late embryogenesis and early
postnatal life, corresponds with the exclusive expression and incorporation of
NR2B subunits to this receptor complex. These studies apply current techniques
in genetics, molecular biology and electrophysiology to probe the role of these
unique NR2B-containing receptors during a postnatal cortical circuit patterning.
Mentorship support is provided for both undergraduate and graduate students. In
addition this project aims to promote career opportunities in neuroscience
and/or biomedical research to students at minority-serving schools in Louisiana
through the initiation of an annual training course in Neurobiology research.
This course will be held each spring at the Louisiana Universities Marine
Consortium (LUMCON) DeFelice Marine Station in Cocodrie Louisiana.
