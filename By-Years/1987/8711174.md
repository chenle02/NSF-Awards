The purpose is to investigate a novel recursive estimation algorithm whose
implementation involves a discerning update strategy, as opposed to the
continual update of most existing algorithms. Model parameter estimates are
determined as the center of an optimal bounding ellipsoid (OBE) in parameter
space. A simple test on the model prediction error determines whether the OBE
needs updating or not. Most of the time it does not. By buffering the inputs
from several independent sensors into one OBE adaptive signal processor, one
could take full advantage of the possible computational savings of this new
approach.
