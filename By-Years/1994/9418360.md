9418360 Walsh This starter grant award to San Diego State University will
support the research of Professor Patrick Walsh. The goal of the research is the
development of new chiral metal complexes and their application as catalysts for
organic synthesis. Specifically, ligands based on sulfonamide-substituted chiral
diamines will be prepared which will form tetrahedral helical complexes when
combined with Group IV metals. These strongly acidic complexes will be tested as
catalyts for carbon-carbon bond formation activity in the Diels-Alder reaction,
the Claisen rearrangement and aldol condensations. This study of asymmetric
catalysis and molecular recognition will lead to advances in chiral Lewis acid
catalysis. The new ligand complexes will be versatile and will be of general use
in organic synthesis.
