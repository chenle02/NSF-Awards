9706708 Yager This grant will use animations contained in the CD versions of the
modules that have been developed by COMET to support instructional development
by university personnel. The goal is to develop a resource of web-based teaching
and learning activities that will be available at no cost for educational use.
This grant will help accomplish this goal by 1) Assemble an annotated catalog of
COMET- produced CD-ROM animations, 2) Make these animations available in web-
accessible formats for popular operating systems and 3) Construct a few examples
of web-based activities which use animation to aid understanding of difficult
concepts.
