This collaborative program will develop and implement a new technique for
measuring the growth of dark matter structure from galaxy clustering. While most
techniques that use galaxy clustering to constrain cosmological parameters focus
on measurements at the largest scales, the investigators aim to use clustering
at the smallest scales, making full use of the information available in the data
with the goal of developing a new cosmological probe based on the relationship
between galaxies and dark matter halos that can be applied to existing data and
future surveys. This approach could develop into a leading probe of dark energy
and other cosmological parameters with the next generation of photometric
surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
graduate students, release of computer code to the community, and outreach via
public lectures.
