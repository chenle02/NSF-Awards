This award is made to Drs. Mark Hampden-Smith and William Buhro in the Advanced
Materials and Processing Program of the Chemistry Division to organize and
partially support a Materials Chemistry Workshop. The first workshop, to be held
in Albuquerque, NM.,October 21-24,1993, will bring together about thirty
participants, active in materials chemistry research and education, to discuss
in an informal setting, research in progress and new directions for materials
chemistry. The focus of the workshop will be the molecular chemical aspects of
materials science. Participants will be drawn from academia, industry and
government laboratories and each participant will give a thirty minute
presentation of his or her work. A report, summarizing workshop discussions will
be produced and submitted for publication in appropriate materials-related
journals. %%% The subject workshop brings together active researchers to discuss
ideas and identify new directions and opportunities for chemists and chemistry
in Advanced Materials and Processing, a critical technology for national growth
and development.
