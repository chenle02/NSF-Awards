The Consortium for Excellence in Teacher Preparation, a coalition of liberal
arts colleges and universities from the northeast with small teacher preparation
programs, is sponsoring a three day conference on STEM Teacher Preparation at
Liberal Arts Institutions to be held at Bryn Mawr College. The primary focus of
the conference is on ways to increase the number of STEM graduates from liberal
arts institutions who go into teaching, while also examining a wider range of
issues related to STEM teacher preparation. The conference addresses the issue:
Maximizing the Contribution of Liberal Arts Institutions to Strengthening the
STEM Teacher Preparation Pipeline. Liberal arts institutions prepare a
relatively small number of STEM teachers, but the teachers they do prepare have
strong content knowledge, tend to take on leadership roles in their schools and
thereby have the potential to make a disproportionately large impact on the
schools in which they teach. By building a network focused on STEM teacher
preparation among liberal arts institutions, the conference has the potential to
significantly strengthen the contribution of these institutions to the national
effort to produce more high quality math and science teachers.
