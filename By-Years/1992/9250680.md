The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a diode array ultraviolet-visible
spectrophotometer for use by students in analytical, organic, inorganic,
physical, and biochemistry classes. Students perform experiments that range from
the analysis of iron in water, to biochemical assays, to the study of kinetics
of inorganic and organic chemical reactions. A flow through cell for a High
Performance Liquid Chromatograph allows for the analysis of complex mixtures
such as aspirin - phenactin -caffeine and mixtures of pinacols. Research
projects probing detection of biologically active amines, synthesis of novel
heterocycles, and analysis of traditional Mayan herbal remedies obtained from
Yucatan, Mexico, allow students and faculty to work together on unique projects
involving the new instrument.
