This research explores the application of fuzzy logic methodology to logic and
architectural synthesis. Constructive and iterative design strategies as well as
adaptive capabilities are being introduced in design algorithms. Theoretical
aspects of adaptation of design algorithms are being investigated. Methodologies
and tools being developed include: 1. Multi-objective iterative algorithms for
physical design; 2. Adaptive placers; 3. A system for logic synthesis and list
scheduling; 4. Technology mappers for FPGAs. These are being implemented in
software and tested on variety of benchmarks.
