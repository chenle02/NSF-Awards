w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9629715 Diehl This research program involves low
energy electron diffraction (LEED) and helium atom scattering (HAS) experiments,
as well as molecular dynamics simulations, of alkali metal atoms and rare gas
atoms on metal surfaces. The goal is to increase our understanding of the
interactions and properties which give rise to the equilibrium structures of
atoms at surfaces. The approach is to determine the structures, the vibrational
amplitudes and their temperature dependence in commensurate structures using
dynamical LEED. The effects of defects such as steps on these overlayers will
also be investigated, and new LEED calculational techniques will be developed
for these systems. Additionally, studies will be made in order to understand the
role of corrugation in the rotational epitaxy of incommensurate layers . %%%
This research program involves the study of the structures which form when
simple atoms such as potassium or xenon are adsorbed on metal surfaces such as
silver or copper. Their structures will be determined by using the diffraction
of electrons or helium atoms. When simple atoms are adsorbed on surfaces, the
structures which form may have the same periodicity as the surface on which they
are adsorbed, or a different periodicity. By measuring this periodicity, we
obtain information on how these atoms interact with the surface. Such
fundamental interactions of adsorbed atoms are interesting and useful for
reasons as diverse as learning how to build better computer chips to inventing
an instrument to measure surface tension. ***
