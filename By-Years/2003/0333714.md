This project is continuing the development and expansion of the content of the
Electronic Encyclopedia of Earthquakes (EEE). EEE is a portal for earthquake
information, freely available to all users, which has been developed under a
prior NSDL award (DUE-0121703) by a team of more than 35 earthquake scientists
and engineers. EEE is a collaboration among three major organizations in
earthquake science and engineering: the Southern California Earthquake Center
(SCEC), the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering
(CUREE), and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS). It
maintains a wide variety of earthquake-related information, including curricula
resources for studying earth science, engineering, physics, and mathematics. The
goals of the EEE project are to leverage curiosity about earthquakes into
increased scientific literacy and, ultimately, to reduce earthquake risk and
loss by improving personal and societal decision-making through increased
awareness of earthquake hazards and the means for mitigation and
preparedness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the existing collection, an evaluation of
the educational benefits and usability of the materials for K-12 and college
educators is being conducted. The activities currently being undertaken reflect
the need to continue adding entries to the EEE, while at the same time assessing
the educational impact of the collection and the resources it references. New
capabilities for usability are also being developed and usability tools such as
Walden's Path and AskE3 are being assessed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant
co-funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences
in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences in recognition of the importance that
this collection of digital resources on earthquakes has for K-16 students and
educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
