Millimeter wave receivers incorporating the highest quality Schottky barrier
diodes presently utilize whisker contacted devices. The advent of millimeter
wave integrated circuitry and planar array receivers underscores the requirement
of a whiskerless, planar Schottky barrier device. At present, commercial
manufacturere have produced whiskerless devices which have far less than optimum
electrical characteristics. The object of this proposed research is to carry out
work toward a whiskerless Schottky barrier mixer diode for use at and above l00
GHz signal frequency which will have electrical characteristics, including
parasitic element values, as near as possible to those theoretically predicted.
This research program will consist of a joint effort between the University of
Virginia's Semiconductor Device Laboratory and the Fort Monmouth Electronic
Technology and Devices Laboratory. It will involve optimization of device design
and fabrication technology utilizing the MBE, ion implantation, and electron
beam mask generation facilities at Fort Monmouth and the existing processing
technologies and processing equipment at the University of Virginia. This
project will involve one Ph.D. student for a period of one year.
