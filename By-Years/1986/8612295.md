This research project focuses on the development of new multidimensional
algorithms for direct and inverse wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. The
phase methods and path integral constructions offer a novel and promising
approach to a difficult but important class of research problems. The research
results will have applications in acoustics, sonar technology and tomography.
