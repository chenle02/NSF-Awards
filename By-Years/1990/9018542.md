Leukotrienes are biomedically important regulatory compounds synthesized from
arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase/LTA4 synthase in mammals. However,
information concerning the structures and functions of leukotrienes is almost
completely lacking in non- mammalian vertebrates. It is important to examine
leukotriene synthesis and action in poikilothermic vertebrates, such as
amphibians because (a) their cell membranes contain other polyunsaturated fatty
acids which may modulate leukotriene synthesis (b) metabolic and physiological
processes are affected by environmental temperature and (c) frog tissues are
simpler than their mammalian counterparts and can serve as less complex model
for leukotriene action. Previous research by this laboratory has demonstrated
biological effects of leukotrienes on hypotension in cannulated bullfrogs and in
in vitro studies on contractility of isolated bullfrog heart and lung strips.
This proposal will examine 1) regulation of leukotriene synthesis by heart,
lung, and blood vessels 2) involvement of cyclic nucleotides and
phosphoinositides in the mechanism of leukotriene action on the heart, lung, and
vascular system and 3) characterization of leukotriene binding to amphibian
heart and lung membrane receptors using radioreceptor assays and
autoradiography. The proposed research will provide additional insight into the
evolution of these important regulatory compounds.//
