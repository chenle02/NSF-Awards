In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Frederick will develop two new approaches for the
accurate evaluation of the quantum dynamics of large molecular systems. One
involves the reduction of large systems to effective model systems of manageable
size including only the critical degrees of freedom. The other develops new
algorithms to permit treatment of the larger system directly. Application will
be to the photo- chemistry of organic molecules containing extended pi-systems
such as benzophenone, biphenyl, and cis-stilbene. %%% One of the outstanding
challenges of modern theoretical chemistry is the modification of standard
quantum chemical methods which are both accurate and feasible on modern
computers to larger molecular systems where much interesting chemistry is to be
explored. Frederick has a unique direction of approach and offers promise of
making a substantial advance.
