The "Smoky Great Plains Geometry Conference" will be held at Wichita State
University on March 17-20, 2014. The conference will feature important areas of
geometry and geometric analysis with leading researchers as speakers. There will
be 13 plenary lectures with plenty of time between talks to encourage discussion
and the interchange of ideas. The funding will help to involve early-career
mathematicians, including graduate students and postdocs. Particular attention
will be paid to identifying and supporting women and other members of
underrepresented groups. The organizers have pledged that at least 50% of the
speakers at the conference will be female.

The focus of the conference is on metric geometry in the broadest possible
sense and the relationship between global metric geometry and topology,
including methods of Riemannian and Semi-Riemannian geometry as well as
Alexandrov geometry and other singular geometric spaces. Key areas represented
will be Metric geometry, Geometric flows, Lorentzian Geometry, Einstein Metrics,
Ricci solitons and Mathematical General Relativity. The overlap between these
areas makes very real the possibility for cross-collaboration among the
participants. The webpage for the conference can be found at:
