0329517 Fukushima This proposal evaluates Surface nuclear magnetic resonance
detection of underground liquid contaminants from New Mexico Resonance, a
nonprofit research company, is for an exploratory Phase I project. The long-term
objective is to develop a non-invasive and remote sensing scheme to characterize
subsurface liquid pollutants and water. Ultimately, this will be an
international and academic-industrial collaboration between New Mexico
Resonance, Montana State University, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of
Sciences, and Yuzhno-Minusinsk Hydrogeological Enterprise.
