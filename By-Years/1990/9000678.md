The scientific staff of the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) are
conducting an NSF REU Program utilizing the University's 10 megawatt research
reactor. Scientists trained in physics, chemistry, and biochemistry supervise
students working on projects in such fields as neutron optics, neutron
diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, analysis of stress in materials,
macro-molecular structure, radiation defects, nuclear archaeology, geology,
analytic epidemiology, nutrition and radiopharmaceutical chemistry. The central
focus is to utilize neutrons to interrogate or alter specimens. The project
areas mentioned are studied by a variety of nuclear techniques including:
neutron interferometry, single crystal and powder neutron diffraction, triple-
axis neutron spectrometry, small angle neutron scattering, deep level transient
spectroscopy, conventional and prompt neutron activation analysis, radionuclidic
assay and radioisotope production.
