The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Molecular Physics
Laboratory at SRI International provides six undergraduate students each summer
the opportunity to participate in research on topics in atomic, molecular and
biological physics. In addition to participating in research with an experienced
mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities such as seminars,
ethics training, safety training, and visits to other research laboratories, to
ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an
engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every
student will have presented the results of the work in a thirty-minute seminar.

This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing
research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong
plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics
and from non-research institutions. The project is informed by an on-going
evaluation.
