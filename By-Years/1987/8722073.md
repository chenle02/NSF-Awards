The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with modern computing hardware and
software, the technique is remarkably efficient to put into practice. The
acquisition of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the
ability of chemists to carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
at the University of Minnesota will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help acquire, operate and maintain important upgrades
for its current X-ray facility. The new instrumentation will be used to enhance
research in the following areas of chemistry: 1) Crystallographic evidence for
nucleophilic attack on nitriles 2) Hydrogen bonding patterns in solid state
organic molecules 3) Structures of new organic and organometallic compounds 4)
Structures of new transition metal carbonyl clusters 5) Synthesis and reactivity
of gold transition metal alloy compounds with applications as catalysts and new
materials.
