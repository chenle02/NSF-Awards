Recent work from the laboratory of Dr. Patterson as well as from other research
groups has identified several secreted and cell surface molecules which may be
involved in the intercellular interactions mediating axon growth and synapse
formation. The goal of this project is to determine the functional role in
neuronal development and regeneration of one of these sets of molecules .
proteolytic enzymes or proteases. Dr. Patterson and his colleagues have
biochemically characterized several proteases, including plasminogen activator,
which are spontaneously released by the distal tips of growing neurites in
culture. In addition, these researchers have partially characterized two
irreversible plasminogen activator inhibitors which are released by muscle and
peripheral glial cultures. Recent evidence from Dr. Patterson's lab has shown
that inhibition of plasminogen activator can increase the rate of neurite
outgrowth in culture. The proposed work will extend these studies to an >>in
viv>>o (rat and chick) preparation. The experimental strategy is to use
antibodies to perturb the activity of this protease and observe the effect on
regenerating peripheral and central nerves in the intact animal. The
establishment of complex synaptic arrays during vertebrate neural development is
the result of an equally complex series of cellular interactions between neurons
and their targets. These interactions occur throughout the various stages of
cell migration, axonal outgrowth, recognition of target cells, differentiation
of synaptic elements, and reorganization and maintenance of final connections.
This research will contribute to our understanding of the role of proteases in
axonal outgrowth during development and regeneration in the nervous system.
