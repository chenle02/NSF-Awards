In the modern development of quadratic form theory, one of the most important
problems has always been that of finding invariants. In the language of Witt
rings, this is the problem of finding homomorphisms from various parts or
subquotients of the Witt ring into other, hopefully more manageable, algebraic
entities. This project studies several aspects of an important subproblem of
this problem called the Arason-Milnor problem. This research concerns the theory
of quadratic forms which is a study of the solutions of homogeneous second
degree polynomials, or equivalently, the study of the geometry of spaces
possessing a symmetric inner product. The project outlined concerns some of the
most important problems in the area of algebraic quadratic forms.
