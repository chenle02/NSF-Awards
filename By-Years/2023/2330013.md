The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a universal atmospheric water harvesting technology for producing
drinking water and water for other uses where water access is limited. Water
scarcity has become increasingly severe due to population growth and climate
change. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 785 million
people live without access to clean water, and it is recognized that a water
shortage is a surging global crisis. There is increasing global interest in
solutions that provide safe drinking water without the environmental
consequences of increasing reliance on bottled water. The proposed atmospheric
water harvesting technology may provide a solution to overcoming the water
shortage of almost any water-deficient area lacking liquid water sources. It is
envisioned that the proposed technology may be used to provide personal water
production equipment as well as scaled to provide household-/facility-based or
community-based water supply systems.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of atmospheric water harvesting
materials and systems that are used to collect and produce water from the air
without consuming electricity. The proposed atmospheric harvesting system uses a
biomass-based composite that is designed to serve as a sustainable carrier of
hygroscopic salts that harvest water from the air under a wide range of humidity
and temperature conditions. In addition, the proposed technology uses the heat
converted from solar energy directly to facilitate water harvesting without
requiring a complex operating system and absorbs water moisture when exposed to
air, no matter whether the composite unit is stationary or mobile. The proposed
technology provides the potential to expand water availability during shortages,
contamination events, and other issues that can interrupt drinking water
services.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
