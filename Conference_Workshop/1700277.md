This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the "Ohio River Analysis Meetings (ORAM) 2017-2019," the first
event of which will be held March 25-26, 2017, on the campus of the University
of Cincinnati. The 2018 meeting will take place in Spring 2018 at the University
of Kentucky, and the meeting will return to the University of Cincinnati in
Spring 2019. For additional information consult the conference website:

The goal of this annual regional conference series, entering its seventh year in
2017, is to stimulate scientific exchange and to foster the area of analysis in
general, and the field of partial differential equations in particular. The
meetings feature invited lectures by distinguished mathematicians and parallel
sessions for contributed talks, mostly by early-career mathematicians.
Anticipated plenary speakers for the 2017 event include the following: Alex
Iosevich, Andrea Nahmod, Stefanie Petermichl, Christopher Sogge, and Jeremy
Tyson.
