MRI/RUI: Acquisition of Touch Sensitive Plasma Displays and Supporting Equipment
for Research and Research Training in Multiple Machine Interfaces

This proposal, studying multi-device classroom technology, centers on the
design, implementation, and evaluation of pen-based computing groupware. The
work, using touch sensitive plasma displays in research and research training in
multiple machine interfaces, emphasizes the applications of such groupware to
educational technology allowing for more display area in the classroom as well
as the use of hand-held calculating devices. Along with the challenges
associated with the multiple-machine interfaces that we deal with in everyday
life, areas of particular interest to the investigators, such as performance
modeling, data structures for storing information, databases, intercommunication
of different computing devices, and educational technology are specifically
addressed. The interfaces run simultaneously on co-located interconnected
machines with varying sizes of screens. The research enhances and continues
previous successful work of the principal investigators (PIs) in a primarily
undergraduate university.
