"Associative learning" is a basic learning process in which animals (including
humans) learn to associate different events or concepts. Dr. Bouton studies it
in animal conditioning experiments in which rats learn that one stimulus, such
as a tone or a light, is associated with the occurrence of another stimulus,
such as a food pellet or a mild foot-shock. This project will study how the
retrieval of associations already stored in memory can influence learning and
behavior in such situations. Dr. Bouton's previous research indicates that the
"context," the stimuli present in the background whenever learning and
remembering occur, is crucial in the retrieval of stored associations. It also
suggests that retrieval of old memories by the context is especially important
when an animal is learning, or has recently learned, a conflicting association.
Such conflict is present when therapists treat human anxiety disorders; new
learning is usually introduced to conflict with old. One implication of Dr.
Bouton's research is that the older memory is not destroyed by conflict; its
retrieval after therapy may cause relapse. A series of experiments with rats
will examine the role of context in a variety of learning situations. An
important goal is to develop and test a general new theory that will integrate
research on different learning and memory phenomena in both animals and humans.
Another goal is to compare and integrate the effects of "contexts" provided by
the physical environment (e.g., features of the room), by the passage of time,
and by the occurrence of other recent events. The work will provide new insight
into the basic mechanisms of associative learning and memory, and will have
implications for the control and treatment of human emotional disorders.
