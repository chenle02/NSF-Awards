Hajian and Eigen will study ergodic measure preserving transformations defined
on an infinite measure space and the effect these transformations have on
unsolved problems of additive number theory. They also will investigate the
spectral measure of an ergodic transformation. The intent is to extend some of
the classical results on Riesz products to the Generalized Riesz products which
arise from ergodic transformations. This project involves research in ergodic
theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of
systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in
microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory
of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way
ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on
homogeneous spaces.
