This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr. James Edward Mark of the
University of Cincinnati and Dr. Stoyko Faktrov of the Laboratory on Polymers,
University of Sofia, Bulgaria, will synthesize and investigate model
thermoplastic elastomers based on poly-(etheresters) and poly(etheresteramides)
with various chemical sequences (i.e., various block lengths), to answer
important questions regarding their structure as well as to improve or even
maximize their properties. The moduli and ultimate properties of these materials
are of critical importance with regard to their functioning as high-performance
fibers and films. This project in chemistry fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
of strong mutual interest and competence.
