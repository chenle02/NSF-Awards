The researchers will investigate aspects of the weak interaction, the force
responsible for radioactivity, inside the nucleus of the least stable naturally
occurring element, francium. Unlike the other three fundamental forces, the weak
interaction does not act symmetrically in all circumstances. It behaves one way
in one set of spatial coordinates, and another way when those coordinates are
exchanged for a mirror image, a phenomenon called parity violation. The
experiments will explore manifestations of this intrinsic handedness in
different isotopes of francium confined in a laser trap and excited with
microwaves. "Forbidden" (extremely rare) transitions by the atoms are linked to
the presence of a peculiar shape of the current inside the nucleus, the anapole
moment, that follows the surface of a bagel. To date this has only been observed
in one isotope of cesium. Because the anapole moment is strongly affected by the
number of neutrons that contribute to the parity-violating weak interaction,
changing the isotope and repeating the experiment will allow measurements of
parameters that characterize the weak interaction in the
nucleus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This international effort, taking place at
TRIUMF, the accelerator in Vancouver Canada, will allow two graduate students to
be educated in the boundary between atomic, molecular and optical physics and
nuclear physics. Local undergraduates will participate during the academic year;
and in the summer Mexican students will take part through a program coordinated
by the Sociedad Mexicana de FÃ­sica.
