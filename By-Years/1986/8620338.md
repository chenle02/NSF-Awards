For a compact set K and a manifold M, the three properties of K being
homogeneously embedded in M, K being isotopically homogeneous in M, and K being
extendibly embedded in M are closely related but not well studied. Lewis will
investigate these properties primarily in the case where K is a closed manifold
with dimension less than that of M, but also for K being a continuum or a Cantor
set. Two types of questions are of interest in this area: 1.) for a given
manifold M, which continua admit homogeneous embeddings in M, and 2.) which
embeddings of a given continuum K in a manifold M are homogeneous. For two-
dimensional manifolds, both questions are completely solved, but in higher
dimensions the information known consists mostly of examples demonstrating
existence of certain types of embeddings.
