The principal investigator, Richard Schoen, will continue his research on the
construction of Riemannian metrics satisfying curvature equations, and on
differential equations involving mappings between Riemannian manifolds. He will
study the Yamabe- type problem for non-compact manifolds. For compact manifolds
he will investigate certain geometrically natural uniqueness questions. For
harmonic maps, he will consider regularity questions for stationary maps,
existence questions for higher critical points of the energy functional, and
generic uniqueness questions for minima. He also intends to study a
geometrically natural functional which is unchanged upon replacement of a map by
its inverse. This should be a useful tool for studying situations involving one-
one maps. The construction of metrics with certain curvature restrictions is an
important aspect of differential geometry with ramifications in mathematical
physics.
