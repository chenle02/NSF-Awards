This project will design and develop experiments of a method of determining the
electron density and the magnetic field in the magnetosphere. It utilizes
tomographic reconstruction using the group delay and Faraday rotation of signals
from a cluster of satellites in the magnetosphere. The project will examine the
accuracy of the technique under different conditions, and will include the
effects of hot plasma on propagation, the characteristics of different
transmitted waveforms, and different receiver properties.
