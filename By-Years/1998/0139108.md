As part of an effort to increase science literacy in the schools and community
involved, this project builds on a number of ongoing outreach programs between
the University and the school district and includes involvement of informal
science resources (the McWane Science Center). Fellows work with a wide variety
of people of varying ages, backgrounds and interests. The program is modified to
accommodate first year, middle year or capstone students (fellows completing
their final year of work) to take full advantage of their abilities and to meet
their varying needs. Fellows are prepared to work in the classroom through a
seminar providing an overview of learning theory and pedagogy that includes two
observations of K-12 students in an informal science setting, two observations
in a K-12 classroom, presentation of a science demonstration and one session
assisting a mentor teacher. Fellows are then offered a variety of opportunities
to establish a partnership with a teacher and work directly in the classroom
helping to implement science standard related materials.
