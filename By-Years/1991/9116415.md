Management of pest species in agricultural environments has become highly
technical since the introduction of synthetic chemicals as pesticides. The
judicious use of these chemical tools, integrated with cultural, mechanical and
biological controls to minimize effects on the environment is an integral part
of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Industry support for a IPM research program
has been obtained to establish an Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Integrated Pest Management at North Carolina State University. The
initial research program at the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Integrated Pest Management will address the impact of pest management on
environmental quality, crop loss assessment and economic threshold
determinations, genetic engineering for improved pest management, improved
understanding of pest biology and ecology, pesticide resistance detection and
management, and development of decision support systems for IPM. The Principal
Investigator and his colleagues are internationally recognized researchers that
have the capability and resources to run the Center. This Center has been
coordinated with Dr. F. Heineken, Program Manager of Biotechnology Program. The
Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University be awarded $50,000
for the first year of a five-year continuing award. Near the end of each 12
month period the Program Manager and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers
Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,
including the following: (1) the extent to which the university-industry
interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to which the support
base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a robust research program is
developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend
support of the next period of this continuing award.
