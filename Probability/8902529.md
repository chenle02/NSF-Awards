Several types of stochastic (random) flows will be investigated: stochastic
flows having singular vortex, homogeneous flows in Euclidean spaces, and stable
isotropic flows. Studies of stochastic flows having singular vortex are
motivated by the stirring of a fluid. The emphasis here will be on the detailed
nature of the flow near the center of the vortex. The emphasis in the study of
homogeneous flows in Euclidean spaces is on relating the nature of the flow to
the spectral distribution. Finally, non-linear characteristics of stable
isotropic flows will be investigated, particularly the shapes of some small
geometric objects. Several types of stochastic (random) flows will be
investigated. Stochastic flows can be used to model the motion of a fluid. In
particular stochastic flows having singular vortex are used to model the
stirring of a fluid. In this instance, the detailed nature of the flow near the
center of the vortex will be studied.
