This grant supports nuclear physics research in several areas: 1) Study of
nuclear reactions of astrophysical importance, induced by secondary, unstable
(i.e. radioactive) nuclear beams using a unique superconducting magnet system
for focusing the secondary beam. This work will be done at the University of
Notre Dame tandem accelerator. 2) Installation, development, and operation of a
very large solid angle superconducting-solenoid spectrometer and detector system
at the Michigan State University -NSCL heavy-ion facility for the study of
radioactive-beam experiments and heavy-ion induced reactions. 3) Study of
charge-exchange reactions with emphasis on non-spinflip transitions and the
isovector giant monopole resonance at the Indiana University Cyclotron using a
large spectrometer in continued collaboration with a Dutch research group. 4)
Re/Os beta-decay lifetime measurement for use in cosmochronology and to set a
limit on the neutrino mass. A large volume low background proportional counter
will be further developed for this purpose. 5) Study of heavy-ion induced
reactions, including the production of high-energy nucleons and alpha particles
at forward angles using the Michigan State University Superconducting Cyclotron.
6) Refinement of nuclear mass models and their application in predicting nuclear
stability.
