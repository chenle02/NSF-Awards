The II-VI semiconductors feature bandgap energies corresponding to wavelengths
which span the ultraviolet to the far infrared, thus giving the potential for a
wide variety of optoelectronic devices. The development of a wide bandgap II-VI
technology has been hampered by the difficulty in controlling the materials'
properties. To achieve the full potential offered by II-VI materials, a complete
understanding of their physical properties is required. This custom molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) system will allow the growth of II-VI semiconductors at West
Virginia University. The system is designed to provide high quality materials
for research into the optical, electrical, magnetic, and defect structure of
these materials. The system is configured to allow a detailed study of growth
kinetics using techniques based on reflection high energy electron diffraction,
modulated beam mass spectroscopy, modulated optical spectroscopy
(photoreflectance and electron beam electroreflectance), and reflectance
difference spectroscopy. Emphasis will be placed on how external modifications,
such as illumination with photons or high energy electrons, can be used to
modify and control the growth kinetics. Investigations will be aimed at
understanding and controlling the fundamental electro-optic properties of II-VI
materials with emphasis on understanding point defects, and how defects control
electro-optic properties.
