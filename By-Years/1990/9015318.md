Approximately seventy leading experts from the United States and other nations
will gather at the Innovation, Creativity and Capital Institute, at the
University of Texas at Austin for a two-day meeting to identify and prioritize
basic and generic research opportunities dealing with the life cycle of
concurrent engineering design. Concurrent engineering has been defined as a
systematic approach to the integrated design of products and their related
processes. Engineers utilizing concurrent design techniques consider all
strategic elements of the product life cycle from conception through disposal.
Concurrent engineering design is a particularly timely subject for an
international workshop because of its implications for increasing the
competitiveness of U.S. industry. Concurrent design leads to shortened lead
times in introducing producible and maintainable products and reduced total
costs of doing business.
