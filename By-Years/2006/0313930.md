This proof-of-concept project involves designing, building and testing a
prototype autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (AUAV). This award (phase 1) is for
building and testing the prototype AUAV. The prototype will have a 5 kg payload
capacity and a maximum range of about 200 km. If this prototype is successful,
funds will be sought for a phase II AUAV to be supported through a separate
grant proposal. The phase II AUAV will have a range of 3-4 thousand km and a
payload capacity of about 10 kg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should it succeed, the
broader benefits that will result from this project include a new relatively
inexpensive, robust observing platform and light weight miniaturized instruments
for measuring radiation (albedo) and cloud and aerosol properties that will be
available to the atmospheric/climate research communities. Regarding educational
impacts, hands-on student/postdoctoral activities will provide excellent cross-
training opportunities between engineering and atmospheric instrument
scientists. In addition, the observing platform to be developed has potential
for use by a broad array of researchers in the geosciences, including for ocean
and land surface monitoring.
