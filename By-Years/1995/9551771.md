This project introduces ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) techniques and associated surface
physics tools into the laboratory program. An existing UHV system is being
equipped with a 3-micrometer-resolution electron gun (to produce secondary-
electron and x-ray emission and allow SEM imaging), an Ar ion gun (for sample
sputter cleaning), and electron and x-ray detectors, together with electronic
units necessary for control and measurement. The resulting multipurpose facility
enables students to carry out a variety of observations and measurements,
including sample surface imaging and the study of electrons and x-rays emitted
when a clean surface is struck by an electron or photon beam. Existing
photoelectric effect and x-ray spectrum experiments in the sophomore Atomic and
Nuclear Physics course are being improved, new experiments on Auger spectroscopy
and electron field emission are being developed for the junior Contemporary
Experimental Physics course, and a variety of student research projects are now
possible in the junior-senior Special Project laboratory. The facility
represents a unique effort to provide research-style tools and techniques to
students while keeping costs far below those of high-performance commercial
equipment.
