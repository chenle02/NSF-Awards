An industrial ergonomics and safety laboratory is being developed to provide
opportunities for undergraduate students to learn to design industrial tasks
within the capabilities of the workforce. This laboratory is a second course in
work methods and work measurement techniques and will facilitate the study and
measurement of kinematics and kinetics of human motions. This project is being
matched by an amount equal to the award.
