9308385 Bernanke This research improves our understanding of how monetary
policy works and how it can best be used. The approach will be primarily
empirical and comparative, with the experiences of a variety of countries during
both the postwar and interwar periods being considered. Three basic questions
about the operation of monetary policy will be addressed: (1) How do we go about
deciding whether a given monetary policy is "tight" or "easy"? That is, are
there reliable indicators of monetary policy stance? (2) How do changes in
monetary policy have their effects on the economy, i.e., what is the monetary
transmission mechanism? (3) What is the best general framework or strategy for
conducting monetary policy -- rules, discretion, or something else? The largest
portion of the research will be on monetary transmission, with a dominant theme
being the role of capital market imperfections. In the postwar context, the
project uses data from a variety of countries to address whether monetary policy
works primarily by affecting the quantity of the transactions medium (the
traditional "money view") or the quantity of bank lending (the "lending view").
The project quantifies the relative importance of the two channels and considers
some alternative ways in which capital market imperfections affect monetary
transmission. In the interwar context, the project uses multi-country data sets
in order to assess the relative importance of nominal rigidities such as sticky
wages and of deflation-induced financial distress in transmitting monetary
shocks. ***
