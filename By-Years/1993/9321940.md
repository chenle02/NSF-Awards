9321940 Tigyi This project continues to research a novel and yet not fully
identified class of lipid mediators with growth factor-like properties generated
during blood clotting. These phospholipid mediators display functions similar to
those of the more delicate and complicated growth factor proteins. The simple
structure of the phospholipid mediators permits their easy chemical synthesis on
an industrial scale, at a cost hundreds of times less than that of protein
growth factors. These naturally occurring molecules are generated in response to
injury, not only in the blood, but also in the nervous system; and experiments
indicate that they are likely to play a physiological role in the initiation of
regeneration and wound healing. The current project sets two goals: 1) determine
the structure of the phospholipid mediators generated during blood clotting, and
2) establish the main biochemical pathways leading to the production of growth
factor-like lipid mediators in activated cells. It is anticipated that learning
more about these factors can ultimately lead to the design and synthesis of new
drugs to prevent secondary neuronal death and the ensuing paralysis. ***
