Computers have become indispensable in the design, simulation, optimization,
control, and scheduling of chemical processes. Yet, the conceptual
representations and computational models needed to more fully automate the
higher-level thought processes of the managers, operating engineers, and
operators of large process management and control systems have yet to be found.
%%% The proposed research is about creating the necessary conceptual
representations and implementing them as computational models in order to manage
the information flow of an autonomous process control system.
