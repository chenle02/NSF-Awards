This project connects White Pines College to the Internet over a 56 kbps line.
Researchers at the college benefit from access to the resources of the Internet,
including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are able to
communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of
research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of the
project for 24 months.
