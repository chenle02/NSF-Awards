Water resources infrastructure and management are central to the sustainability
of communities and ecosystems. They must adapt to increasing hydrologic
variability despite severe uncertainty in future projections. Recent studies
have demonstrated the value of adaptive water planning, which involves
determining how to navigate a range of possible future conditions as they
unfold. However, dynamic adaptation remains a significant challenge in the face
of uncertainties. This includes not only the impacts of extreme floods and
droughts, which are confounded by natural variability, but also impacts of human
behavior such as land use. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to
advance fundamental understanding of the coupled and evolving stressors facing
water resources systems, and to leverage this dynamic information to transform
the process of adaptive planning under uncertainty. This goal is to be achieved
within the context of the northern California water resources system, supported
by sustained engagement with state and local water
agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
