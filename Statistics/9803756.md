Project: Bayes and Empirical Bayes Model Selection Abstract: Bayes and empirical
Bayes approaches for model selection are studied, developed and enhanced for a
variety of different settings. First of all, theoretical frequentist risk
properties of recently discovered empirical Bayes selection criteria are
established for the canonical linear model setting. For graphical model
selection, connections between frequentist and Bayesian methods are investigated
and used to motivate new empirical Bayes methods. For wavelet representations,
robust empirical Bayes selection procedures are developed which accommodate
heavy tailed noise distributions. For Bayesian CART modeling, new families of
structured hierarchical priors are developed. To facilitate and enhance model
search, new MCMC algorithms are developed which move across sets of models
rather than single models. These algorithms use new transition kernel steps,
such as transplantation, which can rapidly traverse the kinds of multimodal
model posterior distributions that arise in this context. These algorithms also
incorporate stochastic heating and cooling to further increase movement. This
research ultimately concerns the development of statistical methods for
discovering systematic structure in large multi-variable data sets. This general
problem is of substantial importance because of the explosive growth in the
technology to collect and analyze such data. Indeed, such large data sets occur
naturally in federal strategic areas of national concern including
telecommunications, biotechnology, and climatology. A standard statistical
approach in such settings is to search for "promising" statistical models within
some prespecified, large, flexible class of potential models. Once found, the
challenge is to estimate the mod el and draw meaningful inference. These tasks
can be especially difficult when the class of potential models is huge, as is
typically the case the number of variables is large. The main thrust of this
work will be to develop new methods to confront these challenges and broaden the
scope of the statistical approach.
