Freedom of speech is a founding principle of democratic society, and the
Internet has become one of the most effective and common means of conveying
expression that is likely to be controversial or suppressed. One threat to the
freedom of speech online is the now widespread practice of Internet censorship
by both private and state interests. These censors use a variety of social and
technological means to limit availability or expression of information, stifling
the democratic process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on
developing overlay networks that promote freedom of speech by circumventing
social and technological censorship measures. The project will develop new
software and protocols for secure overlay networks that satisfy three distinct
security goals: relationship privacy, membership hiding, and blocking
resistance. A secondary focus of the project is on understanding these security
goals and the relationships between them, and investigating the extent to which
existing systems satisfy these properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
train undergraduate and graduate students to perform and apply research from a
variety of disciplines (including cryptography, networking, algorithms, and
coding theory). The project also develops new intellectual infrastructure by
introducing the new notion of membership hiding as a security problem. Finally,
the results of the project are expected to include the broad dissemination of
free software that promotes freedom of expression on the Internet, against
regimes that strongly oppose such expression.&lt;br/&gt;
