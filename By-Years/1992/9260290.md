The project concerns evaluation of a new machining technique which combines
elements of wire Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) and Electro Chemical
Machining (ECM). The metal removal process involves the anodic dissolution of
the workpiece in close proximity to a moving wire. A prototype single-axis wire
ECM machine will be built to prove the concept, in addition to detailed
theoretical analysis. Such a machine, if it is successfully built and tested,
would have the advantages of wire EDM without its adverse heat treatment effects
on the machined surface. Also, in such a machine, high fluid pressures would not
be needed, reducing machine and tooling stresses and avoiding one of the main
disadvantages of conventional ECM.
