To complete the data collection necessary for his doctoral dissertation thesis,
Mr. Jack Rossen, under the direction of Professor Tom Dillehay, will supervise
analyses of archaeological material excavated from sites in the Quebrada de Las
Pircas. This small side canyon of the Zana Valley of northern Peru contains a
series of small habitation sites which, based on preliminary radiocarbon
determinations, date from the Preceramic period ca. 6500-8000 B.P. Excavation by
Mr. Rossen has revealed remains of houses, human burials, and a wide range of
artifacts including lithics, faunal and botanical remains, and marine shell. The
botanical remains include domesticated species, and it is extremely unusual to
recover them in such an early context. Mr. Rossen will arrange for additional
radiocarbon determinations and the analyses of other classes of archaeological
remains. The Preceramic period in Peru marks the transition point from an
earlier hunting and gathering lifestyle to a successor based on settled villages
and reliance on domesticated plants and animals. Because this transformation
provided the base for complex societies, archaeologists wish to know what
underlies this change. The "Quebrada sites," because of their excellent
preservation of a wide range of materials, provide an excellent body of data to
address this issue. Because the sites lie at an ecotone, it is possible to
examine the hypothesis that access to a wide and very diverse range of resources
provided conducive conditions. This research is important for several reasons.
It will investigate the factors which ultimately gave rise to complex societies
such as our own. It will also organize and publish a body of data of interest to
a large number of archaeologists. Finally, it will assist in the professional
development of a very promising young scientist.
