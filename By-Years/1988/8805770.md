An expedited research and development effort is proposed to formulate a
nonlinear control theory of rotating shafts and chains. There will be three
components to this effort: (i) We shall extend our recent work on the nonlinear
stability theory of buckling in rotating shafts and chains to obtain a sharper
picture of the way in which buckling depends on both design parameters such as
mass distribution and shaft stiffness and also on the angular velocity profile
of the rotation. (ii) Taking account of the nonlinear dynamics of these systems,
we shall draw on recent work in nonlinear control theory to lay the theoretical
foundations for active control of buckling. (iii) We shall design an
experimental facility to support and guide future theoretical research in the
control of rotating mechanisms.
