Probability models are used extensively throughout industry, government and
defense, but have long been hampered by the high costs associated with the
computations involved using standard methods. The area of research carried out
by Professor Neuts focuses directly on these issues by the careful and
innovative deviation and testing of efficient algorithms designed to lower these
costs. New concepts introduced by Neuts include profile surfaces and curves
which highlight data that are most significant in the model.
