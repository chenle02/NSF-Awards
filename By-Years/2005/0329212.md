The goal of this SGER is to explore the feasibility of a web-based CAD search
engine to allow the designer to efficiently find qualified prospects for
contract manufacturing in real time from a pool of globally distributed contract
manufacturers. This would require a search system that will allow OEM companies
to search for and qualify potential contractors through coded CAD data in
addition to current text searches, allowing product shape to be mathematically
converted into searchable code. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exploratory research
will determine the feasibility of converting the description of a product's
shape from its Boundary Model Representation (B-Rep) as represented by the
theory of solid modeling into a boundary value problem as governed by field
theory. The tasks include determining if a code or "fingerprint" of a mechanical
product shape can be mapped through electrostatic field analysis. In order to
have significant broader impact on the potential industrial applications in
purchasing and production planning, this mapping must be an efficient and secure
method for CAD data coding and classification
