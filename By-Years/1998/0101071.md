This award provides funds, through Kenyon College, for an REU Site in
archaeology and cultural anthropology at the Lower Cacaulapa Project in NW
Honduras. Eight students will conduct independent field investigations supported
by in-field class instruction and a living and working situation. Participants
will take a common core of seminars that introduce them to archaeological and
ethnographic methods and theory and sensitize them to the political, cultural,
and economic context in which they live and work. Student investigations will
include explorations of modern and ancient cultural processes and behavioral
patterns. This course of study is founded on the directors' considerable
experience in collaborating with and teaching undergraduates within field
settings in the past, most particularly on NSF REU Site projects that they
directed in the Naco vally, Honduras in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1995, and 1996, and in
the lower Cacaulapa valley during 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
