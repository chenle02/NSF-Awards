The Ukrainian government has asked the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine
(NASU) for advice with regard to projections for extreme flooding and plans for
dealing with such events, including consulting international expertise. The NASU
turned to the US National Academies (NAS/NAE/NRC) to seek a joint effort in
understanding the degree of climate-change-induced increased risk of flooding in
the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, and other changes in the water sector, and
in addressing how to manage these risks. A Workshop to address these questions,
to be hosted by the US National Academies, is planned for late Fall 2009 in
Washington DC. The Army Corps of Engineers? International Center for Integrated
Water Resources Management is providing core funding to support the Workshop,
with additional support from the National Science Foundation.
