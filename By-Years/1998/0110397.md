0110397 Honrath

This two-year award for US-Portugal collaboration on assessing the impacts of
continental emissions from North America and Europe upon tropospheric
composition in the North Atlantic region involves Richard Honrath of Michigan
Technological University and Paulo Fialho at the University of the Azores,
Portugal. Measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide, black carbon, and
meteorological parameters will be made at the Pico International Atmospheric
Chemistry Observatory for a two-year period to test the hypothesis that
significant formation of ozone occurs in plumes from North America advected
toward the central North Atlantic.

The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in atmospheric
chemistry measurements at remote field sites in the North Atlantic region and
they will provide the measurement station infrastructure. This is complemented
by Portuguese expertise in atmospheric and land conditions in the Azores region;
the Portuguese will provide black carbon measurements. The results of this
research are expected to contribute to an understanding of anthropogenic impacts
on the earth's radiation budget, and aid the development of improved estimates
of current and future impacts on climate.
