There have been recent advances in understanding various ways of imbedding our
universe in the 10 dimensional space where a consistent unified theory of
particles which have extension (rather than being point-like) exists. The time
is thus now ripe for bringing systematic methods to bear on the construction and
analysis of compactifications of string theory as models of realistic particle
physics. The String Vacuum Project aims to pursue a systematic study of the
space of string compactifications leading to four-dimensional physics. The PIs
will accomplish this with a two pronged approach. Using a bottom-up strategy the
members of the collaboration will search for patches of string vacua which are
as close as possible to low energy, phenomenologically acceptable theories.
These can hopefully be tested at the Large Hadron Collider . On the other hand,
using a top-down strategy the collaboration will pursue a general search of the
string landscape of vacua in search of more general correlations. In order to
accomplish their goals the PIs are proposing a String Vacuum Project (SVP)
network with eight geographic nodes. They are asking for funds to support
students who will work in the proposed area and funds to support travel to bi-
annual network workshops. This project has many broader implications. The
explicit work on interpreting LHC data and on approaches to finding a theory
underlying the signals will help realize the full potential of LHC, a project
strongly supported by U.S. physics goals. This project is strongly
interdisciplinary, involving particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, string
theory, mathematics, and information frontier analysis. The results will be
disseminated via publication at all possible levels. There will be significant
training of graduate students and postdocs, and the project will involve female
and minority scientists to provide role model. The Pis anticipate that the
results of this project will stimulate significant public interest, and they
will systematically communicate results through public talks and articles.
