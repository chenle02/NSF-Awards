The objective of this research grant is to establish a computer design procedure
for product structures that will provide the highest strength or highest
stiffness for a given weight of material. This will be accomplished by direct
solution of the equations defining the optimum structural layout for desired
loading and boundary conditions. The method of solution will involve the use of
matrix operators, and one part of the work will be the extension of the set of
matrix operators to handle a range of different boundary situations. The
procedure will be appropriately applied on personal computers so that it can be
widely used in the engineering design community. The research program will also
involve the manufacture and testing of prototype structures to validate the
design process at each stage of the research. Case studies will be carried out
to illustrate the range of weight reduction opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the principal benefit of the study will be
a new approach to weight reduction, spanning a wide range of applications from
aerospace to mass-produced durable goods. It is also anticipated that the
fundamental and direct approach to structure design, developed in the research,
will be appealing to engineering educators and will impact the teaching of
structural engineering and engineering design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
