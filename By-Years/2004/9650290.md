This project continues and expands previous work on developing multimedia
instruction for undergraduate electrical engineering laboratories. Acquisitions
have been made of some computers and ancillary equipment and software expand the
number of laboratories where multimedia instruction can be employed. The
development platform is placed on a movable workstation for use by faculty,
while the notebook computers take lessons to every laboratory situations. This
grant request also expands the impact of this work by targeting the Circuits
Laboratory (a core course for the School of Engineering), supporting
dissemination via CD ROM and the World-Wide Web, and by improving the quality of
lessons that are prepared. The primary audience impacted is undergraduate
students in laboratories and engineering faculty preparing multimedia
instruction.
