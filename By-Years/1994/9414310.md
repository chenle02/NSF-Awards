9414310 Taylor About once each day the BATSE experiment on the Compton Gamma
Ray Observatory measures a sudden short burst of energetic radiation. The source
of these gamma ray bursts is completely unknown. Detection of bursts at radio
wavelengths in addition to gamma energies would provide a great deal of
information on the sources. The PI will attempt this using an automated radio
telescope which can search for a burst within five seconds of its detection by
BATSE. ***
