9561379 Chandler This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks
to discover one or more chemical additives for LiBr-H2O vapor absorption
chillers that will significantly improve absorption rates compared to currently
available additives. Current state-of-the-art absorption chiller technology uses
performance additives to increase rates of vapor absorption in order to reduce
absorber size and cost and to make the technology economically feasible. An
additive meeting this goal will enable absorption chillers to be built with
significantly smaller copper tube heat exchangers, resulting in reduced first
costs. This in turn will allow for increased market share for absorption
chillers in the air conditioning industry, and significantly enhance the
competitiveness of this non-CFC containing alternative technology. Candidate
additives will be selected based on the chemical properties that can be expected
from their structure. Absorption rate enhancement activity will be determined
using a falling film test absorption machine. Potential commercial applications
include all machines in service and all new designs of LiBr-H2O absorption
chillers, used for cooling buildings requiring 100 tons to several thousand
tons.
