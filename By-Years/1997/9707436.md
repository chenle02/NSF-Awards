The Index Nominum Algarum is a card file of all the published names of all known
species of algae. It includes about 184,000 names and 70,000 literature
references that have been amassed during the entirety of the career of the PI,
who is an imminent authority on algal systematics. Currently, this card file
exists in only a single paper copy. Having this resource archived in CD-ROM
format (as images of the cards) will ensure that the resource will not be lost.
This conversion to CD-ROM will also facilitate further conversion to an
electronic database that will be of exceptional use to a wide variety of users
in governmental and non-governmental agencies, research and education. This
project is co-funded by NSF and the Biological Resources Division of the USGS on
behalf of the Integrated Taxonomic Information Service of U.S. government
agencies.
