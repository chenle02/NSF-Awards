This study concerns fundamental research in melting and solidification.
Researchers will engage in a combined theoretical and experimental study of the
phase change phenomena occurring in materials surrounding finned surfaces. The
results of this study can have an impact on thermal systems used in energy
storage, nuclear reactor safety, food processing, and cryosurgery.
