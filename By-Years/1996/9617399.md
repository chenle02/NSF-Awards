9617399 Jones This planning grant will engage the QEM Network in identifying
strategies and making recommendations to NSF on increasing the pool of minority
candidates for science and mathematics teachers. Specifically, QEM will work
with the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching.
They will examine the recruiting and selection process, and identify key
organizations and individuals who can assist in enlarging the diversity of the
applicant pool. They will develop a database of principals, department chairs
and other school officials in predominantly minority school districts that can
provide assistance. Successfully identified strategies and the database can be
disseminated to all teacher enhancement projects.
