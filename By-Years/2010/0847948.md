The fourth conference on Synchrotron Environmental Science (SES-IV) will focus
attention on frontier scientific challenges in geobiology, low-temperature
geochemistry, geosciences energy, and environmental health and remediation
research for which synchrotron (SR)-based science will be pivotal. The
conference will also highlight new methods and facility developments in the U.S.
The conference will be held during December 11-13, 2008, in San Francisco,
California.

A crucial objective of SES-IV is to involve and train graduate students and post
doctoral fellows interested in using synchrotron techniques in their research
programs and to provide them with the opportunity to interact with leading
scientific figures in the field. An entire day of the conference ? half of the
agenda - will be dedicated to hands-on training sessions and introductory-level
talks for this audience. This grant will encourage participation by this
important group by providing travel scholarships for graduate student and post
doctoral participants. Further, by providing a forum for pre-eminent scientists,
synchrotron facility staff, and students, to interact and exchange information,
SES-IV will catalyze research discoveries in carbon-neutral energy sources,
preservation and clean-up of natural resources, environmental health, and CO2
sequestration.
