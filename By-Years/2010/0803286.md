The goal of this project is to gain a molecular-level understanding of the
regulation of methane gene expression in Archaea. A range of in vitro molecular
techniques will be used to comprehensively characterize two regulators of
methane gene transcription in Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicu. This
research will help establish how methanogenesis is regulated, and the dissection
of the regulatory mechanics will substantially extend knowledge of transcription
regulation in Archaea. Methanogenesis is a metabolism of global environmental
and economic importance and the results obtained will add insight into the
regulation of methane generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
contribute to the career development of an underrepresented minority
investigator through establishment of her research program at the University of
Oklahoma. Research opportunities will be provided for a graduate student and one
undergraduate in molecular microbiology, anaerobic microbiology, and
biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
