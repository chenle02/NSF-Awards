Stavros Garoufalidis plans to study applications of quantum field theory to
3-dimensional topology and geometry. This work is motivated by the Chern-Simons
path integral, its exact computation (in terms of quantum invariants of knots
and 3-manifolds) and its perturbative expansion. Quantum field theory predicts
that invariants of knots and 3-manifolds which are defined via cut-and-paste
topology carry geometric information of the underlying structures; in particular
of the fundamental group of a 3-manifold and its representations to Lie groups.
A key question is to recover the geometric information (described in terms of
surgery theory or Riemannian hyperbolic geometry) by taking an appropriate limit
of quantum invariants.

The above mentioned relation between physics and mathematics has deep roots in
the past century. Mathematics has strongly influenced Physics, as is evident
from the development of Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity,
which describe our world in three quite different scales. Knotedness is a
fundamental property that binds fundamental particles together, but also the DNA
molecule. The most recent interaction between 3-dimensional quantum field theory
and topology aims at describing knotedness in terms of geometric and topological
language. Topology could be a unifying language to describe the building blocks
of physics, but also of life itself.
