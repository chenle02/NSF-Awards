The objectives of the proposed work are to study muonium defect centers in
semiconductors by muon spin rotation an muon level- crossing resonance and
thereby provide information about the structures, diffusion, and reactions of
muonium, and by inference, hydrogen in semiconductors. Little is known about
isolated hydrogen in semiconductors, despite the importance of hydrogen in
semiconductors relating to its passivation of electrically- active defects. ESR
and ENDOR studies have had little impact on the study of hydrogen. Muon studies
given data similar to ESR and ENDOR and permit drawing detailed structural
inferences. Both the effects of charges which are not neutral and neutral
muonium in other materials, and nuclear hyperfine measurements will be studied
yielding structural information.
