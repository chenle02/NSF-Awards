This research is an engineering approach to the solution of two fundamental
problems in designing systolic arrays, namely, restructuring of algorithms for
increased parallelism and efficient mapping of algorithms into systolic arrays.
The study investigates: new syntactic and semantic transformations on complex
algorithms for optimizing area, time, input/output, and other parameters in the
systolic architecture; efficient methodology for mapping algorithms onto two- or
three-dimensional systolic arrays with feedbacks, replicated data, general
timing, and limited or full broadcasting and other architectural constraints;
design of macropipelines of systolic arrays and the related problems in
interconnection, buffering, timing, and closure property; and design of
macropipelines of systolic arrays for image processing and pattern recognition.
Emphasis is on both theoretical and practical approaches in this research. With
the theory developed, an automated design tool is being implemented so that it
can be interfaced with existing VLSI design tools.
