CAREER: Dark Matter and Black Holes, Deconstructing
Galaxies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0349095 Karl
Gebhardt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Karl Gebhardt, at the University of Texas,
Austin, will undertake an observational plan of research that addresses two
areas of galactic research. The first part of the study involves the central
supermassive black holes that reside in galaxies. The goal of the research is to
investigate the existence of black holes in globular clusters and to study the
properties of massive galaxies with the largest known black holes. The purpose
of the work is to allow for stringent tests of evolutionary models that predict
correlations between black holes and the properties of their host galaxies, and
also to better ascertain how black holes grow. The second effort involves an
investigation of galaxy dark matter halos. The goal is to analyze dark matter
profiles, to provide both the shape and the stellar orbital properties
throughout a given galaxy. These profiles should provide direct insight into the
initial formation of the galaxy, since different formation processes leave
different relic signatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of this research
will result from outreach to allow the public to see the results immediately and
directly. The goal is to use a website to disseminate the information. Black
hole studies in particular fascinate the public, and the outreach effort will
take advantage of that interest in order to "educate and
excite".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
