This research is directed toward a calculation of proton- antiproton
annihilation into specific two-meson channels, and of the medium and long-range
nucleon-nucleon interaction as given by the chiral quark model. This is a
continuation of a program by the principal investigator which has made a
significant contribution to our understanding of the origin of certain features
of the interaction between nucleons.
