The Federal Facilities Council (FFC) is an element of the Board on
Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE) of the National Research
Council. Since 1953 the FFC and its predecessor organizations have provided its
sponsoring agencies with a mechanism for jointly identifying and addressing
mutual problems and concerns in the areas of building science and technology,
management, and operations. Each year, the FFC formulates a Technical Activities
Program to address the major concerns of the sponsor agencies. The 2001
Activities Program includes the following activities: initiation of an NRC
advisory study of Capital Project Investment Decisions; information studies and
workshops to address Performance Based Condition Assessments, Best Practices for
Facility Advance Planning, Best Practices for Achieving Healthy Indoor
Environments, and a Compendium of Best Practices for Facility Operations and
Maintenance; conferences on Post-Occupancy Evaluations (POEs) for Facilities,
Outsourcing of Management Functions for the Acquisition of Federal Facilities,
and Emerging Technologies for Buildings of the 21st Century. The FFC program
also supports approximately 35 meetings of FFC standing committee and
maintenance of the FFC Internet Home Page. Reports resulting from the FFC
program are prepared in sufficient quantity to ensure their distribution to the
sponsors and to other relevant parties and made available electronically through
the internet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
