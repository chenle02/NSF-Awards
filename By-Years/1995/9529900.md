This research proposes to examine the transformation to quality in local
government agencies. The research is based on an on-going partnership between a
research team from the Center for Quality and Productivity Improvement at the
University of Wisconsin - Madison, and the City of Madison. For over ten years,
the City of Madison has been recognized as a pioneer in implementing total
quality concepts and principles in government. A conceptual framework is
proposed by which the degree of institutionalization of quality principles is a
function of the implementation process, the organizational structure and
culture. In turn, the degree of institutionalization is believed to influence
the perceived impact of quality initiatives. Feedback loops are an integral part
of the model whereby positive impact increases degree of institutionalization
and institutionalization contributes to a change in organizational structure and
culture. The objective of the project is to collect employee level data to test
the hypothesized relationships among these constructs. Implementation will focus
on employee development, while structure will include employee participation and
labor/management relations, and culture will include leadership and management
style. The study is designed around the department/agency as a second unit of
analysis, providing variability in quality implementation, structure and
culture. An action research paradigm will be used to guide the design and
conduct of research. A variety of data collection methodologies will be
utilized, including surveys of employees and citizens, and an analysis of
archival material. Regression and path analyses will be performed to test
relationships specified in the model.
