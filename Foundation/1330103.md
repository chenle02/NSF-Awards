The twentieth meeting of the Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory (BEST) will be
held on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, during June 16 - 19,
2013 as a symposium of the 94th Annual Meeting of the Pacific Division of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAASPD). The BEST
conference provides the western region of the United States with a conference in
Set Theory that emphasizes diversity. The conference actively seeks to recruit
and integrate student and early career dissemination of research in Set Theory
and its affiliated mathematical disciplines into the conference agenda. The
conference promotes interaction between different career stages in the field by
also recruiting four plenary speakers. The plenary speakers for BEST 2013 are
Dr. Todd Eisworth (Ohio University), Dr. Masaru Kada (Osaka Prefecture
University, Japan), Thilo Weinert (University of Bonn, Germany) and Dr. Lynne
Yengulalp (University of Dayton). The conference seeks to increase participation
by underrepresented groups in the field.

Set Theory is the foundation of Mathematics, and as such, of modeling and
deductive reasoning in the natural sciences. Offering BEST at the Annual Meeting
of the Pacific division of the AAAS thus provides potential for significant
broader impact. Mathematics has always benefited from an influx of ideas and
problems in other sciences, and conversely. It benefits the natural sciences,
and also Set Theory, when opportunities for such cross fertilization are
nurtured and facilitated.
