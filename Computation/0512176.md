The investigator develops a class of efficient and accurate numerical methods
for the unsteady viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) based a
new unconstrained formulation of NSE with fully dissipation in contrast to the
traditional formulation where the Stokes operator is dissipative only in the
divergence free fields. This class of NSE solver is unconditionally stable with
explicit treatment of both pressure and convection terms. Moreover, in this
class of finite element methods, there is no requirement of the so called inf-
sup condition. The cost of solving NSE is greatly reduced to solving a standard
heat equation and a standard Poisson equation at each time step for general
three dimensional fluid problems. The simplicity of the method also enable the
PI to develop a class of numerical methods for complex fluids such as magneto-
hydrodynamics, liquid crystal polymers, geodynamo, climate modeling, and large
eddy turbulence simulations;

Computational Fluid Dynamics has grown from a mathematical curiosity to become
an essential tool in almost every branch of fluid dynamics, from aerospace
propulsion to weather prediction and has received extensive attention throughout
the international community since the advent of the digital computer. The
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes will allow us to simulate
general three-dimensional time-dependent flows with a reasonable turn-over time.
It is expected that the proposed fast algorithms will become an important tool
for many scientists and engineers in numerous scientific and industrial
applications of current interest.
