95-26313 Pryor As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet Shoemaker-
Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Pryor proposes to analyze, model, and
archive data obtained of the event with the telescopes of the University of
Texas McDonald Observatory. In particular, Dr. Pryor and his team members, both
at the University of Colorado and the University of Texas, will analyze in
detail the infrared and CCD imaging and spectroscopy data of the fireball that
resulted from the impact of comet fragment R. Furthermore, they will examine the
data from the impacts of fragments F, U, and V for evidence of fireballs or
plumes. The goal is to determine the distribution of impact debris in the Jovian
atmosphere; the origin of the material (cometary or Jovian); the impacts'
effects on the vertical, zonal, and meridional winds in the Jovian stratosphere;
the ultimate destruction processes of the material; and the amount of
stratospheric water that accumulated over the impact sites. **
