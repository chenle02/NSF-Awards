The principal objective of this work is to study connections between the
topology and arithmetic of real algebraic varieties. The contributions of the
investigator and his collaborator have uncovered such connections in the theory
of real algebraic morphisms and complex structures on real algebraic varieties.
He intends to continue his research in this direction. Another topic for further
investigation is approximation of smooth manifolds by real algebraic varieties.
Algebraic varieties are geometric objects which can be described by polynomial
identities satisfied by the coordinates of their points. "Real" means that the
coordinate numbers are limited to ordinary real numbers, avoiding the square
root of minus one. While these are physically natural objects, paradoxically,
the theory for treating them is in a far less satisfactory state than the one
permitting imaginary numbers, those involving the square root of minus one. The
investigator's efforts have been directed to remedying this situation and have
had some gratifying successes.
