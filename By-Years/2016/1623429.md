Aerosol-cloud interactions are a primary uncertainty in our understanding of
earth's weather and climate. This project addresses the question of how cloud
microphysical properties respond to and alter aerosol properties.

Intellectual Merit: The work will be carried out in the Pi Chamber, a laboratory
cloud chamber capable of sustaining steady-state cloud conditions for long time
periods (hours to days). The Pi Chamber has recently been developed with support
from the NSF Major Research Instrumentation program, and this will be the first
focused scientific research project utilizing the facility. The ability to study
transient cloud responses to sudden changes in aerosol properties was noted
during the initial characterization of the chamber, and therefore this work is
exploratory in nature.

It is potentially transformative because of the unique ability to isolate
aerosol indirect effects by maintaining constant thermodynamic cloud forcing
conditions throughout the study.

Broader Impacts: The project provides a special opportunity for students and
visiting middle/high-school teachers to gain experience with a large
experimental facility.
