The PIs propose to measure hydraulic conductivities, apertures, and roughnesses
in a suite &lt;br/&gt;of fractures from rocks of varying petrology with and
without fracture skins. High-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT;
250micron resolution) will be used define the fracture geometry and surface
roughness of natural rock fractures. In many natural fractures of hydraulic
significance, the scale of the asperities will equal or exceed the scale of the
aperture (i.e., the asperity heights exceed the mean aperture). In this
situation, the classical fluid-mechanics concept of surface roughness simply
doesn't apply. The hypotheses are: &lt;br/&gt;1. Fracture roughness is a
controlling factor for fluid flow and transport of solutes and colloids.
&lt;br/&gt;2. Improvements can be made upon the empirical laws for fluid flow in
rough fractures. &lt;br/&gt;3. Roughness and its effects are inferable from
geological factors, including petrology, grain size, and fracture skin
compositions. &lt;br/&gt;The project includes Hydraulic tests, roughness
analysis, petrographic assessment on Granites, Sandstones, tuffs and
carbonates.&lt;br/&gt;
