Challenges in the theory of random Schrodinger operators

Peter D. Hislop University of Kentucky

Abstract

The spectral and transport properties of random Schrodinger operators have been
the object of intense study. Anderson localization, the occurrence of dense pure
point spectrum almost surely, has been proved for many models at band-edges and
at the bottom of the spectrum. Refined estimates give precise information about
the decay of the eigenfucntions and the dynamical localization of the system.
Conductivity properties of the system are described through the second-order
current-current correlation function. Study of these correlation functions
reveal information about Mott conductivity, the density of states, and
eigenvalue statistics. There are many open questions about the regularity and
bounds on these functions. A lower bound on the current-current correlation
function implies delocalization, for example. Another new tool for the study of
these systems is the use of random matrix theory. This promises to give insight
into the density of states in the delocalized regime.

Random Schrodinger operators provide a model for the propagation of electrons in
perfect crystalline structures that are corrupted by impurities randomly
distributed in the medium. It is hoped that the study of these models reveals
the mechanisms for finite conductivity at low temperatures and the integer
quantum Hall effect. New advances allow one to investigate the transport
properties of these models as expressed through correlation functions. These
correlations functions describe physically measurable quantities such as the
density of states and the Mott conductivity.
