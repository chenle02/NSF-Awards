The project consists of two parts: the first one is devoted to description of
constructible sheaves on homogeneous spaces (mostly of the loop groups) in terms
of coherent sheaves; the second one concerns with study of categories of
coherent sheaves by the method of quantization in positive characteristic. The
first one is a continuation of our previous work inspired by the (local version
of) "geometric Langlands duality" conjecture of Beilinson and Drinfeld. The
second one is suggested by our work (with Mirkovic and Rumynin) on geometric
approach (especially, use of D-modules) in modular representation theory. In
some situations the two constructions lead to the same (t-)structures on the
category of coherent sheaves. The results of the project are expected to yield a
better understanding of the nature of this intriguing coincidence.

From a formal point of view representation theory is a branch of algebra.
However, many of its famous advances were due to discovery of connections to
other disciplines such as differential or algebraic geometry, where geometric
intuition can be applied. In a previous work we developed such geometric methods
for a branch of representation theory called modular representation theory
(where the role of numbers is played by residues of integers modulo a fixed
prime number). One of the goals of the present project is to "repay the debt of
algebra to geometry" by applying ideas stemming from this work to questions in
algebraic geometry. The geometric structures arising from such applications also
appear in the study of some topological objects related to loop groups (whose
definition is similar in spirit to constructions of physists' String Theory).
This miraculous coincidence has strong technical consequences; we hope to get a
better understanding of its nature as a result of the work on the project.
