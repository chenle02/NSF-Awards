The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to study the role of protein folding
chaperones in the secretion of foreign proteins from yeast. There is evidence in
the literature that protein folding in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
may be the rate-limiting step in the overall process of secretion, and that
chaperones such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and KAR2 (the yeast homolog
of mammalian heavy chain binding protein) play a key role in intracellular
protein folding. The PIs plan to vary intracellular levels of PDI and KAR2 by
use of regulated promoters, and to determine the resulting effects on foreign
protein secretion. The PIs also plan to isolate novel chaperones by screening
recombinant DNA libraries for genes whose overexpression enhances foreign
protein secretion or complements a genetically induced defect in protein
translocation into the secretory pathway.
