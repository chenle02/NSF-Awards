This project involves the Ph.D. research of an anthropologist at the University
of Washington-Seattle. The focus is to understand the impact of the closeness of
parental ties between divorced fathers and their children on the father's
provision of resources to the child. A sample of 60 divorced men in the Seattle
area, half with joint custody of children and half without, will be studied. A
standard instrument for assessing parental attachment, defined as an innate
tendency to form close relationships, will be administered. The researcher
hypothesizes that men with high attachment scores--who are evaluated as tending
to form close relationships with others-- will tend to give more resources to
their children, both economic and in terms of time spent, and that time spent
with children before the divorce will be related to attachment scores. This
research is important because the children of divorced parents tend to suffer
deprivations of economic and social resources. Understanding the causes of the
propensity of divorced men to spend resources on their children will be valuable
for planners and social decision makers who must design programs to protect and
improve the position of children of divorced parents.
