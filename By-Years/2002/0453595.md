The objective of this project is to refine and improve the methods of Large Eddy
Simulation (LES) to enable the incorporation of turbulence and land-surface
effects in mesoscale computer models of atmospheric flow. The work includes
representation of the influence of the land surface on atmospheric processes,
definition and representation of local and regional forcing of atmospheric
motion, resolution of key energy-transporting phenomena, and evaluation of the
accuracy of the simulations. The major task is to link (small-scale) turbulence
models to (larger-scale) mesoscale models. For this, two mesoscale computer
codes are employed: the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and the
Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). Linking these to turbulence models
requires accounting for surface boundary conditions and for velocity
fluctuations smaller than the computational grid. Accurate representation of the
land surface is achieved through use of a highly resolved land-surface module
that characterizes many combinations of vegetation and soil type. Turbulence
models are extended to the larger domain using recently proposed algebraic
stress models to account for the effects of motions smaller than the grid size.
Two-way interactive nesting grids enable improved simulations of the interaction
of airflow with the terrain. The ultimate aim is to develop a detailed
methodology for improving local and regional weather predictions by accurately
simulating the effects of small-scale phenomena within the larger-scale models.
Other broad impacts of the research include improved ability to predict the
dispersion of pollutants, as well as the capacity to simulate flow in a given
setting to provide guidance for the design of micrometeorological field
experiments.
