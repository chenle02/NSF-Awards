This grant will support a search for the transformation, or oscillation, of
muon-neutrinos into electron-neutrinos. Such a transformation could occur if
neutrinos have non-zero mass, as has been claimed by a Russian group studying
nuclear beta-decay. The claim would require profound changes in accepted
theories, and thus deserves careful study through independent experiments of the
type funded by this grant. The grantees have completed a series of measurements
for this purpose at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS)
accelerator, and will now evaluate these data for evidence of neutrino
oscillations. The grant also will support preliminary studies intended to define
a system for precise energy-calibration of the bismuth germinate detectors to be
used in the L3 European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) experiment. In
particular, the possibility of using nucluer reactions, induced by a beam from
an ancillary Radio Frequency Quadruple (RFQ) accelerator will be investigated
and evaluated. The importance of this study is augmented by the anticipated need
for similar devices for experiments with the proposed Superconducting Super
Collider (SSC) accelerator.
