Summary of research:&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a gene chip for the
Neotropical butterfly Heliconius erato and use it to study the temporal and
spatial patterning of gene expression during wing pattern development.
Heliconius erato has undergone an extraordinary adaptive radiation in its
vividly colored wing patterns and is an important ecological and evolutionary
model for studying selection, adaptation and morphological differentiation. This
research will determine how differences in gene expression are correlated with
differences in pigmentation both within and between geographic races of H.
erato, and how gene expression patterns for different elements of the color
pattern change during development. This work is expected to uncover new genes
involved in pattern formation and lays the groundwork for understanding how
changes in genetic regulatory interactions cause morphological diversification
and about how these interactions are modified during an evolutionary radiation.
On a more general level, wing pattern formation and evolution in Heliconius is
an excellent model system for conceptualizing the developmental mechanisms
underlying the formation and diversification of more complex morphological
traits. In addition, because the genetic networks underlying wing pattern
formation in butterflies may be simple, this system could provide a powerful
model for reverse engineering of genetic regulatory networks from gene
expression data. This project is a synergistic collaboration between researchers
at the University of Puerto Rico and Duke University and will promote a broader
participation of underrepresented groups in science, particularly at the
undergraduate level. Furthermore, given their visually stunning patterns and
remarkable evolutionary radiation, Heliconius butterflies are excellent models
to promote general conservation and educational efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
