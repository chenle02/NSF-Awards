9730050&lt;br/&gt;Udwadia&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Firdaus E. Udwadia, and
up to ten other researchers to attend a workshop on Dynamics and Control to be
held August 17-19, 1998 in Lambrecht, Germany. Special emphasis will be given to
the topics of nonlinear dynamics, control of uncertain systems, and game
theoretic approaches to solving current problems. U.S. participants will be
chosen from a broad range of universities and geographic locales. The workshop
will bring together experts, senior researchers and students from western
Europe, eastern Europe, and the United States. This workshop answers a need for
increased interaction in this field between scientists from the United States,
western, and especially eastern Europe. It is also expected to lead to new
collaborations between scientists from those areas. East European participants
will be supported by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis;
West European participants will be funded by the Humboldt Foundation; the cost
for room and board for all participants will be paid by the Volkswagen
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;
