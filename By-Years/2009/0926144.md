In order to more deeply understand the algebraic structure of the mapping class
groups, the PI will study the Torelli group, which is the kernel of the
symplectic representation. More generally, the PI will investigate the Johnson
filtration, which is a sequence of subgroups of the mapping class group starting
with the Torelli group. A major open question is whether or not Torelli groups
are finitely presented or not. The Pi would also like to understand how pseudo-
Anosov dilatations are distributed among the terms of the Johnson filtration.
Finally, the PI aims to find generating sets for terms of the Johnson filtration
and related groups.

The mapping class group describes the symmetries of surfaces, or two-dimensional
objects which are analogous to the three-dimensional space we live in. The set
of symmetries of an object is often most easily understood by using matrices. In
the case of the mapping class group, there is a natural way to use matrices to
understand a large piece of the picture, but there is also a large amount of
information that escapes detection by these matrices. It is this mysterious part
of the mapping class groups that the PI is studying.
