1991 Atmospheric Chemistry Gordon Research Conference Program topics for the
1991 Gordon Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry include global distributions and
trends of atmospheric species, surface exchange fluxes of trace species, gas
phase photochemistry, heterogeneous and condensed phase processes, theoretical
modeling and analysis, and policy and perspective. The program represents the
best of national and international efforts in atmospheric chemistry and has been
designed to so that participants will gain a deep insight into both the state-
of-the- art and the outstanding challenges of atmospheric chemistry in 1991.
Informal meetings of the National Research Council's Atmospheric Chemistry
Committee and the Coordinating Committee and Convenors of the International
Global Atmospheric Chemistry Program will also be held. The Conference will be
held in New Hampton, New Hampshire, 17 - 21 June, 1991.
