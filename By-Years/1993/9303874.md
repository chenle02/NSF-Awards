This modern petrologic study of epizonal contact metamorphism around the
Marysville and Boulder intrusions is designed to elucidate processes associated
with the movement of heat and fluid through the shallow continental crust. The
study will involve examination of rock textures using state-of-art electron beam
instruments and image analysis systems. Parameters characterizing the rock
textures will then be utilized in forward thermal modelling of the aureoles to
constrain aspects of fluid-rock interactions during contact metamorphism.
Aspects of interest include the flux of fluid, the direction and pattern of
fluid flow, and the degree to which rock textures and parageneses conform to an
equilibrium model.
