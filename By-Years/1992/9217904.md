This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Jerry P. Becker of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and Professor
Tatsuo Miwa of the Institute for Applied Optics, Tokyo. The project involves
cross-cultural research on computer use in teaching mathematical problem solving
in schools. The collaboration stems from a U.S.-Japan seminar on this topic in
1991 and follows major movements in the United States and Japan to reform
mathematics education and incorporate use of technology (computers and
calculators) to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics in the
classroom. The investigators will address the following areas of research: the
aims of teaching mathematics, software use, curriculum development, development
of open-ended mathematics problems, teacher education, and development of
teaching units for cross- cultural use in classrooms. The research continues
earlier collaboration in studying students' problem solving behaviors in
mathematics. The award is also supported by funds from the Research in Teaching
and Learning Program, Division of Research, Evaluation and Dissemination,
Directorate for Education and Human Resources.
