This project aims to improve the quality of undergraduate instruction in physics
through the incorporation of real-time Microcomputer-Based Laboratory (MBL)
tools into calculus-based introductory physics courses and Physics Concepts I
and II at Lakewood Community College. The college has a significant population
of women and minorities among its 3480 FTE (6180 headcount), and the timing of
this project coincides with statewide initiatives to recognize and increase the
number of outstanding women and minorities in the sciences, both students and
faculty. The department has experienced and committed faculty who are
enthusiastic about incorporating Workshop Physics, Tools for Scientific Thinking
and MBL at Lakewood as a model for replication in the Minnesota Community
College system. The instruments purchased, with software, equip ten lab
stations.
