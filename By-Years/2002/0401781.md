0401781&lt;br/&gt;Liu&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with pattern
formation of vascular smooth muscle cells subject to mechanical stretch and is
focused on clarifying the mechanism by which cells reorient in response to the
stretch and the underlying texture of the substrate, hypothesizing that
mechanical stretch influences orientation of collagen bundles, which in turn
mediate smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration, determining cell alignment and
pattern formation.
