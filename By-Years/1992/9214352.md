The Biology Department of Seton Hall University proposes to renovate and
convert a 1200 square foot laboratory into two research laboratories and a
common instrument room for two new faculty members with expertise in cell
signalling and molecular biology respectively. The area has been dedicated to
cell culture and classical virology. This facility has not received major
attention since 1951. The present laboratory space is poorly designed to
accommodate new faculty. For example, there is a 400 square foot glassware
washing room but no equivalent research area. The temporary walls that were
constructed in 1968, divide the space up into an extremely inefficient suite of
rooms without adequate ventilation and utilities. The area will be gutted, walls
will be constructed to better divide the facilities and a new HVAC unit will be
put in to provide much needed ventilation. Two new laminar flow hoods as well as
a fume hood will be added. All new laboratory benches with appropriate utilities
will be installed. NSF funding of this proposal will facilitate a symbiosis of
research activity between new and veteran faculty.
