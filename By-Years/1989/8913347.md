This dissertation research project will allow a graduate student in cultural
anthropology to study the cultural meanings of infertility among modern-day
women in China. The student's project is approved by the Committee on Scholarly
Communication with the PRC, the main administrative body overseeing research by
US scientists in the PRC. While the PRC government stresses population control,
infertility remains stigmatized. The project will investigate the cultural
construction of femaleness and maleness by studying how social institutions of
family, marriage, medicine and state policies affect notions of gender identity
and the process of stigmatization for infertility. Methods include participant
observation, surveys, open-ended interviewing and the analysis of folklore
materials. This research is important because high population growth rates are
major problems in the developing world. Increased understanding of how local
values about infertility are affected by state population control policies will
be helpful in advising countries how to achieve their population control goals.
