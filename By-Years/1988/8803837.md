Leaves of higher plants are converted from sinks to sources of photoassimilate
as they mature. This lab has shown that termination of photoassimilate import
(end of the sink phase) in tobacco is coincident with, but not due to,
achievement of positive carbon balance. This suggests that phloem unloading is
symplastic (through plasmodesmata) and ceases when plasmodesmatal connections to
surrounding cells are either lost or blocked. Interruption of symplastic flow
would also allow the cells of the phloem to achieve the high solute content
needed for export by preventing leakage. Prior results support the hypothesis
that unloading is passive and symplastic. Additional experiments will be
conducted to further substantiate the symplastic phloem unloading route in
tobacco sink leaves by testing the effects of breaking plasmodesmatal
connections, preventing symplastic transport with high pH and inhibitor
treatments, and refining the present morphometric analysis of the unloading
pathway to allow stimulation of transport using data on solute flux. High
resolution EM studies will be conducted to determine whether plasmodesmata along
the unloading pathway become physically obstructed. Phloem loading will also be
studied to determine whether an apoplastic step is involved.%%% These studies on
the physiology and structure of a developing leaf are providing information on
how sugars made during photosynthesis are first stored in leaves and then
mobilized to form grains and fruits. This has obvious implications for a better
understanding of crop productivity. It is surprising how much plant structure
remains to be elucidated. This project is filling an important information gap
in plant biology.***//
