This project continues the summer conferences on political methodology begun in
1984 and supported since 1986 by the Political Science Program. These workshops
have brought together researchers and graduate students who are actively
contributing to the subfield of political methodology. Discussions and papers
have been used to develop an agenda for methodological research in political
science and, to some degree, in related disciplines; to disseminate and critique
research in this field; and to build up a core group of scholars who are
committed to the development of analytical work in all substantive areas of
political science. This continued support will offset some of the expenses of
the conferences for the next two years. Twenty faculty members and between six
and eight graduate students will attend the workshops. Papers are presented at
the workshops addressing a methodological problem confronting political
scientists. Papers are critiqued by all attendees and every effort is made to
publish papers and make them available to as broad an audience as possible.
