CBET-0820919&lt;br/&gt;Ni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding
for a BRUKER low-field proton 7.5 MHz bench-top NMR&lt;br/&gt;system for
research and teaching. The main components of this 7.5 MHz TD-NMR
Analyzer&lt;br/&gt;with gradient capability are listed as
following.&lt;br/&gt;1. mg-YS-R/GX: mg7.5, 7.5 TD-NMR Analyzer&lt;br/&gt;2. mg-
HPC: Host personal computer&lt;br/&gt;3. mg-PGU4: One dimensional Unipolar
Gradient Amplifier&lt;br/&gt;4. mg-ExpSpel: Developers' Software Option
(operating NMR sequence program,&lt;br/&gt;controlling data, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;One
of the objectives of the proposed research is to develop a non-destructive and
noninvasive&lt;br/&gt;technique to assess bone quality by quantifying the
distribution of water (bound and mobile&lt;br/&gt;water) within bone tissue,
porosity, and pore size distributions in cortical bone in vitro.
In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the acquired instrumentation will provide other faculty
with the necessary tool(s) to&lt;br/&gt;pursue aspects of their research that
are presently not available on the TAMIU campus.
