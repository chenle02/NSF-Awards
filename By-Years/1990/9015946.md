The objective of this research is to design, fabricate and characterize highly
resonant electron wave guide structures. The semiconductor structures will be
fabricated using high mobility GaAs/A1GaAs heterostructures. Device design will
be similar to that of HEMT devices except a gate structure will confirm the two-
dimensional electron gas between the source and the drain to one-dimension. The
region of confinement will be shaped in a manner analogous to adding tuning
stubs and cavities to a conventional wave guide system. We will examine the
transmission coefficients and transconductance of the device as a function of
gate bias, source-drain bias, temperature and applied magnetic field.
