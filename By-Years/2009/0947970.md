The goals of the Community Workshop on Climate Change Education are to: (1)
broadly describe the types of climatechange education activities currently
underway within the formal, informal, policy, and education research sectors;
(2) determine major gaps in climate change education that are not
currently&lt;br/&gt;being addressed; (3) identify priority, near-term
opportunities for improving climate change education; and (4) highlight some of
the particular issues that inform or impede progressin these areas. Workshop
attendees will include NSF program staff and representatives of the communities
with expertise in formal (K-16) and informal geoscience education, STEM
education research, and communicating with public audiences about scientific
concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide NSF program
staff with an overview on current efforts within the community regarding climate
change education and will help NSF frame future efforts to establish a more
cohesive and coordinated investment in climate change education.
