9723489 Wang This award supports the initiation of collaborative research
between Zhi-Qiang Wang, Utah State University, and Li Shujie, Institute of
Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The research concerns the development
of new methods in calculus of variations, critical point theory, and Morse
theory, and the application of these techniques to nonlinear differential
equations. The project will bring together two groups in nonlinear analysis to
work on a problem that requires the strengths of both groups to address. The
Chinese co-PI has over forty research papers in relevant areas, and is
responsible for the initiation of the concept of local linking, which is a
powerful tool in critical point theory to deal with multiplicity results. The US
PI has expertise in variational techniques and in the theory of Morse. The
complementary expertise of the two groups should enable new insights into this
field. Support on the Chinese side will be provided by the Chinese National
Natural Science Foundation.
