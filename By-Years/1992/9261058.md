Passive restraint government standards have resulted in the introduction of
passenger side airbags for most cars in 1993. TIP Engineering has initiated a
significant amount of R&D activity in developing the next state of the art
passenger airbags (PAB) deployment door without any visible cut lines. The
concept is referred to as the hidden seam deployment door. The major parameter
of a successful hidden seam door function is the scoring of the back surface of
the skin. Present technology can only accomplish this criteria by mechanical
means. TIP would cut the skin by the use of a heat/energy/pressure pyrotechnic)
device to the back surface of the skin. At the time the airbag is fired, the
same command signal would initiate the pyrotechnic device to ignite creating an
instant cut line along the periphery of the airbag opening. The pyrotechnic
devices presently being considered are used primarily in the defense industry as
an initiator to an explosive device. We propose to significantly revise and
redevelop these devices for application on the airbag door. The anticipated
benefits are to improve safety, warranty, and obvious styling improvement at a
reduced cost.
