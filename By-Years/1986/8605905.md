This research equipment grant is to procure two cold rooms (8'x12' and 8'x16'
Bally units) with several freezers, circulating baths, molds, and a de-airing
system for preparing and testing ice specimens. The cold rooms are part of a
much larger facility which will be used for constitutive modeling of materials
to characterize both fracture and continuum behavior. A research program is
underway in this institution with projects in the area of natural resource
extraction from Artic and Sub-artic regions both off shore and on shore. Primary
emphasis of the research will be on ice-mechanic, ice-structure interaction, and
mechanics of cementitious composites.
