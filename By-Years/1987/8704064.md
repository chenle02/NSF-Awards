The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student enrollments. Eligibility institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. Wayne State University will use
RIMI support to characterize all details of certain chemical dynamics through
the use of laser techniques. Researchers will examine the relative kinetic
energy, internal energy, impact parameter, and relative electron orbital
orientations of several bimolecular chemical reactions. This project will meet
the research needs of an urban university that is making a special effort to
involve more minorities in first rate research. The principal investigator, who
is a minority, is an expert in infrared excitations and has done research at the
University of Cambridge (England). The Foundation has supported this project
because it will provide support to increase opportunities for minorities to
perform meritorious research on dye laser systems.
