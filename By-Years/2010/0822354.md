This proposed four-year effort envisions a new approach to promoting science
literacy through science journalism as a subject of study. It is premised on a
critical set of assumptions: (a) Most citizens have the need to interpret
scientific information found in popular media (e.g., newspapers, magazines,
online resources, science-related television programs); (b) science journalism
provides reliable, well-researched science information; (c) authentic science
writing provides motivation to learn; and (d) standards and rubrics specifically
developed for evaluating students' science-related expository text do not exist.
Thus, the project approaches science journalism as a means to assist students to
investigate and coherently write about contemporary science and to learn to base
assertions and descriptions on reliable, publicly available sources. To this
end, the project aims to develop, pilot, and evaluate a model of instruction
that focuses on the following aspects: (a) Identifying questions of both
personal and public interest; (b) evaluating contemporary science-related
issues; (c) making available highly regarded sources of information as exemplars
(in-print, online, interviews); (d) synthesizing information; (e) assessing
information based on fact-checking using the five Ws (who, what, where, when,
and why); and (f) coherently explaining claims and evidence.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hypothesis and a set of research questions guide this
effort. The hypothesis is the following: If participating students successfully
attain the fundamental elements of the proposed model, then they will become
more literate and better critical consumers and producers of scientific
information. The main guiding research question of the proposed activity is the
following: Does the teaching of science journalism using an apprenticeship
model, reliable data sources, and science-specific writing standards improve
high school students' understanding of science-related public literacy?
Secondary questions include (a) Is the teaching of science journalism an
efficacious, replicable and sustainable model for improving science literacy?;
(b) How useful are science-related standards and rubrics for scaffolding and
evaluating students' science writing and science literacy?; and (c) What is the
nature of the engagement in science that this apprenticeship invites?
