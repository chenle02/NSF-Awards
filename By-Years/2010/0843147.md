Scientific research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cilia are highly conserved organelles
present in all major phylogenetic groups of eukaryotic organisms. They have been
adapted for motility of single cells and for fluid transport over cell layers.
In multicellular animals, they play specialized roles in embryo development and
in signaling pathways in diverse cell types. The nine doublet microtubules in
typical cilia grow from a template of nine triplet microtubules that compose the
wall of the basal body (centriole). Basal body docking with the plasma membrane
provides a site for assembly of a cilium. Components of intraflagellar
transport, required for ciliary assembly and maintenance, converge at the basal
body. Initiation of ciliary assembly depends on the conversion of triplet
microtubules to doublet microtubules at the distal end of the basal body. Using
as a model system the unicellular, biflagellate green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, this project investigates a class of "uni" mutants with defects in
docking of basal bodies with the plasma membrane and in the conversion of
triplet microtubules to doublet microtubules required for ciliary assembly. The
molecular basis of these processes is investigated through biochemical
characterization of the products of the UNI1 and UNI2 genes. The role of
phosphorylation in the function of the Uni2 protein is being studied. The
functions of the Uni1 and Uni2 proteins are being examined through analysis of
mutant phenotypes, subcellular localization of the proteins, and protein
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project
integrates research and education by providing mentored research experiences for
undergraduate students. Students receive training in cell biology, molecular
biology, and genetics disciplines while carrying out research. The projects help
students to develop the ability for critical thinking and the skills for written
and oral science communication.
