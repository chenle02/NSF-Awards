An integrated multi-rack read/write head and associated circuitry suitable for
high performance (100 MHz), ultra-high density (2x109 bits/in2) recording will
be designed. The magnetoresistive sensor wil use Giant Magnetoresistance Ratio
(GMR) material, which provied a much higher signal (about ten times) compared
with standard materials because of higher magnetoresistance and higher sheet
resistivity. The orientation of the sensor wil be orthogonal to the orientation
of the sensors in use today for improved reliability and higher density. The
associate circuitry will be signed using CMOS on a substrate of Silicon on
Sapphire (SOS) which has both favorable wear capability compared to silicon, and
in addition has lower parasitic capacitances that silicon, hence improving the
electrical performance of the on-chip circuitry. Sensors for servo track will be
included in the design. In Phase I the head will be designed, and satisfactory
GMR materials will be demonstrated on a substrate comprised of permalloy
shielding material on SOS. The read portion on the head designed in Phase I,
except for shields, will be fabricated and demonstrated in Phase II.
