This project investigates the development of algorithmic foundations to address
challenges in real-world markets in which matching is an essential activity. The
proposal addresses timely challenges in organ allocation, kidney exchange,
student assignment systems, and other matching marketplaces, enriching the
mathematically grounded algorithms for resource allocation and matching. The
project serves the national interest by promoting scientific progress, advancing
market design knowledge, addressing equity and fairness in resource allocation,
and enhancing societal welfare. The project will also train undergraduate and
graduate students.

The research project will address the following areas: algorithmic questions in
labor markets, student assignment systems, organ allocation challenges, and
algorithmic market design questions in transportation. The project will study
the role of information and learning, preference discovery, and equity in
matching markets. The project will explore the interaction between algorithms
and information towards reducing congestion in entry-level labor markets. In
organ allocation, the team will design algorithms for allocating hard-to-place
organs, addressing novel algorithmic questions related to online matching and
trade-offs between utilization and welfare. The project will also investigate
token systems for incentivizing participation of hospitals in kidney exchange
platforms. Lastly, it will tackle matching and pricing questions in
transportation markets, developing a unifying framework for congestion pricing
and carpooling. By integrating algorithms and application understanding, the
project seeks to develop grounded solutions for resource allocation and
matching, making it both intellectually and practically impactful.
