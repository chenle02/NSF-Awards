Abstract ATM-9405145 Grimm, Eric C. Illinois State Museum Title: Long Records of
Paleoclimate from Florida Recent research on a continuous 50,000-year sediment
record from eastern North America has revealed a striking correlation between
Heinrich events (large surges in flow of ice streams feeding from the Laurentide
ice sheet into the North Atlantic) and major changes in vegetation in peninsular
Florida. These events are expressed at Lake Tulane, Florida, as abrupt shifts
between pine-dominated and oak-dominated communities, which likely correspond
with times of moist climate alternating with periods of extreme drought. Those
results suggest that the Heinrich events involved important changes in ocean-
atmosphere circulation, and thus forcing other than internal dynamics of the ice
sheet. This award supports a research project designed with the following
objectives: (1) To establish a higher-resolution AMS-radiocarbon chronology for
the sediments of Lake Tulane. The record will verify whether the vegetational
shifts in Florida are indeed synchronous with Heinrich events; (2) To
reconstruct the history of lake-level fluctuations in Lake Tulane; (3) To extend
the regional and temporal records of vegetation and climate for peninsular
Florida by studying the pollen stratigraphy of new long cores (already
collected) from several in-filled sinkholes. These sediments appear likely to
span much more than the 50,000 years covered by the Lake Tulane record, and thus
have excellent potential to produce the first record of changes in vegetation
and climate spanning the last complete glacial/interglacial cycle in eastern
North America.
