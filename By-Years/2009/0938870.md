The creation of self-powered, health monitoring systems is possible only through
the harvesting of energy from the environment. Energy in the environment can be
converted to stored electrical energy by a variety of means, such as solar
energy collection and mechanical power harvesting. Solar power is the most
established technique, and can generate low voltage, moderate current at 10
mW/cm2. The drawbacks of solar for this application are its dependence on direct
sunlight. The PI proposes to utilize vibrations from machines and wind induced
structural oscillations to generate mechanical power that can be tapped as an
electrical power source. Piezoelectric materials are compact, energy dense
actuators and have unique properties for energy harvesting. They are capable of
generating high voltages for modest levels of strain. Researchers have shown
that nonlinear switching can enhance the performance of piezoelectric power
harvesting, and it suggests that power electronics need to be considered when
designing such systems. This approach can increase the theoretical power
harvested from a piezoelectric by 400%. Additionally, circuits that can switch
using self-generated power and sensing, in synchronization with the strain of
piezoelectric devices will be also investigated.
