Basic research will be carried out on thermal properties of solid and liquid
phases, kinetics of phase transitions, conformationally disordered phases, and
strained molecules in phase boundaries. Thermal properties research is to
connect to prior work that led to a data bank with information on Cp, H, S and G
on about a hundred polymers. Experimentation is to continue and expand by
building a 10-300 K scanning calorimeter, an instrument not available in this
country. The theory of heat capacity is to be advanced by the study of skeletal
vibrations and anharmonicity. The kinetics of phase transitions are to be
followed by simulation of molecular nucleation on a supercomputer using
molecular dynamics, and by collection of further data on segregation on
crystallization. Condis crystals are to be studied by thermal analysis (entropy
evaluation), solid-state NMR (motion assessment), X-ray and neutron scattering
(structure determination) and computer simulation (understanding of roto-
repartition). The strained molecules, finally, are to be quantitatively
evaluated by thermal analysis (rigid amorphous fraction), solid-state NMR
(motion), and energy-sensitive electron microscopy (location of rigid molecule
parts). Overall, these projects are designed to advance materials
characterization and understanding of properties and processes in polymeric as
well an nonpolymeric substances.
