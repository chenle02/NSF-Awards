The nascent Science of Security (SoS) seeks to develop the principles with which
to understand how computing systems are architected, built, used, and maintained
with a view to understanding and addressing security challenges systematically
across their life cycle. This workshop will help further research in the field.
HotSoS is a follow-on to the NSF/NSA sponsored Science of Security Community
meeting held in conjunction with the 2012 SaTC Principal Investigators meeting.
In the first year as a separate event, HotSos 2014 had 150 attendees. For the
2015 event, the PI anticipates 150-200 attendees.

The goal of the travel grant program is to encourage participation in HotSoS by
students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Availability of student
travel grants is publicized through the website and announcements, with
particular encouragement for women and underrepresented groups to apply.
Preference for awards is given to full-time students with limited other means to
support their participation, with priority given to students who are presenting
papers at HotSoS.
