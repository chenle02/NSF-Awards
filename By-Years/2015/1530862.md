An award is made to Utah State University to acquire a new Beckman ProteomeLab
XLI analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC) to support research and training. The AUC
will support the research programs of seven different laboratories and be
available to other users within the university and neighboring institutions. At
USU, the instrument will be used to provide hands-on training in cutting-edge
molecular techniques to undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers,
and become an integral part of the educational and outreach efforts in the
Chemistry and Biochemistry department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analytical
ultracentrifuge will be used to study the in solution properties of
macromolecular complexes including determining accurate molecular weights,
heterogeneity and stoichiometry. At USU, the analytical ultraentrifuge will be
used to support the research of the PI and Co-PI's to investigate: (1) the
mechanism of action of ATP-dependent motor proteins; (2) the assembly of Type
III secretion systems in pathogens; (3) the oxidation based control of proteins;
(4) the assembly mechanism of RNA; (5) the Iron protein cycle; (6) antimicrobial
action of amphiphilic aminoglycosides; and (7) the development of therapeutics
for Amyloid Diseases.
