This project continues the development, testing, and use of a series of web-
based computer simulations for improving the teaching and learning of physics.
It expands the number of simulations in physics, creates new simulations
addressing introductory chemistry, creates simulations addressing the conceptual
understanding of equations in solving science problems, and further refines some
existing simulations. It increases, by approximately 35, the 35 online
interactive simulations that have been developed for teaching physics
(http://www.colorado.edu/ physics/phet). The project produces and widely
disseminates on-line supporting materials for use in undergraduate and high
school science courses. The supporting materials include: guided-discovery,
tutorial worksheets; a list of learning goals; materials to support in-lecture,
homework, and laboratory use; assessment instruments; and other user-contributed
materials. The simulations being introduced and their effectiveness are being
evaluated in at least eight additional courses in physics and chemistry at the
University of Colorado and a diverse set of partner institutions. The materials
are being extensively tested to ensure that they are easy to use and effective
at promoting deep conceptual understanding and positive attitudes about science
and technology.
