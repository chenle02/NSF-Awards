The SIGCSE Robot Hoedown and Rodeo provides computer science faculty, teachers,
and graduate students the opportunity to program a variety of robot platforms
used in education. Though a significant minority of computer science educators
has used robots, most computer science educators have never had the opportunity
to experiment with one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in consumer electronics
and robotics have created several platforms which are sufficiently affordable to
move to the "personal robot" model in which each student has his or her own
robot for the duration of a class. There is recent evidence that students in
courses with personal robots show greater motivation to complete assignments in
the course and that these courses have better retention rates. This workshop
primarily focuses on these relatively newer and more affordable
platforms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This robotics workshop is part of SIGCSE 2011,
the flagship conference for the Association for Computing Machinery?s Special
Interest Group on Computer Science Education which attracts roughly 1200
attendees each year. The workshop provides conference attendees who have never
programmed a robot before the opportunity to do so and offers those who already
have programmed a robot the chance to work with alternative platforms. The
creative results of programmed robotic dance movements and robot-specific
programming challenges are publicly demonstrated throughout the conference.
