Prof. DeWitt and his group will work on problems related to constructing
computer models with some of the features to be expected in a quantum theory of
gravitation. Such a fundamental theory does not yet exist. Indeed, its discovery
remains the most difficult and outstanding problem in theoretical physics during
this century. DeWitt will explore the conceptual issues which arise in a
simplified theory called the O (1,2) sigma model. This theory has several
mathematical features expected to be in the eventual quantum theory of gravity.
Exploration if this model will, therefore, lead to the understanding of
conceptual difficulties whose resolution will be important for future progress.
