Purple bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy through anoxygenic
photosynthesis. Purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) are a sub-group of purple bacteria,
coupling the oxidation of reduced sulfur species to phototrophic growth. While
PSB are recognized as key drivers of the sulfur cycle in various ecosystems
(e.g., meromictic lakes, inland seas, and marine basins), their metabolic
capability and flexibility are not fully understood. The research team's recent
work demonstrated robust autotrophic growth of PSB strains using solid-phase
transition metal sulfide (TMS) as sulfur and electron donors. Significantly,
this finding reveals PSBâ€™s remarkable potential in scavenging electrons directly
from solid-phase substrate and close ties with TMS, which naturally occur in
their niches, meriting further investigations. As such, the team will examine
the PSB-TMS interactions and relevant mechanisms systematically. This work may
have key implications for geochemistry and bioelectrochemistry, through
providing new constraints for ancient and modern metal-sulfur biogeochemical
cycles, establishing new models for bacterial extracellular electron transfer
research, and demonstrating the potential synergy between nanoparticle
photochemistry and microbial energy demand.

The main research questions to be addressed in this study are: (i) if all TMS
phases may enable the autotrophic growth of PSB as sole sulfur and electron
donors; and (ii) what molecular mechanisms are involved in the PSB-TMS
interactions. The research team will use a combination of transcriptomic
sequencing, transmission electron microscopy coupled with advanced spectroscopy
and cryo-techniques, and various aqueous/surface chemical analytical tools to
resolve these questions. To maximize the impact of their work on society, they
will incorporate synergistic outreach and mentoring activities. For example,
they will create a series of short animation videos (to be hosted on YouTube) to
disseminate the main results of this work. They will also develop an open-access
Environmental Nanoscience tutorial. The long-term goal for these outreach
activities is to create a robust pipeline for cross-disciplinary STEM research
and to train a diverse group of students into a competent STEM workforce.
