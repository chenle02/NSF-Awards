Some commercially important chemicals are produced in trickle bed reactors where
gaseous and liquid reactants flow cocurrently down through a fixed catalyst bed.
An important feature of such three-phase system is that the catalyst pellet may
exposed to an extremely nonuniform environment because the flowing liquid may
only partially contact (wet) the pellet surface. Partial wetting can enhance or
retard the rate of a reaction depending on whether the reaction is gas reactant
limiting or liquid reactant limiting. The purpose of the proposed work is to
devise a meachanism which will enable reactor designers to predict how the
intrinsic catalytic selectivity is altered by the multiphase transport
associated with partial wetting. The PIs plan to do both experimental as well as
modelling work for this system. Initially, a single pellet reactor is to be
constructed and reaction rates will be measured. Then four spherical pellets
will be put together to simulate packing conditions in a large fuel scale
reactor. In this setup liquid pockets can be created and their effect on the
reaction rate evaluated. Facilities will thus exist to measure directly the
relationship between the overall reaction rates (selectivity) and the wetting
efficiency.
