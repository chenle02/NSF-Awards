Zero sound attenuation in normal fluid helium-three will be studied at
frequencies up to 500 MHZ to unambiguously test Landau's prediction of the
quantum absorption regime. Ultrasound will be used to directly measure the order
parameter energy gap of superfluid helium-three-B. Various measurements of the
superconducting properties of UBe13 and UPt3 will be conducted at millikelvin
temperatures to positively identify their pairing mechanisms. The research will
require the development of high frequency acoustic techniques for the
millikelvin regime.
