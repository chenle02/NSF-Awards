The goal of this project is to equip the laboratory for a new, required course
in Cellular and Molecular Biology. This course has been moved to the college's
unique Spring Short Term to allow improvement and expansion of the laboratory
experience afforded the students. (During this Spring Term, Bates students
immerse themselves in a single course. This scheduling permits longer, more
open-ended laboratory experiences than are possible to fit into the normal
laboratory period of three or four hours.) The new equipment also will allow
more individualized student instruction in such basic techniques as cell
fractionation, electrophoresis, column chromatography, enzymology, and cell
culturing. The improvements made through this award are expected to strengthen
significantly the technical skills of students in this course, and to have a
major secondary effect on the advanced laboratory electives currently taught in
the Department. Instruments procured through the award include ultracentrifuges,
a 12-port filtering manifold, tissue culture and cell harvesting apparati,
electrophoresis equipment, fraction collectors and other chromatography
instruments.
