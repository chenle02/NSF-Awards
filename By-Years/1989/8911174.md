Insect metamorphosis is a time during which the nervous system is dramatically
altered to allow the very different organism which emerges from the larva to
behave in new ways appropriate to its new life situation. These pronounced
changes in behavior require a striking reorganization of neuronal circuits and
the properties of individual cells. Dr. Levine follows the changes in a
mechanosensory reflex circuit that mediates a very different behavioral response
at different life stages. Using innovative state-of-the-art techniques, he
examines the mechanisms by which steroid and peptide hormones direct the
formation of new synapses and modifies important cellular events which are
reflected in the altered patterns of behavior. Recent findings have led to the
conclusion that the adult nervous system is not rigid since adult neurons can
undergo morphological changes. Dr. Levine's findings will enhance our
understanding of the events underlying neuronal plasticity. Thus, his work holds
promise of providing insights into how changes can occur in adult brains,
especially with relationship to learning and memory and recovery of function.
