The climate Research Institute seeks to inform public policy officials and
opinion leaders of the gravity of the climate change challenge. Scientists have
predicted a global warming of as much as 9 degrees F. by the middle of the 21st
Century. Increased vulnerability of coastal areas to storm damage, and
significant changes in agriculture production, forestry, and fisheries have been
predicted. An international conference, to be held October 27-29, 1987 in
Washington, D.C., will bring together top scientists studying climate change and
its likely impacts; and government policy makers, environmental leaders, and
corporate decision makers. NSF is one of several government and non-government
sponsors of this conference. Because significant climate change may be observed
first in the Polar regions, this proposal is important to the Division of Polar
Programs. Research on climate change in the Polar regions is also a major
component of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan.
