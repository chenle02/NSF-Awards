This project will enhance lower-division students' understanding of the basic
concepts of calculus and increase the likelihood that these concepts will be
properly applied in new situations. The project will incorporate the use of a
Computer Algebra System (CAS) to carry out complex computational and symbolic
operations, thereby freeing time for students to better understand and apply the
rich collection of ideas embodied in calculus. Many applied mathematicians and
engineers have used CAS in their work, but the computer power required to
sustain CAS has, until recently, prohibited its use in most academic
environments. Denison University will purchase two Micro VAX II computers with
20 attached terminals on which to run Maple, a CAS software package. This
configuration is well within the capability of the faculty and one that meets
the needs of the students. This project is especially important now, when many
mathematicians are calling for attempts to make calculus more "lean and lively"
and to interest more students in mathematics.
