The Thirtieth Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
University on October 16-18, 2009. The program was organized by a committee
consisting of Ananda Weerasinghe, Julien Dubedat and Joseph Quinn. The main
speaker will be Joel Spencer of the Courant Institute. The other two speakers
will be Maury Bramson (Minnesota) and Sunder Sethuraman Iowa State.

The Midwest Probability Colloquium hosts 75-100 people from the greater Midwest
region, A special effort is made to encourage attendance by graduate students,
minorities and under-represented groups in the mathematical community. This is
done by hotel supplements and, in some cases, travel supplements. As in the
past, Northwestern University will also provide some partial support.
