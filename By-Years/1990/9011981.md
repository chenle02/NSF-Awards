Performance is a major issue in the design and implementation of systems such as
computer systems, production systems, communication networks, and flexible
manufacturing systems. The success or failure of such systems is judged by the
degree to which performance measures are of great interest. In the last two
decades it has been demonstrated several times that performance can be evaluated
or predicted well by queueing network models. For queueing networks with nodes
of infinite capacity numerous methods have been introduced in the last two
decades. However, since in actual systems nodes have a finite capacity, queueing
networks with blocking should be used for accurate modeling for performance
analysis. Queueing networks with blocking have thus become an interesting
research topic in recent years. Several researchers have suggested different
solution techniques. Previous studies, however, are restricted to exponential
service time distributions, single job classes and FCFS scheduling disciplines.
In actual systems the devices may have different scheduling disciplines, the job
behavior may vary and the service times are drawn non-exponentially. Therefore,
this project investigates queueing networks having finite capacity, four
different node types and multiple job classes. Several approximate ways as well
as exact solutions to solving these models are studied.
