9304185 Stuber The principal investigator (PI) will develop new code design
criteria, and identify trellis codes and interleaving techniques that are
effective for multipath fading ISI channels. In addition the PI will develop new
reduced complexity receiver structures for performing diversity combining,
equalization, and trellis decoding, along with suitable channel estimation
techniques. Sequence estimators that are based on the Viterbi algorithm and the
Fano algorithm are of particular interest. Finally the PI will derive tighter
upper bounds on the error probability of receivers that employ joint
equalization and decoding. The approaches that will be used in this study
involve a mixture of theoretical work in channel modeling, signal processing,
and coding theory as well as computation and simulation on workstations. ***
