This award will enable Professors Charles Coble and Floyd Mattheis of East
Carolina University to collaborate with Professor Shigekazu Takemura of
Hiroshima University, Japan on a comparative study of American and Japanese
science teacher education. The study will gather data on the organizational
structure, staffing, and the curriculum used for pre-service and in-service
education of teachers of science at the elementary, junior high and senior high
levels in the U.S. and Japan. The Japanese and U.S. research teams will
synthesize their findings and present the results at a joint conference on
Comparative Science Teacher Education in May 1989 to be held in Honolulu,
Hawaii. Science educators in the United States have much to learn from a
comparative study of American and Japanese teacher education since Japanese
students consistently outscore U.S. students on standardized science achievement
tests at every pre-college level. The teams, under the direction of Professor
Coble and Professor Takemura, are composed of well established and highly
respected science educators in both countries.
