9624705 Mackin This CAREER award is to study the connection between microscopic
and macroscopic mechanical properties. The educational plan will provide state-
of-the-art programs to experimental and theoretical mechanics for undergraduates
as well as a connection with current industrial problems. The research emphasis
will be given to internal stress and strain distributions in composites and how
these change as damage accumulates. The combined use of a non- contact stress
measurement technique known as SPATE and a newly developed strain mapping method
called DAiSleS will provide the experimental data needed. ***
