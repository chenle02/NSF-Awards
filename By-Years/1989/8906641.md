Theoretical Physics problems in general relativity, lattice gauge theories, and
elementary particle phenomenology, and problems at the interface of field theory
and statistical mechanics, will be investigated. In general relativity it is
planned to work on discrete gravity from a general theoretical perspective, and
to perform numerical calculations. In addition, some problems in cosmology will
be investigated. Large "Monte Carlo" calculations of quark spectroscopy will be
undertaken. The works will aid the effort to achieve a reconciliation between
gravity and quantum mechanics, and will help to reveal the consequences of
quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong nuclear force.
