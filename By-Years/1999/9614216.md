9614216 WITMAN This project is supported as a high risk, rapid response project
to investigate the causes and consequences of a regional, massive recruitment of
the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, to the rocky shores off New England. This vast
and unusual recruitment occured in the period around August -September 1995 from
Maine to Massachusetts. This project will look at the fate of this population
increase and its influences on the subtidal communities of plants and animals in
the New England region. The spatial extent of the event, the changes in local
cover over time and pilot experiments on its impact will be pursued. ***
