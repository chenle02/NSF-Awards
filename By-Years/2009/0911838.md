This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Roger Revelle, a 273' general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Melville, a 279'
general purpose Global vessel; the R/V New Horizon, a 170', general purpose,
Intermediate vessel and the R/V Sproul, a 125' general purpose Regional vessel.
All four vessels are operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. One of
the requests in this proposal will be funded as a group purchase through another
institution and another request already exists in a fleet pool and will be
devilvered to the institution. This award includes one item: 1) SeaSpy Tow Cable

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The
acquisition of the components for the sonar systemes on the Scripps vessels will
allow this important functionality of bottom and sub-bottom tracking to be
maintained in this hub institution on the West Coast.
