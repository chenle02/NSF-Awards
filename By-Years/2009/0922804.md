With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Cristina
Suarez and colleagues Maureen Fagan, Elizabeth R. Jamieson and Kevin Shea from
Smith College and Megan E. Nunez from Mt. Holyoke College will acquire a 500 MHz
NMR spectrometer to support research that includes organic structure
determination, organometallic structure determination, biological structure
determination, DNA damage studies, dynamic NMR studies, and development of new
types of NMR solvents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be
an integral part of teaching as well as research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
