This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will enable the participation of 13 younger U.S. chemists in the NSF-SERC Joint
Workshop on Main Group Chemistry which will occur at Imperial College in London,
England, August 9-12, 1989. Main group chemistry is an area of growing
importance because of its relevance to several areas of materials science, such
as electronic materials and ceramics, and because of the great promise it offers
for the discovery of new kinds of molecules.
