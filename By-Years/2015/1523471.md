Networking security is of critical importance in the Internet age. The Network
and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) symposium, now in its 22nd year, is a
leading venue for research on internet security. The program typically includes
45-50 peer-reviewed papers and 2-3 keynote speeches. NDSS is always held in San
Diego, CA, in February. The 22nd NDSS is scheduled for Feb 8-11, 2015.

Attendance at NDSS is highly useful to graduate students studying internet
security. This proposal funds attendance by 10 students to attend the
conference, thus furthering the research and future employment prospects of
these individuals. The student travel grants will offset the costs of conference
travel and registration. Preference will be to students who have submitted
papers or posters to the conference, and women and underrepresented groups will
be actively encouraged to apply through established networks of academics and
industry leaders.
