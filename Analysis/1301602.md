We propose a research program on several intertwined geometric themes of complex
and real low-dimensional dynamics, primarily on the polynomial dynamics on the
Riemann sphere and the dynamics in the dissipative real and complex Henon
family. Most of these themes are unified by the idea of renormalization as a
powerful tool of penetrating into small-scale structure of dynamical objects,
aimed towards their complete classification. We particularly emphasize the
following themes: the problem of local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set,
Feigenbaum Julia sets of positive area and Siegel Renormalization Theory, the
Palis Conjecture on finiteness of attractors for strongly dissipative real Henon
maps, and stability and bifurcations for moderately dissipative complex Henon
maps.

The proposed activity will result in deeper insights into small scale structure
of dynamical systems, in training of highly qualified graduate students and
postdocs who will apply their skills in academia and industry, in broader
interactions between experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics,
in promotion of communication between the field of dynamics and related areas of
physics and applied mathematics.
