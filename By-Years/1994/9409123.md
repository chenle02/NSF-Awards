9409123 Shore Ohio State Univ. Dr. Sheldon Shore, Chemistry Department, Ohio
State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program for research designed to expand and develop
avenues for the preparation and study of organometallic transition metal cluster
systems. Compounds derived from ruthenium and osmium carbonyl clusters in which
a boron is either incorporated at a cluster vertex or encapsulated within the
metal core will be synthesized by reactions of borane with carbonyl or
carbonylate metal clusters. The carbonylate anions will be further reduced with
borane in hopes of obtaining species with multiple methylene bridges and
reactions with carbon monoxide and hydrogen will be explored. The reduction of
the ruthenium and osmium carbonyls with lanthanide metals will be used to
prepare ladder polymers in which lanthanide/transition metal chains are joined
by carbonyl linkages. With the development of the synthetic strategy, this work
will be extended to a variety of transition metals and to alternative bridging
groups such as cyanide. These ladder polymers will be loaded on hydroxylated
magnesia and converted into bimetallic nanoparticles for use as catalysts and
for studies of surface reactions. Small metal containing particles are finding
application in various areas of catalysis and as electronic devices. This
project is aimed at preparing small "clusters" which are composed of a
transition metal, such as ruthenium or osmium, and a boron atom or a more
extended, sheet-like array of transition and lanthanide metals. These will be
converted into "nanoparticles" which will be characterized and evaluated for
their chemical and catalytic properties.
