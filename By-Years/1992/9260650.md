This proposal outlines a research program to develop a non-invasive temperature
sensor for application in dry etching (plasma etching, reactive ion etching for
example) of electronic materials. There is a critical need for such sensors at
present since the temperature of the water influences the results of the etching
process; etch rate, undercutting, and surface quality. In addition, the
photoresist used for masking begins to char at elevated temperatures. Hence, it
is important to measure and monitor the wafer temperature at all times. The
proposed effort would result in a novel temperature sensor to measure and
monitor wafer temperature in dry etching environment. The innovation here is
that the proposed technique would enable a non-invasive, contactless and non-
destructive method of performing surface temperature measurement in a plasma
etching chamber. In contrast, existing techniques are invasive and cumbersome
and the need for contacting precludes measuring the process-wafer temperature;
instead only the temperature of the cathode or a dummy wafer is measured at
present. The proposed research is to investigate photoreflectance as a
temperature sensor for the above purpose. The energy gap of the semiconductor
material would be measured using modulation spectroscopy and correlated to the
surface temperature. The Phase I effort demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy
of this technique. The Phase II effort would result in a prototype instrument
and demonstrate its use in improving practical etching in an industrial
environment.
