9500237 Hollibaugh This project will investigate the relationship between
bacterioplankton community composition and community metabolic capabilities in
the Arctic Ocean. They will examine the patterns of spatial variation in these
properties of Arctic Ocean bacterioplankton communities and attempt to relate
them to sources of organic matter fueling heterotrophic production. The
investigation will be conducted using samples collected from a U.S. Navy
submarine in March-May 1995, which will be dedicated to Arctic oceanography.
Collected samples will be analyzed in the laboratory after the cruise. Community
composition will be analyzed using a method developed at San Francisco State
University based on separating partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene. Community
metabolic capabilities will be assessed by the ability of bacteria to grow on 95
different organic carbon sources. They will analyze water samples chemically to
determine the concentrations of amino acids, carbohydrates and dissolved organic
carbon, and conduct bioassays using native bacteria to determine directly the
proportion of dissolved organic carbon that they can metabolize.
