This CAREER proposal focuses on detailed studies of the production mechanisms of
the top quark, in particular in attempting to observe, with the D0 detector at
the Fermilab Tevatron, the electroweak production of a single top quark from a
Wtb vertex and, hence, to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element,
Vtb, directly. The measurement of Vtb is very important to particle physics. It
will help assure that the top quark has the properties that are expected of the
SU(2) partner of the bottom quark. Extracting a single-top signal from a large
background requires a very efficient identification of jets originating from a
bottom quark, with a very low rate of mis-identification. This can be achieved
with a silicon-based tracking system, now being developed for the D0 Run2b
upgrade. The Principal Investigator is one of the major contributors to the
development of this detector.
