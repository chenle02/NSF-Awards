This is a four-year, research-oriented teacher enhancement project in
engineering directed at the secondary school science and mathematics teachers.
It involves a public university, a regional school system, and local industries.
The project will establish an on-going career development path for teachers by
providing them an introduction to selected high priority technical areas, using
a combination of tutorial sessions and participation in research and workshops.
At the heart of the project is a six week concentrated summer workshop and
research experience, followed by complementary activities in the ensuing
academic year. A team of engineers and scientists drawn from the participating
institutions will be responsible for the tutorial sessions and supervision of
research and workshop activities. In order to broaden and sustain its impact,
the project staff will create a system of mentors and resource persons at the
school level to assist teachers in the translation of their program experiences
into effective educational modules and other teaching resources which will lead
to measurable curricular upgrading.
