This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
avalanche-warning systems to improve the safety of those who travel and live in
mountainous areas. Avalanches produce low frequency infrasound (1-5 Hz), which
can propagate miles from their origin, and thus provide a means for remote,
automated detection and warning systems. Single sensor monitoring systems are
capable of detecting avalanche infrasound, but associated detection algorithms
suffer from false alarms under high noise conditions. Sensor array based systems
provide spatial signal information, which can be used both for noise
suppression, and source location, potentially greatly improving detection
capabilities. However, the use and limitations of array-based signal processing
techniques and associated theoretical assumptions, as applied to the large
scales and field demands of avalanche infrasound, needs to be investigated and
understood. A monitoring system will be operated during planned avalanche
control activities to gain experimental data to determine the feasibility of
sensor arrays for avalanche detection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial
applications of this technology exist for monitoring, warning, and controlling
routes of travel and commerce, for backcountry travelers, recreation areas,
search and rescue operations, and for monitoring and warning of avalanches where
people reside. It is estimated that there is a large international market for
this technology.
