9712658 Raufaste With this award continuing support is provided for the
U.S./Japan Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects, which was established in 1969.
Annual meetings are held in alternate years in the U.S. and Japan, with the
Panel developing technologies and strategies that advance engineering design and
construction practices. The Panel is comprised of 19 Federal agencies who
participate on eleven task committees. The task committees focus on specific
national issues, e.g., earthquake hazard reduction; passive and active control
systems; repair and retrofit of structures; and wind engineering for offshore
structures. The results of the task committee workshops and conferences are
usually published as proceedings. ***
