An ad hoc committee of the National Academies will conduct a study to summarize
current geoengineering knowledge about underground development in the urban
environment; identify pressing research needed to take advantage of
opportunities for enhancing urban sustainability through underground
development; and develop an enhanced public and technical community
understanding of the role of geoengineering in the sustainability of the urban
built environment, specifically through the minimization of consumption of
nonrenewable energy resources, construction materials, and negative impact on
the natural, built, and social environments. Issues to be addressed include
geologic site characterization, construction and geotechnical monitoring
techniques, energy requirements and benefits, and lifecycle costs and benefits
of sustainable underground infrastructure development. The study will recommend
directions for a new geoengineering research track focused on earth systems
engineering and management to ensure future human resources for sustainable
underground development. Advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new
research center in this area will be analyzed, and other potential options for
enhancing the human resource capacity for sustainable underground development
-including the status quo- will be considered. The policy, economic, and human
behavioral drivers that promote or inhibit the development of the subsurface in
a sustainable manner will also be considered from a social science point of
view.
