Undergraduate students in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University
of Florida are using instrumentation and measurement equipment as part of a new
course on laboratory and field testing. The laboratory course involves
electrical measurements, data acquisition, strain gage applications, pressure
transducers, linear variable differential transformers for measurement of
displacement, anemometer and temperature measurements, and moisture and pH
measurements, all of which are an important part of civil engineering practice.
In this laboratory the students increase their appreciation of the errors
involved in the measurements and learn the effective utilization of test data.
