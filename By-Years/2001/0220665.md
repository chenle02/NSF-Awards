This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students majoring in
computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology and
mathematics. Special consideration for scholarships is given to the recruitment
and retention of women and minorities in these fields. Students are retained in
the program through strategies to enhance learning experiences, by participation
in cohort group learning and support, and with academic tutoring and faculty
advising. Information about the scholarship program is broadly disseminated in
order to encourage other low-income students to aspire to and prepare for
college careers in these fields. The program builds on relationships with
industry to assist in recruitment, retention and in providing employment
opportunities. The college also continues to foster relationships with 4-year
colleges for both AS and AAS transfer students. Ridgewater College Foundation,
the financial aid office, and the counseling office, ensure timely and careful
selection of scholarship winners and processing of student information.
Scholarship recipients are identified as winners on campus and in the community
and are encouraged to participate in cohort groups of 15 members on each of two
campuses. An advocacy team made up of faculty, counselors, industry
representatives and high school staff meet twice yearly to review progress in
achieving program goals and to make recommendations for improvements.
