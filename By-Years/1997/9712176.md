9712176 Shen A comprehensive analysis of the local seismicity along a 300 km-
long stretch of the Southern East Pacific Rise, 15 to 18 degrees south, and off-
axis out to 400 km on either flank is possible using data from the MELT ocean-
bottom seismometer experiment. This experiment deployed 51 seismometers for 7
months, and provides an opportunity to detect tectonic and magmatic events and
intraplace seismicity at a super-fast spreading ridge. The study has two
components. The first is to characterize seismic activity at and near the ridge
axis, to relate seismicity to variations along-strike in volcanic and tectonic
features of the axial zone, and to use the spatial and temperal patterns of
seismicity to evaluate the existing models of the basic processes of the
formation of the ocean crust. The second component is to assess the level and
nature of intraplate seismicity and its correlation with seafloor age,
seamounts, gravity lineations, or other tectonic features.
