The Applied Algebra, Algebraic Algorithms, Error Correcting Codes (AAECC 9)
International Conference to be held in New Orleans on October 7-10, 1991 is the
ninth in a series of annual conferences and the first one to be held in the
United States. The previous eight conferences were held in Europe and Japan. The
aims of the meeting are to guarantee through cross-fertilization, spreading of
algebraic techniques among different application areas, and attracting
theoretical algebraists with an interest in applications to work on applied
problems. An interdisciplinary conference like this is an effective way to allow
researchers to keep abreast of the current state of the art, and this proposed
one will also allow a broader audience in the US to hear from its leading
overseas practitioners the present state of research in Computer Algebra.
