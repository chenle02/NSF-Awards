This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include a development of the AMANDA neutrino
telescope which utilizes the vast expanse of optically transparent ice located
one kilometer beneath the surface of the South Pole, and continue to investigate
methods to augment the capabilities of the SPASE air shower array to observe
astrophysical sources of high energy.
