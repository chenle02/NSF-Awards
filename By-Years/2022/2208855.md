Algebraic Topology: Methods, Computation, and Science (ATMCS) is a biennial
conference on algebraic topology and its applications. The tenth ATMCS meeting
will be hosted by Oxford University, the week of June 20â€“24, 2022. The program
includes invited talks, contributed talks, and a poster session. As many as 350
participants from around the world are expected at the conference. This project
will support the travel of US-based participants to the meeting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas represented at the meeting will include
multivariate persistent homology, directed topology, stochastic topology,
inverse problems, algorithms and software development, topological data analysis
(TDA) in machine learning, network data analysis, and applications of TDA. By
supporting the cross pollination of ideas, the conference will directly impact
research in the United States. Participant support costs will be prioritized for
early-career researchers. A conference website is available at
https://atmcs.web.ox.ac.uk/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
