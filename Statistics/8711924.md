This research will seek results and their applications of multivariate regular
variation. The applications will be to least square estimators in multiple
regression with random predictors. The notable part will be that the assumptions
on the underlying distributions will be minimal, allowing for infinite moments
and disparity among distributional types. Basic among problems of study is the
regular variation of probability tails for product of a random vector with an
independent scaler and for the matrix of cross products formed from a random
vector. A related problem to be studied will involve the exponential tail
behavior of convolutions. Extensions of the concepts of subexponentiality and
convolution equivalency will be sought. The research will have applications for
multivariate infinitely divisible laws for compound multivariate distributions.
