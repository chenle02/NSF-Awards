This project is a collaboration between the University of Houston - Clear Lake
(UHCL), an upper-level undergraduate and graduate university, and three campuses
of the San Jacinto Community College district (SJC) to increase attainment of
STEM associates and baccalaureate degrees, as well as to facilitate and increase
transfer of STEM students across the institutions. The project focuses on
increasing student engagement and persistence through the development of face-
to-face and technology-enhanced learning networks, both within and across
campuses. Supporting initiatives include extended orientation programs, peer and
faculty mentoring, career-awareness and enhancement activities, and modest
financial aid. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the strong
partnership between the baccalaureate and associates institutions, well-designed
and coherent project elements which build on literature-based best practices and
successful pilot studies, clear implementation strategies, well-planned
evaluation, and extensive involvement of local STEM industries. Broader impacts
include enhanced support at these Hispanic-serving institutions, with additional
efforts to reach women, veterans and/or low-income students. Project graduates
deepen and diversify the local STEM workforce, and the project provides a useful
model for linking associates and baccalaureate institutions, as well as local
STEM employers, to support student retention and success.
