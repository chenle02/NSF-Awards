This research project will test the hypothesis that there was regional-scale
(thousands of square kilometers) fluid flow in east Vermont during the Acadian
regional metamorphism. The project will involve collection of stable isotopes
(carbon, oxygen, hydrogen) on minerals in the Waits River Formation. The
research will focus on determining the presence, magnitude, and timing of
proposed "giant" hydrothermal systems associated with major antiformal
structures. If documented, these systems will have important implications with
regard to heat and mass transfer processes in the deep continental crust.
