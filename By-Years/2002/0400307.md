&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will focus attention on a variety of problems in
interpolation, invariant subspaces, and model theory on reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces of analytic functions on domains in Cn. These problems connect
operator theory and function theory. Examples of such problems are the corona
problem on symmetric Fock space on the unti ball of Cn and the corona problem on
Hardy space of the unit polydisc in Cn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
