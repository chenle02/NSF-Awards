Proposal Number: ECS-9734438 Principle Investigator: Ann Mescher Title: CAREER:
Discovery and transfer of knowledge enabling manufacture of polymer materials
with specialized optical characteristics Abstract The proposed research is
related to numerical modeling and experimental characterization of polymer
optical fibers. Through strong collaboration with industrial sponsors, the PI
will receive specific processing conditions to simulate the manufacturing
process and to verify experimentally numerical predictions regarding to the
refractive index profile and bandwidth of the polymer fiber. The educational
plan includes the development of an interdisciplinary graduate course, and to
establish collaboration with the ECSEL coalition and an outreach effort to women
and minorities in engineering. This proposal is recommended for a CAREER award
at $200,000 for 48 months. T. P. Lee February 13, 1998
