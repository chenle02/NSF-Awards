9312233 Gordon This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University in the purchase of
an upgrade for a 500 MHz, multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. This upgrade will enhance greatly research in a number of areas
including the following: 1) Total synthesis of interesting and challenging
molecules such as: (a) miroestrol, a structurally novel ingredient of an
oriental medicinal herb with interesting biological properties, (b)
paeoniflorin, a complex polycyclic plant glucoside and (c) inhibitors of tumor
angiogenesis such as ovalicin, 2) Natural product synthesis of palytoxin, 3)
Conformational studies of C- and O-glycosides, 4) Polyether macrolide
halichondrins, 5) Structural and functional studies of signaling proteins, 6)
Structural and mechanistic studies of nucleic acids and nucleic-acid binding
proteins, %%% A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain
information about molecular structure (what types of carbon and/or hydrogen
atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present, what are the relative number of each type
of atoms and how are they connected to one another in the molecule) and
molecular dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule moving).
This instrument is essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry
research program. ***
