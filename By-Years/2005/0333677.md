This project proposes to establish a DS3 connection from Marquette University to
WiscNet/WiscREN point of presence to access the Abilene/Internet2 advanced
network. The Marquette campus backbone has been upgraded. The proposed
connection will initially support collaborations with researchers at the
University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and Madison Campuses, the Medical College of
Wisconsin, the University of California, Berkeley, the Internet2 Technology
Evaluation Center of Ohio/Ohio Supercomputer Center, and 32 American Dental
Education Association member schools in the areas of &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chemical Proteomics&lt;br/&gt; Imaging System/Case Based
Learning/TeleDentistry&lt;br/&gt; Rehabilitation Engineering Research on
Accessible Medical Instrumentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
successful research and implementation of the above projects include leveraging
significant NIH investments in instruments on other campuses which may be
accessed remotely by Marquette researchers, a real-time case-based learning
model throughout US and Canada in the area of dentristry, and organized
archiving of dental images that can be used in the future for population studies
and oral health research. Marquette University plans to disseminate results from
the above projects in various Internet2 working groups and research initiatives.
