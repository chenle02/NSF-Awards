This research investigates Bayesian methods for constructing probabilistic
networks from databases. Its main focus is on constructing Bayesian belief
networks. Primary goals are to (1) develop methods for calculating the
probability of a Bayesian belief-network structure given a database of cases,
(2) identify the most probable belief-network structure given a database of
cases, and (3) perform probabilistic inference by taking a weighted average over
the inferences of multiple belief networks. Potential applications include
computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and
automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. Methods will be explored
for intergrateing prior knowledge with data, handling missing data, and
discovering hidden (latent) variables. Of particular concern is the development
of computationally efficient algorithms. The methods developed will be
empirically evaluated using databases from several domains. //
