This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to understand defect phenomena in hydrogen bonded systems. This research will
lead to new insights into the mechanisms of ice crystal growth and nucleation, a
field of importance to technologies varying from protection of agricultural
crops to the understanding of the mechanisms of importance in transport of
protons through cell walls. The influence of interfacial effects on defect
activities near surfaces will be studied to establish the relationships between
defect activities and the ability of ice like structures to grow from metastable
phases. Ion pair studies in both protic and aprotic solvents will also be
explored. The experiments will be performed using the techniques of infrared and
Raman spectroscopy on room and low temperature systems. Emphasis will be paid to
comparisons between matrix solvation spectra and the corresponding spectra
obtained by others for vitrified aqueous systems.
