The research to be carried out includes the following: 1. A program of precise
wavelength measurements of energy levels of atomic helium at an accuracy which
will provide a test of current theoretical calculations. 2. Precise measurements
of the ionization potential of molecular hydrogen, to be done in collaboration
with Edward Eyler of the University of Delaware. 3. Theoretical work on
correlation effects in atom-atom collisions, to be done in collaboration with
Kate Kirby of the Harvard Smithsonian Observatory.
