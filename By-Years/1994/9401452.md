Gasper 9401452 The award supports mathematical research on fundamental
properties of hypergeometric and q-(basic) hypergeometric series, classical and
non-classical orthogonal polynomials, and on the development of new methods for
proving that certain orthogonal polynomials and entire functions have only real
roots. In particular, investigations will be made into the nonnegativity of the
coefficients in linearization formulas, the positivity of kernels in product
formulas (both of which lead to new convolution structures and hypergroups), and
necessary and sufficient multiplier conditions (via norms involving fractional
differences) for certain systems of orthogonal polynomials. Continuing work will
also be done on sums and integrals of squares of real-valued functions and their
application in deriving explicit identities which prove that certain entire
special functions have only real roots, and in deriving new families of
inequalities, which also prove that all of the rootsare real. The theory of
special functions and orthogonal polynomials has fruitful connections with many
branches of mathematical analysis and applied mathematics, such as differential
equations, operator theory, numerical analysis, integration, continued fractions
and control theory to name a few. This particular program makes interesting
connections with some of the most outstanding mathematical questions considered
in the mainstream of interest at this time. Of particular note is the study of
roots of entire functions which relates directly to the Riemann hypthesis. ***
