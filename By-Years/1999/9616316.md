This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga University to acquire
a fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (1) new solid state
materials, (2) synthesis of transition metal porphyrin complexes, and (3)
synthesis and characterization of biomolecular analogs. A fourier-transform
infrared spectrometer can provide important information about chemical
reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.
