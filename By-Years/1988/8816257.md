The proportions of ferric and ferrous iron in a given amphibole are determined
by a complex interaction between intensive parameters such as temperature and
pressure and crystal-chemical parameters such as crystal structure. Research to
determine these properties will be continued. The approach consists of
experimental treatment of amphiboles followed by thorough characterization of
run products by x-ray, optical, wet chemical, and spectroscopic techniques. The
results will have specific applications in relating the compositions of natural
amphiboles to intensive parameters in the environment of formation. More
fundamental understanding will come from the defining of the interrelaionship
between chemical, crysallographic, and thermodynamic properties of a major rock-
forming mineral group. The end result will be a better understanding of
amphibole group minerals and the environments in which rocks have formed.
