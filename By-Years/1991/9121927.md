This award is for the purchase of a file server and disk storage for research
in automatic language identification, continuous letter recognition, telephone
speech recognition and stochastic dynamics of neural learning. These research
projects require frequent and repeated use of large amounts of data. The file
server will be able to handle a large number of disks and heavy network traffic,
and the disk storage will satisfy current storage needs. Network transfers of
very large files used to train neural network classifiers can seriously strain
an institution's disk/cpu server. The requested file server and disk storage
will allow the Oregon Graduate Institute to handle a large number of disks and
very heavy network traffic. The additional disk storage will satisfy current
storage needs.
