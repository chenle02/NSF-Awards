The Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 requires the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) to publicly report hate crime statistics. However, hate
crimes are often under-identified, and variation in reporting hate crimes across
communities is largely unexplored. This project will investigate deviation in
the nature and extent of hate crime victimization and the reporting of hate
crimes across local communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will
examine data on hate crime victimization and reporting from the restricted
version of the 2005-2015 National Crime Victimization Survey provided by the
Federal Statistical Research Data Center, as well as state and local data from
multiple sources, including the Decennial Census, American Community Survey, and
Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics survey, among other
data sources. The project will investigate the effects of contextual and other
characteristics on hate crime victimization and reporting. Findings from this
project will aid scholars, policy makers, and the public on issues related to
hate crimes, including localized variation in hate crime and reporting, data-
collection strategies, better identification of strategies to attend to the
needs of victims, and assessment of programs that pertain to hate crime
victimization and reporting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
