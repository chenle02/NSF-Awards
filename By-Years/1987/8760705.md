There is a definite need in crop improvement for a method to isolate plant
genes which relies primarily on phenotypes. The idea of using plant transposons
in such a strategy is attractive but its efficient implementation awaits a
detailed investigation into factors which might influence transposition
frequency. The corn transposon Ac (Activator), which has been used in gene
isolation in corn, is known to transpose in tobacco, but existing systems for
monitoring the activity of the transposon are limited by the absence of any
phenotype which can be easily scored in whole plants. This poses problems in
assessing the effectiveness of systems for gene isolation based on transposon
mutagenesis. Dr. Jones has engineered a useful visual assay for Ac transposition
is seedlings based on scoring somatic excisions from a streptomycin resistance
gene. He proposes to carry out further studies on genetic and other factors
which might influence transposition frequency in dicots in order to refine plant
transposon technology so that it can effectively be used for gene isolation in
this group of plants. The development of this transposon technology will enable
the isolation of plant genes which could not easily be isolated by other means.
