This renewal award by the Division of Materials Research to University of
Maryland College Park is to study the dispersion of the shear elastic isotropy
and magnetic properties in the high temperature phase of ferromagnetic shape
memory alloys (FSMAs), where tweed has been observed or is likely to occur. With
this award, Professor Wuttig will be experimentally investigating the structural
origin of the elastic dispersion in FSMAs, particularly Fe"70Pd"30, by time
resolved diffraction studies at a bright X-ray source operated by national
facilities. Complete temperature and magnetic field dependence of the real and
imaginary parts of all elastic constants in the cubic phase of magnetic shape
memory alloys of interest will also be determined, and these studies will be
augmented with structural information. These experiments would provide the input
parameters for modeling that would promote an overall understanding of the
elasticity and anelasticity as well as related magnetic response functions of
the alloys of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the cooperation of one of
Maryland's premier science magnet high schools, the project would attempt to
enhance the image of engineering sciences in general and materials science in
particular among students. The planned activities include: a) creating role
model(s) by working with one or two students on aspects of this project, and b)
nurturing them so that they will be able to write a scientific papers and
prepare them to compete well in the Intel competition. One of the outcomes of
these activities would be increased enrollment of students in undergraduate
engineering programs.&lt;br/&gt;
