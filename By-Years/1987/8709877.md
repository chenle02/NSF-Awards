The long term goals of this research are to understand the structure,
organization, and expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain genes in the
goldfish, Carassius auratus. A genomic library has been constructed in lambda
phage; initial sequencing of three VH.related genes has been completed, and
putative JH regions have been identified by oligonucleotide probe hybridization.
These studies will be expanded in three areas. First, representative VH, DH, JH,
and CH regions will be identified and sequenced to elucidate their germline
organization. Standard DNA cloning, mapping, and sequencing strategies will be
used. To identify CH regions, peptides of goldfish IgM heavy chains will be
microsequenced, and specific mixed oligonucleotide probes will be synthesized to
correspond to their coding sequences. Second, computer assisted analyses of
goldfish VH gene sequences and comparison of these with each other and with
published VH sequences for other vertebrates will be undertaken in an attempt to
infer the relative contributions of selection, mutation, drift, and
non.reciprocal exchange in the evolution of these genes. Third, the function of
putative regulatory regions of the goldfish Ig heavy chain genes will be
studied. Appropriate expression vectors will be constructed to test whether the
goldfish heavy chain promoter (in association with a mammalian Ig enhancer
region) permits gene expression in mammalian lymphoid cells. The mechanisms of
immune function in animals other than mammals are as yet poorly understood.
Basic knowledge of the structure, organization and regulation of expression of
immunoglobulin genes in fish is of importance not only for its intrinsic
interest, but also because understanding of immune function in fish is
fundamental for the capability to grow and maintain of fish in commercial
culture and for understanding the factors involved in the success or failure of
fish to survive in natural environments. Knowledge of the evolution of immune
function obtained from these studies may also shed light on the function of
immune systems in higher vertebrates.
