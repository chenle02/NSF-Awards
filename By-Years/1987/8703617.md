This proposal requests funds to purchase a transmission electon microscope
(TEM). The replacement TEM will include features such as an expanded range of
magnification, a tilt goniometer that will allow stereo photography, a high
capacity camera, and a video camera system that displays and/or stores the
projected electron image. The TEM will be used for studies on the development
and structure of leaves of selected C3 and C4 plants, studies on the green alga
Coleochaete as a source of clues to the early evolutionary history of land
plants, studies on leaf morphogenesis to determine the attainment of
photosynthetic competency, studies to elucidate the cytological and histological
processes of wound healing in response to bruising in potatoes, and studies on
healthy and diseased marigold cultivars infected with Pseudomas syringae.
