A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V
Savannah. The R/V Savannah is a 92 foot coastal research vessel operated by
Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request includes
three items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Upgrade of Data
Acquisition System&lt;br/&gt; 2) Sampling components for multi-corer
system&lt;br/&gt; 3) Acoustic deck unit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
