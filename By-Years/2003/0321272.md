This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
innovations pertaining to optrodes (optical sensors) and electro-optical
instrumentation for advanced material characterization. Specifically, this
project will develop the first commercially available high-resolution volumetric
dilatometer. In addition, the innovations will allow for: (1) a linear
dilatometer that possesses a resolution that is 2-3 orders of magnitude better
than its conventional linear counterparts; (2) an optical control system for
micro-translation stages; (3) an optrode for thin film characterization that
possesses a linear resolution exceeding 1 nanometer; and (4) an ultra-fast,
high-resolution spectrometer that will enable commercialization of three optical
sensors (pressure, temperature, and load) suitable for harsh
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications are
expected in electronics and microelectronics manufacturing for dilatometry, thin
films analysis, micro-translation stages, ultra-fast spectroscopy, and various
optical sensors.&lt;br/&gt;
