This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) - Faculty and
Students in Industry component - award provides support of an Oakland University
Systems Engineering Student for a one semester visit with the Advanced
Manufacturing Technology Group at the DaimlerChrysler Technology Center. The
research project is to study the development of a supervisory system which
monitors the physical manufacturing systems and compares its behavior with that
of an equivalent computer simulation model. It is proposed that if the behavior
of the physical manufacturing system varies from that of the computer simulation
model due to the modifications made to the physical system, the supervisory
system will identify these changes and attempt to modify the model to account
for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study will be communicated
through a series of company briefings, as well as publications in appropriate
academic journals.
