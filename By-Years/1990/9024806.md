String theories and conformal field theories have had a remarkable impact on
mathematics, as well as having a profound effect in turning a generation of
young theoretical physicists toward mathematics. The mathematical developments
deriving from string theories and conformal field theories have been truly
prodigious, with new applications from algebraic geometry, representations of
infinite dimensional algebras, quantum groups, Riemann surfaces, non-commutative
geometry, topology and knot theory. This grant will partially support a
conference on Differential Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics at Baruch
College in June, 1991. In addition to attracting the world leaders in these
areas, who will interact in a stimulating research atmosphere, this conference
will provide undergraduates and honor high school students with the opportunity
to participate in specially designed expository lectures and panel discussions
with the assembled experts.
