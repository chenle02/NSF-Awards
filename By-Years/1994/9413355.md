Many countries are currently instituting sweeping changes in economic policy in
areas such as liberalization of trade and capital flows, monetary and fiscal
policy, greater reliance on markets, and privatization. Countries which have a
history of highly variable economic policies have experienced booms in economic
activity, consumption, and imports following sharp policy changes. The purpose
of this project is to analyze the effects of uncertainty about the timing and
nature of shifts in economic policy on the dynamics of consumption, investment,
asset accumulation, and capital flows: and to determine how variability of
policy may influence these dynamics. A general analytical framework will be
developed to study the effects of uncertainty created by economic policy
changes.
