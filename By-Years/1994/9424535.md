9424535 Blue Granite Software, Inc. This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will develop an automatic Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
tooling generator. The new system would allow PCB manufacturers to produce PCB
custom tooling without manual steps. Techniques such as statistical process
control and continuous improvement could then be applied to the custom tooling
portion of the PCB manufacturing process. Complex patterns of fine lines must be
accurately portrayed by the tooling, and these patterns are contained in a
design database. Creation of custom tooling from the design database is
currently a manual process, but this system is expected to automate the function
entirely. If successful, the system would produce considerable cost savings,
higher yields, and shorter response times to customer orders in the PCB supply
industry.
