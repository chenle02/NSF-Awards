This is a request for funds to obtain an automated circular dichroism (CD)
spectrometer which will be utilized by five major users in studies of
stereochemical analysis, biomolecular structure, synthetic protein analysis and
electronic spectroscopy. The individual projects are, first, an investigation of
structural perturbations induced in DNAs by regulatory protein binding. Second,
a study of structures of synthetic proteins and nucleation of protein folding.
Third, a study of peptide and protein conformation. Fourth, an investigation of
the interaction of carcinogens with DNA. Finally, a study of microscopic domains
in the secondary structure and methylation of myelin basic protein.
