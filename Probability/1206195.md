In recent years, there has been growing interest in using tools from probability
theory to solve biological problems. Probability theory has contributed
substantially to the field of population genetics because many of the factors
that are responsible for the evolution of populations are best modeled as random
events. The aim of this project is to make further contributions in this area by
undertaking a detailed mathematical study of some natural models of randomly
evolving populations.

The first part of the project focuses on branching Brownian motion with
absorption. Particles move according to Brownian motion with drift, divide into
two at a constant rate, and are absorbed upon hitting the origin. This process
can be viewed as modeling a population undergoing selection. The particle
positions represent fitnesses of individuals, the branching events represent
births, and absorption at the origin models the death of unfit individuals. The
goal will be to provide sharp estimates for the probability that the process
survives for a long time and for the position of the right-most particle. The
second part of the project involves studying a model of a population of fixed
size in which individuals acquire beneficial mutations. The goal will be to
prove results concerning the speed of evolution, the distribution of the
fitnesses of individuals in the population, and the genealogy of the population.
The third part of the project involves further study of the beta coalescent, a
process which can be used to describe the genealogy of populations with large
family sizes.
