This study will systematically characterize the origins of volcanic breccias and
their constituent fragments, and thus develop a new genetic classification
scheme using mostly field-based observational criteria. Integrated field and
laboratory studies will be undertaken in two phases. Phase I studies will focus
on well- exposed breccias, mostly on Quaternary volcanoes, where field
relationships permit relatively unambiguous interpretation of deposit and
particle origins. These reference sites will emphasize those types of volcanic
breccias that are least well understood. Phase II investigations will take place
on well-exposed, accessible, and mapped volcanoes (one active, one Tertiary in
age) to evaluate how breccias of different types are distributed within volcanic
edifices, and the role that breccias play in the growth of the volcano.
