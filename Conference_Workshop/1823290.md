The Conference on Combinatorics and its Applications is a three day event to be
held at the new Novena Campus of Nanyang Technological University (NTU),
Singapore, from 14 to 16 July 2018. Combinatorial design theory lies at the
crossroads of combinatorics, algebra, geometry, number theory, and mathematics
of computation. It has extensive applications in communications, cryptography
and security, experimental design, networking, coding theory, software testing,
and bioinformatics, to list a few. The conference includes keynote presentations
from nine renowned experts from Asia, Europe, North America and Australia, whose
research spans these topics. The conference has strong international
participation and thus affords many opportunities for collaboration among
researchers and educators in combinatorics and its applications.

The conference is supported by Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the
Institute of Advanced Studies at NTU, The Institute of Combinatorics and its
Applications (ICA), and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).
Specifically, this NSF grant broadens the participation of U.S. researchers
working at the intersection of combinatorial design theory and computer science,
expanding and strengthening this community. The participants will be selected
through a travel grant application process, giving preference to women,
minorities, under-represented groups, and beginning researchers. More
information about the conference, and a description of the travel grant
application process, may be found at the conference website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
