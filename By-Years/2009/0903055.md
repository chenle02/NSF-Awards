This project expands the workforce preparation for the renewable energy and
environmental technology industries through a partnership of Red Rocks Community
College (RRCC) with the Colorado Governor's Energy Office, the University of
Colorado, the Colorado School of Mines, Colorado State University, the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, and the Jefferson County School
District. The project advances environmental sustainability and energy
technology education through curriculum development, materials preparation,
professional development, and hands-on energy science experiences in the RRCC
Energy Laboratory. The critical education juncture of high school through
community college (grades 9-14) is the focus of the student education and
teacher professional development. Workforce development focuses on adults in
career transition as well as underserved traditional students. The project
connects renewable energy and environmental technology education with partner
research universities to increase Colorado's competitiveness in propelling
renewable energy technology transfer from research and development to commercial
application. The project offers teachers an opportunity to increase their
understanding of and improve skills in energy science and environmental
technology as well as prepare students for the future using new materials and
instructional methods. The partnerships with the Governor's office and the
national laboratory allows the project to reach across the state in supporting
high school students, community college traditional and non-traditional
students, and teachers underrepresented in science and technology careers.
