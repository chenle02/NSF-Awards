This research project in communication protocols focuses on the study of formal
modeling of communication protocols which spans the areas of protocol
specification, verification, testing and performance. Goals of the project are
to provide a unification of the formulation techniques across all of these areas
from specification to testing and to add the capability of studying performance
within the same kind of formulation. Currently the approaches used to formally
specify a protocol are different from those used to verify the logical
correctness of a protocol. There is also a gap between the verification
formulations and the conformance test generation formulations. The research
studies in this project are aimed at closing these two gaps and thereby
providing a more integrated approach to the design of communication protocols
from specification to verification to testing. In addition, the studies aim to
allow one to investigate the performance of the protocol at an early stage of
the design, again using the same formulation techniques as in specification and
verification.
