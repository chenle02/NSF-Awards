This Small Business Innovation Research project is to demonstrate large scale
capability for sorting single walled carbon nanotubes by diameter and electronic
type. Sorting of carbon nanotubes can lead to improved performance in existing
applications as well as opening up new applications that require monodisperse
properties.

The broader impacts of this research if successful will enable the delivery of
purified carbon nanotubes on scales necessary for volume applications. A means
for producing large quantities of SWCNTs that are monodisperse in their diameter
and/or electronic type would enable companies in the electronics, optics,
materials, and healthcare industries to explore fundamentally new avenues for
commercial product development using carbon nanotubes. SWCNTs can potentially be
incorporated into a wide range of commercial devices, such as transparent
conductive films for displays and solar panels, interconnects in integrated
circuits, high-performance field-effect transistors, thin-film transistors,
memory devices, near-infrared emitters and detectors, and biosensors.
