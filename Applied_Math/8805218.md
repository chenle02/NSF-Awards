This research will consider the numerical analysis of strongly nonlinear
problems including free boundary problems, constrained problems such as Stokes
flow, and the Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Linearization techniques based on
nonlinear Chernoff formulae will be investigated, and nonlinear algorithms for
both parabolic and eliptic problems will be analyzed with particular emphasis on
accuracy in nonenergy spaces and splitting algorithms. The impact of local mesh
refinements in reducing computational labor for a given accuracy will be
considered. Work analyzing the pointwise accuracy of mixed finite element
methods will be continued. This work will combine and interrelate theory and
numerical methods. It should increase understanding of both the numerical
techniques and the motivating physical situations.
