Basic research studies on the growth and characterization of oriented thin films
of magnetic materials on GaAs single crystal substrates will be conducted. The
approach uses laser ablation as the primary film growth method, and includes
consideration of lattice matching between the substrate and the deposited
magnetic films. Permanent magnet compounds that have uniaxial anisotropy and are
lattice matched to either (100) or (111) GaAs substrates will be investigated.
Examples are the t-MnAl phase(CuAu-type), its related ternary alloys MnAlM(M=Ni,
Cu, Zn) which are compatible with (100) GaAs, and the NiAs-type structure such
as MnBi, MnSb, and MnBiSb compatible with (111) GaAs substrates.
Characterization of the structural, compositional, and magnetic properties of
the films is an integral part of the research. %%% This research addresses the
epitaxial growth of thin films of magnetic materials on compound semiconductors
which offers many possibilities for the discovery of new devices and the
integration of magnetic storage media and active electronic or opto-electronic
components for improvements in devices and integrated circuits used in
computing, information processing, and telecommunications.
