Proposal #: 0308096&lt;br/&gt;Title: Augmenting Visual Perception with Real-Time
Tomographic Holography&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stetten, George&lt;br/&gt;U of
Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of emerging imaging technologies permit
inspection directly through walls, into luggage, beneath rubble, and through
turbid water or smoke. This proposal describes a new method of displaying such
data in situ by merging a stable virtual image of the data with a direct view of
its physical location, using a Holographic Optical Element (HOE). The method,
Real Time Tomographic (RTT) Display, requires no tracking or head-mounted
apparatus, and will operate in the 0.1-5 meter range around the observer,
permitting the observer to look directly through intervening structures as
though transparent, while taking full advantage of natural hand-eye
coordination, stereoscopic vision, and motion cues. The proposed HOE-based
technique relates to a recent innovation, the Sonic Flashlight, which uses a
half-silvered mirror to perform the same function at a smaller scale for medical
ultrasound. The present proposal extends the concept to larger-scale non-medical
imaging modalities, including those based on laser or ultrasonic range-finders,
ultra-wideband radar, and close-range (underwater) sonar. &lt;br/&gt;RTT
displays represent an important new method of augmenting natural interaction
with tomographic data. Investigator George Stetten developed the original
mirror-based Sonic Flashlight system and Investigator Andreas Nowatzyk developed
the theory for the HOE-based version. &lt;br/&gt;CMU is a premier center for
research and education, especially strong in Robotics, Graphics, and
Human/Computer Interfaces. Student participation is anticipated, including
graduate thesis research.&lt;br/&gt;
