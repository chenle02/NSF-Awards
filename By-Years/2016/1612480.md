The significance of the Raising Physics to the Surface project is that it will
yield a set of hands-on, discovery-style, discussion-based classroom activities
where students develop meaningful understandings of physical systems that depend
on multiple variables. Most physical systems depend on more than one variable.
However, when solving problems about these systems, many students merely apply
pointless algebraic manipulations to memorized formulas. Students gain
meaningful understandings by thinking conceptually and geometrically about the
relationships between variables. During the Raising Physics activities, students
will develop these understandings by working with custom, dry-erasable, 3D
surfaces, corresponding contour and gradient maps, and computer-based models.
The activities will span physics topics in classical mechanics, electricity and
magnetism, and thermal physics. Instructors from various colleges and
universities will learn how to use the Raising Physics materials effectively
during a summer workshop then deploy the materials in their physics
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the Raising Physics project are to
(a) produce and disseminate curricular materials, (b) identify the best
practices for using these materials in various classroom settings, and (c) study
the impact of these materials on student learning and on instructors' attitudes,
beliefs, and teaching practices. The curricular materials will be informed by
results from research in physics and math education that demonstrate the
importance of (1) using tangible models, maps and tools to explore geometric
relationships, (2) representing physical quantities in multiple ways, and (3)
discussing ideas in small groups for meaningful and flexible learning. The
research components of this project will investigate the effectiveness of the
activities and will advance understanding of how students reason about
multivariable functions in physics using multiple representations.
