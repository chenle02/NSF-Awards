This project will have four parts. The first part seeks to improve the running
time of algorithms to compute the volumes of convex sets, to do multivariate
sampling and integration. Randomized polynomial time algorithms for these
problems using rapidly mixing Markov Chains have been used; some new ones will
be designed that are ultimately intended to render these theoretically
polynomial time bounded algorithms usable in practice. The second part considers
some general results on log-concave functions that will reduce the running time
of sampling according to such functions; most statistical distributions belong
to this class. The third section considers some problems arising in
Manufacturing where, one has to optimize (minimize)the cost of components (raw
materials) subject to the (chance) constraint that one has enough components to
make the probability of our being able to meet the stochastic demands high
enough. The last part considers Parametric Integer Programming which arises in
contexts where the constraint matrix of an integer program remains fixed and one
wishes to solve the problem for various right hand side vectors. Algorithms to
preprocess the constraint matrix with a parallel algorithm will be considered.
