NSF CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences:

Recent Advances in the Numerical Approximation of Stochastic Partial
Differential Equations

Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, August 2010

Stochastic partial differential equations are appropriate models for many
randomly influenced systems. In order to quantify uncertainty and estimate
predictability of these systems, numerical approximations of stochastic partial
differential equations are crucial.

With Peter E. Kloeden as the Principal Lecturer, this conference will focus on
new advances and possible future research directions in numerical approaches for
simulating and analyzing stochastic partial differential equations, with
applications for understanding uncertainty quantification, noise-induced
phenomena and predictability.
