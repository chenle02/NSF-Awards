This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the
technological feasibility of the use of the Conversim [TM} dialogue model to
convey curricular material. This work includes developing and documenting the
protocol for transforming lecture material into an effective virtual dialogue
program; measuring student acceptance of learning critical, curricular material
this way; and measuring the learning success of the students. This Conversim
[TM] model represents a new paradigm in education, one that allows the student
to learn through a personal interview of the master teacher. The paradigm
includes non-directive, independent learning by conducting face-to-face
dialogues with master teachers who are always present, always available, and
always willing to converse with people who wish to engage them. Conversim [TM]
software combines speech recognition, digital video and personal computer
technologies to allow PC users to have "face-to-face" dialogues with video
characters. Scientific research has shown that most users enjoy the virtual
dialogue experience, many have significant, often accelerated, learning gain,
and almost all feel as though they have met the person with whom they have been
"talking." Multimedia presentations can be used in concert with the dialogue to
clarify concepts and complex topics. Also, the power of the computer for
tracking and for innovative, dynamic evaluation strategies is inherent in this
model. The broad objective is to make this model and this new paradigm available
in all educational institutions that would benefit from its use.
