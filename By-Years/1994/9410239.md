9410239 Etzkorn University of Virginia A covalent tether designed to bend DNA
will be used to study the natural target sequence for catabolite activating
protein (CAP) when it is bent. The crystal structure of CAP bound to DNA has
been solved permitting the design of a structural mimic of the bent DNA. The
length of DNA being bent and the amount of bending will be varied in a
controlled fashion in order to study a variety of DNA conformations. Unwinding
of DNA will be effected by varying the position of attachment of the tether to
the phosphate backbone and the biochemical effects will be determined. A
possible application is to use stable pieces of bent DNA to target proteins
which recognize bent DNA in order to block transcription by RNA polymerase. This
grant from the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Felicia A.
Etzkorn at the University of Virginia in the form of a Research Planning Grant.
A mimic of bent DNA will be synthesized and characterized both structurally and
functionally. The bending of DNA will be effected by a tether that will be
attached at widely spaced positions on the backbone of DNA. The research has
possible implications in blocking the formation of RNA, which is dictated by
DNA.
