The two leading theories of how the white/gray/black shade of a surface is
computed in your brain will be tested against each other in a series of 10
experiments. Human observers will be presented with three-dimensional displays
carefully constructed so that, under controlled viewing conditions, the two
theories make different predictions regarding the gray shade that will be
perceived for a test surface embedded within the display. All of the displays
will incorporate a serious challenge for vision, namely, multiple areas of light
and shadow. These displays will vary in terms of (a) whether the change of
illumination is projected onto a surface or occurs at a corner (or bend) in the
surface, (b) the number of different gray shades on each surface, and (c) the
range of gray shades on a given surface. The observers will be asked to match
critical parts of each display for gray level and level of illumination. The
strengths and weaknesses of each of the theories will be evaluated based on the
observer matches. Ideally these results will suggest how the respective
strengths of the two theories might be integrated.

How humans see the white, gray, and black shade of objects has not yet been
explained scientifically. The basic problem is that the light that an object
reflects to the eye does not reveal the shade of the object because it depends
so heavily on the intensity of illumination on the object. Thus any intensity of
light can be reflected from any shade of gray. The problem can only be solved by
analyzing the surrounding context. Advances in our understanding of the nature
of this analysis are absolutely necessary for guiding brain research in this
area. The work will impact computer vision as well. At the moment, no robot can
simply look at an object and report its shade of gray. Work with human vision
provides the best hope for making better computer programs. Ironically, the
proposed work will be conducted, not using computer images, as is almost
universally done in human vision research, but with actual three-dimensional
displays that are far more realistic.
