The general focus of this internship project is to carry out research directed
at automating the design and manufacture of dies. In particular, a parametric
design and manufacturing system will be developed that takes as an input the CAD
model of a stamped part (e.g., and automobile outer panel) and produces the
design of die components required for its manufacture. The design and
manufacture of dies is a problem central to reducing the concept to customer
time for a variety of industrial products. The results of this research are
expected to directly impact the competitiveness of United States manufacturing
industries.
