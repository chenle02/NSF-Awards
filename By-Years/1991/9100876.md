Professor Margaret V. Merritt and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Wellesley College are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, nine
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Some of the research projects involve molecular
beam experiments, hydrogen bonding in supermolecules, and identification of
natural products. Students will attend a weekly seminar series and discussions
of research progress and two field trips to industrial laboratories. Each
student will prepare a final report and give a poster presentation. Participants
will be predominantly women and minorites.
