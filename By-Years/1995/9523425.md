This postdoctoral award will (1) develop daytime measurement capabilities for
the sodium wind/temperature lidar, (2) operate the improved sodium
wind/temperature lidar simultaneously with UAO MF radar for a minimum of four
24-hour periods per month throughout the year, and (3) analyze and interpret the
data collected to study dynamics, in particular, tides effects involved in the
mesopause region above Urbana, Illinois. All the PI's observations will be
placed in the CEDAR database.
