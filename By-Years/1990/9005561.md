The contractile protein tropomyosin is an important component of the thin
filament-linked contractile regulatory system. The long-term goal of this
research program is to obtain a more detailed understanding of the relationship
between tropomyosin's primary structure and its role in muscle cells. The
current proposal focuses on the functional importance of specific amino acid
residues in the C-terminal region of tropomyosin, using Drosophila as a model
system. This work will enhance our understanding of muscle structure and
function.
