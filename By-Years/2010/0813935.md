The Flora of China (FOC) is an international collaborative project, whose goal
is to produce the first complete, English-language account of the approximately
31,500 species of Chinese vascular plants. FOC will result in the publication of
50 volumes, including detailed descriptions of all Chinese plants and
illustrations of over 60% of them. All of these materials will be freely
available for browsing and downloading via the FOC Web
site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOC is already having a major positive impact on the
international scientific community. Upon completion, it will be of great
importance to the future of plant science, biodiversity conservation, medicine,
education, and horticulture. FOC is also enhancing the infrastructure for
scientific research and education by promoting international collaborations
among institutions in the United States, China, and Europe. FOC is coordinated
by the Missouri Botanical Garden in partnership with ten other actively
collaborating institutions. Every text in FOC is co-authored by at least one
Chinese and at least one non-Chinese botanist, and the project involves the
collaboration of at least 300 non-Chinese and 170 Chinese botanists worldwide.
Of these, at least 100 botanists, including and graduate and undergraduate
students, are from the United States.
