DMS-9500973 PI: Moy Moy will investigate various aspects of the representation
theory of p-adic reductive groups. This will include investigations into the
behavior of characters in which the local character expansion of a
representation is shown to be connected to certain representations of compact
open subgroups appearing in the representation, and the development of the
theory of minimal K-types for reductive p-adic groups based on the results of
unrefined minimal K-types. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
