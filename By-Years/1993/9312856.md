9312856 Thompson This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing
Program in support of the research of Professor Thompson at Princeton
University. Support is provided by the Chemistry Division. The research will
focus on the mechanism of formation of photoinduced charge-separated states in
zirconium phosphonate sheets separated by viologen halides. These
microcrystalline solids will be grown as thin sheets and labeling and
substitution studies employed to elucidate both reversible and irreversible
mechanisms of charge separation. Investigations into how the structures and
electrochemical properties of the films relate to their photochemistry will be
carried out. These electroactive films supported on a metal electrode can be
made to contain all of the elements necessary for harvesting light, electron and
proton transfer, and catalysis. They will be screened for activity towards
carbon dioxide reduction and water-splitting. %%% Layered zirconium viologen
phosphonates are new materials which show promise in a variety of practical
applications including energy storage, electron transfer relays and catalysts
for the photoreduction of carbon dioxide and protons. ***
