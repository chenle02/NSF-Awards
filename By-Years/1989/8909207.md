Studies of hormone-behavior interactions have attempted to answer two central
questions: How do social conditions modify individual hormone patterns? How do
hormones modulate behavior? Dr Phillips and his colleague Dr. Lance propose to
investigate the interrelationship between a male's social dominance and its
circulating hormone levels and social environment. This interplay between
hormone levels and social conditions is most apparent in adult populations
during the breeding season. Yet, recent studies suggest that many behavior
patterns were established when the individual was a juvenile. Dr. Phillips has
developed an excellent model system to determine to what extent a male's social
dominance is shaped during development by both its physiology and social
environment. He will study a population of green iguanas from hatching to
puberty. This species is perhaps the only reptile where such a developmental
study of social structure and corresponding hormone levels is feasible. Indeed
given that reptiles are a pivotal group in vertebrate evolution, the studies
will also provide insight into how the interactions among hormones and behavior
may have evolved.
