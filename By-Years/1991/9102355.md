This electron beam writing and quantitative x-ray analysis system will be used
to address fundamental studies of small structures having confined geometries.
Fundamental materials investigations include one dimensional superconductors,
magnetism in confined geometries, and reduced dimensionality. Potential
technological applications are weak links, tunnel junctions, and SQUIDs. The
system will be accessible to groups on the campus involved in studies of
magnetism, superconductivity, and thin films.//
