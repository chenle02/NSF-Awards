This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award
funds the development of an 8kx8k pixel direct detection CMOS camera with single
electron quantized detection for high-resolution single particle cryo electron
microscopy (cryoEM) at the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF). The
new camera system will enable high frame readout rates, with extreme sensitivity
and high resolution. Because it uses so little material and does not require
crystals, single particle cryoEM has become an indispensable tool for studying
the three-dimensional (3D) structures of complex biological assemblies,
providing critical information not obtainable by more traditional methods such
as x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. The camera development project
will be coordinated through collaborations among UCSF, the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (LBNL), and Gatan, Inc., a company specializing in EM
cameras and peripherals. The camera will benefit a large number of research
projects and improve the training prospects for 15-25 students and postdoctoral
fellows in advanced cryoEM technology. UCSF PIs are also active participants in
summer research programs and have been hosting undergraduates in their labs to
provide research opportunities with advanced technologies. Performance and
availability of the camera will be widely disseminated through a web site, in
publications, and through presentations at local and international meetings.
Commercialization of the new technology may lead to even wider dissemination of
similar devices.
