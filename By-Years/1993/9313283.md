9313283 Chakravarthy Finite capacity queuing systems arise naturally in many
practical situations, notably in communications, manufacturing and production
systems. These queuing systems have very few analytical results (most of which
are obtained under very stringent conditions such as exponential assumptions)
and have been getting a lot of attention in recent years due to their profound
applications in practice. In this research using a dynamic group service rule
that has a number of potential application, several finite capacity queuing
models are investigated. Using matrix analytic methods, these models will be
analyzed. Efficient and stable algorithms for computing various system
performance measures will be developed. These algorithms are to be used
interactively to solve non-traditional but significant design problems. An
attempt is made to narrow the gap between theoreticians and practitioners in
operations research and production system areas which will be beneficial to
industry.
