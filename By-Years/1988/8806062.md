This proposal is for a Phase II SBIR. The primary objective of the research is
to develop a tomography gauge capable of making comprehensive, on-line
measurements of hot-rolled sheet steel as it is being manufactured. Phase I
research investigated the feasibility of this concept and was fully successful.
The Phase II research will develop and demonstrate a prototype sheet steel
scanner. X-ray source and detector technology will be optimized and candidate
algorithms suitable for making precise, high-speed, limited- angle tomography
measurements will be defined. A series of sheet steel phantoms, sufficient for
exhaustive performance evaluation of the components will also be developed. This
research could make a significant contribution to the technology of sheet steel
manufacture.
