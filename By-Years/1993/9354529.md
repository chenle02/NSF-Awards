9354529 Derry Literacy and informed decision making in an uncertain world
require the ability to reason statistically. However, research indicates that
although conceptions of statistics and probability have steadily advanced within
scientific and mathematical communities, adults in mainstream American society
cannot think probabilistically or statistically about important societal issues.
This project therefore presents a novel undergraduate course targeting students
who are considering a career in teaching. The course is designed to help
students employ statistical concepts as tools for social reasoning within
simulations of real-world problem situations. Reusable instructional materials
are being designed and will be disseminated to assist faculty at other
universities who wish to offer the course. The course will also interact with
the community, focus on cultural diversity, and is expected to achieve a high
degree of authenticity through simulations of realistic social problem solving.
