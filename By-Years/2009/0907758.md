Dr. Oey will investigate the population of massive stars in the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) by examining stars in the general field, rather than the more
commonly studied star clusters. She will use the multi-object spectrograph at
the 6.5-meter Magellan telescopes to take spectra of the 400 or so known stars
in the OB class, which contains the hottest and most massive stars. The motion
of the stars towards or away from the observer can be measured directly from the
spectra; their temperature and mass can be estimated by comparison with models.
She will then estimate how many stars were formed at each mass (the field star
initial mass function). She will examine whether the high-mass stars now in the
general field might have been born in star clusters, exploring the distribution
of radial velocities to constrain the numbers of both runaway stars and binary
stars, and estimating the time required for a star cluster to dissolve into the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both undergraduate and graduate students will be
trained through their involvement in the research. Dr Oey will lead a number of
outreach programs at the University of Michigan, including a Theme Semester for
the International Year of Astronomy in 2009. She will partner with the historic
Detroit Observatory on campus, to update exhibits, provide scientific training
for the docents, and collaborate with a science historian to document the
Observatory's historic role.
