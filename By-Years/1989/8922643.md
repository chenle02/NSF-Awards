The primary objective of this U.S.-Polish research between Dr. Shulamith
Schlick of the University of Detroit and Dr. Andrzej Plonka of the Technical
University of Lodz is to study the polarity. fluidity and local heterogeneity of
water pools in ionomers and in reverse micelles. The researchers will examine
these media in the motional mechanism, stability and kinetics of small reactive
intermediates that are sensitive to the local environment, and employ electron
spin resonance spectroscopy. Results are expected to contribute to our
understanding of catalytic processes occurring in biomembranes and should be
useful in modeling the conversion of light to chemical energy. This project in
biopolymers fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
