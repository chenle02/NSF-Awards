A microVax computer, a network system, a graphics terminal and other
computational equipment will be acquired to support molecular and structural
biology research. The projects to be supported include the molecular structure
of helical viruses, the folding of nucleic acids, the analysis of nucleic acid
sequence information, whole, the instrumentation will enhance research relevant
to biotechnology and enhance our understanding of cellular processes.
