9525828 Bequette This project seeks to sponsor engineering students to attend
the IEEE Control Systems Society Meetings. The goal is to develop an opportunity
for students to be informed about the most recent developments in research,
engineering and operation in the control and/or power engineering industry.
Opportunities for student attendance will be advertised nationwide and women,
minorities and disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply for
sponsorship. ***
