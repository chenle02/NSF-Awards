The goal of this project is to enable students in the physiology laboratory to
study the temporal patterning of extracellularly recorded neuronal activity.
This is to be accomplished through the use of a high speed 12 bit analog to
digital conversion board and complementary display and analytical software.
Processing would be handled by a 386 SX computer and high resolution hard copy
would be obtained with a laser printer.Specific applications include recording
patterns of activity in cockroach leg sensory axons in response to mechanical
stimulation of leg spines and changes in cockroach ventral nerve cord activity
in response to cercal nerve stimulation. The software will enable isolation of
single units through window (amplitude) discrimination and waveshape recognition
as well as analysis of action potential frequencies. These capabilities are
expected to significantly enhance students' understanding of neuronal coding by
allowing them to collect and quantitatively analyze temporal patterning over
longer periods of time than would be the case when using a digital storage
oscilloscope.
