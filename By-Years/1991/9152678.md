Although lasers have revolutionized many areas of experimental physical
chemistry, the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory is essentially
unchanged. This project introduces lasers and laser spectroscopy to the
undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory. Flexible equipment including an
argon ion pumped dye laser and a spectrometer for the undergraduate physical
chemistry laboratory will make possible a Raman experiment, a laser induced
fluorescence experiment, a laser- excitation/molecular absorption experiment,
and a laser refractometry experiment. These experiments have been described by
various authors. Other laser spectroscopy experiments may be developed and
incorporated into the curriculum. The grantee will match the NSF contribution to
this project from non-Federal sources.
