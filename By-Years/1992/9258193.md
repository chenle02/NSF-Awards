This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of surface
analysis. During the tenure of this five-year award, Professor Levis and his
students will develop mass spectroscopic methods for studying complex molecules
adsorbed on surfaces and found in this films. Two primary thrusts are involved:
(1) the use of hyperthermal (1-10 eV) atoms to promote nondissociative
desorption of complex adsorbates from surfaces for subsequent mass spectroscopic
analysis and (2) investigation of the use of laser vaporization of biological
molecules for use in high speed DNA sequencing experiments. %%% The successful
attainment of the goals of this project should give rise to new mass
spectroscopic techniques for molecular-level surface characterization, novel
approaches to rapid DNA sequencing, and new approaches to heteroepitaxial
deposition of thin-film molecular solids. Additionally, this NSF Young
Investigator Award should significantly assist Professor Levis in his
establishing a vital and productive program of research and research training.
