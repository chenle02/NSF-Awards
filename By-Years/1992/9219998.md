9219998 Murray In vitro methods will be used to study gap junction function and
gap junction gene regulation following treatment of cells with compounds known
to influence junction formation and to promote adrenal steroidogenesis.
Specifically, the effect of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), DbcAMP, forskolin, and
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (pKA) activity on gap junction expression will be
studied with gap junction cDNA clones. Y-1 mouse and SW-13 human adrenocortical
cell lines and primary cultures of adult rat adrenal cortical cells will be
used. Gap junction expression will be characterized and localized with
immunohistochemistry, western blot and northern blot analysis. Evidence of cell
communication will be obtained with Lucifer yellow dye transfer experiments.
Vectors containing cDNA antisense and antibody directed against gap junction
gene products (Cx43) will be introduced into cells to determine the effect of
inhibition of gap junction expression. The effect of over-expression of gap
junctions on adrenal cell function will be studied in cells transfected with gap
junction cDNA. These studies will give insight into the relationship of
junctional communication to the hormone response. %%% Gap junctions are
structures that connect cells to one another in certain tissues, in certain
stages of development, and/or during certain functional states. These structures
are pathways by which cells communicate by passage of chemical messengers. This
research will use techniques of molecular biology to examine the effect of
hormones on gap junction formation and function. The results of these studies
will increase our knowledge of how hormones affect the way cells communicate
with one another. ***
