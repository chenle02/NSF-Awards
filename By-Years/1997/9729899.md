This research is concerned with understanding the impact of redistricting on
legislative elections. The standard wisdom holds that redistricting has only a
minimal effect on elections; producing tiny changes in partisan gain or doing
little to protect incumbents. While a great deal of research has been undertaken
on this problem, the researchers argue that previous work has improperly modeled
the effects. Using a formal model of strategic redistricting, the PIs show that
a variety of actors, ranging from state legislators to state judges have
important effects on how redistricting lines are drawn. While this is well
known, they also show the conditions under when their strategic behavior will
have an impact on partisan gains and incumbent advantage. The researchers test
crucial features of their model by examining the array of redistricting changes
that occurred in the 1960's. This was a key period in American politics and has
often been associated with the rise of an incumbency advantage. The researchers
find that redistricting is an important strategic tool to change partisan
advantage and to protect incumbents.
