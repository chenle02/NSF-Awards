This award is in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode. The objective
of this project is the design of behavioral control techniques for a simulated
network of army ant robotic devices. The devices envisioned are small,
inexpensive, and identical mobile platforms which cannot transport material
individually, but can cooperate to lift and carry arbitrarily large objects. The
behavioral control approach seeks to minimize the complexity of the units and
the communications necessary by designing their collective function into their
group behavior rather than through individual performance. Each "ant" will be
programmed to respond to sensory stimulus with simple reactions. The collective
effect of many such reactions will be the desired maneuvering task, in much the
dame way teams of humans can transport heavy objects with minimal
communications. Sensory inputs necessary will include applied forces and the
attitude of the load being carried. The set of behavioral reactions designed
will be implemented in a computer simulation. The simulation will also model the
dynamics of the load, the force and attitude sensors, "beacon" signals emitted
by the units, and the possibility of uneven or rough terrain. The speed,
stability and accuracy of the material transport system will be evaluated in
order to further develop the controls and to suggest behavioral approaches to
broader army-ant problems, such as team-forming, reorganization, navigation, and
message-passing. The result of the work will be a paradigm for material
transport using modular networks of small machines as opposed to using large
robots to transport small objects.//
