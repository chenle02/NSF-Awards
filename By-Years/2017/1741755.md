The Russia-Japan-USA-Europe Symposium on Fundamental & Applied Problems of
Terahertz Devices & Technologies will take place on October 2-6, 2017 in Troy,
NY. It will address research areas in the field of interaction of THz radiation
with micro- and nanostructures and advanced solid-state THz emitters and
sensors. This conference will foster advances in the leading research on various
types of Terahertz technology, by gathering a diverse group of experts,
researchers and students. The Symposium will foster interactions between leading
researchers in USA, Japan, and Russia working in the area of Terahertz Devices
and Technologies. Topics cover THz emission and detection, THz devices and
electronic, optical components, THz physics and applications. There will be
invited talks and contributed presentations. Special attention will be paid in
attracting students and post-doctoral associates, and young faculty with special
emphasis to inviting women and members of the under representative minorities.
The highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide through the
