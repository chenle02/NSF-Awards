Escherichia coli transcription termination protein rho employs an RNA-dependent
ATPase activity to effect transcript release from paused transcription
complexes. The PI is studying the molecular mechanism of the rho ATPase reaction
using enzymological, biochemical, and molecular biological techniques, in order
to understand its role in transcription termination . The knowledge gained will
prove useful to the broader question of RNA-protein interactions and to the
understanding of energy-transducing ATPases. In the present proposal, studies of
rho ATPase activity are continued, and an investigation of rho-RNA interactions
is begun. RHO is thought to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move with
respect to the RNA chain of transcription complexes. Rho binds to this RNA and
releases it from RNA polymerase and the DNA template. The postulated mechanism
for such movement is the ATP hydrolysis- dependent binding and release of the
nascent RNA. From earlier work on rho-ATP interactions it is predicted that RNA
should bind to rho ATP complexes much more tightly than to rho ADP.Pi complexes,
and an experiment had been designed to test this prediction. To test whether rho
uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to travel with respect to RNA, Dr. Stitt and
co- workers have developed a system to measure the amount of ATP hydrolyzed per
RNA chain released. This system is being used in a normal rho-dependent release;
it will also be employed in a system in which an insert has been made between
the rho binding site and the end of the transcript. If rho used ATP energy to
travel along RNA, it should use more ATP in the system where it has to travel
further. The sites on rho of its interaction with RNA have only vaguely been
localized; RNA crosslinking experiments will be used to better define them. Rho
shows a requirement for RNA to activate its ATPase activity, although the DNA
poly(dC) binds as well to rho as the RNA poly(C). Mixed RNA-DNA oligonucleotides
of defined sequence will be used to identify the locations on RNA where the 2'OH
is critical for rho ATPase activation.
