"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will realize in-
situ visualization at extreme scale, and deliver a feasible data-understanding
solution to scientists whose work will rely on extreme-scale supercomputing,
such as those in the NSF PetaApps program. To make the in-situ approach
feasible, project will have to either transform existing visualization
algorithms or develop a set of new algorithms. These algorithms must be not only
scalable but also low cost. The proposed work will build on the PI?s prior
success and on-going effort in developing visualization algorithms and systems,
as well as his long track record of successful collaboration with application
scientists in a variety of areas. The PI directs the Institute for Ultrascale
Visualization, a 5-year project funded by the DOE SciDAC program to address the
data visualization challenges of petascale computing. The proposed project will
be able to leverage, in particular, the Institute?s research in scalable
parallel visualization and I/O. This leverage is crucial since it allows this
project to focus on application requirements, hardware capabilities/limitations,
integration, evaluation, and coupling with the simulation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The key impact anticipates is to achieve
is the demonstration of a working and attractive solution for scientists to
possibly comprehend the vast amounts of data generated by petacale
computing.PI's won?t have to store petascale data for validating, verifying, and
analyzing petascale simulations. This project will provide training for graduate
students in the area of computational science and high-performance computing.
The new algorithms and software tools developed in the project will be
disseminated through the annual visualization workshops and tutorials that the
PI has been offering to both the supercomputing and visualization communities.
