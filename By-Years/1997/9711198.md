Aller OCE-9711198 ABSTRACT From tidal flats to the deepest ocean trenches, the
surface sediments of the sea floor are zones of intense chemical, biological,
and physical activity. This intensity is due largely by macroscopic animals that
physically mix particles and cause interstitial water exchange during their
feeding, moving, and burrow irrigation activities. Such activity effectively
increases the effective surface of the seafloor several times more that it would
be if such animals were not present. The investigator in this project will be
organizing a scientific workshop to review the state of scientific development
of the field of "organism-sediment" relations and to assess future research
directions and technological developments. Participants will include sediment
geochemists, physical oceanographers, benthic biologists, ocean engineers,
sedimentary geologists and others who share a common interest in understanding
this most scientifically elusive boundary of the world ocean.
