The purpose of this research is to develop a sensor for the measurement of
dynamic high pressures. Existing sensors tend to be limited by high amplitude,
broadband electromagnetic noise endemic to the environments in which they are
used. The proposed sensor will use fiber optics to produce a low noise stress
dependent optical signal. The sensor is based on an electroluminescent emitter
combined with piezoelectric or ferroelectric materials. When stressed, these
materials produce a stress-dependent electrical charge. This charge is used to
produce an electroluminescent optical signal with a stress- dependent amplitude.
This signal is transmitted through an optical fiber to remotely located
diagnostics. This research will test several combinations of piezoelectric and
ferroelectric materials with electroluminescent materials and evaluate the
output of these sensors with various shock stimuli.
