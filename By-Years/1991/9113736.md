This the the second year base and first year match funding of a five year PYI
continuing award complex queries in future database systems is a major focus of
this work. The applicability of randomized algorithms for query optimization is
investigated or several types of database systems, e.g., relational, object-
oriented, and parallel systems. Emphasis is placed on identifying the abstract
characteristics of cost functions and data models that determine the
effectiveness of such algorithms. Of special concern is also the propagation of
errors in parameters that affect the query optimizer's decisions. This research
leads to developing techniques for query optimization in future systems where
current technology is inadequate. Another focus of this work is the study of
specialized database systems for managing data from scientific experiments. The
emphasis is on graphical user interfaces and semantic heterogeneity.
Collaborating scientists from many disciplines provide guidelines for the goals
of this effort based on the needs of their laboratories. This research develops
tools that enables such scientists to use database technology effectively for
their experiments. Although this work is driven by the specific needs of
scientific databases, its results can be applied to solve many similar problems
faced by next generation database systems in general.
