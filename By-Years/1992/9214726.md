The astronomical facilities at the University of Wyoming's Infrared Observatory
(WIRO) are to be renovated. Since its construction in the mid- 1970s, no major
renovations of the telescope facilities have occurred. Due partially to
equipment failure, and advancing technology, the WIRO telescopes no longer can
perform the wide range of functions that they originally were designed for.
Support will be used in three critical areas of infrastructure. First, the
antiquated, essentially non-functional on-campus telescope will be replaced with
a DFM Engineering 0.6 m telescope. Also, the 2.3 m telescope, the primary
research tool of WIRO users will be upgraded. The current, outmoded telescope
multiplexers will be replaced with industry standard, "off-the-shelf" IEEE 488
hardware. A modern pump station with a leak detector assembly for dewar
maintenance will be acquired, and the present dome shutter system will be
replaced with a modern, aerodynamic shutter design to improve the ability to
conduct observation during high wind conditions. The third area of emphasis is
an upgrade of the observatory computer facilities. The current set of PC-ATs
will be replaced with a SPARC workstation. Modernization of each component is
critically necessary for effective, integrated operation of the WIRO as a viable
training and research facility. Research emphasis for the renovated facility is
observational extragalactic and stellar astronomy, digital image
reconstruction/signal processing of astronomical images, and instrument
development. These broad fields are areas of shared interest among all the
astronomy faculty at WIRO and many of the physicists in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy.
