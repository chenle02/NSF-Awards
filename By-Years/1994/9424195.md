9424195 Guckenheimer Under this three-year program, undergraduate students will
investigate problems in a variety of areas of computational science research
under the joint guidance of Cornell University faculty member and members of the
Corand technical staff. While working on their research projects, students will
not only participate in scientific research but will also learn about
computational methods and receive training in high performance computing
techniques. The research projects will take advantage of the advanced
computational resources of the Theory Center including scaleable parallel
processing and visualization tools. The research experience will be enhanced by
the interaction among students from diverse institutions with multi-disciplinary
backgrounds and research projects. Building on long-standing relationships, the
project will aggressively recruit from historically black colleges and women's
colleges; it will also target those institutions which lack a strong research
orientation. Students at colleges and universities with otherwise limited
computational research resources will thus have the opportunity to undertake
significant reseapch projects as part of their undergraduate education. ***
