This three-year project is designed to improve the computational facilities at
the Institute for Scientific Computation (ISC), an interdisciplinary research
unit housed within the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wyoming.
ISC supports a variety of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers whose
research involves mathematical modeling, scientific computation, and scientific
visualization. Though certainly not a complete list, several examples of
specific research foci of investigators using ISC resources are the following: .
Migration and growth of biofilms in porous media; . Scale-up of stochastic,
heterogeneous medium properties; .New finite-element techniques for flow and
transport problems with reactions, heterogeneity,sharp fronts; . Domain
decomposition and multilevel schemes for flow problems with highly variable
coefficients;
