This award is for support of a glacial geologic, stratigraphic, and
geochronologic study of the limits and timing of Late Weichselian /Holocene
glacial and deglacial events on Franz Josef Land, Russia. High resolution
satellite imagery will be used to identify study areas; radiocarbon dating of
subfossils included in raised beaches of known elevation will provide
information on the timing and rate of glacial-isostatic uplift; stratigraphic
and sedimentological studies of glacial deposits will provide information on
provenance; and integration of field data with isostatic and glaciological
modeling will provide insight into glacial thickness, position of ice divides,
domes, and streams and possible response to sea-level rise. This study will
provide new data on Holocene and Late Weichselian glacial geometry in the
Russian Arctic where little data currently exists.
