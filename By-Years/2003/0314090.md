0314090 Ferguson A workshop on Engineering Concepts for Ballast Water Discharge
will be conducted over three days, probably in March 2003 in San Diego,
preceding or following the 3 rd International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions.
Researchers from the ongoing NOAA research program on BWT will present current
studies, and a Maritime Administration (MARAD) National Defense Reserve Fleet
vessel will be visited to illustrate ballast water operations and possibilities
for using NDRF vessels as in port tenders for BWT. Presentations about the range
of ANS and about microbial hazards to human health, fish and shellfish will lead
off two days of short presentations and breakout working groups on approaches to
BW management system and to BW treatment. The groups will develop research
issues and research needs in these areas, perhaps accomplishing prioritization
and research approaches for some technologies. A report will be prepared by the
PI, posted at the website for discussion, revised and submitted to NSF in the
summer.
