A number of important problems deal with functions that have a large number d of
variables. Sometimes d is in hundreds, thousands, or even unbounded as it is the
case in path integration. The classical algorithms are inadequate for such
problems since their costs increase exponentially fast with d. Moreover, under
the classical assumptions on the classes of functions, all algorithms are
prohibitively expensive since the corresponding multivariate problems are
intractable. This is why new assumptions and new approaches need to be devised
to guarantee an existence of efficient algorithms with much weaker dependence on
d. A significant part of the proposed research will concentrate on identifying
important tractable problems and deriving the corresponding efficient
algorithms. In particular, a significant progress in this direction is expected
for problems that have small effective dimension. Since the worst case
intractability of some important problems can be avoided by switching to other
settings, efficient algorithms will be studied also in the average case and
randomized settings. Positive results are expected here for problems defined
over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

Theoretical work will yield new and efficient algorithms for a host of important
problems that so far could only be solved for small number of variables. These
algorithms will be developed and thoroughly tested. Research results and
software will be promptly disseminated using various electronic digests, journal
publications, conference presentations, and a special web page. Although not
supported by this Grant, graduate students will be involved in the research and
algorithm development.
