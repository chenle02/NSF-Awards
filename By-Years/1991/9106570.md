The primary objective of this US-Bulgaria project between Dr. Alexander Ramm of
Kansas State University and Dr. Plamen Stefanov, Institute of Mathematics of the
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is to study several problems in applied
mathematics and classical analysis. In particular the researchers plan to
develop methods for the study of multidimensional inverse scattering problems
and inverse backscattering problems. The researchers' methods are based on the
concept of property C for pairs of formal partial differential operators. Data
will be studied within the framework of exact theory. The researchers plan to
develop several applications of property C to the theory of multi- dimensional
inverse problems. This project in applied mathematics and classical analysis
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
