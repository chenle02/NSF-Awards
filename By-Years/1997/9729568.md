In this project, the PI formulates game theoretic models to study the formation
and stability of networks, with applications to merger policy and the internet.
The research is inspired by possible applications of the theory that is being
build, rather than taking the theory itself as a point of departure. Insights
gained from the study of network structures in economic and social situations,
are used to identify specific types of networks and specific circumstances in
which networks play an important role. Additional structure imposed by
incorporating the institutional details of these situations are likely to
produce tractable models and policy-relevant results. The existing models of
(the formation of) cooperation structures are extended to encompass costs on
links in networks and to study situations in which there are externalities
between groups of agents. With the rapid evolution of the internet recent years
and globalization of the economy, it is apparent that networks have a major
influence on our daily lives. Recent research tackles the problem of modeling
cooperation structures from several different perspectives. However, interesting
problems remain that cannot be answered using the models and the techniques that
are currently known. These problems include mergers by Cournot firms and the
extension of the internet and the problems associated with this extension.
