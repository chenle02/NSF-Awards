The goal of this project is to expose undergraduate civil engineering students
to the wide variety of field test equipment they will be encountering in
geotechnical engineering practice. This training has not traditionally been
included as part of the undergraduate curricula at most universities, yet field
testing has as the primary design tools for geotechnical engineering firms.
Current industry needs are therefore dictating a change in the focus of
undergraduate civil engineering education. This change includes a greater
emphasis on interdisciplinary testing techniques. Engineers are relying on
geological and geophysical methods in conjunction with geotechnical field test
to conduct engineering surveys and determine design parameters. The equipment
was selected in an effort to expose students to some other tools most widely
used in current practice: a nuclear density device, a dilatometer, and
geophysical equipment (seismograph, resistivity meter and magnetometer).
Approximately 170 students per year will become acquainted with these new tools
through field exercises incorporated into three undergraduate civil engineering
courses.
