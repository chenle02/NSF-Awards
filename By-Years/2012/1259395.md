The University of Michigan is developing an integrated, holistic curricular and
co-curricular support system for students with high ability and potential in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) but who for reasons
associated with socioeconomic class, first generation college status, race,
gender, or rigor of high school background might not experience their full
potential for success at a highly competitive research university. The
University of Michigan STEM (M-STEM) Academy provides transitional academic and
social support for a selected cohort of approximately 50-60 students during
their first and second years in the College of
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The M-STEM Academy is grounded in well-
documented success strategies, developed by the Meyerhoff Scholars Program at
the University of Maryland Baltimore-County, for the retention and academic
success of diverse students. It expands upon the Meyerhoff model by transferring
the components to a large university setting and working with students who,
although-well qualified, have often struggled and not reached their full
potential in this environment. It partners closely with other University of
Michigan STEM education pipeline efforts such as the Center for Engineering
Diversity and Outreach, the Michigan Louis Strokes Alliance for Minority
Participation (MI-LSAMP) Program, and the Michigan Alliances for Graduate
Education and the Professoriate (MI-AGEP) Program to provide a seamless
continuum of STEM education and support services from grade school to graduate
school and the workplace. The M-STEM Academy is fully supported by the
University Central and College administrations in a continual effort to increase
the number and success of STEM students, with an emphasis on diverse students.
The assessment of the Academy by faculty in the Center for the Study of Higher
and Post-Secondary Education provides continual feedback for needed
modifications to the program as it is implemented.
