Since the arrival of people for the first time on the island of Madagascar at
about 500 A.D., there have been a startling series of environmental changes: all
of the island's largest native animal species -- primates, birds, land tortoises
and a pygmy hippopotamus -- have become extinct, forests have been reduced in
extent, other areas of natural vegetation degraded and there have been massive
increases in erosion and water run-off. This interdisciplinary project is an
attempt to understand the causes of this long history of environmental
degradation, and in particular to find out which precise human actions may be
responsible. The research is of relevance to other studies of the past --
paleoecological, paleontological, and archaeological, but it is also important
as a guide to future action. The results will be of critical value to those
analysts seeking to halt the ecological degradation in Madagascar and other
areas of Africa and the tropics, who need a solid base from which to prepare
effective environmental policies and programs.
