9357000 Bell The major goal of this work is to identify amino acids comprising
the substrate-binding/active site of OMP decarboxylase (ODCase) and to determine
how they participate in the catalytic mechanism. Specific objectives are: (1) to
examine the role of putative active site residues by changing these residues
using site-directed mutagenesis; and (2) to provide diffraction quality crystals
of the native and liganded OBCase for structural determination by x-ray
crystallography. %%% ODCase catalyzes the decarboxylation of OMP to UMP in the
last of six enzymatic steps required for de novo model enzyme because it shares
51% homology with the ODCase domain of the bifunctional UMP synthases from human
and mouse. Aside from its novel decarboxylation mechanism (which unlike other
decarboxylation reactions does not require a metal cofactor), this enzyme is of
interest because defect results in the genetic deficiency, orotic aciduria. ***
