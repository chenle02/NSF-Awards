This grant is for an international conference on active phenomena in solar
system plasmas to be held in Hong Kong on February 11-15, 1991. The goals of
this conference are to encourage the exchange of ideas, observations, and
theoretical models between scientists interested in earth and planetary
magnetospheric physics, and cometary physics. This conference will explore
common concepts such as reconnection, turbulence, and parallel electric fields,
and examine their roles in different environments.
