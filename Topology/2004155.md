The study of three-dimensional spaces, and knotted curves in them, is essential
to our understanding of large- and small-scale aspects of the universe. A
classification of these spaces will rest on a mathematical understanding of the
possible shapes they can take and the rigidity and flexibility properties they
can have. These properties are known as invariants and they come from algebraic,
analytic, and geometric considerations, often with crucial input from physics.
The proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture established that three-
dimensional spaces, called manifolds, decompose into pieces that admit explicit
geometries. In the last few decades, ideas from quantum physics have led
mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of subtle invariants and structures
of three-manifolds and the knotted curves contained in them. There are several
open conjectures, both in physics and in mathematics, that predict deep
relations between quantum structures and geometries of three-manifolds. This
project will investigate the relations of these quantum invariants to the
geometric structures arising from Thurston's picture and explore the
ramifications and applications of these connections to mathematics and physics.
The project also provides topics for graduate student research.

The project will combine geometric and quantum topology techniques to study the
interplay of geometry, topological quantum field theories (TQFT), and
combinatorial structures of three-manifolds, with an eye towards developing
tools to tackle open conjectures in quantum topology. One part of the project
will continue work around the Turaev-Viro invariants volume conjecture, and on
the geometry of quantum representations of surface mapping class groups. The
goal is to understand the extent to which asymptotic features of TQFT detect or
determine the existence of hyperbolic pieces in the geometric decomposition of
3-manifolds. A second part of the project will study relations between the
colored Jones knot polynomials, the topology of incompressible surfaces in link
complements, and hyperbolic geometry. A third part will develop methods for
recognizing geometric structures on three-manifolds from purely combinatorial
input and derive estimates on geometric quantities from topological data. This
includes the study of low-genus incompressible surfaces in certain link
complements and the understanding of how knot diagrammatic properties and
constraints affect the geometric structure of link complements.
