0235548&lt;br/&gt;Sundaresan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control of cell division
is an important feature of development in multicellular organisms. In higher
plants, both the timing and the plane of cell division are regulated and
responsive to developmental cues. Although there are extensive studies showing
that the cytoskeleton is important in executing the decision to divide in a
predetermined plane, there is little information on the underlying molecular
mechanisms. A mutation in Arabidopsis called tormoz (toz) has been identified,
in which longitudinal divisions of the embryo are randomized. The mutant embryos
arrest but can be rescued to generate seedlings which have severe morphological
defects. The predicted TOZ gene product appears to have a close homolog in every
sequenced eukaryote from yeast to humans. However, the function of the TOZ-
related proteins has not been previously studied in any species. The role of the
TOZ gene product in cell division and development in Arabidopsis will be
investigated. First, the toz mutant seedlings will be used to examine how plant
development has been affected by the mutation, including the extent to which
patterning, and cell specification have been perturbed by the defect in cell
division planes. Second, studies of toz mutant cells will be undertaken to
determine possible functions of TOZ in the organization of the plant
cytoskeleton for mitosis and cytokinesis. Third, the intracellular localization
of the TOZ gene product during cell division in Arabidopsis will be studied to
generate clues to the mechanism by which it may be involved in the control of
division plane. Fourth, we will attempt to identify putative interacting
partners of TOZ in order to gain further information on the molecular mechanism
by which the TOZ protein executes its function. These studies will help to
understand the control of cell division in plant development, and may add to the
knowledge of cell division in animals and fungi. The project includes training
of students and postdoctoral fellows and minority participation.&lt;br/&gt;
