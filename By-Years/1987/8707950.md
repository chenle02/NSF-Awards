The purpose of this research is to analyze the macroeconomic consequences of
small frictions in the setting of prices and wages. Two types of frictions will
be considered: small costs associated with changing prices and wages and the
fact that not all wage and price changes occur simultaneously, but are staggered
over time. This research is important because these frictions may provide the
heretofore missing micro-foundations of the Keynesian model of macroeconomic
fluctuations. Specifically, this project will investigate the possibility that
rigidities in real wages and prices increase the magnitude of cyclical
fluctuations and that the reductions in average welfare are caused by costs
associated with changing nominal prices. Further, the relationship between price
stickiness and models of Keynesian coordination failures will be explored. With
regard to staggered price-setting, the study will investigate the reasons why
such staggering occurs and what the adverse affects of such price setting may
entail.
