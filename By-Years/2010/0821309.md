This award will permit the addition of a large, shared-memory, multi-processing
computer to the computing facilities for JMU
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The machine purchased with this grant will
initially&lt;br/&gt;be used in the following research
problems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptographic Hashing Algorithm. An
algorithm is ready for immediate parallel implementation and testing. The final
result will be submitted to the NIST cryptographic hashing algorithm
competition.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;N-body Integration Software. An algorithm
with exceptional accuracy and low computational cost awaits parallel
implementation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Stability of NonlinearWaves. Applicable to
the study of ocean dynamics and propagation of information in optical
fiber.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Parallel Multi-Precision Linear Algebra Library.
Bringing the functionality of parallellinear algebra libraries like ScaLaPack to
discrete mathematics computations that require thousands, millions, or even
billions of bits of precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parameter Recovery. Of
fundamental importance in porous media simulation.&lt;br/&gt;
