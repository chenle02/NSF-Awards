Between 10% and 40% of the Vanadium and Uranium entering the modern ocean as
dissolved river input is eventually buried in sediments overlain by anoxic
bottom water. Previous work by Dr. Mix and his colleague Dr. Emeron from the
University of Washington has found that concentrations of V and U in foram tests
have varied over the last 150 Kyrs. Provided the assumption is true tht formas
incorporated these metals in equilibrium with seawater, this preliminary data
suggests that bottom, water during the last glacial period was more oxygenated
that at present, and that between Atlantic and Pacific bottom water was
substantially different from that of today. In this renewal award the PIs will
to continue their research in several directins: 1) they will perform culturing
experiments with collaborator Dr. Erez in Israel to determine the uptake
patterns of V and U in live forams; 2) they will improve solid source mass
spectometry techniques for measuring V and U in single species of forams; and 3)
they will apply these techniques to refine the history of anoxia in the world's
oceans since the last interglacial
