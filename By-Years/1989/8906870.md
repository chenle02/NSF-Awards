This award supports the research in Combinatorics and Operations Research of
Professor Peter Hammer of Rutgers University. Dr. Hammer's work centers on the
study of pseudo- Boolean functions, which typically associate a number to each
subset of a finite set. Applications in science are numerous; to name a few
applications, this work has implications for minimization as in VLSI design, and
Ising spin glass models and neural networks in physics. The specific goal of
this project is on the one hand to gain a better understanding of pseudo-
Boolean functions, with an emphasis on the construction of a coherent theory,
and on the other hand to develop the compu- tational mathematics of these
functions, accompanied by the implementation of efficient codes and by numerical
experi- mentation. This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics,
which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally,
Combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical
activities, counting. In its modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone
beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical
techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had
an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in
communications and information technology.
