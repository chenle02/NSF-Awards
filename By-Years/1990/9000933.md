The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
theoretical and computational chemistry between Slobodan Bosanac of the Rudjer
Boskovic Institute and David A. Micha of the University of Florida is to
continue their investigators of the fundamental properties and structure of
complex metal atom clusters. They are planning to investigate energy transfer in
atom-cluster collisions and the vibronic structure of metal clusters. Dr.
Micha's mathematical methods utilizing time correlation functions and quantum
mechanics will be tested further in cooperation with Dr. Bosanac. This award
adds an international dimension to Dr. Micha's NSF grant on theoretical methods
of quantum molecular dynamics. His research has relevant applications relating
to properties of materials and behavior of electronic devices. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav
institution. NSF's goal to advance scientific knowledge will be promoted through
the joint efforts and complementary expertise of the Yugoslav and U.S.
scientists.
