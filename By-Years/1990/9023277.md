Professor Devlin is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study icy thin films and clusters, including crystalline
ice, amorphous ice and acid hydrates using infrared spectroscopy. The data
acquired will enhance our understanding of natural processes such as nucleation
and growth of icy particles in the atmosphere, the molecular-level processes at
ice surfaces that lead to charge separation in electrical storms, and proton
conductivity across and along biomembrane-water interfaces. The influence of
surfaces, interfaces and intense near-infrared radiation on point-defect
activities (ionic: hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, and orientational: L and D) of
hydrogen-bonded solids will be examined in icy thin films and clusters,
including ice I, amorphous ice, acid hydrates and clathrate hydrates. Fourier
transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies will be used to monitor isotopic
exchange rates for samples containing nonequilibrium quantitites of protium and
deuterium isotopomers. These experiments will take advantage of a technique
recently developed by Devlin based on observations that the absorption bands of
OH groups that dangle from the surfaces are distinct from the OH groups which
are involved in hydrogen bonds. These methods will be applied to the evaluation
of the hypothesis that phase transitions of icy substances are critically
dependent on the availability of mobile orientational defects.
