This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the "Fifteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 20-22, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual
conference, of which the 2012 meeting will be the fifteenth in the series,
celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by
focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial
differential equations. The 2012 program will feature two principle speakers
(Panagiotis Souganidis and Antonio Cordoba), each of whom will give a two-hour
lecture, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by young
mathematicians (Thomas Alazard, Giuseppe Mingione, Gabriella Tarantello, Rachel
Ward). The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the
participants.
