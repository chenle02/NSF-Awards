This project will undertake the development of a database of ground
magnetometers which will be utilized to extend the nonlinear state space
reconstruction technique to include spatially resolved predictions and
validation. The objective of this work is to produce quantitative regional
predictions of geomagnetic activity through the assimilation of ground based and
satellite data. The validation work needed to transition the research algorithm
will be undertaken and the near real-time results of the algorithm will be
available via the WWW.
