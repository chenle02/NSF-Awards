Algebraic combinatorics is an area of research that seeks to build connections
between discrete structures and algebraic objects, with broad applications in
computing, statistics, biology, and other subjects of mathematics. A central
theme in combinatorics problems is to organize discrete data in a way that
reflects key structural properties, thereby making it easier to analyze. This
project applies the tools of algebraic combinatorics to study solutions of
complicated systems of equations, called algebraic varieties. The PI will
develop sophisticated counting techniques to streamline computations and
decipher patterns in otherwise complex data. The PI then will use geometric
properties of algebraic varieties to uncover new approaches to unsolved problems
in algebra and combinatorics. In addition this project also provides research
training opportunities for graduate students.

The specific research addressed in this project concerns the combinatorial and
geometric structure of Hessenberg varieties and extended Springer fibers.
Hessenberg varieties are subvarieties of the flag variety whose cohomology rings
encode rich algebraic structure. The PI will use topological data obtained from
Hessenberg varieties to outline a new approach to the long-standing Stanley-
Stembridge conjecture in combinatorics. The geometry and topology of Hessenberg
varieties is completely understood in only a few cases. Using combinatorial
invariants and an affine paving, the PI will characterize geometric properties
of Hessenberg varieties. Graham has defined an analogue of the Springer
resolution, called the extended Springer resolution. The PI will use the fibers
of this map to develop a new geometric framework for the generalized Springer
correspondence, transforming the usual approach to this seminal work.
