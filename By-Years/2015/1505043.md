Most nuclei are unstable and have limited lifetimes. Understanding the structure
of nuclei far from stability and defining the limits of the heaviest elements
has been an exciting challenge and has led to the production of nuclei with as
many as 118 protons using both hot and cold fusion techniques as well as
radioactive beams. This award will use the multi-nucleon transfer technique to
synthesize new actinide nuclei. The investigators will also measure the
properties and production mechanisms of the heaviest nuclei to understand the
nature and behavior of these nuclei, and to assist theoretical predictions for
the stability, structure and production of super-heavy elements. The project
will contribute to the education of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.
The training of scientists in nuclear and radiochemistry fulfills a well-
articulated, frequently stated national need, the re-vitalization of nuclear and
radiochemistry.

There are three phases of the research: (a) to investigate the use of multi-
nucleon transfer (MNT) reactions in the region near 208Pb to test models of
these reactions and to make new nuclei. These investigations are to be done with
thick target experiments at Gammasphere (136Xe + 208Pb and 136Xe, 238U + 198Pt).
In the former experiment, one is making a unique rigorous test of the Zagrebaev
and Greiner formalism for treating MNT reactions while the latter reactions deal
with the best way to make N=126 nuclei (b) to study the production of lower Z
actinide nuclei testing current models of MNT. This will involve the
identification of 15-30 alpha-emitting nuclear products from the 132Xe + 233U
reaction by in-beam spectroscopy and off-line analysis and a study of similar
products from the 192Os + 197Au reaction and (c) to study the production of
exotic neutron-rich actinide nuclei at the limits of stability using transfer
reactions such as 136Xe+ 248Cm and 232Th + 248Cm. Several new n-rich isotopes of
Fm, Cm, and Cf will be produced.
