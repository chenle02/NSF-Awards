This project will study the structure and ecological variability of naturally
occurring populations of the brewer's and baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and its sister species Saccharomyces paradoxus. In preliminary work, the
principle investigator (PI) has shown that both of these yeast species are
widespread in natural woodland environments, where they are found in association
with oaks. The PI's laboratory has established a large collection of both
species from such habitats in the midwestern and mid-Atlantic United States. In
the current project, further collections of both species will be carried out at
vineyard sites in the same regions. DNA sequence data and standard
microbiological methods will then be used to characterize geographic patterns of
genetic variability, inbreeding, and ecological variability in these organisms
for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the
most important organisms in basic and applied genetic research. Study of its
genome has greatly accelerated genomics in other higher organisms, including
humans. Surprisingly, however, we know little about the ecology and evolution of
S. cerevisiae in nature. This project will answer fundamental questions about
the population biology of yeast in nature and will provide a basis for future
research integrating evolution, ecology, and genomics using yeast as both a
laboratory and a field model organism.&lt;br/&gt;
