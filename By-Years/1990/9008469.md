Two problems in dislocation dynamics are under study, tunneling of a
dislocation (how it occurs) and a dislocation model for martensite phase
transformations. In both cases detailed ultrasonic measurements are employed to
examine the structural changes that occur during the process. The first part is
an attempt to define the conditions under which tunneling of dislocations
through pinning points can occur in dilute superconductor alloys as a function
of impurity segregation to dislocations. If definitive evidence of tunneling is
found, it can be used to test current theories of the effect of viscosity on
tunneling of macroscopic systems. The second part is an attempt to obtain
parameters for a detailed dislocation model for the martensite transformation in
cobalt, which involves a change from the face-centered cubic structure to
hexagonal close-packed structure. In this research ultrasonic measurements are
ideally suited for examination of the mechanisms involved because of the
sensitivity available for small structural changes, the discrimination possible
from polarization dependence measurements, and the fact that the technique
measures dynamic aspects of dislocation behavior.
