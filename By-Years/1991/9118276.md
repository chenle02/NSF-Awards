The principal investigator will make a series of experimental measurements
relevant to multicomponent diffusion in anhydrous silicate liquids. The aims are
to document the diffusive coupling of melt components, to provide a database for
diffusion models, and to attempt to determine melt species. The results will be
used to model crystal growth from magmatic liquids and to construct more
physically realistic configurational entropy models for such liquids.
