educational institutions and industry, and a strong working partnership with
CICNet, the state of Illinois Central Management Services (CMS), and with
considerable networking experience within its member shop, has developed a
communications network known as netIllinois. NetIllinois request support to

(Barat College, College of Lake County, Columbia College, Eureka College,
Heartland Community College, Illinois Wesleyan University, John A. Logan
College, John Wood Community College, Kaskaskia College, Milliken University,
Parkland College, Prairie State College, Quincy University). The requested
connections will support connectivity to netIllinois, CICNET, NSFNET, and the
greater Internet. It will also provide access to state, regional, and national
computing resources and databases; and foster communication and collaboration
among teachers, students, scholars, and researchers at these institutions and
their peers within the worldwide education and research community. The network
will provide a consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET access for a broad
variety of entities engaged in education and research. This cooperative network
will provide gateways to regional, national, and international networks and will
be consistent with their standards. It will further the institutions' work in
enhancing the state's economic development through a well-educated workforce,
accessible training opportunities, and research and development partnerships.
Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing
of resources between institutions, including those outside the state. ***
