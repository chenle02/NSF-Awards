Investigations of non-yrast spectroscopies and electromagnetic moments of
nuclei in high-spin states or far- from stability are being planned at several
laboratories: Argonne, Livermore, Yale, Rochester, and Notre Dame. Experiments
carried out with both heavy and light projectiles will concern the onset of
collectivity in Te and Po nuclei, non-yrast degrees of freedom in Hf nuclei,
statistical transitions following fusion reactions, prompt decay of fission
fragments, shape isomers around A=190, the structure of light actinides, and
heavy-ion induced two-neutron transfer reactions. Magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole moments will be measured with a variety of standard and developing
technologies involving transient magnetic fields, multi-tilted foil assemblies
designed to polarize the nuclei under study, and beta-NMR detection systems.
These studies are geared to fully utilize the existing Rochester mass separator
and the New Fragment Mass Analyzer being built at Argonne (ATLAS).
