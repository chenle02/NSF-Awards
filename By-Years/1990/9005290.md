Fatty acid synthesis is required for several diverse roles in plants including
an essential housekeeping function in the synthesis of membranes in every cell,
and specialized developmental and organ-specific functions in the production of
seed storage oils and surface protective waxes. The long term goal of this
project is to understand how plants regulate fatty acid biosynthesis at both
biochemical and gene expression levels to meet these diverse roles. This
research provides information on three fronts: 1. Identification of the rate
determining/regulatory steps which provide short term control over rates of
fatty acid synthesis. 2. Examination of the structure, organization and
regulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) genes is to be done using acyl carrier
protein (ACP) as a model. 3. Evaluation will be made of the possible
physiological role of multiple ACP isoforms by over-expression of their genes
and antisense inhibition of their expression in transgenic plants. In addition
to their major role in the structure and function of all cell membranes, plant
fats represent a vast renewable resource. Annual world production of plant oils
is approximately 60 million metric tons with a value of more than $20 billion.
In the U.S., about two-thirds of all plant oil is consumed by humans and
animals. In the American diet, plant oils have gradually tended to replace
animal fats and now accout for 15-20% of total calories consumed. In addition,
plant oils are employed in the manufacture of a range of specialty products
including lubricants, plastics and detergents. Despite the major economic and
nutritional significance of plant fats, there has been comparatively little
research into the regulation of their biosynthesis. This research investigates
the expression of certain genes required for fat synthesis by plants as well as
points of metabolic control in one specific case.***//
