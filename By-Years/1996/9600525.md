9600525 Buechtemann This research project uses the opportunity of a new
projection facility in the United States by Mercedes-Benz to examine questions
of the basic skills and aptitudes of the US labor force for manufacturing jobs
and the role of the systematic worker selection for high performance
manufacturing. It examines the role of the formal workforce training and
apprenticeship school and business partnerships in generating the human capital
pre requisites and technical skills base for modern production systems. Also it
examines the transferability of elements of the German "dual" apprenticeship
system for high level technical training to the US and the need for their
adaptation to the specific US social environment; and the selection of workforce
for highly technical training. The analysis will be conducted between 1996 and
1998 and will involve collection of quantitative and qualitative empirical
information of the new production site in Alabama and from regional education
providers and also from comparable sites of the parent company in Germany. Thus,
the analysis plan is longitudinal (follows teams) and cross-national
comparative. This project is part of a large research effort to study the
technological, organizational, and human resources of the creation of a local
capability base for high performance manufacturing work settings. ***
