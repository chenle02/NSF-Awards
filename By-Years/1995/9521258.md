9521258 Kastner Kastner will develop Nd isotopes in marine barite to trace
fluctuations of water masses. This technique should be useful in understanding
the development of water masses and their movement during glacial-interglacial
cycles. This research should also lead to an understanding of what depth barite
forms in the water, which has been a puzzle for some time. This is important
because barite in sediments has been used to indicate the productivity of the
surface waters. ***
