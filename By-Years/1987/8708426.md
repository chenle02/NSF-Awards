Dr. Greer plans experimental measurements to test the applicability of
statistical mechanical models originally developed for magnetic phase
transitions to cases of equilibrium polymerization reactions. In particular, she
will test the predictions of the theory for the phase equilibria, the heat
capacity, the density, and the viscosity, of sulfur and of various so-called
living polymers (certain organic molecules which show reversible
polymerization). She also plans to study the kinetics of these polymerization
processes for comparison with computer simulations being done by other workers.
The scientific interest in the general class of so-called living polymer systems
is widespread. It includes analytical theory, computer simulations, and
laboratory experiments such as Dr. Greer is carrying out. Her work promises to
strengthen the intellectual linkages between modern phase transition theory and
chemical kinetics and reactivity. It is important as an outstanding example of
the essence of the scientific enterprise: the seeking of the most general
paradigm of the physical world.
