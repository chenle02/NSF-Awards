The Cedar Point Biological Station is operated by the University of Nebraska
for grassland research. The Station is adjacent to mixed prairie, sandhills
prairie, sand-sage prairie, and short grass prairie, and adjoins a reservoir on
the North Platte River. Several hybrid zones occur in this area of habitat
transition. Dr. Anthony Joern, Director of the Station, plans construction of a
research laboratory building in which biochemical analyses can be conducted.
This building would replace an 11-year old trailer, and would expand the
analytical activities at the site. Cedar Point is well-supported by the
University of Nebraska, and the Station is facilitating research by a rapidly
growing number of investigators. The Station has established important research
collaborations with the NSF-supported Long-Term Ecological Research Site at
Kansas State University, and the new laboratory building is essential to the
analyses involved in this research. Prairie-based research is important to
agriculture and to our understanding of global change and biodiversity. The
proposed lab construction will enhance research in both of these areas.
