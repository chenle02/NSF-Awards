This award will provide support for two undergraduates working under faculty
supervision of mathematical problems arising in the theory of control, design
and simulation of linear dynamical systems. The mathematics of differential
equations and matrix theory will be central to these investigations. Problems
will be selected from studies on the stabilization of linear dynamical systems
by output feedback, control design and simulation for Euler-Bernoulli beam with
Kelvin-Voigt Damping, computation of Bezout fractions, computation of the gap
metric and polynomial control for discrete linear control systems. The two
students are University Scholars at the Penn State, University Park, campus who
will be working at the Wilkes-Barre campus (where they completed their first two
years' studies).
