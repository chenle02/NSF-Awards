9605046 Reddy This award provides support for a joint workshop on high
performance concrete including marine structures organized by Professor D.V.
Reddy of Florida Atlantic University and Dr. B.V. Rangan of the Curtin
University of Technology, Perth, Australia. The primary focus of the workshop
will be to highlight recent advances in the United States and Australia on the
use of new supplementary cementing materials such as fly ash, silica fume, slag,
and natural pozzolans, and fibers to increase the durability of concrete. The
factors considered will be 1) materials and design, 2) loading, 3) structural
details, 4) environmental considerations, and 5) constructional techniques. The
U.S. team will include four junior investigators and six senior researchers. The
workshop will be timed to coincide with the International Conference on the
Durability of Concrete in Sydney. This will allow the American team to interact
with leading researchers from the East Asian region as well as from around the
world.
