The Hillsboro School District, working in partnership with Portland Community
College, has developed an excellent precollege program called "Engineering Prep"
that can serve as an effective precursor to A.T.E. programs in semiconductor
manufacturing. This project supports replication of the Engineering Prep
Program, locally and nationally, through the publication of curriculum
materials, faculty enhancement workshops to equip high school teachers and
community college faculty to implement the curriculum in their communities, and
follow-up consultancies to each implementation site. Disseminable products will
include a curriculum guide and classroom-ready instructional materials to teach
the Engineering Prep Program. These products, combined with the teacher and
faculty enhancement workshops, will enable quicker implementations of precollege
programs for associate and baccalaureate degree programs in semiconductor
manufacturing and related engineering programs.
