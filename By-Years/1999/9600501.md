96------ VanDecar This U.S.-Mexico Planning Visit will provide travel support to
Drs. John C. VanDecar and Sean C. Solomon of Carnegie Institution of Washington
so that they may participate in project SAMPLE Jalisco (Seismic Analysis of
Micro-Plate Evolution, Jalisco, Mexico). This project will provide understanding
of fundamental scientific questions which concern the evolution of the Jalisco
area, as well as other plate boundaries. The Jalisco area at this particular
time will act as a natural laboratory to study the forces that have shaped the
west coast of North America in its transition from subduction to transform
motion. The collaborator on the Mexican side, Dr. Gerardo Suarez at Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, is being supported by NSF's counterpart agency,
CONACYT. Both sides will place seismometers in the field, return periodically to
service the network, and finally, analyze the data. ***
