This award provides for the development of flow cytometric techniques and
instrumentation for the analysis of large cell (10 to 50 microns in diameter),
principally plant cell protoplasts. The emphasis will be on development of
digital pulse processing modules for real time analysis and sorting. The
development of novel substrates and gene expression systems for use with
transgenic plants will also be explored. Finally, these techniques will be used
to select populations of transgenic plant cells expressing developmentally
regulated genes as a first step in the construction of tissue specific-DNA
libraries.
