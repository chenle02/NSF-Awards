Variations in trace element distributions at mid-ocean ridges have often been
used to constrain parameters such as melting source compositions, depth and
degree of melting, and size and shape of source regions. Traditional trace
element models assume some model of the melting process that, in general, do not
include either the physics of magma migration or trace element transport. The
purpose of this research is to investigate and quantify to what degree
observable trace elements to varying parameters such as flow regime, sensitive
is the behavior of trace element distribution can distinguish between different
potential mantel processes. The behavior of arbitrary initial trace element
distributions can be calculated for a range of physically consistent models
governing the flow of melt and solid in the mantle. The following questions will
be addresses. How sensitive is the behavior of trace elements to varying
parameters such as flow regime, degree of melting, source characteristics,
porosity/permeability structure? Can these parameters be recovered from trace
element distribution observed at the surface? What are the errors in the
parameters recovered using more traditional melting models?
