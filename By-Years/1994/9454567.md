Project Monterey Advanced Technology Education (MATE) is uniting educational
institutions (grades 9-16-university) and cooperating science-related agencies
in a consortium to design a marine, environmental, and global change ATE Center
at Monterey Bay, CA. The goal of providing better educated science and
engineering technicians is made possible through the proposed alliance of local
institutions and scientific agencies that surround Monterey Bay. These human and
technological resources, aligned with the unique bioresources of Monterey Bay,
provide for the development of an articulated, technologically enhanced and
thematic environmental science education program including curriculum,
instructional strategies, and products serving as a model for replication and
national dissemination. Project MATE is providing for a program formulation
session in order to identify courses, products, technology, and resources to be
merged, aligned, designed, and developed for the planned ATE Center. MATE is
producing a blueprint for systemic change relative to the new articulated
curriculum and instruction utilizing the resources of the environment,
scientific, industrial and business communities of the Monterey Bay area. This
project is planning to implement a nationwide model for a technologically
enhanced and articulated marine, environmental and global change science
instructional program that will produce science and engineering professionals.
