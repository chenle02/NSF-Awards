ABSTRACT The principal investigators propose to study a new technique to
enhance convective heat transfer from hot surfaces. Arrays of concave
indentations will be created on the surface to induce higher rates of heat
transfer. This concept was first mentioned by Russian scientists at an
international conference held in 1995. The Russian scientists conjectured that
tornado-like bursts resulting from flow over the concavities were responsible
for the enhanced heat transfer. Preliminary experimental measurements by the
principal investigators did show enhanced heat transfer, but not the presence of
tornado-like bursts. The proposed work will include comprehensive experimental
measurements using the transient liquid crystal technique to establish the full
effects of concavities. Three-dimensional numerical simulations using a finite-
volume based computer code will be carried out to reveal the flow behavior.
