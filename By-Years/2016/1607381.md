This award supports work to understand neutrinos: the smallest but most common
massive particle in the universe. Although there are a billion neutrinos for
every more well-known electron or proton, neutrinos interact only via the so-
called "weak" force: so they rarely bump into anything, even the detectors
designed to study them. That means they are also the least well understood of
the fundamental particles. Work at Univ. of Minnesota Duluth studies neutrino
interactions with normal matter, how they change or "oscillate" as they travel
along, and the astrophysical sources of neutrinos. The intellectual merit for
this proposal is the that these experiments will bring us to further knowledge
of three critical parameters needed to understand neutrinos: the determination
of the neutrino mass hierarchy, or how the masses of the three neutrinos relate
to each other, improved measurements of the mass-squared difference of the three
masses and mixing parameters that determine how the three alternate with each
other, and vastly improved measurements of neutrino cross sections.

Faculty and students working on the NOvA experiment will further the oscillation
measurements and are working toward first astrophysics results. The effort
includes enhancing the ability for NOvA electronics to self-detect the neutrino
burst from a potential galactic supernova and share that alert with the world-
wide supernova detection network. Neutrino interaction measurements continue
with existing and incoming data from the MINERvA experiment. Finally, the group
is pursuing work toward the next generation experiment, DUNE, including roles in
the data acquisition system, design of the near detectors, and the role of
neutrino interaction uncertainties in the design sensitivity of the experiment.
This grant also supports broader impacts via participation and leadership of the
Soudan + NOvA outreach program, which includes regular summer tours of the
Soudan Underground Laboratory and the NOvA detector at the Ash River, MN site.
