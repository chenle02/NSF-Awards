Microrobots less than a millimeter on a side have many potential biomedical
applications, including cell manipulation, endoscopy, microorganism studies,
targeted drug delivery, cancer therapy, and numerous medical procedures. This
project addresses the problem of orienting a free-floating microrobot in three
dimensions -- that is, the problem of simultaneously pointing each of three
mutually perpendicular edges of the robot in a specified direction. In
traditional applications such as spacecraft this is done, for example, using
spinning wheels mounted on the body. However traditional approaches are
currently infeasible on the submillimeter length scale. This project will
demonstrate microrobots capable of precise orientation control using a novel
arrangement of vibrating mass actuators. Such microrobots have the potential to
transform invasive medical procedures such as endoscopy, micofabrication, and
targeted drug delivery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of this project is
to demonstrate 3-axis orientation control of a microrobot with onboard
actuation. This multidisciplinary project requires advances in noncommutative
orientation control theory and microfabrication. Noncommutative orientation
control is a new approach to orientation control that takes advantage of the
noncommutative property of rigid-body rotations. The control technique generates
noncommutative rotations using moving-mass actuators to generate a rapid
sequence of positive and negative torques about 2 of the body-fixed orthogonal
axes. This sequence causes zero net rotation about those 2 body-fixed axes,
while causing a nonzero net rotation about the remaining orthogonal axis. Unlike
traditional attitude control technology such as reactions wheels and control
moment gyros, noncommutative orientation control can be implemented at the
microscale. This project also aims to advance the state-of-the-art in
microfabrication by combining lithography-based microfabrication and micro-
origami self-assembly.
