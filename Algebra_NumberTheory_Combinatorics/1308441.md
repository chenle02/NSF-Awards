This project tackles several open problems related to ``maps'', that is, graphs
embedded in surfaces. Maps appear naturally in many active areas of research
including computer science (for encoding meshes of surfaces), algebraic
combinatorics (for studying factorizations in the symmetric group), statistical
mechanics (as host of a model), and probability (as a discrete approximation of
the random surfaces needed in quantum gravity). In the last decade, building on
works by Schaeffer, a bijective approach was developed for several classes of
maps. Typically, the bijections obtained give a correspondence between a class
of maps, and a class of (decorated) plane trees. Because trees are easier to
study than maps, bijections have been key to the solution of several open
problems on maps coming from combinatorics, probability theory and theoretical
physics. In this project, the P.I. intends to (1) Unify several bijections: this
would simplify a review on the bijective approach to maps, and systematize, to
some extent, the process of finding bijections. (2) Extend bijections to planar
maps with boundaries and to maps of higher genus: this would satisfy some
algorithmic needs and might inform recent results from representation theory.
(3) Apply a bijective approach to statistical mechanics models on maps: this
could provide new models and help understand how metric properties of maps are
affected by the Boltzmann probabilities imposed by these models.

The P.I. will actively mentor undergraduate research students and, more
generally, foster the mathematical curiosity of young students. The
combinatorics of maps is an ideal subject for initiating undergraduate students
to research as it requires only a limited mathematical background but can lead
to very rich problems. Moreover, the visual nature of maps gives many
opportunities to convey mathematical ideas to a young audience during talks. The
P.I. also plans to write a review article which would serve has an entry point
for non-specialists willing to learn the bijective approach to maps. Such a
survey is particularly needed because maps appear at the frontier of several
research communities. The bijective approach to maps has practical applications
in computer science. Indeed, maps are the combinatorial structures underlying
the meshes of surfaces, and this creates a need for efficient coding algorithms.
Bijections between maps and trees are the basis of the most efficient coding
algorithms to date. Thus, extending bijections to new classes of maps is likely
to improve the coding methods for the corresponding meshes. Other possible
byproducts of bijections are random sampling and drawing algorithms for meshes.
