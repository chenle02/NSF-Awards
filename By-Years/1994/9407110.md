Current available testing methodologies have not been widely or productively
utilized in industry for several reasons, including such factors as deadline
pressures, necessity of a large initial investment in software and hardware,
impracticality of methodologies, or inability to work with embedded systems.
This project addresses one testing issue which has been problematic for
industry: embedded systems. The inherent multiprocessing in embedded systems
makes them particularly difficult to test. For example, each instrument control
and display may be implemented as its own thread of execution. Testing all
possible interleavings quickly results in a combinatorial explosion. Code
complexity directly contributes to these combinatorics. One approach for
handling complexity is through abstraction. This research seeks to develop a
testing strategy based on state pools and constraints. Contraints represent
relationships that must be maintained between objects. By treating these
relationships as atomic units, execution granularity can be increased, reducing
the number of interleaved execution paths. With the cooperation of an industry
partner, application to production systems is being explored.
