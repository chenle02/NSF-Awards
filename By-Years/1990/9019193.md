This research is a continuation of a study to investigate the hypothesis that
variations in normal stress across a fault surface are a primary factor
controlling stick-slip behavior in laboratory simulations and in earthquakes.
The hypothesis has been suggested on the basis of recent work on stick-slip
behavior in foam rubber and, if true, will have a major impact on current ideas
about rupture nucleation and the characteristics of premonitory slip. The
existence of normal vibrations during stick-slip has implications for rupture
mechanics, fault behavior, and short-term earthquake prediction. This research
is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
