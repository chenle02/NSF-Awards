9512055 Smith This award supports the preparation and publication of four issues
of China Exchange News (CEN) over a two year period. CEN is a quarterly
publication which provides information on scholarly developments in China,
research access and opportunities for US researchers, and general information on
science and education policies and institutions. CEN has been published since
1972, and serves a wide audience of readers, many of whom are not familiar with
China but who wish to pursue research collaboration in China. Despite the
proliferation of contacts between the US and Chinese scientific communities, the
development of initial contacts, research plans, and joint projects is still a
daunting task for scientists who have not worked previously with Chinese
colleagues. CEN is noted for serving a vital function for the US scientific
community and for performing an invaluable service in fostering international
research.
