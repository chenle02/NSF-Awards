This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University to
acquire a high resolution graphics system for 3-D visualization. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas that include visualization of peptide
and protein structures, quantum chemical wavefunctions and electron densities,
classical electrostatic fields, and molecular dynamics simulations of polymers
and dense fluids. A workstation network of fast , modern computer workstations
is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a
`computer network` also serves as a development environment for new theoretical
codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and visualization
facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel
processing.
