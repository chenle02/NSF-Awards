This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. Deep arrays for measurement of earthquake
response are essential to improve the current capability to predict the motion
amplification in deep clays, and to predict the liquefaction of sands. The
establishment of such arrays is consistent with the recommendation of the recent
NSF-sponsored workshop on designated test sites for geotechnical experimentation
in the United States. The objectives of this pilot study are to gather
information necessary for the selection of sites where arrays of instrumentation
for earthquake response could be permanently installed. An integral part of this
study is to review all information available from the Loma Prieta earthquake and
other previous events in the San Francisco Bay area to assist in selecting the
most suitable candidate sites in the San Francisco Bay area for implementation
of the arrays. Of special interest are all field geotechnical data acquired
after the Loma Prieta earthquake which will further help the selection process.
Necessary steps include visiting and surveying the potential sites and
initiating the steps that are necessary to ensure long-term availability of
these sites. The final goal is to recommend sites and areas within the selected
sites for the establishment of seismic recording stations in the San Francisco
Bay area.
