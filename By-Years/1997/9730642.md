Syracuse University The proposed research will focus upon globalization and
urban restructuring in Accra, Ghana and Mumbai, India. The project entails
parallel studies of both cities on the extent and ways that the urban economies
have become articulated within the international economy. The empirical analysis
will assess globalization through several specific measures, identify the nature
of national economic liberalization policies in both countries, and trends on
urban restructuring in both cities. The methodology will utilize the comparative
intensive case study method and will take advantage of both qualitative and
quantitative analyses. The project will generate new understanding about the
impact and force of globalization on the urban developing world as evidenced by
these two cities.
