9602935 Fauchet This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Dr. Philippe Fauchet, University of Rochester, and Dr. Julia
Taguena, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. The objective is to
investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the properties and device
applications of silicon/polymer nanocomposites. Theoretical methods developed by
the Mexican side to predict the electronic and optical properties of multiphase
materials within an effective medium framework will be applied to
silicon/polymer nanocomposites. Using porous silicon as the starting material,
optical and transport measurements will be performed by the U.S. side on the
nanocomposites to ensure a close fit between the theoretical calculations and
the experimental results. Composites form a recently-developed class of
materials with unusual optical properties. The modeling and production of such
nanocomposites provide many opportunities for materials and devices with
enhanced properties that may find application in optoelectronic devices. ***
