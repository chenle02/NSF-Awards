This award provides renewed support for the Natural Hazards Information Center
at the University of Colorado. The Center serves as a research clearinghouse and
provides channels of communication between producers and users of research on
natural hazards. The Center furthers the dissemination of information to such
potential users as researchers, practitioners, and government policy makers and
managers through several activities. An annual hazards research workshop is held
at the University of Colorado with participants from the research and user
communities. The Center's bi-monthly newsletter, the "Natural Hazards Observer,"
highlights results from research projects and hazard mitigation programs and is
distributed to several thousand persons. The Center also publishes a monograph
series on hazards research topics. During the next 12 month period, the Center
will continue its dissemination program. It will also support modest projects,
including quick-response field investigations, that will produce results that
will be disseminated to relevant researchers.
