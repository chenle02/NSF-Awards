Abstract ATM 97-25142 Druyan, Leonard M. Columbia University TITLE: Regional
Climate Model Studies of the Sahel Summer Climate This research is a
continuation of earlier successful research with a previous NSF grant. This
study proposes to investigate Sahel climate processes using models (The FSU
regional climate Model and the NASA GSFC GCM) and Observations ~CEP reanalysis).
Areas explored will include African Wave disturbances, their synoptic and
mesoscale features and their relationship to the Sahel droughts, SST anomalies,
and landscape heterogeneity. A successful conclusion of this study will help to
understand the processes at work for the Sahel climate and will assist
forecasting of Sahel climate.
