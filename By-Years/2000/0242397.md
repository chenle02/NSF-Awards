Continual data streams are a generalization of continuous data streams due to
two major factors: (1) irregular data bursts and (2) the need to integrate all
kinds of data and metadata, instead of pure time series or multimedia. Continual
data streams naturally have a trade-off between performance scalability
properties and system survivability properties. On the one hand, survivability
requires increased redundancy since node and network instability inevitably
renders parts of the system unavailable. On the other hand, scalability requires
a decrease in data redundancy, to reduce update and propagation costs. This
inherent trade-off between survivability and scalability is a major research
challenge due to the irregular arrival and integration of continual data
streams. The project will investigate the approaches that span the spectrum
between absolute consistency guarantees for replicas in traditional replication
on one extreme and by-chance consistency/zero guarantees for cached copies in
traditional proxy caches on the other extreme. Formally, this approach is based
on the notion of bounded inconsistency such as Epsilon Serializability. The main
technical idea is to keep the distance between a replica and the original to
within the specified threshold (to handle bursts) while optimizing the
performance scalability and integrating heterogeneous data streams.
