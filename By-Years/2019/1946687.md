In child maltreatment investigations, testimony from fresh complaint witnesses
(persons to whom children disclosed abuse) informs a broad range of
investigative and legal decisions and provides triers of fact with a window into
the credibility of children’s allegations. Despite the importance of fresh
complaint testimony to child maltreatment investigations, currently there are no
guidelines for interviewing adults who receive children’s disclosures. This
project will develop the first set of recommendations for conducting
investigative interviews with fresh complaint witnesses.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an ethical experimental approach involving children
and their parents, PIs will examine strategies for maximizing parents’ ability
to report on a conversation with their children related to various levels of
inappropriate behavior. Parents will be questioned about that conversation
either with an interview modeled on current police investigative practices or
with an interview that uses a context reinstatement strategy to enhance recall
for conversational and contextual detail. Comparison of the accuracy of the
testimony elicited by the traditional approach and the use of context
reinstatement will inform interviewing practices and help investigators
interpret inconsistencies between children’s testimony and the hearsay testimony
of the fresh complaint witnesses who receive the children’s disclosures. Project
results and recommendations will be shared with scientists and forensic
professionals, local and federal law enforcement agencies, and national policy
groups in order to improve the reliability of evidence and testimony by
integrating evidenced-based and theoretically driven recommendations into formal
investigative practices. Deidentified project data will be publicly archived for
secondary data analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
