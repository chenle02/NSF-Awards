This Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high field FT-NMR spectrometer with
13C and 1H resonance capabilities for use in the improvement of the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum. A particular effort is made to integrate the
theory learned in formal courses with the undergraduate student research
program. The basic principles and practice of 13C and 1H FT-NMR spectrometry are
first introduced in the sophomore Organic Chemistry Laboratory courses where
students personally use the new instrument to determine organic structures. The
junior- senior laboratory courses (Physical Chemistry, Analytical Biochemistry,
and Instrumental Analysis) center on the technical aspects of fourier transform
methods and the applications of 13C NMR alongside 1H NMR spectroscopic
techniques for quantitative measurements of chemical systems. Specific NMR
experiments include the determination of equilibrium constants, thermodynamic
properties, pka values, and substituent constants; and studies on enzyme
kinetics, stereospecific reactions, hydrogen exchange rates, and reaction
mechanisms. The use of the 13C/1H FT-NMR spectrometer also enhances the quality
and quantity of student independent research which is an important component of
the curriculum.
