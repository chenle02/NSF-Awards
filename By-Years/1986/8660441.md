This is a recommendation for an award to support research on developing a
practical and inexpensive sensor for radon gas. Current approaches to radon
measurement provide little information on factors contributing to concentration
fluctuations over periods of time. These factors include seasonal variations,
weather changes, utility usage and structural changes to the enclosure being
monitored. The monitor, subject of this project, will utilize commercially
available microchips that will be adapted for use as radon sensors by applying
adsorbing coatings to de- lidded devices. The proposal leading to this
recommendation was submitted in accord with NSF 86-19, Small Business Innovation
Research. This proposed work has objectives consistent with those of the Program
in Environmental Engineering and the investigators have qualifications
appropriate for the work to be done. Award is recommended in the amount of
$40,000 for six months starting on February 1, 1987. This will be for Phase I as
described in NSF 86-19.
