This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of California at San
Diego provides funds for developments that will improve the capabilities of
eighty ocean bottom seismometers operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography
as part of the NSF-funded national Ocean Bottom Seismometer Instrument Pool. The
seismometers will be outfitted with rechargeable battery packs, radio beacons
for location during recovery, and Ethernet cards with flash memory to improve
data downloading, and reduce noise and power consumption. The award is supported
by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. Scripps Institution will provide cost-
share support from non-federal funds for more than 30% of equipment
costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
