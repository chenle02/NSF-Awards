The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) is investigating the
impact of statistically derived semantic word relationships on information
retrieval. Exploiting these relationships, for example, by identifying when
different words express the same content can lead to more effective rankings of
retrieval results. Semantic relationships are not labeled explicitly in text and
are too varied to be identified solely by hand. The CIIR is mining massive
corpora for direct and indirect word co-occurrence data using both offline and
retrieval-time computation. The particular focus is on techniques that create
and use Web-based corpora of "comparable" sentences and text chunks for
estimating word and phrase translation probabilities, and on techniques that
derive relationships from "context vectors" that represent word and phrase
meanings. The quality of the word relationships that are discovered is being
tested using large-scale retrieval experiments. In addition, the CIIR is
addressing computational barriers to large-scale data mining by moving its new
distributed computational framework, TupleFlow, to Hadoop. That framework was
developed for the type of indexing and analysis operations that are required for
large-scale studies of relational structure in text. TupleFlow is an extension
of MapReduce, with advantages in flexibility, scalability, disk abstraction, and
low abstraction penalties. This work is expected to have broad impact by
improving the quality of search results.
