Event-driven software (EDS) spans multiple domains, from industrial embedded
devices and robotic controllers to web interfaces. Researchers experimenting
with new software testing techniques for EDS do not have benchmarks that they
can use to compare their techniques. This project investigates the requirements
for a community infrastructure of event-based testing researchers to provide
uniformity in experimentation. It uses the results of the requirements analysis
to develop a preliminary prototype called COMET: COMmunity-Event-based Testing.
COMET will consist of a core set of requirements for EDS testing that provides a
repository of both logical and concrete test artifacts. This includes processes
and models to standardize the way experiments are conducted as well as on- line
web services for common computational components. Techniques developed in this
project will have a broad impact: COMET has the potential to bring EDS testing
techniques to a broader community and will promote greater transferability of
ideas. Artifacts for EDS testing will be available to other disciplines such as
computer human interaction researchers who are interested in EDS usability.
