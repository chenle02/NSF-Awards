This award is to purchase a workstation, video production hardware and software
to support research in areas of analysis and presentation of experimental fluid
and granular flow, visualization and mathematical analysis of pattern formations
and spatiotemporal chaos in large domains, visualization of solid modeling, and
photorealistic animation of chemical reactions on surfaces. The effectiveness of
large-scale numerical simulation problems in computer science and the natural
sciences are dependent on high-speed computation and increasingly sophisticated
visualization techniques. Duke University will be establishing a high-quality
facility for the support of scientific visualization with emphasis on computer
animation, for use by faculty in computer science and the natural sciences.
