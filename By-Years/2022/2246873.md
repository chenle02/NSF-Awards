The project will mostly focus on symmetry groups of certain mathematical
objects. Two examples of such objects are: a space with a measure and a generic
generalized curve. The interest in these objects and their symmetries originates
in classical mechanics and in geometric topology, respectively, but they will be
investigated using methods coming from a variety of mathematical fields. The
interaction of these fields is of independent mathematical interest. The project
involves graduate student training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will tackle
problems on the boundary of Descriptive Set Theory, or more broadly, Logic,
Ergodic Theory, and Topology. A precise analysis will be made of closed groups
generated by measure preserving transformations. Topological dynamics of the
homeomorphism group of a certain canonical continuum, called the pseudoarc, will
be investigated. Combinatorial properties related to Ramsey theory of a class of
maps of $n$-dimensional simplex will be explored. These diverse themes will be
tied together by a point of view coming from Mathematical
Logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
