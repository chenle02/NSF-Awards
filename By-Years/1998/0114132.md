This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the
acquisition of a SQUID magnetometer will enable students and researchers at
Northeastern University to study the physics, chemistry, and engineering of new
materials and structures. The multiuser instrument from Quantum Design (model
MPMS) has the capability of measuring magnetization and AC susceptibility in
magnetic fields to 5 T, from 1.9 to 400 K. It has high sensitivity (10-8 emu)
required for measuring small MBE-grown samples. The instrument will be used for:
(i) student education in electronics courses; (ii) characterizing the synthesis
of improved ferromagnetic semiconductors; (iii) investigating magnetism and
superconductivity in molecules, low-D materials, magnetic oxides,
semiconductors, and ferrites; and (iv) training in materials science research.
Students will perform and analyze most of the
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Instrumentation

a SQUID magnetometer enables students and researchers at Northeastern University
to study the physics, chemistry, and engineering of new materials and
structures. The multiuser instrument has the capability of measuring the
magnetic properties of novel materials with high sensitivity. The instrument
will be used for: (i) student education in electronics courses; (ii) studying
the properties of materials for future "spintronic" and "quantum computing"
applications; (iii) investigating superconductivity and magnetism in molecules
and semiconductors; and (iv) training in materials science research. Students
will perform and analyze most of the measurements. The intellectually
challenging and technologically important projects could strengthen our
knowledge base and impact future device technology&lt;br/&gt;
