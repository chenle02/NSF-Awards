9311465 Rovelli Research in theoretical gravitational physics will be concerned
with the use of new variables to describe both classical and quantum phenomena
in gravity. These new variables give rise to a great simplification in obtaining
solutions to the equations of general relativity, and could lead to a better
understanding of quantum gravity. Such an understanding is important in an
elucidation of the fundamental forces of nature. ***
