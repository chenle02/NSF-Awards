This grant supports a mathematical research institute during the summer of 1996.
This institute will be the forty-third in a series planned with the purpose of
bringing together a group of mathematics interested in a particular field of
mathematical research. Emphasis is placed on instruction at a very high level
with seminars and lectures by distinguished mathematicians in related fields, to
promote interaction between participants while broadening their mathematical
perspectives. "Cohomology representations and actions of finite groups" has been
selected as the topic of the 1996 Summer Research Institute by the 1994 AMS
Committee on Summer Institutes and Special Symposia. The 1996 Institute will be
held in San Diego, California. It is expected to be held during a three-week
period in July/August, 1996.
