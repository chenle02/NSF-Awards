The investigator has already demonstrated that a predatory fish, the bluegill,
can approach and attack an artificial prey specimen even when it is not visible.
When the bluegill's lateral line sense was chemically blocked it still
approached the "prey" but did not attack. This suggests that the otolith organs
of the inner ear are involved in the animals responses to prey in the water
nearby. In this project the phenomenon is being studied in more detail. In one
series of experiments the prey is simulated as a moving sphere and in another
the bluegill will simply be exposed to a series of low frequency vibrations in
the water similar to those that a prey animal would set up. The results will
clarify the relation between the lateral line and inner ear sensory systems in
fish. This, in turn, bears upon the evolution of vertebrate hearing. It is
generally believed that hearing evolved as a mechanism of detecting sound waves
originating some distance away; this work may provide evidence that it occurred
first as a means of detecting nearby vibrations and later adapted to sound
detection.
