Though all mantle plume basalts are wetter than MORB, recent work by the lead PI
has shown that basalts associated with mantle plume components containing
subducted lithosphere (EM-type) are less wet ("damp" plumes) than those
associated with a common mantle or mildly-HIMU source (wet plumes). The likely
explanation for this depletion is that water is efficiently extracted (&gt;92%)
from the lithosphere during the subduction process. Under this award the PIs
will test and refine this hypothesis by (1) expanding the existing data sets to
include H-, D-, and O-isotopes and Cl concentrations; (2) characterizing H2O,
CO2, and Cl concentrations and stable isotopic compositions (H-, C-, and
O-isotopes) of different mantle components as sampled by oceanic island and mid-
oceanic ridge basalts (MORB) north of Iceland and within the Foundation Seamount
Chain; and (3) developing box models to help understand the temporal evolution
of water in the mantle, the origin of FOZO, and the regional heterogeneity in
MORB water concentrations.
