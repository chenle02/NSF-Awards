This project is to research the synthesis of two classes of materials. The first
is biominerals, in particular, calcium carbonate, a well defined model in
biomineralization studies. The objective here is develop systems for the control
of crystal size and morphology. The biomimetic environments selected are those
that exert spatial and structural control of mineralization. Reversed micelles
and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films will be used. In addition, the role of proteins
that regulate mineralization through geometric and stereochemical lattice
matching will be investigated. The second class of materials is semiconductor
nanoclusters of zinc and cadmium sulfides and selenides. Synthesis will again be
approached through the use of reverse micelle environments. Control in-situ is
to be carried out by a novel approach using clathrate hydrate formation, and
this project will examine the effects of hydrate formation on particle size and
structure.
