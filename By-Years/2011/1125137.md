Dr. Cynthia M. Friend of Harvard University is supported by the Chemical
Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to chair a workshop on defining
critical directions for the future of chemical catalysis. The workshop will be
co-chaired with Dr. Hector D. Abruna of Cornell University and Dr. Melanie S.
Sanford of the University of Michigan. The workshop will draw together a diverse
group of established and emerging leaders in catalysis in order to articulate
the grand challenges and future directions in this area of research. The
workshop will address the role of catalysis in advancing the national need for
sustainability. Chemical catalysis plays a central role in energy, such as in
the production of renewable fuels, manufacturing, such as in the synthesis of
chemical, pharmaceuticals and materials, and environmental sustainability, such
as in carbon dioxide conversion, pollution control and remediation. The workshop
proceedings and conclusions will be disseminated to the scientific community
through a website and a workshop report.
