Abstract: In this project, Ross plans to investigate the shift operator (i.e.,
multiplication by the independent variable) on various spaces of analytic and
harmonic functions. Specifically, he plans to look at the lattice of invariant
subspaces of the shift operator on the Hardy space of a "slit domain" in the
complex plane. Invariant subspaces of Hardy spaces on other types of domains
such as the disk, the annulus, and "crescent" domains were examined by Beurling,
Sarason, Hitt, Aleman, Richter, Olin, and Yakubovich. Ross also plans to look at
the 1 and 2 invariant subspaces of the (formal) shift operator on spaces of
harmonic functions on the disk (e.g., the Bergman and Dirichlet spaces) and, in
particular, to examine (via duality) how complications in one space are realized
in the other.

This work combines two fields of mathematics, harmonic function theory and
operator theory, both of which stem from classical problems in physics (such as
heat diffusion and electrostatics) which are still active areas of research
today. It is the hope that a better mathematical understanding of the functions
and operators involved will shed new light on the physical processes themselves.
Investigations of the mathematics generated by the above physics problems goes
back to 18th and 19th century mathematicians such as Fourier, Dirichlet, Kelvin,
Weierstrass, and von Neumann and continues today with ground breaking work of
mathematicians from all over the world.
