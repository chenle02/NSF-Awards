Technical Description: This research project focuses on the development and
understanding of a new approach for fabrication of semipolar III-nitride
structures for light emitting diode (LED) applications. The method is based on
stripe patterning of c-plane GaN templates and deep-groove etching, followed by
sidewall re-growth to form semipolar facets on which InGaN/GaN quantum wells are
grown. The dominant lateral growth modes are expected to result in a
significantly reduced dislocation density. The LEDs based on the semipolar
materials should benefit from a reduced polarization-induced field and enhanced
indium incorporation, and are regarded as a promising solution of the "green
gap" problem in the nitride LED technology. By employing a variety of structural
and optical characterization, the research team studies the preferential
faceting formation and dislocation reduction for different patterning methods as
well as the growth kinetics for different semipolar facets; the indium and
doping-element incorporation efficiency in different directions in lateral
growth regimes; the strain and internal quantum efficiency in structures with
different semipolar alignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description:
The knowledge gained from this research project can be of significant importance
for establishing a design of low defect-density, cost-efficient InGaN/GaN
quantum-well structures with semipolar alignment, and for guiding technological
development of light emitting diodes with improved internal quantum efficiency
in blue-green region. The research activities leverage the PIs' previously
established national and international collaborations. The project provides
training of graduate students by exposing them to comprehensive, application-
motivated academic research through curriculum development, guest lectures and
seminars. The project intends to involve and support women and underrepresented
minorities, as well as high-school students conducting summer science research.
