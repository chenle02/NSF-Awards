The principal investigator will carry out theoretical and experimental lattice
dynamical studies of aluminium and magnesium silicate materials, with a view
towards the determination of thermodynamic properties from their atomic
vibration characteristics. The dynamics of phase transitions in anorthite and in
enstatite also will be investigated. This work should result in a better
understanding of the links between the microscopic characteristics and the
macroscopic behavior of these materials.
