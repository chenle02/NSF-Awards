0100754&lt;br/&gt;Alexander&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial
funding for U.S. ocean scientists, particularly those in the academic research
community, to participate in the activities of the North Pacific Marine Science
Organization (PICES). This organization was established in 1992 to promote and
coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance knowledge of living
marine resources, land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem
components and processes, resource usage, ocean response to global weather and
climate change, and human impacts in the North Pacific. Members presently
include Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States.
Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual Meetings, scientific committee
working groups and workshops, will also be funded through this award.
