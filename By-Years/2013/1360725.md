The objective of this project is to conduct a rigorous "proof of principle"
experimental test of coherent perfect rotation (CPR), which is a first example
of a hermitian (thus reversible), multiport, 100% quantum efficient optical mode
conversion process. Hermitian "coherent perfect" processes are a generalization
of the antilaser (coherent perfect absorption, or CPA that combines wave
interference with a (sufficiently large) time reversal symmetry breaking
transport process. The PIs have shown theoretically that CPR can optimize the
optical efficiency and contrast in many optical devices including cavity-based
laser frequency locks, opto-magnetic sensors, and optical
modulators.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The theory of CPR is
relatively complete, simple and subtle. As a general result of linear optics,
CPR provides useful insights into optimizing optical systems with components as
ubiquitous and prosaic as beam splitters and cavities. This understanding of
fundamental symmetry (time-odd optical elements) combined with coherence may be
used to improve select non-linear optical processes as well. Verification of CPR
will be a first step in the extension and diffusion of this methodology for
improving optical design and devices.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Because this research illuminates the use of fundamental
symmetries and coherence in optimizing quantum efficiency, experimentally
verifying the method is of value for a broad array of optical devices and
protocols, and may ultimately inform commercial optical
design.&lt;br/&gt;Testing CPR will involve mentoring a postdoc and undergraduate
physics and engineering students, through their inclusion in the Photonic,
Electronic, and Optical Materials (POEM) research group at YSU.&lt;br/&gt;Their
participation will include extensive, novel laboratory work, co-authorship of
scientific publications (for some of the students it will be their first peer-
reviewed scientific publication) and presentation of research findings at
national meetings. The PIs have a proven record of successful and effective
post-doc mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have long-standing commitments to science
education in northeast Ohio through YAPA (a teacher outreach program active
since the 1970's, initiated during the PSSC era) and the Ohio Section of the
American Physical Society (OSAPS) and the regional American Association of
Physics Teachers (AAPT). The PIs will use activity generated by this research
support in outreach by promoting public interest in science and exciting younger
students about the innovative careers opportunities in technical fields
(primarily Physics and Electrical Engineering).
