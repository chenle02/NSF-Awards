99743430&lt;br/&gt;Bates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns the dynamics
of both spatially discrete and &lt;br/&gt;continuous but non-local evolutionary
systems. In particular, we are &lt;br/&gt;concerned with the existence,
stability, and variety of spatial patterns in &lt;br/&gt;interacting and
reacting systems which exhibit threshold behavior. Not &lt;br/&gt;just
stationary patterns but also those which evolve in a predictable way.
&lt;br/&gt;The systems of equations arise in the field of computational neural
&lt;br/&gt;networks designed to perform specialized tasks such as automatic
image &lt;br/&gt;recognition. They also arise in population dynamics, in models
of phase &lt;br/&gt;transitions, in models of the primary visual cortex of the
brain, and in &lt;br/&gt;computer simulation of a wide variety of continuum
processes where &lt;br/&gt;discretization is the standard approach. Results from
the project will have &lt;br/&gt;a direct impact on the understanding of
computational experiments and on &lt;br/&gt;the assumptions on which the
mathematical models of many physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena
rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From one perspective, the project explores some of
the basic challenges of &lt;br/&gt;present day material science: The modeling of
processes which cause and &lt;br/&gt;accompany change of phases or crystalline
variants of a substance. New &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models are being
continually proposed, with the hope of &lt;br/&gt;shedding insight into the
basic physics of these processes. Successful &lt;br/&gt;modeling can offer help
in the development of new high performance &lt;br/&gt;materials, which is vital
to economic and other national interests. From &lt;br/&gt;another perspective,
the theoretical study of neural networks will lead to &lt;br/&gt;the development
of automatic pattern recognition, useful in such widely &lt;br/&gt;diverse areas
as text analysis, target identification, and image
&lt;br/&gt;enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;
