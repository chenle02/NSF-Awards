The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the San Diego Supercomputer
Center (SDSC) propose acquisition of the first commercial MTA system. The
salient features of the Tera MTA multiprocessors are: -high-speed GaAs
processors, -its multi-threaded architecture (hence MTA), which should allow
more concurrency and thus higher processor efficiency, -an interconnection
network scalable to hundreds of processors, -shared memory with its convenient
programming model and broad applicability, -a sophisticated compiler for
automatic parallelization. This system will be made accessible to researchers
and educators nationwide for production computing and computer science
experimentation. In addition, local researchers will evaluate performance of the
MTA a from both systems and applications perspectives.
