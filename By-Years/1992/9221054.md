As regional and national networking infrastructure matures, so does the work
force needed to operate and maintain it. New network operations centers (NOC)
personnel must digest information about a perplexing mixture of devices and
software for monitoring, updating, and maintaining the network and reporting the
necessary statistics. This document proposes production of a videotaped course
built on the foundation of experience gained during the past year in which the
OARnet engineering staff carried out ongoing classroom training in network
operations. A workbook will also be compiled and will accompany the videotaped
instructions. Training will greatly increase productivity and the ability to
take on more responsibility for complex network monitoring and problem solving.
