This campus of Texas A &amp; M is the marine and maritime special purpose
undergraduate institution in the university system. A basic understanding of and
familiarity with modern oceanographic acoustic instrumentation is essential to
the education of its students. The acquisition of sonic detectors and sonar
equipment (seismic boomer, hydrophones, recorders, fathometer, etc.) is
necessary for the study of marine stratigraphy and sedimentation, field methods
in the marine sciences, geological and physical oceanography, exploratory
geophysics, and coastal erosion and evolution. The equipment is being
incorporated in courses within several departments, and greatly extends the
number, scope, and variety of undergraduate research projects. The equipment
provides state of the art instrument expertise appropriate for marine and
maritime careers. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
