This NSDL Services project is developing networked middleware to facilitate and
expand access to the content and services of the NSDL through the existing
national infrastructure of traditional libraries and their service programs.
Additionally, the collaborative project team is creating a reference model for
integrating the NSDL into traditional library services; evaluating the utility,
usage, and impacts of the local library tested services on the participating
campus communities via web log analysis, focus groups, and usability studies;
and disseminating results and facilitating growth of the network among an
expanding group of institutional partners. By stimulating an extensible
framework for networked peer-to-peer interoperation among the NSDL and
traditional libraries, this project is also advancing the dialog between
librarians and researchers.
