This three year grant is to Professor Frederick Lobkowicz, University of
Rochester. The award is for continued work on Fermilab experiment E706 and on
the Fermilab "DO" experiment to be run on the Tevatron Collider. Experiment E706
uses a liquid argon calorimeter (LAC) to measure energies of "direct" photons
(photons emitted directly from QCD process as distinguished from photons from
neutral pion decay). This experiment will produce clean measurements of several
important QCD subprocesses. DO is a major experiment at the Tevatron Collider;
it will use a LAC for hadron and photon calorimetry. Both of these experiments
use high energy collisions to probe the structure of matter at sub-nuclear
distance scales. Experiment E706 studies photons produced in collisions in which
the strong "chromodynamic" force dominates. The DO experiment will make a
general survey of ultra-high energy collisions with the capability of almost
complete detection of everything that happens in an individual collision.
