This award provides partial support for renovations of an existing building to
expand laboratory space available for staff and for visiting students and
researchers at the Archbold Biological Station. The renovation will convert
existing attic space in the Station's main building into 6,000 sq. feet of space
devoted to new open-plan laboratories, storage space, small offices and informal
meeting areas. The renovation will also increase access to the computer network,
and improve building infrastructure with new insulation and upgraded air
handling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities at Archbold focus on a
distinctive natural ecosystem, the Florida scrub, that has dry, sandy conditions
and that is subject to frequent natural fires. Studies range from genetics of
rare species to landscape-scale analysis of the effects of fire on species
distribution and on ecosystem processes. In addition to its research programs,
the Archbold Station has active programs aimed at informal science education,
including a nature trail, guided tours of the Station conducted by volunteer
docents, and public seminars. &lt;br/&gt;
