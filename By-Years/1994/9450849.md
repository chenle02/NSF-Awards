9450849 Gale \A powerful microcomputer-based computer algebra system such as
Maple V is a resource for calculus teaching that can enhance students'
understanding of fundamental concepts, enable students and instructors to do
realistic applications, and ameliorate the ongoing decline in the number of
students pursuing technical degrees. To maximize these benefits the CAS must be
incorporated smoothly into each class session in such a way that students can
see how the program is used, and can use it themselves whenever need or
opportunity arises. To this end, the Department of Mathematics of the University
of North Carolina at Asheville is teaching calculus in a combination
classroom/computer laboratory. A classroom is outfitted with 19 Macintosh
Centris 650 computers, an In Focus System 6000 LCD projection panel, and some
networking hardware and software. The calculus computer classroom (not a
laboratory) enables smooth transitions between lecture/discussion and computer
explorations. This classroom enables the mathematics faculty to teach calculus
courses in an innovative way and creates a model for math departments initiating
changes in their own curricula.
