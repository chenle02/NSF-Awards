This project is conducting planning activities for the development of a model
curriculum based on an existing program at Evergreen Valley College. The
envisioned curriculum will integrate new technologies such as GIS, GPS, CADD and
computer-aided math into civil engineering technology. Design constraints
envisioned include an expandable certificate program that includes all course
descriptions, textbooks, assignments, lab activities, and fieldwork.&lt;br/&gt;
