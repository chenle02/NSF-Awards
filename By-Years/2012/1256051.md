This multi-year (2012-2016) proposal is for continuation of WHOI?s management of
the Fleet Broadband (FBB) Satellite Communication program for up to 70 UNOLS
research ships, special platforms, and OOI platforms. The project has been on-
going since 2008 and is currently supported by a five year contract from 2010 ?
2014 between WHOI and satellite communication providers Inmarsat, Stratos, and
World- Link. Current scope of services include: 102 GB of data per month, voice
services, antenna procurement, maintenance and repair and application support,
and administration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal
impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure
support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in
support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually
undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
