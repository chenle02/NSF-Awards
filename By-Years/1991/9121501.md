It is proposed to conduct research on the design of robust output feedback
control of a class of nonlinear systems. The class of systems to be considered
is the class of input-output linearizable systems, which arise in many
applications such as robotic manipulators, aircraft control, and electric
machines. The design procedure starts with the design of a robust state feedback
control followed by the design of a robust observer to recover robustness
achieved with state feedback. The performance of such observers are usually
hindered by difficulties due to measurement noise and excessively large
transient response. A recent result by the principal investigator has shown
that, for the special case of fully linearizable systems, the undesirable
transient behavior can be eliminated by designing the feedback control to be
globally bounded. This proposal aims at developing a comprehensive theory for
the design of globally bounded output feedback controllers. Problems to be
investigated include tracking, disturbance rejection servomechanisms,
robustness, comparison of various state estimation schemes, and study the effect
of measurement noise.
