This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
three key components necessary to incorporate Dimension Technologies Inc's
(DTI's) proprietary ultra high resolution display technology into head mounted
systems for virtual reality applications. To be commercially viable, the
technology must provide additional resolution without tradeoffs in key areas
such as visual performance, size, weight and field of view. The objective of
this Phase I will be to assess the feasibility of applying DTI s increased
resolution technique to leading edge HMD products. Three main areas will be
investigated. The first is the design of an array of compact, bright, rapidly
flashing colored light sources. The second is the optical design to efficiently
direct light from the light sources to a light valve and then to the user's eye
with maximum brightness and even light distribution. The third area will be
means of configuring and fabricating flat, precisely formed microlens arrays. .
If successful, virtual reality displays will be capable of generating images
with near eye limited resolution across a wide, immersive field of view.
Products resulting from this research will expand markets for virtual reality
systems in many markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology could find initial
use in small scale, moderate budget, or tight quarters simulation or public
exhibit applications where high end VR systems are now used. In the longer term,
as the capabilities of PCs increase, consumer products for games and other
recreational activities will incorporate the technology.
