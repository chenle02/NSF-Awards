Genomic/Proteomic/Metabolomic "Omics" approaches contribute increasingly to the
systems-level interrogation of fundamental biological processes. In addition,
live-cell imaging, quantitative microscopy, and the computational infrastructure
allow for phenotypic analyses at unprecedented scales. The objectives of this
conference is to (1) provide an opportunity for show-casing cutting-edge "Omics"
scientific advances; (2) motivate the traditional molecular/cell biology,
biochemistry and genetics community to embrace the "Omics" resources and to
adopt an integrated systems approach to solve complex biological problems; and
(3) foster opportunities for networking and establishing key collaborations.
Keystone Symposia is a non-profit organization that offers an ideal setting for
connecting interdisciplinary and international scientific communities.

Broader Impacts: This symposium will bring together the leading experts
representing "Omics" technologies, cell biology, structural biology, chemistry,
genetics, bioinformatics and computational biology to develop and discuss new
strategies to maximize the impact the "Omics" revolution on the understanding of
biological systems and processes. The organizers make a significant effort to
showcase the work of students, postdoctoral fellows and young investigators and
include women and minorities at the organizational level, as speakers and
participants.
