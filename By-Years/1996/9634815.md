*** 9634815 Dixon This Research Planning Grant focuses on the feasibility of
virtual environment. Specific planning objectives are as follows: Complete an
extensive literature search of research to date performed in the object-oriented
computer-based area of virtual reality and the application of this technology to
infrastructure modeling. Identify and contact local and national experts in the
area of advanced computer and virtual reality applications. Perform preliminary
translation tasks to determine the compatiility issues that will occur when
modifying the digital terrain models created by software in current use and
those required for application to the virtual reality environment. Initial
planning tasks will include determination of the required hierarchial processes
of grouping and combining digital terrain model features into polygons or
sufaces for ultimate virtual reality applications.***
