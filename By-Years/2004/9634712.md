9634712 Bean This research involves the development of theory and algorithms to
solve nonhomogeneous Markov decision problems. The application area to be
considered results from just-in-time production and distribution practices.
Massive data requirements and extremely long computation times make solving
nonhomogeneous Markov a formidable task. This research will develop theory that
isolates the data important to making good decisions from the large volume of
data that have no direct effect. The primary approach will integrate forecast
horizons, parametric Markov decision processes and genetic algorithms. This
theory will be embedded in algorithms that will be implemented and evaluated
against data from production and transportation problems. The relatively high-
risk research objectives of (1) developing theory for solving nonhomogeneous
Markov through treatment as parametric Markov decision processes and
acceleration of parametric Markov decision processes algorithms using sampling
information and (2) developing implementable algorithms to solve nonhomogeneous
Markov using forecast horizon theory to reduce problem size, genetic algorithms
to eliminate the bulk of the computation, and then the results of the genetic
algorithms to accelerate parametric Markov decision processes algorithms to
obtain a provably optimal solution have an excellent chance of being met. The
result will be a unique hybrid of artificial intelligence-based algorithms that
result in fast computation times and provable optimality.
