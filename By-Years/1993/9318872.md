9318872 Borns This award is for support for a one year reconaissance inves-
tigation of reported paleo glacial geological evidence on nunataks in the
Executive Committee Range of Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica. The glacial/non
glacial geologic record of higher ice levels including precise chronology, will
be documented on selected nunataks. The purpose of this work is to test the
feasibility for a more extensive study to provide glacial geological data for
documentation of the paleoglaciology of the inland portion of the West Antarctic
ice sheet. ***
