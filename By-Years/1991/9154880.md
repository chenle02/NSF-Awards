The University of Mississippi will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars project in the Life Sciences which will offer science enrichment
activities for 40 precollege students entering grades 10-12. This program will
emphasize research participation in wetlands in fresh water ecology. A
biological field station will serve as an outdoor laboratory for research on
amphibian and reptile migration. Participants will build a drift fence, address
hypotheses concerning migration, and learn the behavior and ecology of many
species. Field trips to the National Forest Hydrology Laboratory, the National
Sedimentation Laboratory, and the Sardis Reservoir Dam will supplement their
coursework.
