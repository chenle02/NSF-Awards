Molecular biology equipment augmented with computer analysis capabilities is
incorporated into two courses in molecular biology; one for students preparing
for a career in ecology and conservation biology and one for students interested
in biotechnology and health related fields. The molecular approach in ecology is
an innovative feature of this project; one which promises to have national
impact. Equipment includes: centrifuges, chromatography chambers, DNA sequencers
and readers and a fileserver with 8 related workstations. Techniques introduced
include access and use of computer molecular genetics databases. Other classes
using this equipment include: the Foundations of Biology Lab, General Genetics,
Human Genetics, Conservation Biology, Fish Ecology, and Evolutionary Biology.
