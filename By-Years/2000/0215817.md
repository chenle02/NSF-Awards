0215817&lt;br/&gt;Landry&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of Hawaii at Manoa supports the acquisition of a high-performance,
multi-laser sorting flow cytometer to continue an active program of plankton
community research in open-ocean ecosystems, as well as providing a shared-use
facility for other research in marine biology, microbial ecology, cell
regulation and culture of aquatic organisms. It will replace a heavily-used, but
aging, flow cytometer that has been operated as a shared-use facility since
1991. The new instrument will provide important new capabilities, and will be
particularly well suited for study of extremely small "picoplankton" such as the
photosynthetic bacterium Prochlorococcus, that are important marine primary
producers, but are very difficult to study with other
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
