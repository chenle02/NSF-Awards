The investigator will work on the algebraic K-theory of group rings of infinite
discrete groups, using the homotopy fixed point set of the action of the group
on a "bounded K-group." He hopes to extend the class of groups to which the
methods apply to all fundamental groups of non-positively curved manifolds with
boundary, to S-arithmetic groups, and to discrete subgroups of p- adic groups.
In addition, he plans to study the Dennis trace map from the stable
pseudoisotopy space of a manifold M to the S1- homotopy fixed point set of its
free loop space, the singular loci in representations of the symmetric group,
and orbit spectra in equivariant stable homotopy theory. K-theory is one of the
standard techniques for finding topological invariants of spaces and for
determining properties of these invariants. Sophisticated algebra is involved.
Typically one relates geometric objects to algebraic ones, calculates with the
algebraic objects, and then translates the results back into geometry.
