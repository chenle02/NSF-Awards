A fundamental concept in database management systems (DBMSs) is that of
physical data independence, i.e., the ability to modify the physical database
scheme without requiring a rewrite of the software that implements the DBMS or
the application programs that use the data. This concept enables a DBMS to
support multiple applications and at the same time optimize the physical design
of each database to provide each application with the highest performance
available. This research focuses on alternative implementations of database
management systems and investigates: (1) physical data independence, (2) tools
and techniques that can optimize the physical design of data for a given
application, and (3) techniques for dynamic reorganization of data in the
presence of changing patterns of data access. The main objective is to maximize
the performance of a system, and whenever appropriate, to utilize parallelism.
Some of this research has been conducted in the context of the relational data
model. This research project concentrates on the object-oriented data model and
other current and emerging data models (i.e., a family of logical constructs for
representation and manipulation of data). This research is expected to
significantly enhance the performance of the current and next generation DBMSs.
