This analysis will test the roles of paleoenvironmental distribution and
adaptation in the evolutionary origins of tetrapod lineages and the causes of
local patterns of faunal turnover in the Texas Early Cretaceous. The well
preserved vertebrate fauna being produced from a sequence spanning as much as 15
my includes diverse fishes, amphibians, lacertilians, dinosaurs, and mammals,
many of which are new. Faunas are found in the intercalated marine and
terrestrial sediments of the Comanche Series, in habitats ranging from open
marine shelf to inland semi-arid floodplain. Abundances of vertebrate taxa
through the section will be analyzed quantitatively to determine the
relationships of taxa to specific environments and their patterns of change
through the section. Paleoenvironments will be assessed based on the sedimentary
context of vertebrate localities. Building upon samples already in hand the
stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental diversity of the vertebrate record will be
further developed through a program of screen washing and through quarrying
where feasible. Search efforts will focus on poorly sampled stratigraphic
intervals in central Texas and on more inland environments preserved to the west
and south.
