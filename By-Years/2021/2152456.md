Why are there so few Black-owned businesses in the U.S.? This project first
documents this racial gap with much more recent and comprehensive data than have
been studied previously. Using longitudinal business data, the project will
study firm dynamics, decomposing the gap into differences in start-up and exit
rates by owner race. An important focus will be understanding the lower survival
rates in Black-owned businesses, especially in their early, vulnerable years.
The project will analyze causes of racial differences, including owner human
capital and firm characteristics, with the key hypothesis that tougher financial
constraints faced by Black entrepreneurs reduce the survival rate of their
firms. The project will estimate the causal effects on firm survival of credit
programs that may increase financial access for Black business owners. In these
ways, the project will contribute to understanding the racial gap in
entrepreneurship and business ownership, which is a crucial, but little studied
component of the broader issue of racial inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project brings new data and methods to analyzing the racial gap. The use of
Census Bureau micro-data represents an advance over previous work, as much
better data at the firm-level have gradually become available, and the project
will knit them together into a new longitudinal database with a rich set of
variables on owners and firms. The analysis of differences in firm dynamics by
race using a panel dataset has little precedent and allows the research to focus
on the key outcome of survival in a way that is difficult if not impossible with
only a cross-section. The rich data enable an assessment of the roles of
characteristics of entrepreneurs, including their motivations and choices,
impacting survival outcomes. The project also develops innovative identification
strategies, based on panel regression, matching, instrumental variable, and
regression discontinuity methods, for assessing the role of financial
constraints in firm survival, exploiting plausibly exogenous variation using
data from two programs: the Small Business Administrationâ€™s 7(a) loan program
and the Community Reinvestment Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was
