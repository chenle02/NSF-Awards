The purpose of this research is to determine the response of osteoblasts to flow
and to ascertain what is the transducing physical signal and what is the
biological signal transduction pathway for the signal. Skeletal unloading, as a
result of bad rest and weightlessness, has been shown to cause progressive bone
loss. However, the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are largely
unknown. Mechanical loading induces strains which cause pressure gradients in
the interstitial fluid and hence fluid flow. The goal of this research is to
prove mechanical loading stimulates the osteoblasts.
