ABSTRACT OPP 9505093 Moritz Research supported by this grant is under the
auspices of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program
and is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of
Polar Programs. Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a
major 5-year research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat
budget of the Arctic Ocean and its impact on global change. The primary goals of
SHEBA are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-
atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present
day arctic climate, including its variability, using General Circulation Models
(GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpre tation of satellite remote sensing data
in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable
data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring. This award to the
University of Washington establishes a Science Project Office for the SHEBA
Program. The Office will coordidate the planning activities, data collection,
and serve as the primary point of contact for the project. The data generated by
all of the Phase 1 investigators will be transmitted to the Office and made
available to other investigators so that the planning effort for the field
program will be efficiently conducted with the most recent data set available.
