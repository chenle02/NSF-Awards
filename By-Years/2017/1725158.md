The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program
recommends an award of $90,421 for the purchase of the following:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;1) Replacement Tender/Workboat $69,954&lt;br/&gt;2) Electronic Chart
Upgrade $6,174&lt;br/&gt;3) Navigation Depth Sounder $14,293&lt;br/&gt; $90,421
