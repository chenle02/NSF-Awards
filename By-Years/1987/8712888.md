The proposed project involves analysis of the process of cell-type
determination in the ovary. The approach is to be genetic: ask the organism what
functions it considers important by identifying mutations that are defective in
the process, analyze the defect in the mutants, and then deduce the role of the
wild-type allele in insuring the normal process. Analysis will involve both
light microscopy and serial section reconstruction electron microscopy.
Mutations that are excellent candidates for defects in this process are already
in hand, and analysis of one locus has been completed (egalitarian, a defect in
oocyte-nurse cell determination); analysis of additional loci has begun. The
process is complex, so for each locus a range of morphic types of alleles (as
defined relative to a deficiency) will be studied to define the primary defect
and the range of secondary defects; additional mutant alleles will be induced as
needed after the "type" allele has been examined. The level of residual function
that will make analysis of a given locus possible will be a function of the
locus itself. Once several different loci are known, pathway analysis will
begin: double-mutant combinations will be examined by both light and EM. At this
point, there will be predictions of the types of interactions (dependent,
independent, or interactive pathways), but the actual phenotype of the double-
mutant combinations will both guide assessment of the kinds of pathways present
in the process and further refine the deductions of function of the specific
wild-type alleles. Moreover, once several mutations have been identified that
appear to be in the same or interacting pathways, additional recessive mutations
in those pathways may be isolatable as dominant enhancers of multiple
heterozygotes of existing mutants. Suppressors (second-site "revertants") will
also be sought. These additional loci will then be studied, first as independent
mutants and then in interactions. In the process of development, the original
single cell, the zygote, is totipotent but as cell division occurs, cells
differentiate to form specific cell types. How this process is regulated at the
molecular level is not understood for any cell types. Dr. Carpenter has chosen
to use ovarian cell types for this study, but the information obtained will be
insightful and add to our generalized concept of differentiation.
