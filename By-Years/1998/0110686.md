Molecular compounds in the brain called neuropeptides often regulate
physiological functions, acting similarly to hormones. A new member of the
family of neuropeptides known as galanins recently has been isolated in mammals
and called galanin-like peptide (GALP). Preliminary evidence suggests that GALP
plays a role in the neuroendocrine regulation of pituitary functions, but little
is yet known about the functions of this compound. This project uses
neuroanatomical, physiological and molecular biological techniques to reveal the
anatomical circuitry of the cells containing GALP, to discover how and where the
expression of GALP occurs, and to develop a mutant mouse model with a targeted
deletion of the GALP gene to reveal physiological functions. Results of these
studies should provide a novel understanding of possible roles for this molecule
in physiological processes such as regulation of metabolism, body weight,
reproduction, lactation and growth.&lt;br/&gt; This exploratory project has both
high risk and high potential impact. It remains unknown what the specific
discoveries will be, but novel data are likely to have major importance,
extending beyond neuroendocrinology to regulatory physiology and developmental
biology. Graduate and postdoctoral training will also be done in a laboratory
with a long record of excellence.&lt;br/&gt;
