The National Research Council in 2013 released the report Monitoring Progress
toward Successful K-12 STEM Education: A Nation Advancing?, which outlined 14
Indicators as well as the needed research and development to create a system to
monitor the quality of STEM education in the nation. This project is funded in
response to a Dear Colleague Letter request for research in the Promoting
Innovation in Measurement and Evaluation program focused on developing research
and tools to advance the nation's capability to measure these indicators. The
researchers in this project will address Indicator 1: Number of, and enrollment
in, different types of STEM schools and programs in each district. STEM-focused
schools are a rising phenomenon in education, and there are multiple variations
in which such schools manifest. In addition, there are multiple types of STEM-
focused programs whose distribution and opportunity for participation present
serious equity issues for underrepresented minorities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities will be carried out in three phases.
In phase one, the research team will review the literature to identify the ways
in which STEM schools and programs are characterized and the tools and resources
that have been developed by states and districts. The project will convene a set
of working sessions with other researchers and important stakeholders to
establish a set of operational definitions and a framework to inform the
development of a set of indicators of STEM schools and programs. Finally, the
project will convene a larger workshop to validate the framework and identify
the next steps that will be needed for the development of measures.
