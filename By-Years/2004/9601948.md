We request funds to purchase an integrated package for acoustic data
collection, modeling, and visualization. Instrument components include two
4-frequency, digital acoustic systems for data acquisition, a large measurement
tank for instrument calibration and parameter estimation, a portable soft, x-ray
machine for organism anatomy measurements, and a computer workstation for data
management, modeling, and visualization. When combined, these instruments will
form a Fisheries Acoustic Center with enhanced computer power and memory; high
resolution, multi-frequency acoustic measurement and calibration facilities; and
state-of-the-art interactive acoustic modeling and visualization capabilities
all housed at a new shore-based laboratory. This instrumentation package will
make the Great Lakes Center at Buffalo State College one of the premier
institutes in acoustic research and modeling. It will form a major research
focus of the Principal Investigators over the next 5-10 years and will be a core
instrument in academic course development and research recruitment at the newly
reconstituted Great Lakes Center at Buffalo State College. Over the past three
years, we have developed a new analytical approach to examine the spatial
ecology and production of pelagic organisms in aquatic environments. We combine
the strengths of underwater acoustics to measure fish abundances at high spatial
resolution, bioenergetic models to measure fish consumption and growth, and
spatial modeling to define the relationship between observed distribution
patterns and causative processes. This approach has been used to assess the
effects of fine-scale changes in the spatial pattering of biotic and abiotic
habitat on the feeding ecology, growth, and production of fishes in freshwater
and estuarine environments. Creation of a Fisheries Acoustic Center will
complement ongoing ecological research by quantifying species-specific
parameters used in foraging and spatial models. Th e types of ongoing and
projected research that will use this equipment include the field of aquatic
ecology (acoustic assessment of the abundances, production, distributions, sizes
and behavior of fishes and invertebrates in systems ranging in size from small
lakes to the Great Lakes and oceans), acoustical oceanography (acoustic measures
of swimming speeds, target strength, and identity of acoustic scatterers) and
spatial ecology (spatial modeling in two or three dimensions of the effects of
fine-scale spatial and temporal processes on large scale phenomena). Training
will be done at the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels through a
combination of individual 'on-hands' research experience, specialized courses,
visiting scientists and remote internet access.
