Tension receptors are important links in the feedback system controlling
movements and maintenance of position. The PRincipal Investigator in this
project has been studying such receptors in the limbs of crabs and crayfish.
These provide particularly favorable material with which to explore the
mechanisms by which such receptors work and the ways in which the information
obtained from them is used by the organism. This is because the behavior of the
animals is relatively simple and the joints and muscles in which the receptors
are found are rather easily accessible. The studies here will use two species of
crab and two of crayfish. There are four main objectives of this project: 1. To
study the output of individual tension receptors on the tendon that closes the
joint, characterizing its action. 2. To obtain descriptions of the structure and
general responsivities of tension receptors on other tendons of the walking
legs. 3. To attempt to determine if the muscle of the legs have length detectors
as well as tension receptors. 4. To compare the tension receptors in the pair of
claws, one of which is much larger than the other. This exploratory work has
considerable potential for leading to a model system that can give important
clues to the workings of the proprioceptive sense.
