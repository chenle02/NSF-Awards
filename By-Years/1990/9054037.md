Abstract: This project provides support for printing and distributing 750
additional copies of the Proceedings of the St. Cloud Conference on Women in
Mathematics and Science held in November of 1989. That conference, supported by
other than NSF funds, has become widely known as one of the most productive
conferences held on this topic. The original grant only provided for publishing
and distributing the Proceedings to the participants and a few others.
