This action would provide funds for two faculty members, one research associate
and students to continue their research in elementary particle physics. They are
involved in an international collaboration with physicists from ten different
countries building a particle detector to be used at a new facility under
construction in Hamburg, Germany. The particle detector is known by the name,
Zeus. The experiments to be done will be to study the reaction products of
electrons colliding with protons at the highest laboratory energies available
for these processes. These studies will complement experiments at other
facilities now under construction in the U.S. and abroad. The principal
responsibility of the American physicists involved (from 7 institutions; 3
receiving NSF funds) is the calorimeter used to measure the energy of emerging
particles. Virginia Tech has particular responsibility for the phototube bases
and radiative corrections.
