A grant has been awarded to the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science (DMNS)
under the direction of Dr. Paula E. Cushing, Curator of Invertebrate Zoology, to
curate, identify, and database backlogged arachnid specimens (spiders,
scorpions, etc.) and to stabilize and re-curate recently acquired arachnid
specimens from the Colorado State University (CSU) collection. The arachnid
collection at the DMNS was established in 1998 and has grown from fewer than 50
vials to nearly 21,000 vials (100 - 300,000 specimens) representing 947 species,
making the collection the largest of its kind in the Rocky Mountain / Great
Plains region. Support from NSF will provide personnel support to assist in
curation and identification to species of backlogged specimens. The funding also
will enable the immediate re-curation and stabilization of the CSU specimens
transferred to DMNS. &lt;br/&gt;The DMNS is now the primary repository for
arachnids in the Rocky Mountains / Great Plains region. The data from the
identified backlogged material will be made readily accessible to a broad range
of users including students, teachers, researchers, land managers and the
general public through the currently existing web page and online database. The
project will have a major impact on the Museum's ability to serve the research
and educational needs of a broad and diverse audience and will strengthen the
arachnology program at the DMNS. &lt;br/&gt;
