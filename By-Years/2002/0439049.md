"Waves in Space," an educational museum exhibit for upper elementary and middle
school students, clarifies the concept of radio wave propagation and how it is
affected by variations in the Earth's atmosphere. The exhibit is based on
research in upper atmospheric physics conducted by the Atmospheric Sciences
Group at the MIT Haystack Observatory. This research is at the forefront of the
emerging national space weather effort, a large NSF initiative to forecast and
predict dynamic conditions in Earth's upper atmosphere and the effects these
conditions have on key technologies such as cellular phones, pagers and
satellites.
