This proposal is to continue investigation on topics of large scale circulation
theory. With the aid of numerical and analytical models, Ierley has determined
the effect of boundary conditions, western boundary layers and inertial jets on
the vorticity balance of quasi-geostrophic (QG) ocean models. The main aspect of
these studies is to comprehend the physical reasons for the features exhibited
by the numerical solutions. Ierley has produced very valuable contributions to
the theory of ocean circulation with his analysis of "q-driven" models, models
in which the interior flow is determined by the advection and diffusion of
potential vorticity. He will analyze very high resolution, low viscosity QG
model solutions which show western boundary separation and intense inertial
recirculation. This analysis is critical to interpret results of ocean models
used for climatic studies.
