9631396 Fischer Lifelong learning integrates and mutually enriches the cultures
of work and education. This integration should not be interpreted as "adult
education," nor as giving children "jobs;" rather, it frames a vision in which
people learn continually in the course of authentic, self-directed, and creative
activities. Central to this vision is the notion of design activity, a model of
work that is open-ended and long-term in nature, incorporates personalized and
collaborative aspects, and combines technical and aesthetic elements. The
communality that crucially binds design activities together is that they are
centered around the production of new, publicly accessible artifacts. Our
proposal is focused around a vision of how education and work may be seen as
interwoven elements of creative design activity. We offer six specific
hypotheses as vehicles to attain and sustain this vision, and we present a
framework for computational domain-oriented design environment that reflect
these hypotheses and offer a means to assess them. The research will develop
theories about lifelong learning, will create computational environments
necessary to support lifelong learners, will contribute to the restructuring of
our national educational infrastructure, and will provide a unique opportunity
for extending not only technological developments but also the societal networks
of working, learning and collaborating. ***
