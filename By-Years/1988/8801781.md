This doctoral dissertation award will support an investigation of the place of
cartography and science in nineteenth-century industrial development and
imperial domination. The research will focus on the British geodetic surveys
undertaken by the East India Company as part of its imperial activities in
India. The purpose of the project is to find out why politicians and bureaucrats
perceived a need for more accurate and more comprehensive maps than were
hitherto available, and why they accepted the great expense that such maps
entailed. The project will have significance for reshaping our understanding of
cartography as not merely an exact and scientific profession concerned with the
accurate and truthful depiction of geographic reality, but as an enterprise that
is an important part of social and political process.
