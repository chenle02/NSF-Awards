The research involves systems employing three innovations using polarized light
to represent bipolar values, using liquid crystal devices as neuron outputs and
connection matrix, and using a custom integrated detector and comparator.
Emphasis is on new applications for neural networks, better algorithms for
current use, and new methods of implementing neural networks.
