This workshop will serve as a conduit for jump-starting synergistic research
advancing our understanding of the Earth system through innovative cyber-
infrastructure that pushes the envelope on information systems research. The
workshop will help synthesize a vision and needs for intelligent systems
research that will provide new capabilities envisioned by EarthCube to advance
geosciences. The workshop will catalyze a community and research agenda in the
emerging area of Discovery Informatics grounded on geoscience requirements.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will discuss how to tackle problems in
heterogeneous data integration and visualization (e.g., hand-made sketches,
aerial imagery, field-data repositories, stakeholder interviews), ontological
reasoning with scientific metadata and mathematical models (e.g., representing
uncertainty, simulation predictions, evolving theories). The salient themes
arising from discussions at the workshop will be articulated in detail in a
final workshop report, which will be made available for the broad research
community.
