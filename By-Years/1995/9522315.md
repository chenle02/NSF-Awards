NCR-95223 15 PI: Richard Pethia In response to computer security threats, the
Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has established a Computer Emergency
Response Team (CERT) to support users of the Internet. The Internet CERT
coordination center is located at Carnegie Mellon University's Software
Engineering Institute and has been active since November 18, 1988. CERT is
chartered to work with the Internet community in detecting and resolving
computer security incidents. Since its inception, CERT has responded to
continuous stream of security incidents. The incident rate and impact on
Internet sites has grown steadily as the Internet user population has grown. As
the incident rate has grown, so has the sophistication of the intruders. Where
intruders once focused on exploitation of weak passwords and widely known
vulnerabilities, they have now progressed to examining source files for new
security flaws, exploiting protocol flaws, and using tool kits to automate their
attacks and increase their impact. CERT is expanding its program to increase its
emphasis on incident prevention through a combination of technology improvement,
security awareness and training, and security assessment activities. This
expanded program includes two areas where CERT can provide special help that
will facilitate the orderly, secure progression to the next stage in the
Internet evolution: 1. Collaboration with router manufacturers 2. Collaboration
with network service Providers
