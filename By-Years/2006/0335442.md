This research study focuses on issues of teacher induction and retention and
will explore these activities in about six MSP projects from among 2-3 MSP
cohorts. During the first two years, the researchers will conduct exploratory
research activities to identify a set of MSPS having an amount and type of
teacher induction that merits further investigation. During this phase of the
project, researchers will conduct primarily qualitative research such as
document inspection, telephone interviews and exploratory site visits. In years
2-5 researchers will conduct focused case studies of the six selected MSPs and
more extensive data collection will be gathered and analyzed. In addition, the
five-year project timeline permits a longitudinal investigation that explores
phenomena such as program changes and their causes/effects and changes in
beginner teachers/ beliefs, knowledge and practice as a result of their
participation in the MSP induction activities.
