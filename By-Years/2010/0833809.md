NSF is providing partial financial support for a Student Research Workshop
&lt;br/&gt;at the AMTA-2008 conference in Waikiki, Hawaii. The Association for
Machine&lt;br/&gt;Translation in the Americas (AMTA) is a non-profit
professional organization&lt;br/&gt;in the area of Machine Translation (MT) in
the US and the American continent.&lt;br/&gt;The main mission of AMTA is to
facilitate and promote the exchange of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and information
between the communities of researchers, developers&lt;br/&gt;and users of
Machine Translation and related translation technologies. In
its&lt;br/&gt;effort to foster the professional growth of the next generation of
MT&lt;br/&gt;researchers, AMTA-2008 is featuring a new Student Research
Workshop, embedded&lt;br/&gt;as an integral part of the research program at the
conference. Students at&lt;br/&gt;all levels of study (undergraduate, graduate
and post-graduate) are invited to&lt;br/&gt;submit papers describing their
research work. NSF is providing funding to&lt;br/&gt;subsidize travel,
conference and accommodation expenses for up to 10 students&lt;br/&gt;that have
been selected to present their research work at the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AMTA-2008 Student Research Workshop will
greatly facilitate professional&lt;br/&gt;growth for the brightest young
researchers in the field of MT, in the early&lt;br/&gt;stages of their
professional career. The workshop will contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;professional
development of a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of&lt;br/&gt;Machine
Translation and computational processing of natural language. MT
and&lt;br/&gt;other language processing applications are becoming vital
technologies in the&lt;br/&gt;global information age. Strength in these areas is
crucial to American&lt;br/&gt;competitiveness in the global economy of the 21st
century.
