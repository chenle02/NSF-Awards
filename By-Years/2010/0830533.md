Parametric condition numbers for optimization and complementarity
problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of conditioning is central in
numerical analysis. Given a specific numerical problem such as solving a system
of linear or polynomial equations, a condition number is a measure of the
sensitivity of the solution of a problem instance to changes in the input
defining it. It is a fundamental tool in the analysis of the performance and
numerical stability of algorithms. The long-term goal of this research plan is
to create a flexible framework for condition numbers in optimization that
incorporates specific characteristics of the problem of interest such as
sparsity patterns as well as other structural properties in the input data.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will develop new parametric
condition numbers for various important problem classes including saddle-point
problems, complementarity problems, and copositive programming. It will also use
the new parametric condition numbers to analyze the performance of algorithms
for these problem classes. Finally, it will establish connections between
parametric condition numbers and robust
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
