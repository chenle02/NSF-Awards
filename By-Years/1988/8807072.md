To ensure the vitality of the Nation's technological enterprise, it is necessary
to maintain the quality, effectiveness and distribution of the human resource
base in science and engineering in general, and in computing technology in
particular. Toward the fulfillment of this objective, it is crucial to increase
the minority presence in the field by stimulating computer science research and
education at minority institutions such as Atlanta University (AU). With the
development of a viable infrastructure via the NSF-CISE Program, AU hopes to
play an important role in establishing a regional base for such activities and
promoting computer science research and education at other HBCUs. Through this
project, AU will develop a comprehensive five-year plan for improving the
academic program, research and computing facilities with emphasis on the
following: (1) Reorganization of research via creation of a limited number of
research clusters around the existing nuclei of research interests; (2)
Improvement of the existing academic program and curriculum development in
advanced courses related to research areas; (3) Enhancement of the existing
computing facilities and creation of special-purpose laboratories; (4) Creation
of a viable faculty base; and (5) Creation of linkages and partnerships with
other major universities, government laboratories and industry.
