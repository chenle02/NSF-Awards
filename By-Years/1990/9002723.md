This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage data due to the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. This project aims to establish a complete computerized data base of
unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings using a portfolio of 2,007 such buildings
in San Francisco, to survey the damage data, and to assess the accurate damage
to URMs in a consistent manner. This data base will be provided with additional
information such as soil conditions, adjacent building conditions, and street
frontage to facilitate subsequent analysis and other utilization. By individual
field survey, sorting and processing and in conjunction with a companion effort
of URMs evaluation program of the San Francisco city, a complete pre-
earthquake/post earthquake damage data base will be produced. Statistical
summaries of the results will be documented and made available to the public,
along with a description of the field data base and its possibilities. The
collection and computerization of the data base in this project will serve the
needs of researchers for purposes of mitigating URM hazards in the future.
