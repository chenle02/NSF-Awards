This is a two-day working conference to be held at NSF headquarters in
Arlington, VA, in spring 2016 to discuss ways of increasing collaborations
between cognitive scientists and discipline-based education researchers. Working
groups will discuss the three themes: (1) standards for evidence in cognitive
science and discipline-based education research, (2) bridging the engineering of
instructional solutions and innovations and attributing causality to those
solutions and innovations; and (3) facilitating communication and collaboration
across CS and DBER communities. The goal of the meeting is to discuss obstacles,
opportunities, and policies that could be used as input in a national dialog to
increase collaborations among CS and DBER Researchers.

Despite advances in communication and occasional collaboration across these two
fields, research from cognitive science that could be applied to improve
teaching and learning in the STEM fields remains largely unknown to STEM
scientists and discipline-based education researchers. Similarly, research-based
instructional strategies in STEM remain largely unknown in the learning
sciences. This meeting will convene key leaders from both fields for the purpose
of discussing important methodological, practical, and philosophical issues in
order to promote increased dialog and collaborations across the two communities.
