Honeycutt 9700717 The study is composed of two central objectives. The first
objective is to test the hypothesis that the absolute rate of DNA change in a
mitochondrial genome is influenced by the mode of replication of the genome. The
process of replication yields a displaced strand of DNA. DNA in this displaced
single-stranded state is expected to be more susceptible to spontaneous mutation
than the normal double-stranded state of the DNA. Thus the hypothesis yields a
testable prediction; the amounts of detectable DNA change should be proportional
to the time that a DNA strand is displaced during the replication process. The
second objective is to use a DNA data set to determine the relationships of a
closely related group of Notropin shiners. This group is a member of the most
taxonomically diverse family of North American freshwater fishes. Knowledge of
these relationships is basic to understanding the taxonomic and ecological
diversity of this group. Each objective of this study will be obtained from
different analyses of the same mitochondrial DNA data set.
