Students are using a computer classroom/laboratory equipped with Sun
workstations running "Mathematica" and other software packages as an integral
part of their learning environment in upper division mathematics courses. The
integrated symbolic manipulation, computational, and graphics capability of
"Mathematica" and the simulation of vector and parallel processors available in
other packages allow students to perform experiments that lead to a better
understanding of mathematical concepts in linear algebra, differential
equations, probability and statistics, and numerical analysis. An extended
series of faculty workshops will bring all members of the mathematics faculty
into this program and is expected to lead to the use of this computer facility
in over half of the mathematics classes within a few years. This project is
being matched by an amount equal to the award.
