The research project constructs a two-country optimizing model to study the
intertemporal constraints which fixed exchange rates impose on fiscal policy.
These constraints are identified, and empirical tests are proposed. The timing
of exchange rate collapse is investigated. The viability of a fixed rate system
is shown to depend on speculators' expectations regarding the intertemporal
fiscal constraint. The vulnerability of the fixed rate system to speculative
attack is dependent on the assumptions about capital mobility. The timing of
exchange rate collapse under alternative assumptions about impediments to
capital flows will be investigated. Interactive activities include teaching a
course in International Economics and conducting a seminar series with visiting
speakers in the same field. Additional activities include presenting a research
workshop, participating in ongoing workshops, counseling students on their
research, attending a faculty meetings, and organizing brown bag lunches for
graduates and undergraduates featuring outside speakers.
