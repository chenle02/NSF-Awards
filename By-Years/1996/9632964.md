Proposal Number: ECS-9632964 Principal Investigator: Mordechai Segev Title:
Photorefractiove Solitons Abstract This research will investigate fundamental
aspects of photorefractive solitons and will also demonstrate their practical
potential in a series of important applications including high efficiency
frequency difference generation in a soliton induced waveguide, ultra-narrow
beam steering, optical wring and near-field reconfigurable interconnects.
Research on photorefractive solitons in the semiconductors GaAs and InP will
also be conducted in order to investigate theoretically predicted intensity
dependent resonant behavior. Photorefractive solitons (an area pioneered by the
PI) use the photorefractive nonlinearity: photorefractive solitons form when a
photorefractive medium interacts with a beam of light such than the nonlinear
index-change exactly compensates for diffractive spreading and traps the beam.
Once generated, photorefractive solitons can act was graded-index waveguides in
the volume of the bulk crystal and very weak soliton beam can guide a very
intense beam of a longer (non-photorefractive)wavelength with no degradation.
Photorefractive solitons are also robust and stable against material
inhomogeneities. Forming a practical soliton trapped in both transverse
dimensions in a bulk medium has been a long-standing open problem which has
limited their practical use.
