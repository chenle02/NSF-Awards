Slaman will investigate the effective, and more generally definable, aspects of
mathematical phenomena such as genericity, compactness, and randomness. Jointly
with Veronica Becher and Pablo Heiber, both at the University of Buenos Aires,
Slaman will apply methods from Computability and Descriptive Set Theory to
normality of real numbers, the property that the digits in their representations
occur with equal asymptotic frequency, especially considering representations in
varying bases. Will also collaborate with Laurent Bienvenu, University of Paris
Diderot-Paris 7, and Kelty Allen, an advanced graduate student working with
Slaman, on the effective theory of Brownian motion. In parallel, Slaman will
investigate the more foundational question, "What are the number theoretic
consequences of familiar infinitary principles?" as formalized in first and
second order arithmetic. The phrase "first order arithmetic" refers to the
structure of the natural numbers N={0,1,2,...} with the operations of addition
and multiplication. ``Second order arithmetic'' refers to the expansion of N to
include all of the subsets of N and allowing for reference to and quantification
over infinite sets. Stated more precisely, Slaman will investigate the extent to
which second order principles, such as the existence of a random sequence or the
assertion of a frequently applied infinitary combinatorial principle such as
Ramsey's Theorem, have non-trivial consequences in first order arithmetic.

This project comes from the perspective of Mathematical Logic, that
understanding the means by which one can work with mathematical objects can be
as important as, or even equivalent to, understanding those objects themselves.
In one of the more interdisciplinary parts of the proposal, this point of view
will be invoked to study the problem of constructing real numbers so as to
control the behaviors of their representations relative to all integer bases.
One goal is to exhibit a fast-running algorithm to output an absolutely normal
number, which means that for any integer base b the digits in the base b
representation of this number occur with equal frequency over time. Absolute
normality is often interpreted as an indicator of randomness, but such an
accessible and predictable example would refute that view. Another part of the
project puts Mathematical Logic in the foreground by asking for exact
information concerning the extent that the properties of the real numbers, in
the form of combinatorics seen within infinite subsets of the natural numbers,
have consequences among the finite sets.
