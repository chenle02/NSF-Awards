ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arctic Alive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arctic Alive is
an e-learning project that brings cutting-edge geosciences research to the K-12
classroom, integrates geosciences curriculum, provides opportunities for K-12
teachers to work with scientists, and promotes global understanding about the
value and worldwide significance of the Arctic region. Arctic Alive focuses on
arctic research, the importance of the arctic region including its role in
global climate change, and its extraordinary environments and diverse cultures.
Science is the central curriculum theme, while technology is the catalyst.
Arctic Alive is an interactive, real-time, and unique web-based education
program. It uses a variety of delivery methods and e-learning strategies to
deliver arctic research to the classroom. Two key program components are a
teacher in the field with the geoscientists to facilitate activities in the
classroom, and student interactions with the researchers. Educators and students
integrate the Arctic Alive program not only into their sciences curriculum but
also social studies and technology curricula. The Arctic Alive program aligns
with National Education Standards in technology, science, and math, as well as
Alaska Content Standards for Students.&lt;br/&gt;
