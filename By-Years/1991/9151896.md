The Department of Geology and Environmental science is acquiring subsurface
sampling and seismic equipment for use in laboratory portion of all
undergraduate courses. Students in lower level courses are using the seismic
equipment to map subsurface layers of the earth, while students in upper
division courses to map aquifers in local water district. Projects are also
being undertaken to investigate changes in lake and bay environment as a
function of changes in industrial activities and increasing population.
