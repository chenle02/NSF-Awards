There is currently some question as to whether the biological resources of the
Antarctic marine ecosystem are divided into stocks that can be managed
separately or constitute a single community which is influenced by common events
over a large geographic area. In order to address this question, comparable data
for populations of the same species collected from different regions over a
large time span are needed. Researchers have been monitoring reproductive rates
of Weddell seals at several locations in Antarctica, but none has yet attempted
to compare the various data sets. Testa proposes to analyze and compare existing
data on the annual reproductive rates of Weddell seals from McMurdo Station
(U.S.) with those from Davis (Australia) and Signy Island (British) Stations to
determine whether large-scale factors influence reproductive success in distinct
populations from widely separated geographic locations. The work will be
conducted in collaboration with members of the British Antarctic Survey and the
Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition. Data also exists on food
habits of Weddell seals at these locations, and will be utilized for
interpretation of data sets. Results will provide a foundation for better
management of Antarctic marine biological resources, as well as an opportunity
for international collaboration and dissemination of information. Results should
also further our understanding of life-history evolution and population ecology
of large mammals.
