The Department of Chemistry will require a nitrogen laser and computer-
interfaced UV/VIS spectrophotometer to improve their undergraduate education in
chemistry. The first part of this project will bring computers into the physical
chemistry laboratory to give students experience in using computer-interfaced
instrumentation and to reduce the time required to analyze raw data. It is hoped
this will increase the appeal of this course to prospective chemistry majors and
reduce a major barrier to their completing a B.S. major in chemistry. The
combination of computers with high-resolution plotters will also allow
quantitative estimation of errors to be made much more quickly and more
routinely. The computers will also be used with a molecular orbital program to
interpret the absorption spectra of dyes and aromatic compounds and to teach the
BASIC programming language. The new instrumentation will allow the introduction
of three new experiments into the physical chemistry laboratory course as well
as significant upgrading of several existing experiments. The nitrogen laser
will allow for measurement of fluorescence decay times in the 1 nanosecond
range. Other new experiments include "The Photochemistry of NO2" and "The
Statistical Thermodynamics of Iodine Sublimation."
