Over the years the University of Minnesota Duluth undergraduate research program
has established a tradition whereby former program participants who are in
graduate school or have obtained a Ph.D. have return for visits to assist with
the program. The visitors take part in all aspects of the program and serve as
live-in councilors and role models for the undergraduates. In addition to
contributing to the research done in the program, the visitors are part of a
valuable network of those who have been in the Duluth program. The visits, which
last from one to ten weeks, have proven to be an important component in the
success of the program. This grant provides travel support to continue this
aspect of the program.&lt;br/&gt;
