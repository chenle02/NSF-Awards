This award provides an additional three years of continuing support to the
Department of Biology at Hope College to carry on with the Research Experience
for Undergraduates Site that was established in 1988. The program will provide
ten undergraduate students with an in-depth summer experience in research in
environmental biology. In order to provide research opportunities to individuals
who are not well represented in science, the department will recruit women and
members of minority groups to participate in the program with the goal of having
at least 50% of the student participants being women and 50% being members of
minority groups. Five students from Hope College and five students from other
schools will be selected for participation on the basis of academic record,
research ability and potential, initiative, independence and professional
objectives. Students will select a research project from five different areas
related to environmental biology: 1) Molecular Biology of Nitrogen Fixation, 2)
Environmental Biochemistry and Physiology, 3) Genetic Toxicology, 4) Plant and
Animal Parasitology and 5) Ecology and Systematics and will work under the
supervision of twelve Ph.D faculty members. Students will perform independent
research projects, give oral presentations on their work in progress, attend
workshops on graduate school and scientific writing, attend special scientific
seminars and prepare a research poster and research paper summarizing their
work.
