The 2011 Electromagnetic Interactions with Nucleons and Nuclei (EINN) conference
will be held from October 31 to November 04, 2011 in Pafos, Cyprus. This award
will enable junior scientists without other means of support to attend the
meeting.

EINN offers a unique venue for the presentation and discussion of frontier
research covering the electromagnetic properties of atomic nuclei. The
conference runs across different subfields of electromagnetic nuclear physics,
including those at the interface between nuclear and particle physics.

The modest size of the conference and its cross-disciplinary aspect enhance the
learning experience and provide serious training of the next generation of
leaders in nuclear physics and related disciplines. Students will have many
opportunities to interact with present leaders in an informal setting.
