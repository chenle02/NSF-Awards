Narrative: Airlift reactors incorporating mammalian and plant cells have a high
potential for commercial utilization to synthesize a variety of important
bioproducts (proteins, etc.). Some advantages of the airlift concept include low
shear rates, relatively good mixing, and a decreased risk of contamination. The
single most important aspect of air lift reactors is that they provide a gentle
environment for the culture and therefore, preserve the integrity of fragile
cells, which in turn reduces the release of undesirables into the broth. The
specific objective of the research will be to obtain fundamental knowledge about
the hydrodynamic forces and to characterize turbulence in multiphase flow. This
information will be used to examine effects on fragile cultures, design supports
for immobilized cultures, and provide scale-up information for airlift
fermentors.
