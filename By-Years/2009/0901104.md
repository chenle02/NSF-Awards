Abstract Barbasch

There are two major themes in this proposal, the determination of the unitary
dual, and the structure of unipotent representations. Barbasch will continue and
extend his previous work to find necessary and sufficient conditions for
unitarity for classes of Langlands parameters such as principal series in real
and p-adic groups. The aim is to find proofs that are as uniform and conceptual
as possible, and express the answers in a closed form. Unipotent representations
are (conjectured to be) the building blocks of the unitary dual. Their character
theory plays an important role in the theory of automorphic forms. Barbasch will
study the character theory of unipotent representations in the real case, with
an emphasis on relations to endoscopic groups, particularly twisted ones.
Realizations of unipotent representations as local factors of automorphic forms,
and in the context of the dual pairs correspondence are also envisioned. This
research will provide a deeper understanding of representation theory of
reductive Lie groups, in particular unitary representations, which play an
essential role in the applications of representation theory to automorphic
forms, mathematical physics analysis and geometry.

This research will generate problems suitable for Ph.D. theses as well as
combinatorial problems for undergraduate research. Together with several faculty
members at Cornell, Barbasch will run the ``Sophus Lie Days at Cornell'' an
instructional conference designed to expose undergraduates and graduate students
in mathematics and other sciences to the theory of Lie groups and their
representations, one of the aims being to get them interested and involved in
research at an early stage. The results of this research will be disseminated
through research papers, talks at seminars and conferences, and various web
sites.
