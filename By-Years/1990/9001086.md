This dissertation research explores the tension between feminist critiques of
bureaucracy and feminist organizational practice. The student will conduct the
study in three stages. In the first she will examine questions of external and
internal influences on organizational structure by means of a self- administered
questionnaire. In the second she will examine changes in organizational form
through semi-structured telephone interviews with members of 20 organizations.
She will then try in the third stage to explain why some groups are better able
to maintain alternative organizational structures. Information will be gathered
through participant observation in three organizations representative of the
range of organizational forms.
