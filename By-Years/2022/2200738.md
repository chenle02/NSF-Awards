The research project lies at the crossroads of algebra and geometry. A
particular focus is on the theory of cluster algebras and moduli spaces. Cluster
algebras, discovered by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2001, are a class of algebras
associated with integer skew-symmetric matrices. Since its inception, the rapid
developments of cluster theory have found tremendous interactions with many
different areas of mathematics and physics, including representation theory,
knot theory, and high energy physics. Moduli spaces are geometric spaces that
classify objects of some fixed shapes or solutions to specific systems in
physics. This project will explore the connections between moduli spaces and
cluster algebras to further their understanding and build parallels between the
different areas. In addition, the PI will mentor undergraduate research
projects, train graduate students, and support a research seminar.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the quantum geometry of
moduli spaces under the framework of cluster algebras. It also explores the
fruitful connections between decorated character varieties, quantum groups, and
Legendrian knots, finding new results in all directions. In more detail, the
project will touch on four topics. (1) It will provide a rigid cluster model
realizing quantum groups, obtaining new interpretations of many properties of
quantum groups from the perspective of cluster algebras. (2) It will study the
natural bases of the quantized decorated character varieties, including a
concrete diagrammatic construction of web bases. (3) It will explore an
intrinsic correspondence between the exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian
knots and the cluster seeds of their augmentation varieties. As an application,
it will solve the infinite-filling problem for Legendrian knots beyond positive
braids. (4) It will use tools from Legendrian knot theory to introduce a cluster
structure on generalized Richardson varieties, confirming a conjecture of
Leclerc on the cluster nature of open Richardson
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
