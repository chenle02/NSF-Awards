The purpose of this project is to design an approach to science instruction that
takes into account some findings from cognitive research. It has been widely
demonstrated that students come into the classroom with invalid perceptions
about physical phenomena which are not altered by current forms of instruction.
Through interviews, this project will document the general misconceptions held
by students, identify these for teachers, and develop methods which directly
confront the misconceptions. The student materials will consist of a unit,
"Models of Matter", which will be modified to also confront the commonly held
misconceptions. The final product will be an educational system that integrates
learning activities and teaching strategies to cause conceptual change. The
modified "Models of Matter" unit will be randomly assigned to 12 of 24 Lansing,
Michigan Public School grade six classes to test its effectiveness in increasing
student achievement and promoting recommended teaching strategies. The remaining
12 sixth grade classes will use the unmodified "Models of Matter" unit. The
project expects to demonstrate how authors can use existing research findings to
modify commercial textbook units and teacher guides to increase student
learning. Since most teachers structure their teaching around a commercial
textbook, the project has national significance for improving student
achievement in science.
