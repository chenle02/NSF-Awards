1255731 &lt;br/&gt;Senko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAR/Instrumentation and
Facilities grant supports acquisition of a bench top low energy powder x-ray
diffractometer (XRD) for phase identification of fine grained natural and
synthetic materials and crystallographic structure characterization. Specific
research applications will include studies of: 1) acid-mine drainage and
corrosion affiliated biomineralization processes; 2) geomicrobiological
processed in kart environments; and 3) bone apatite biomineralization processes.
The requested XRD will replace a Phillips 3100 XRPD system that has been in
service in The University of Akron?s (UA) Department of Geology and
Environmental Science (GES) since 1985 and present safety concerns for student
opertion. The instrument would support research and research training across
multiple departments at the University of Akron and would serve as a regional
x-ray characterization facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
