As computer technology becomes increasingly pervasive in all aspects of our
lives, it becomes critical for the researchers who develop algorithms to work
closely with the domain experts who have a deep understanding of the underlying
systems. The purpose of the NSF Algorithms in the Field (AitF) program is to
fund collaborations between theoretical computer scientists with other computing
researchers. Via this meeting, the program is providing an opportunity for its
principal investigators to share and discuss their latest advances, demonstrate
technical accomplishments, and inform NSF on promising future research
directions. The technical program agenda will highlight the contributions of the
participating NSF divisions and address the research themes of the AitF program.
Student researchers will also attend and present their work. This provides a
valuable training opportunity and will contribute to the foundation for an
enduring AitF research community.
