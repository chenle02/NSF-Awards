This project aims to use transition metals, in particular cobalt complexes, for
the development of methodology for the rapid construction of novel complex
molecules by multiple bond formation. These include the phenylenes, a new class
of novel cyclohexatrienoid hydrocarbons endowed with strain and antiaromatic
activation. These molecules are not only adding fundamental knowledge to the
understanding of aromatic delocalization, but also have great promise in
applications such as thin film transistors, organic semiconductor materials,
electroluminescent devices, energy storage systems, and others. A long term goal
is to facilitate the invention of integrated nanotechnologies for the
microsystems of the future. In another thrust, the synthetic methodology to be
developed under this program should facilitate the construction of hitherto
inaccessible novel compound classes of synthetic and medicinal interest. Through
the understanding of mechanisms, and aided by computational methods, catalytic
selectivity will be sought. This effort should greatly simplify routes to
natural and unnatural products, with impact on total synthesis and the
development of compound libraries endowed with new potentially pharmacophoric
motifs.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor K. Peter C Vollhardt of the Department of Chemistry at
the University of California at Berkeley. Professor Vollhardt's research efforts
focus on the development of transition metal mediated transformations that lead
to novel molecules. His efforts could positively impact materials, energy, and
medical research.
