Examining sudden changes in climate is an important aspect of paleoclimate and
paleoceanographic research. The North Atlantic Ocean is particularly critical,
since changes in this region may be related to major changes in the deep ocean
ventilation and circulation rates. Additionally, the proximity of large northern
hemisphere ice sheets have significant impact on North Atlantic oceanography
during glacial times. Study of the oceanographic and climate history revealed in
sediments may allow correlation to the climate record recovered from ice coring
projects in Greenland. The present award will support study of short timescale
variations in the North Atlantic and the evolution of climate during the
Pliocene. Previous work at ODP site 609 has revealed variability in
sedimentation on a 1000 year time scale, as well as features at a 10,000 year
time scale. Work in this award will attempt to map the distribution of these
events using existing cores, and will extend the previous study back in time at
appropriate DSDP/ODP sites.
