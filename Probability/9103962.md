The principal investigator will continue his work on multiparamter processes
and random fields. These stochastic processes describe random phenomena whose
probabilistic properties are both spatial and time dependent, such as the time
evolution of a one-, two- or three dimensional medium subject to random
excitation. An important question in this area of probability theory is: if one
observes this random field in a certain region of space-time, how does one
estimate its behavior elsewhere? The investigator will study the relationship
between this prediction problem for a particularly important class of random
field, their Markov properties, and the behavior of solutions of certain
stochastic partial differential equations.
