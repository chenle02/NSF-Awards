This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research Training Group in
Studies of Paleorecords of Global Change. The faculty group is a mixture of
outstanding senior and junior investigators who come from a variety of
disciplines. The funds will provide stipends for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows, will support research participation by high school and
undergraduate students, will defray part of the cost of the trainees' research
and will enable the trainees to attend scientific meetings. In addition, funds
will be used to purchase specialized research equipment to be used by trainees,
and to bring investigators from other research and academic institutions to the
Minnesota campus for workshops and symposia. There is now a significant need for
the training of new researchers skilled in study of the environment. The use of
new techniques taken from a variety of physical and biological disciplines is
revolutionizing studies both of the environment and of its variation over the
course of time. The quantitative analysis of past changes in the environment,
including the study of particular ecosystems and their response to environmental
stress, is of particular relevance to the current concerns about global change.
