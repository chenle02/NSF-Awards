Ray 9630402 The integrity, as well as the diversity of chromosomes, is
maintained by recombination and yet little is known about how this mechanism is
judiciously performed, particularly in plants. A system of induced mitotic
recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which a single, defined, DNA double
strand break is delivered to the chromosome at a particular locus has been
developed. The target site of a site-specific DNA endonuclease, HO endonuclease
of yeast, is cloned into a unique chromosomal location and the break induced by
the expression of a cloned HO gene in the plant. Specific objectives are 1) to
test the hypothesis that a chromosomal double strand break in meiosis can induce
homologous recombination in Arabidopsis and 2) to determine whether ectopic
recombination can be stimulated in mitosis and meiosis by a DNA double strand
break in the plant chromosome. %%% A better understanding of the basic
mechanisms involved in recombination of plant chromosomes will result from this
study using the model plant, Arabidopsis thalania. Moreover, any movement toward
the goal of achieving site-specific recombination in plants will have
significant impact in both basic and applied research.
