The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development,
implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for
improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that
they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. In concert with the
mission of HBCU-UP, Hinds Community College-Utica Community College (HCC-UTC)
seeks to continue its legacy of preparing students to earn baccalaureate degrees
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through partnership
with partnering universities and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
focuses on strengthening the math performance of students who aspire to earn
STEM degrees. Accordingly, the project’s overarching goal is to recruit,
prepare, develop, and retain African American students who have expressed
interest in STEM fields and are at risk for failure in math courses. By
providing academic support for rising freshmen through graduation from the
community college, the following objectives will be accomplished: (1) Increased
math scores of high school students on state and ACT/Next Generation ACCUPLACER
assessments, (2) Increased success rates of students taking developmental and
college level math courses through academic supports, (3) Strengthened Math
Infrastructure at HCC-UTC to increase students’ persistence in STEM, and (4)
Transformed STEM education in rural Mississippi and beyond due to executed
research. The long-term benefit of the project will increase numbers of
qualified African Americans in STEM workforce and careers. Hinds Community
College will work within its college system, which includes seven locations, and
with its external partners to achieve the project’s goals and
objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
