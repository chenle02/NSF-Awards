investigator will use a whole-spectrum fluorescence system to study
intracellular calcium-dependent cellular triggering. When this is applied to the
fluorescent probe Indo-1 it can detect simultaneous changes in intracellular
calcium as well as a competing ion such as barium. This system will be applied
to the analysis of transients in intracellular calcium concentration
particularly the calcium influx due to ligand activated calcium channels, which
provide a second messenger in many nonexcitable cells. The PI will set up a cell
imaging and a single cell spectroscopy microscope. In its single cell mode it
will allow full spectra to be acquired with all wavelengths to be measured
simultaneously via a solid state camera attached to the spectrometer. %%% The
use of a whole-spectrum fluorescence system, which can detect simultaneous
changes in intracellular calcium as well as a competing ion, will permit the
simultaneous study of the equilibrium of Indo-1 with two different cations. A
cell imaging and single cell spectroscopy microscope will be also be set up.
These techniques will be used to correlate calcium oscillations with cell
activation. *** ; Oh +' 0 $ H l D h R:\WWUSER\TEMPLATE\NORMAL.DOT 9417750 Una
