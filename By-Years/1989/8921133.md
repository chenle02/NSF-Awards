The Synthetic Organic Program is funding the collaborative research of Dr.
Francois N. Diederich, Dr. Orville L. Chapman and Dr. Robert L. Whetten in the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles. This
interdisciplinary program combines state-of-the-art methodology in organic
synthesis and in physical chemical characterization to gain new fundamental
insights into the structure and bonding of all-carbon molecules and polymers.
The goal of the study is to probe the chemistry of new carbon allotropes that
differ from the three natural modifications which consist of graphite, diamond
and lonsdaleite. Acetylenic cycloÄ±n!carbons (n = 6-72) will be prepared as
isolable all-carbon molecules from stable, well-characterized precursors by the
use of flash pyrolysis/laser heating experiments or by photolysis. The
cyclocarbons will serve as all-carbon monomers for the controlled formation of
crystalline polymer carbon allotropes, composed of regular networks of
dehydroannulenes.
