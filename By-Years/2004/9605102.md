9605102 Herr To encourage the development of young scientists in the field of
biology, the Undergraduate Research Program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
has, since 1959, sponsored undergraduates from various institutions in the U.S.
for an intensive summer research experience. The students are housed on the
Laboratory grounds, and each one is assigned to a permanent Laboratory staff
member to perform an independent research project in the mentor's field of
expertise. Each student begins his or her project with the mentor's close
guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work independently. This allows
students to develop to their full potential and to sample first-hand the
excitement of experimental science. During the program the students present two
series of seminars: one in which they describe their proposed research and one
in which the results of each project are summarized. They attend a series of
seminars especially for the program given by the Laboratory staff, and may also
attend lectures in the post-graduate biology courses that are taking place
concurrently. This undergraduate research program focuses on the selection of
individuals who are likely to make a contribution to science in their ensuing
careers. Strong emphasis is placed on recruiting minorities. The success of the
program is evidenced by the number of past participants who have become eminent
scientists.
