This planning proposal recognizes the constraints imposed on Alaskan schools by
geography and small school populations while at the same time recognizing
Alaskan opportunities for learning in context. The Renewal component will
consider the constraints on -- and solutions to -- problems associated with
having a distributed cohort of experienced teachers participate in a brief but
intense field experience using those ubiquitous Alaskan commodities, SNOW and
ICE. The Retention portion will consider the constraints and procedures
necessary to involve small populations of novice teachers from Alaskan Districts
in 137 hours of close mentoring using the snow- and ice-field work along with
appropriate curricular materials (NSF supported GLACIER) to provide learning in
context. The final planning activities involve determining through pilot work
the adequacy of follow-up work in short 1-2 day workshops during spring breaks,
etc. as times when teachers from distributed districts can come
together.&lt;br/&gt;
