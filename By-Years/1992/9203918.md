A series of high spin polyradical molecules with distinct three-dimensional
shapes will be synthesized and characterized. The polyradical shapes will be
imposed by either steric hindrance (dendrimers) or covalent bond networks
(cages). Magnetic analysis will be accomplished by utilizing SQUID, NMR, and ESR
techniques. Molecular solids comprised of high spin polyradicals will be
developed and investigated, and the feasibility of making ultra high spin
polyradicals will be demonstrated. The investigation will provide a general
model for electron spin ordering as a function of distance and number of
unpaired electrons. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports
the work of Professor Andrzej Rajca at the University of Nebraska on the
synthesis and characterization of high spin organic molecules that possess
several unpaired electrons. Electrons in typical organic molecules are paired
and thus have no magnetic properties, whereas the target molecules will be
prototype building blocks for novel organic magnets. This investigation should
provide basic information required to produce magnets on a molecular level for a
variety of technical and scientific applications impacting on the electronics
and communications fields.
