9402891 de Szoeke This project consists of conducting long-term integrations
(>100 years) with a global ocean model based on the Bleck-Boudra GCM with
massive parallel code developed at Oregon State University (OSU) for the TMC CM5
computer. The focus of the study is on improvements on the surface fluxes and
mixed layer processes that drive the thermohaline circulation of the world
oceans. A series of idealized process experiments will be run focusing on mid-
latitude wind- and buoyancy-driven flows, interaction of mixed layer and sea ice
in sub-polar regions, the role of eddies in meridional transport of properties,
and the influence of bottom topography on mesoscale eddy dynamics. After these
process experiments are completed, a fully global eddy-resolving ocean
circulation model will be run with 12 density layers and 1/6-degree mean
horizontal resolution. ***
