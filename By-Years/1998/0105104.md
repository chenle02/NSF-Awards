The George V Coast (140 - 150 degrees E) is an understudied coastal region of
Antarctica. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research adds a biological
component to a project focusing on the shelf and bottom water formation along
the coast. This research will determine basic information on the biological
oceanography of the region and in particular, how its productivity is related to
the local hydrographic fields. The specific goals are 1) to map the chlorophyll
a distribution and the photosynthetic capacity of the phytoplankton of the
regions, 2) to characterize the phytoplankton and microzooplankton populations
in the region by direct microscopic analysis, and 3) to measure nitrate and
silicate levels in the various water masses. These goals will provide
information on to what extent biological production relates to regional water
masses, on the biological nature of the local production and the association
between function groups of plankon and the water masses of the region, and on
the interaction between phytoplankton growth and nutrient draw-down. Results
from the study can be used as the basis for more extensive hypotheses about the
biological production and flux in the region and are likely to catalyze further
research in the understudied Southern Ocean.
