The ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry is sponsoring a four day symposium
entitled "NMR Spectroscopy of Polymers". Nearly 100 papers have been submitted
as oral and poster presentations. This symposium is a major forum for this type
of work in the world. Support in the amount of $3000 will partially offset the
expenses associated with underwriting graduate students, post-doctoral
associates, and new faculty attendance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of this symposium is exemplified by the bringing together of the leading
scientists from around the world to exchange thoughts and make presentations
their recent work in this field. The broader impact is demonstrated by another
objective of this symposium being the education and development of graduate
students, post-docs, and young faculty.&lt;br/&gt;
