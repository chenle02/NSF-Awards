The award will support research on mathematical problems in fluid mechanics and
related partial differential equations and their applications, along with the
analysis and development of efficient numerical methods. The objective of this
research program is threefold: investigate important nonlinear problems
including compressible fluids with various constitutive relations, asymptotic
problems, multiphase problems, transonic flows, and develop stable and efficient
numerical algorithms; study dissipation mechanisms for nonlinear partial
differential equations, especially for compressible viscous gas flow; and
analyze and develop new theoretical techniques for the study of these problems.

Problems in fluid dynamics arise in many areas of science and engineering, for
example in gas dynamics, hydraulics, elasticity, plasticity, combustion,
magnetohydrodynamics, multiphase flow, phase transition, charge transport in
semiconductors, biological transport of ions, and etching and deposition
processes. The physical processes are typically governed by certain nonlinear
systems of partial differential equations. The award will support research on
the solvability of these nonlinear systems and the qualitative behavior of their
solutions, as well as on the analysis and development of efficient theoretical
and numerical methods. This will lead to a better understanding of these flow
phenomena and their governing laws.
