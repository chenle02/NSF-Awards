This Research Planning Grant project is in the broad area of materials chemistry
and in the subfields of electrochemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. During the
tenure of this eighteen-month standard grant, Professor Collinson and her
students at Kansas State University will undertake a fundamental investigation
of intrazeolite electron transfer. Special emphasis will be placed on
electroactive molecules permanently trapped within the zeolite framework
resulting from `ship-in-a-bottle` syntheses. A systematic investigation of
variables which influence intrazeolite electron transfer will be pursued,
particularly the concentration, distribution, and electron exchange rate of the
encapsulated redox centers. Using a suite of electrochemical and spectroscopic
probes in combination with synthetic strategies, the electroactive surface
concentration and thermodynamic redox properties of encapsulated bipyridine
complexes of divalent cobalt and ruthenium will be investigated as functions of
site density, electron exchange rate, and zeolite microenvironment. The
objective of this Research Planning Grant project is the characterization of
intrazeolite electron transfer and an exploration of the practical applications
of these unique organized molecular assemblies. This research is important to
uncovering applications of these materials in areas such as electroanalysis,
electrocatalysis, electronic materials, and optical displays.
