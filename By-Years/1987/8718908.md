Dr. Wendorf and his international team of collaborators will conduct one
season's field research at a series of archaeological sites located in the
Eastern Sahara Desert in Egypt. Previous work indicates that a series of Middle
Paleolithic sites which date to ca. 100,000 years ago are preserved in ancient
lake sediments. Dr. Wendorf plans to excavate these and to analyze the stone
tools and faunal remains which are recovered. Information thus obtained will
provide insight into both the subsistence practices and social organization of
these early inhabitants of the Sahara. The team will also collect materials
which will permit reconstruction of the changing environment and hopefully allow
absolute dates to be obtained. The research will provide insight into the
development of human behavior and show how these groups adapted to a highly
variable environment.
