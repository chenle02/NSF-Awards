Title: REU Site: Software Security

This project offers a nine-week summer program for 10 undergraduate students to
gain research experience in software security at Boise State University. During
the summer program, each student works with a faculty mentor on a carefully
designed research project. The recruiting effort focuses on students from
underrepresented groups and academic institutions with limited research
opportunities or without cybersecurity programs. At least 50% participants are
selected from other academic institutions. The intellectual merits of this
project are that the research experiences motivate undergraduate students to
purse graduate studies in software security, an area of national priority, and
that students make innovative contributions and advance the knowledge base in
emerging areas of software security. The broader significance and importance is
that this project allows a diverse pool of motivated students from
underrepresented groups and universities with limited research opportunities to
gain research experiences in software security. The process of learning how to
do research, write up and present research results, better prepares students for
their future field of study. By focusing on the critical area of software
security, an area in which there are few trained experts, the site addresses a
pressing national need by training qualified students.

Under the supervision of faculty mentors, the students work on research projects
related to various software security issues. Sample projects are assurance of
obligatory attribute-based access control, automated debugging of attribute-
based access control policies, secure development of software-defined networking
applications, and efficient symbolic execution for detection of software
vulnerability.
