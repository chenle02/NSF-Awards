The two aspects of this research focus on semiparametric regression modeling
and the properties of estimators and the comparative merits of different
approaches. In the context of survival function analysis, the estimation problem
focuses on the information in the censoring distribution and/or the observed
censoring times. In the industrial context, the problem focuses on describing
the behavior of the bootstrap methodology as used in smoothing and in
determining conditions under which this is the superior methodology. Situations
in which statistical models or functions can be described only partially in
terms of identified factors or attributes occur widely. This project considers
applications to data from medical trials and, separately, from industrial
experimentation. When known features only specify part of the model, the
unexplained part can be described in a number of different ways. This proposal
seeks to identify the conditions which make each particular choice of
methodology are sufficiently superior to make its use important.
