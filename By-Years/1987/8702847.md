The nature of freezing in orientational glasses is as yet an open question. The
proposed experimental work will investigate whether the freezing is random.
Temperature-jump nuclear magnetic resonance will be employed to determine
whether individual molecules return to the same orientation upon repeated
melting and freezing. The experiments will use the well-studied orientational
glasses potassium cyanide-bromide and sodium- potassium cyanide. The experiments
should lead to a more detailed understanding of the glassy state of matter.
Studies of simple molecular solids at high pressures have found new solid
phases. However, almost none of the work to date has studied the dynamics of
these solids. In particular, it is not known whether the orientational disorder
in the high pressure disordered phases is static or dynamic. Nuclear magnetic
resonance in diamond anvil cells, a recently developed technique, will be used
to study the orientational dynamics. Diffusion will also be measured to look for
a change in mechanism at high densities. The work will begin with nitrogen and
carbon monoxide because reliable phase diagrams are available and because of
their molecular similarities. The work should extend the understanding of high
density materials.
