The scientific objective of SAFOD is to understand the physical and chemical
processes of deformation and earthquake generation within an active, plate-
bounding fault. Comprehensive understanding will be possible only if the
structure and geochemistry of the fault zone are thoroughly documented and
integrated with other data. This collaborative effort will characterize the
composition, structure and deformation mechanisms of the San Andreas fault at
the Observatory. Observations of core and cuttings from the pilot hole and first
two phases of drilling (2004-2005), and of samples from fault exposures near the
drill site, will be integrated with geophysical and hydrologic data presented in
other SAFOD studies to address key questions regarding structure, physical
properties and mechanics of the fault, and to test hypotheses of earthquake
rupture dynamics, energy balance, and fault weakening. Work includes determining
fault rock lithology, and distributions and orientations of fractures, secondary
faults, veins, and particle sizes, and targeting key structures for detailed
microstructure, mineralogy, and geochemistry analyses.
