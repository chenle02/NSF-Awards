This award supports a conference that will inform the design of "backbone"
organizations for the NSF INCLUDES (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities
of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science) program.
NORC at the University of Chicago (an independent research institution that
delivers reliable data and rigorous analyses to guide programmatic and policy
decisions) and TERC (a nonprofit education research and development organization
based in Cambridge, MA, dedicated to improving STEM learning for all)
collaborate on Envisioning Impact, a two-part in-person and virtual event that
will inform the design of INCLUDES Alliance and National Network backbone
organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the conference are to:
(1) facilitate a shared vision of impact for INCLUDES broadening participation
projects and program; (2) stimulate discourse on key elements of a shared
measurement system for continuous improvement and outcome assessment; and (3)
inform decisions on the infrastructure and priority services INCLUDES backbone
organizations will provide to assist grantees (and others) in assessing progress
towards collective impact. The conference will bring members of three
communities together: PIs and evaluators of INCLUDES Design and Development
Launch Pilots; investigators and evaluators of other NSF-supported broadening
participation alliances, extension projects, and other collective efforts to
support inclusion and diversity in STEM; and members of prior and extant NSF-
supported knowledge-networking, collaboratory, and resource network initiatives.
Members of these communities will collaborate in two separate events: an in-
person, 1.5 day conference, and a follow-on virtual Video Hall that will allow a
larger number of participants to engage, over a one week period, in facilitated
community discourse around short video narratives produced by each project.
