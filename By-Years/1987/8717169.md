Principal Investigator Abele proposes to continue his investigation of the
evolutionary relationships among the suborders of decapod Crustacea. Crustacean
research has recently matured greatly, owing to the adoption of cladistic
techniques and high-quality ultrastructural analyses at several labs. Dr. Abele
has been among the leaders, and he continues in this leadership role by being
the first to learn and apply RNA sequencing techniques to the Crustacea. His
work to date has concentrated on morphological, behavioral and ultrastructural
data, and the proposed project would incorporate analysis of small-unit
ribosomal RNA sequence data and new explorations of spermatazoan ultrastructure.
Equipment will be obtained to create a molecular evolution laboratory at Florida
State University dedicated to the study of crustacean evolution. The project has
potential for wide impact on our understanding of crustacean systematics and
evolution. It is generally accepted that molecular data will be useful in
testing hypothetical relationships based on morphological and other data. This
study will be among those rare projects that integrate diverse data types.
