This project focuses on the design of a controller for active suppression of
vibration produced by unknown disturbing forces which cannot be measured
directly. The design procedure comprises two stages including the design of an
observer to reconstruct the system state and the disturbance based on the system
outputs, and the design of a controller which cancels or minimizes the effect of
the disturbance. The proposed approach for the design of the observer does not
assume any a priori information about the disturbance such as statistical data
or waveforms of the disturbance. The idea here is to design an observer which
includes an additional term to account for the disturbance. The controller
itself will be designed to cancel external force entirely, provided the
disturbing force can be reconstructed by the observer. This research is intended
for application to vehicle active suspension systems, and for active vibration
absorbers for manufacturing machines such as forging hammers, press machines,
etc.
