9422059 Gabriel Support is provided for a collaborative proposal between Dean
Gabriel, University of Florida, and Deng Xiuxin, Huazhong Agricultural
University, Wuhan, China, on genetic transformation of citrus for resistance to
Xanthomonas, a major cause of disease in citrus. The research proposed contains
innovative ideas to combat a serious disease of citrus. There will be a two way
exchange of biotechnology: research training in molecular cloning from the US,
and citrus tissue culture expertise from China. Through the cooperation of
Chinese and US laboratories working on this important problem, both practical
knowledge important for a major US and Chinese crop, and fundamental knowledge
in plant biotechnology will be advanced. The genetic work on manipulation of
bacteria will be done in Florida and complementary work including bioassays and
field- testing of the genetically altered citrus lines will be conducted in
China. The international cooperation is essential to the success of the project,
providing complementary expertise and opportunities for field testing not
available in the United States. Support is recommended. Alice Hogan
