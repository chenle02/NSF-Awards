In living systems, noise in gene expression can lead to differences in
phenotype, even among genetically identical cells. This project will study the
basis for different phenotypes occurring in animals carrying the same genotype,
using the development of the gut in the nematode C. elegans as a model. The
genetic pathway controlling specification of the gut involves transient
activation of the genes end-1 and end-3. Mutated versions of these genes have
been introduced into C. elegans animals that lack the normal copies. Preliminary
results show that only some embryos make gut, and that surviving adults have
abnormal guts. This project will study the basis for these effects. First, the
development of the gut in end mutant embryos will be examined at high
resolution. Second, global gene expression in adult guts will be compared with
normal animals, and possible defects in function of genes in the gut
specification pathway will be tested. Third, sources of noise in the upstream-
most components of gut specification will be measured, and genes whose products
influence the stochastic specification of gut will be identified. Reverse
genetics (using RNA interference), time lapse microscopy, and high-throughput
sequencing of expressed genes (RNA-Seq) will be used. The experiments will
describe gut development at high resolution in a new set of mutants,
characterize defects in adult intestines derived from the mutant strains, and
identify possible sources of gene expression noise in organ specification. The
work has the potential to define new paradigms for how living systems manage
inherent differences in gene expression during development. In the course of
performing this work, the PI, himself of Hispanic descent, will train
undergraduates from the diverse UC Riverside campus, and a graduate student. A
laboratory course for first-year Biology undergraduates will train students in
research and allow them to carry out original research.
