&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall research goal of this proposal is to design,
develop, evaluate and deploy Pragma, the next generation adaptive runtime
infrastructure capable of reactively and proactively managing and optimizing
application execution using current system and application state, predictive
models for system behavior and application performance, and an agent based
control network. The overarching motivation for this research is to enable very
large-scale, dynamically adaptive scientific and engineering simulations on
widely distributed and highly heterogeneous and dynamic execution environments
such as the computational "grid". The design, development and evaluation of the
proposed Pragma framework will be conducted in collaboration with the Astronomy
Department at the University of Arizona in the context of a real-world
astrophysical hydrodynamics simulation using adaptive mesh refinement and
including multigroup flux-limited diffusion, self gravity, nuclear burning, and
a complex equation of state.&lt;br/&gt;
