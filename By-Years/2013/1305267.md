This infrastructure proposal, acquiring two Kinova JACO Research arms to upgrade
aging mobile manipulators, will enable fundamental research in interactive
perception with non-rigid objects. Traditionally, robotics has focused upon
rigid objects. The PI team proposes to enable study of the problem of sifting
through a cluttered pile of non-rigid objects, many of which are occluding one
another, and properly classifying and manipulating each object. The proposed
work is not merely concerned with computing grasp points of rigid objects for
which training examples are available for off-line learning; rather the focus is
upon segmenting, grasping, and interacting with non-rigid objects for which
models are difficult to construct. The aim is to merge ideas from interactive
perception with those of the textile manipulationn to learn object properties
over time and interact with objects in unstructured environments.

Non-rigid objects are important in a number of highly-visible industries, such
as textiles and automotive manufacturing, so broader impacts are numerous.
Moreover, automated laundry folding will have a significant impact on service
robots, where products such as vacuum cleaning robots and lawn mowing robots
have already reached the commercial sector. The findings of the research will be
made available to the research community via conference proceedings and journal
publications, and the research will be integrated into existing courses to reach
undergraduate and graduate students. Presentations to nearby schools to
introduce disadvantaged and underrepresented high school students to STEM
careers is included in the outreach plan.
