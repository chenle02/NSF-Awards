This project emphasizes the acquisition and use of semantic information,
focusing on robust parsing of natural language inputs (in limited domains).
Further, this research addresses the problems of portability, reliability, and
habitability. It outlines the development of a set of interactive tools which
provide, to both the linguist and the end-user, an accurate set of domain-
specific co-occurrence patterns (subject-verb-object and host-modifier
combinations allowed in the domain). This set of tools will partly automate the
creation of the Domain Information Schema (DIS), namely, the domain-specific
information required for processing a given domain. The same set of tools,
provided with a different interface for the end-user, will be used to support
interactive text entry. The tools will provide detailed feedback on where the
system fails to process the text, due to missing or incompatible semantic co-
occurrence patterns.
