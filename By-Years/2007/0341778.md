2004 Gordon Conference on Genes and Behavior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of
how genes influence behavior is one of the important frontiers in the life
sciences and holds profound promise to illuminate diverse areas of biology.
Funds are requested to help support travel costs for people participating in the
first Gordon Research Conference on Genes and Behavior, to be held on 8-13
February 2004 at the Holiday Inn, Ventura, California. Gordon Conferences are
renowned for catalyzing activity in new fields. This Conference will focus on
selected, important topics at the interface of animal behavior, neurobiology,
genetics, molecular biology, and evolutionary biology, to catalyze a broader
synthesis of the study of "genes and behavior." We aim to bring together for the
first time those that study behavior in nature in carefully selected "model
behavioral systems" with those who study behavior in the laboratory with "model
genetic systems." The principal goal is to create an environment, according to
the well established and highly respected Gordon Research Conference format, in
which experts and trainees in areas of science central to the meeting focus can
start to build connections and collaborations to forge a comprehensive approach
to the study of genes and behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
