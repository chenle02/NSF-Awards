This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at Duke
University, with Professor Robert L. Clark as principal investigator, addresses
both scientific and engineering aspects of nanopatterning of surfaces and in-
situ nanofabrication that will directly impact biotechnology, biologically
inspired engineering, transducers and electronics at nanoscale. Instrumentation
based on scanning probe lithography and dip-pen lithography will be developed
for use in specially designed nanolithography. New fabrication methods will be
developed for nanometer length structures with biomolecules and stimulus-
responsive macromolecules.
