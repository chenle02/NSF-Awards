This award will provide for half the funds necessary to acquire an automated
carbonate preparation system which will be attached to and integrated with an
existing gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The additional funds for
this acquisition have been committed by the University of Colorado. The
equipment will be used primarily by faculty and students in the Department of
Geological Sciences and the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research(INSTAAR).
The automated preparation system will make it possible to increase greatly the
number of samples that can be processed,thereby lowering costs per sample.
Research projects to be supported by this equipment cover a broad range of
topics including paleoclimate studies,recent climate changes based on studies of
corals,carbonate diagenesis,and Paleozoic paleooceanography.
