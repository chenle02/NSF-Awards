This research involves a variety of new data-analytic techniques for processing
and modeling high dimensional data that arise from many scientific disciplines.
These range from varying-coefficient models from epidemiology and environmental
statistics, time-inhomogeneous diffusion models from finance, curves and images
data from ophthalmology, marketing and biostatistics, to wavelet applications in
statistics and engineering. The research enhances significantly the availability
of tools and software for analyzing these complicated high-dimensional data.

The research covers a wide array of methodological developments and foundational
research. In particular, four inter-related topics are focussed. Firstly, a two-
step strategy is proposed for efficient estimation in varying-coefficient
models. This is particularly useful when coefficient functions admit different
degrees of smoothness. The proposed methods will be justified by carefully
formulated asymptotic theory and simulations. The proposed methods extends to
longitudinal studies and likelihood-based models such as generalized linear
models. Secondly, time-inhomogeneous diffusion models are proposed to model
term-structure dynamics and asset pricing. These nonparametric models aim at
addressing inadequacy of over simplified parametric models. Various data-
analytic modeling techniques are proposed and justified by both theoretical
studies and empirical research. Thirdly, wavelet applications to a variety of
statistical problems are discussed. The proposed approaches derive from
statistical modeling prospective and are based on penalized likelihood idea. Our
aim is to expand the applicability of wavelets in statistics and to improve
efficiency of some existing techniques. In particular, likelihood based models,
robustness, denoising correlated data and additive modeling are proposed for
investigation. Finally, some statistical inference problems arising from
processing curves and images data are investigated.
