This project improves the laboratory portion of the Animal Tissue Culture
course, facilitating addition of two new laboratory exercises. The equipment
acquired includes a modern biological safety cabinet, a carbon dioxide
incubator, and a liquid nitrogen freezer. New exercises added to the course
include the karyotyping of human cultured cells and the oncogenic transformation
of normal chicken embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus. Students observe the
initiation of the transformed phenotype and compare properties of normal and
transformed cells.
