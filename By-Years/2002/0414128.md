The basal boundary of glaciers and ice sheets is generally not observationally
accessible. This poses a major problem for glacier modeling studies, because the
basal boundary condition is an essential part of a well-posed problem. The
surface, however, is accessible to ground based, airborne, and satellite
measurements. It is now possible to measure surface topography, ice thickness,
and surface velocities over large areas. This sets up a classic inverse problem
in mathematics with too many boundary conditions at the top and not enough at
the bottom. Funds are provided to apply inverse methods, common in geophysics
and other areas, to the problem of inferring subsurface glacier flow. A first
step with a one-dimensional linear forward model has been accomplished. The
funded effort will expand that work to non-linear two- and three-dimensional
problems. Powerful methods of inverse theory and optimal control will be applied
to solving these problems. The research goals will require obtaining new results
in these two fields of mathematics as well as in numerical analysis. The
resulting methods will be applied to existing data and thus no additional field
work is required.
