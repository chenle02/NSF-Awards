This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the feasibility of
recovering the valuable metallic and reinforcing components of metal-matrix
composite (MMC) materials in order to eliminate the needless environmental
releases of fine inert particulates and harmful metal leachates.
PyrometallurgicaI and electrometallurgicaI reprocessing of aluminum and
magnesium matrix MMC's will be evaluated and a new flowsheet will be designed to
accommodate the unique processing technology. Two major benefits will result
from the eventual commercialization of a composite recycling process. First, a
potentially severe source of environmental hazard will be eliminated by
reprocessing composite scrap material directly at the point of origin. Second,
both valuable metals and high strength reinforcements will be efficiently
reprocessed into new composite structures resulting in overall savings of labor,
materials, energy and cost. This research is consistent with the Environmental
Engineering program objectives. The investigators are highly qualified to carry
out the research. This proposal was in response to SBIR Phase I Program
Announcement NSF 86-19. An award of $40,000 for six months starting February 1,
1987 is recommended.
