This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
and the Biochemistry Program provides the third year of a three-year continuing
grant to support the work of Dr. Jacqueline K. Barton of the California
Institute of Technology. In collaboration with Dr. Lawrence A. Chasin of
Columbia University, Dr. Barton will evaluate the usefulness of chiral metal
complexes as probes of the secondary structure of DNA. Such metal complexes have
proven useful in identifying segments of DNA with altered conformations, such as
the so-called Z-DNA and cruciform DNA.
