A major redevelopment project is being undertaken in the calculus-differential
equations sequence which is taught each quarter to about 900 students in the
sciences, engineering, and computer science. The most basic concepts of these
subjects are being developed graphically, and the visual impact of the graphical
development is expected to lead to a stronger qualitative intuition for the
subject. Once the qualitative intuition that graphics provides is in place, the
students have a framework in which to imbed a more quantitative algebraic
development of the same concepts. This approach will enhance the student's
ability in analyzing and then solving scientific problems. For these purposes
computers and symbolic manipulations software are providing graphical
capabilities. Equally important to the project is the interactive notebook
feature of Mathematica which is imperative to the exploratory approach
incorporated into laboratory projects. A philosophical belief of this project is
that experimentation fosters intuition; and intuition builds mathematical skills
and the confidence to use them.
