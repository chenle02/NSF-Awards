Using 13 years of SRS-sponsored attitudinal data, the PI will use multivariate
analyses to identify important independent variables to explain attentiveness
and other concepts of interest to the program. Further, the project will explore
possible changes over time in these variables, with particular emphasis on
male/female differences in attentiveness to science and how the explanatory
variables for these differences may be changing.
