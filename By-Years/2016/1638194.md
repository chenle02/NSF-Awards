This one year EAGER project seeks to do the following: (i) conduct a set of
numerical experiments to verify the investigator's previous analytic work
demonstrating the adjustment process during weather model initialization using
what are called "adjoint methods"; (ii) determine whether evidence for an
adjoint adjustment holds in a time-dependent basic state and how adjustment is
manifest in sensitivities to direct and diagnosed model variables; and (iii)
describe how ensemble-derived sensitivities from the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model compare with adjoint derived sensitivities and determine
whether there is evidence that an adjustment process can be seen in these
sensitivities as well.

The key features of this EAGER project are: (i) it provides a robust, previously
tested foundation for understanding the adjustment process seen in the adjoints
of operational and research NWP models, (ii) a pathway to develop and interpret
sensitivities to potential vorticity (PV) and the unbalanced components of the
flow in diagnostic case studies of weather systems using adjoint models, and
(iii) the work will provide insight into whether the balanced or unbalanced
components of data innovations are preserved in 4DVAR data assimilation.
