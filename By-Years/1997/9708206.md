This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to
construct new density functionals for use in quantum chemistry. All of the
popular functionals in use today lead to difficult three-dimensional integrals
that cannot be computed exactly and which are estimated approximately using
large three-dimensional grids. This project approaches the problem by devising
functionals which, by construction, can be integrated exactly and which,
therefore, require no grids. The work will proceed in a number of stages and
should yield "gridless" functionals for the exchange and correlation energies.
It should also yield "gridless" functionals for the kinetic energy. The results
will be published in respected journals and presented at international
scientific conferences. The use of gridless density functionals offers two
advantages over present methods: (1) The results will not be contaminated by
"grid noise", the error introduced by the imperfect quadrature afforded by a
finite numerical grid. (2) Exact integration is much more efficient than
quadrature on a three-dimensional grid (with thousands of grid points per atom)
and, as a result, gridless calculations should require much less computing time
than grid-based ones. The new functionals, will be implemented within the
software package and made available commercially to computational scientists in
a future release. Because gridless density functional calculations will be both
more numerically robust and more computationally efficient than grid-based
calculations, their availability will allow computational scientists to
undertake first principles quantum mechanical studies of larger and more
complicated systems than were previously accessible. This will benefit research
in biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, new materials and elsewhere.
