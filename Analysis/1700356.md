This annual conference, which began in 1978 and of which the 2017 meeting will
be the forty-first installment, is considered to be the premier conference of
its type by the members of the real analysis community. The featured speakers in
the 2017 event include Bruce Hanson, Mikhail Korobkov, Assaf Naor, and Artur
Nicolau. They will address topics ranging from differentiability properties of
functions to the geometry of Banach spaces. The program allows ample time for
junior mathematicians to present their work.
