Iron is an essential nutrient and the ability to accumulate iron from the diet
is crucial for human health. Currently, more people suffer from malnutrition due
to micronutrient deficiencies than from deficiencies of protein or energy and it
is estimated that over 2 billion people worldwide suffer from iron deficiency.
In agriculture, the availability of iron in soil plays a major part in
determining crop yields. In addition, plants are the main dietary source of iron
for much of the world's population. However, iron can also be toxic to both
plants and animals when present at high levels. Thus, all cells must carefully
regulate iron uptake. The long-range goal of these studies is to understand how
plants take up iron from the soil and how plants maintain proper iron levels in
the various cells/tissues of the plant. A combined genetic, molecular and
biochemical approach will be used to address two major open questions regarding
iron metabolism in plants. First, experiments will be conducted to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms underlying iron transfer to mitochondria. Second,
experiments will be conducted to decipher the mechanisms involved in plant iron
deficiency signaling response pathways. The proposed studies will ultimately
lead to a better understanding of iron uptake in plants and to the design of
plants that are capable of growth on iron deficient soils and that accumulate
iron and thus have a higher nutritional value. This collaborative project will
provide unique mentoring opportunities. Because the Biology Dept at USC has a
large number of minority students, the proposed research project has the
potential for increasing representation in the sciences by these
underrepresented groups. An exchange program between USC and Dartmouth will be
established that will allow promising young USC undergraduates to experience
research in both the Guerinot and Connolly labs. First-generation, low-income
undergraduate students from groups under-represented in the sciences will be
recruited and trained in the latest genomic, molecular and biochemical methods.
