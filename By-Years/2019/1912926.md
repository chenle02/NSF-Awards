This award will provide funds to partially support the 22nd annual Conference
Experience for Undergraduates (CEU), which will be held as part of the Fall
Meeting of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. This meeting will be held in
Crystal City, VA October 13 - 17, 2019. The CEU is a natural venue for students
who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of
their research and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior
researchers. The CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this
interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to
research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know
some of the junior future leaders. Partial support will be provided for
approximately 20 undergraduate students, out of a planned total of
140.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
