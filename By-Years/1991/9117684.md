This project is to use negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry techniques
to examine the 187Re-187Os isotope systematics of the Pechenga ferropicrites and
associated Ni-Cu ores (Kola peninsula, USSR). The specific objectives of this
research are: 1) to obtain information about the Os isotopic compositions of the
mantle sources for these rocks, and constrain the geochemical behavior of Re and
Os doing mantle melting and the subsequent crystal-liquid differentiation that
produced these compositionally diverse suites, and 2) to utilize the Re-Os
system as a tracer for determining the sources of noble metals contained in the
Pechenga ores. Ultimately, because of the geochemical characteristics of Re and
Os, the Re-Os system will provide new insights into the chemical evolution of
the mantle and crust, and lead to a better understanding of noble metal ore
formation.
