Under this grant, the PI will work on problems related to surfaces in
3-manifolds. The virtual Haken conjecture asks whether any aspherical closed
3-manifold has a finite-sheeted cover which contains a closed surface which
injects on the fundamental group. The PI proposes to work on this conjecture
making use of recent results of Kahn-Markovic and Wise. This would have
ramifications for related conjectures, such as the virtual fibering conjecture,
and would greatly elucidate the structure of 3-manifolds and their invariants,
such as twisted Alexander polynomials. The PI also proposes to study the
Thurston norm, and the relation between various surfaces realizing the Thurston
norm in a minimal homology class via sutured manifold hierarchies. He hopes to
use these relations to study various questions about the Thurston norm and its
relation to other invariants of the 3-manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
mathematical study of 3-dimensional spaces goes back to the work of Poincare.
Because classical physics describes our universe to be a 3-dimensional space,
the classification of 3-dimensional spaces is an important mathematical
endeavor, since it may have ramifications for the global structure of our
universe. This project will pursue various aspects of the classification of
3-dimensional spaces. The principal and most ambitious project will study
2-dimensional objects inside of 3-dimensional spaces, and how one may resolve
these in related "covering spaces". Studying these 2-dimensional objects has
implications for the global structure of finite 3-dimensional spaces. The
techniques of the project will have relations to other areas of mathematics such
as group theory, geometry, and the study of 4-dimensional spaces.
