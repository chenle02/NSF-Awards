This grant provides partial funds for the organization of the 16th International
Conference on Noncontact Atomic Force Microscopy (NC-AFM) at the University of
Maryland, College Park on August 5-9, 2013, specifically to support travel
stipends and to enable the participation of U.S. graduate students and junior
faculty members. The conference will host approximately 60 oral presentations
and 100 posters focusing on topics such as sub-atomic imaging resolution in
ultra-high vacuum and milli-Kelvin temperatures, nanoscale tribology, chemical
force microscopy and multi-scale modeling techniques that combine atomistic
simulation with classical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hosting the conference
in the U.S. in 2013 will enable a large number of domestic investigators to
attend and interact with the most prominent researchers in the field of NC-AFM,
most of whom reside in Europe and Japan. Exposure of young investigators to
presentations on the latest NC-AFM techniques and their application to
scientific and engineering problems will help educate the next generation of
scientists and raise the level of interest in the U.S., such that the country
can emerge as a competitor in this important area of nanoscale science and
technology.
