This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
selectively direct-current permeable pedicle screw surface for use with patent-
pending osteogenic spinal fusion instrumentation. New bone matrix more rapidly
incorporates the bone graft material in the presence of an electric field to
form a robust, biomechanically sound, intersegmental union. As the screw
transmits current into the bone, peri-screw anchorage strength is also increased
because of the local osteogenic effects. Pedicle screw loosening is a factor
that contributes to clinically unacceptable failure rate (20-40%) associated
with spinal fusion surgery. Based on preliminary work, the proposed
instrumentation system has the potential to significantly improve outcomes by
increasing fusion rate and robustness. Precise control of the electric field
delivered through the pedicle screws is necessary to optimize the osteogenic
capabilities.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of
commercially available osteogenic instrumentation with the potential to improve
surgical outcomes, thus reducing the high incidence of additional surgery,
chronic pain and cost associated with failed fusion. In future iterations, it
could potentially be used to accelerate fracture repair of the skull, face, and
other sites. Because bone repair mechanisms are similar across species, it may
one day offer veterinary orthopedic surgeons a means to help their animal
patients.
