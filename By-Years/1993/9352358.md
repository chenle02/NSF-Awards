9352358 Thompson This project is designed to upgrade microcomputer laboratory
facilities in geography. Most of the facilities are utilized in the
undergraduate geography curriculum, principally at the intermediate and advanced
levels, and impact various courses. Undergraduate students have access to
personal computer workstations equipped with various graphics and text
peripherals. Various special-purpose computer software packages and updates are
also available. The project has improved computing facilities and maintains and
en- hances high-quality instruction of undergraduate students in the discipline.
