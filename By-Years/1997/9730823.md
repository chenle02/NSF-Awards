OCE-9730639 Barth The project is to finish the analysis of the data collected
during the Coastal Jet Separation experiment and to definitively evaluate
dynamical theories for the separation from the coast of an along-shore upwelling
jet. Analysis tasks include construction and interpretation of sections and maps
of potential vorticity, spiciness and ADCP stream- function. Dynamical insights
will be gained by applying steady, layered, potential vorticity conserving
models, but extensions to time-dependent model will be pursued as needed.
