The late Jurassic to early Cretaceous history of the Peninsular Ranges,
California is thought to involve collision of an oceanic arc with cratonic North
America, collapsing a sedimentary basin between. However, a prominent shear zone
thought to record this collision has been shown to involve rocks of too young an
age and has extensional, not contractional kinematics. This project will involve
detailed mapping of the Cuyamaca- Laguna Mountains shear zone, study of oriented
samples and radiometric age dating. Results should provide a test of the
collisional model for the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous of the Peninsular
Ranges.
