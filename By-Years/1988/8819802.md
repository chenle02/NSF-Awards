Research will be performed on fundamental and relevant problems in theoretical
astrophysics and cosmology that focus on the areas of cosmology and galaxy
formation. One investigation will be of the angular anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation in open cosmological models. Small deviations
from anisotropy are inevitable and probe the origin of the large-scale structure
in the Universe. Detailed predictions are necessary to compare with experiments
in progress. A second research area will be a study of galaxy evolution.
Emphasis will be placed on developing improved models of protogalaxies and
predicting their luminosity, spectral and chemical evolution, with application
to deep surveys, studies of the background light, intergalactic gas, and
contributions to baryonic dark matter.
