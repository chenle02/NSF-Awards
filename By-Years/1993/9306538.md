investigate the use of an amorphous silicon/ferroelectric liquid crystal
optically addressed spatial light modulator (OASLM) (5) as essentially real time
film on which to record the fringe patterns and perform the Fourier transform
via a coherent optical processor. Since this device has a frame rate of ~3 kHz
the PIV optical processor should be capable of 3 orders of magnitude speed
increase over the best convential electronic processor. ***
