Three mathematicians within the Purdue University-Indiana University system will
teach three small (25-30 students) prototype calculus courses based on computer,
computer languages and algebra systems. The geometric and conceptual aspects of
calculus, solution of applied problems, and reduction of routine drill by using
symbolic manipulation will be emphasized. These courses will include both
mainstream and non-mainstream calculus. The extent of the use of computer labs
and the use of the ISTEL and Maple software packages will vary. A consulting
board of 25 experts from the various academic disciplines will suggest
applications from science and mathematics from the latter third of the 20th
century. A unique component of this project will be research on how students
come to understand or not to understand the underlying ideas in calculus.
Theoretical analysis, observations and experiments on the teaching and learning
of calculus will be formulated. Purdue University will share project costs.
