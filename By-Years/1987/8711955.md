Moth sex pheromone communication systems are an important factor in effecting
species reproductive specificity in the field, and they have been utilized in
pest management programs to monitor and suppress certain pest species. Research
in the present proposal will investigate different biochemical routes that are
used by female moths to produce the unique chemical blends of pheromones used by
each species. A comparison of biosynthetic routes used by primitive species
found in New Zealand to those used by species in North America will be carried
out to obtain information on the evolution of these enzyme systems. Key enzymes,
particularly a unique desaturase, used in these biochemical pathways will be
characterized and compared among species. Concurrent with these
characterizations will be a study of the mRNA's that encode for those unique
enzymes. The long-term goal of this effort will be to identify the genes and the
regulation of the expression of the genes involved in the production of the sex
pheromone compounds. At some later date, the techniques may be available to
insert these genes in agricultural crops as a means for developing novel insect
control programs.
