9308804 Currie Selection of particular motor patterns is a complex process that
depends on the integration of sensory information with information about
internal state. Both spatial and temporal integration of information by
specialized interneurons is required for appropriate pattern selection. This NSF
award to a new young investigator is to establish a novel model system for the
study of this phenomenon. The behavior involved is a particular form of the
scratch reflex in which a brief stimulus sets up a pattern of excitation that
far outlasts the stimulus. Dr. Currie will investigate the pharmacological and
physiological mechanisms that spinal interneurons use to "remember" the
stimulus. For these experiments he will utilize a newly developed enzyme-treated
carbon-fiber microelectrode that can detect the release of the neurotransmitter
glutamate with exquisite temporal (millisecond) resolution. The results of these
investigations will aid in our understanding of human motor control and spinal
cord function. ***
