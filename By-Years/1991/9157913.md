Over the next five years, the Principal Investigator (PI) plans to uncover
experimentally and model mathematically the regulatory interactions that control
secondary metabolite synthesis, product secretion, and growth of plant cells.
The PI also plans to design recombinant organisms capable of rapid, simultaneous
bioconversion of hazardous compounds into biomass, or chiral molecules for use
as stereospecific feedstocks.
