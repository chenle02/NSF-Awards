9529846 Pillsbury In this project, the PI will assist in implementing phase 2 of
ARLINDO (Indonesian acronym for Indonesian Throughflow), called ARLINDO
Circulation (AC). The objective is to study the circulation and water mass
stratification within the Indonesian Seas in order to formulate a thorough
description of the source, spreading patterns, inter-ocean transport and
dominant mixing processes. AC is specifically aimed at resolving the throughflow
transport and velocity field across the central passages of the Indonesian Seas,
and extending hydrography to the eastern Banda Sea. Moorings are designed to
measure the mean and variable current and thermohaline stratification. The PI in
this award will be responsible for constructing and deploying the current meter
and temperature pod moorings under the direction of the lead PI, Gordon.
