This project will address the presence of parameter-tampering security holes in
web applications. Current market tools do not appear to have the capabilities to
detect these security holes in an automatic fashion. Parameter tampering
vulnerabilities are rampant in commercial as well as open source web
applications. Further, it has been shown that these vulnerabilities could be
exploited by malicious actors to make financial gains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It
is important to note that the proposed solution is unique in the sense that it
offers not only to detect the web security, but also to fix the issue by
correcting the code. If successfully deployed, this effort holds the promise of
addressing an emerging security threat in a manner that is both robust and cost-
effective.
