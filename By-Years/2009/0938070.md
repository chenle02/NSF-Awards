This award provides support for the Modern Mathematics Workshop, which will be
held in conjunction with the 2009 SACNAS National Conference in Dallas, Texas on
October 14-15, 2009. The award provides partial support of faculty and post-docs
to participate in a two-day workshop which describes the mathematical
underpinning of the upcoming 2010-2011 year programs at a consortium of US-
based Mathematics Institutes. The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM), the
Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), the Institute for Pure and
Applied Mathematics (IPAM), the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI), the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), the Park City Mathematics
Institute (PCMI), and the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences
Institute (SAMSI) have all agreed to host the two-day workshop. By joining
together, they aim to make the Workshop attendees feel welcome to participate in
their programs, and become familiar with all the opportunities that the
Mathematics Institutes offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will also
feature a speaker who will address the underrepresented minority undergraduates
in a three-hour mini-course. The speaker will encourage students to see the
various ways in which mathematics acts as the glue among the STEM sciences.
