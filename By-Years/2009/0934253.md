Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Water Equipment and Policy

0934407 University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee; Erik Christensen 0934253 Marquette
University; Michael Switzenbaum The Center for Water Equipment and Policy will
continue along existing efforts being made in the Milwaukee region with respect
to fostering collaboration and promoting economic development in the area of
water. University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) and Marquette University (MU) are
collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UWM as the lead
institution.

By planning and coordinating research activities and programs on water
equipment, quality and policy, this center will combine existing strengths with
important problems in fresh water management. With recent advances in materials,
sensors, and control hardware/software, the timing is right for advances in
knowledge and application to improved water equipment and policy. The PI and
research team are qualified, and both the UWM PI and MU PI have demonstrated
leadership.

The proposed work will have a wide impact on industry's competitiveness and
ability to adopt new technology. The teams of researchers and the center
director, in conjunction with the industrial advisory board will select high
priority projects that have the potential to improve the profitability of water
equipment manufacturers and help obtain higher quality of water. The proposed
center plans to recruit underrepresented students to work on projects that are
of direct industrial relevance, and to work with the Society of Women Engineers
and the National Society of Black Engineers student organizations to attract
qualified minority students.
