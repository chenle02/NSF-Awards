9361271 Sachs The goal of this project is to improve the prediction and
optimization of the performance of polymer gels in applications in the
agricultural, pharmaceutical, and chemical production and purification
industries. These improvements will be brought about by increased understanding
of transport, flow, and swelling in polymer gels through: (1) elucidation of the
physical phenomena fundamental to their behavior; (2) quantification of these
phenomena in a mathematical model; and (3) development of an experimentally
verified software tool implementing these models. Design and optimization of
gel-based technologies could be significantly accelerated by this software. In
Phase I, numerical computations based on a prototype model will predict gel
swelling and stresses, charge density, solute concentrations, and solute and
solvent fluxes. The model will be validated by comparing its predictions with an
experiment on release of blue dextrans. ***
