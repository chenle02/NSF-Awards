The relationships between brain cell metabolism and functional activity, studies
of amino-acid metabolism and the effects of pharmacological agents basic studies
of glucose metabolism and mechanisms of glucose homeostasis. New NMR-based
functional brain imaging methods for assessing neuronal activation in response
to specific cognitive and sensory stimuli. Susceptibility contrast effects from
alterations in blood oxygenation in the microvasculature that can be used to
detect regional brain activation. This application is unique in that it involves
the combined efforts of scientists who are leaders in spectroscopic studies of
metabolism and physiology, in imaging of brain functional activity and other
aspects of MR imaging science, as well as leading neuroscientists. A high degree
of synergy will occur between the spectroscopic and imaging studies, and the
resource will be the primary system for advanced NMR applications serving an
experienced community of users.
