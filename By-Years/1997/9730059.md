ABSTRACT 9730059 Michael Nathanson Yale University A Two-Photon Imaging System
for Biological Research and Education This proposal will fund the purchase of a
two-photon excitation imaging system for the Center for Cell Imaging at Yale
University School of Medicine. Specifically, the Center's confocal microscope
will be upgraded to have two- photon capability. Two photon laser excitation
imaging has several properties that make it unique, even relative to point
scanning confocal imaging. Two photon imaging permits more highly localized
excitation of fluorophores, excitation of dyes that excite at lower wavelengths,
much deeper sample penetration, less photobleaching, and less cytotoxicity than
conventional confocal microscopy. These features improve spatial resolution,
especially in thicker tissue preparations such as intact organs, and make it
possible for the first time to photolyse caged compounds or photobleach dyes in
highly localized, submicron-sized intracellular regions. No two-photon imaging
system is currently available at the School of Medicine, although a number of
investigators require this technology to advance their research efforts. The
range of projects that will make immediate use of this technology include flash
photolysis of caged second messengers to examine regulation of Cai2+ signals at
the subcellular level, photolysis of caged oligonucleotides to perform in situ
PCR at the single cell level, immunochemistry of intact embryos and larvae,
examination of acid production in intact gastric glands, examination of
intercellular Cai2+ waves in intact, perfused livers, and distribution and
trafficking of GFP-labeled proteins in tissues (including brain slices) and in
whole brains of transgenic animals. In addition, the Center for Cell Imaging is
the only such imaging resource available to all investigators at the School of
Medicine. Therefore, the acquisition of the two-photon imaging system by the
Center will insure that any investigator at the school will have access to this
technology now and in the future.
