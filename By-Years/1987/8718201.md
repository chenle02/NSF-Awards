This Special Year in Algebra at the University of Washington will emphasize
topics in non-commutative ring theory and their applications to rings of
differential operators and enveloping algebras. Featured will be long term
visits from M. Artin, J. T. Stafford, and T. Levasseur, and other visitors for
varying durations throughout the year. The University of Washington will provide
the bulk of the funds for this activity. Ring theory is a large core area of
algebra that has interconnections with, and applications to, many areas of
mathematics.
