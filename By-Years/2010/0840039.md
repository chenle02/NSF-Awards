This proposal seeks support for a conference/symposium grant to provide an
opportunity for African American faculty members in science education to
interact with their academic colleagues and enhance their knowledge of research
being pursued in science education. It proposes to convene a
conference/symposium to develop a cadre of African American science education
faculty to research issues surrounding the teaching and learning of science.
This cadre of African American faculty will develop a research agenda, submit
grant proposals for funding, and submit manuscripts for publication. The overall
goal of this project is to improve K-12 teaching and learning by faculty
development of the research scholarship of African American science educators in
the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
