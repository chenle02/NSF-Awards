Optical instruments for performing linewidth measurement or for finding the
geometry of small features are limited by the resolution associated with the
wavelength of light. Basis optical theory states that features small than one-
half of the illumination wavelength are unresolvable. However, information is
present in the image about higher spatial frequencies than given by the optical
resolution. By utilizing deconvolution, superresolution, or high resolution
microscopy techniques, information about higher spatial frequencies may be
extracted. The aim of this research is to investigate techniques of obtaining
accurate submicron linewidth measurement for implementation in an
interferometric optical profiler with the hope of measuring features on the
order of 0.1 um in extent. An applicable technique would be useful in a
commercial product. Possible applications include the measurement of integrated
circuit or integrated optical device geometries as well as measurement of pits
in compact disk masters, and magnetic recording head geometry.
