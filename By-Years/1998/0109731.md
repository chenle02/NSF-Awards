This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project details the
roadmap to rapid commercialization of a powerful new gas chromatography (GC)
detector, the Aromatic Specific Laser Ionization Detector (ArSLID). Like a
conventional photoionization detector (PID), the ArSLID creates ions by
photoabsorption. But its two-photon laser ionization process confers many
significant advantages over the PID, including: extraordinarily low limit of
detection, potentially the lowest of any GC detector; extremely fast response
ideally suited for fast GC; miniscule background signal; far higher selectivity
for aromatic hydrocarbons; stable esponse over long periods of time; and
compatible with all carrier gases, including air. Preliminary data taken with a
prototype ArSLID already show the low background, selectivity, and sensitivity;
it is as sensitive as any PID (ca. 1 pg toluene injected on-column). At least an
order of magnitude further improvement will be achieved in Phase I with
incorporation of a compact, low cost microchip laser ionization source that also
offers much higher pulse repetition frequency and shot-to-shot stability
compared to the laser source used to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ArSLID will
find numerous applications that are difficult or impossible for a PID to meet.
In the case of environmental analysis, the signals from the toxic and hazardous
aromatic species (specifically the BTEX fraction) are too often buried in the
aliphatic signals with a PID. Similarly, in pharmaceutical analysis,
approximately 75% of the drugs contain an aromatic moiety and it is often
challenging to find the drugs or their metabolites in the sea of endogenous
compounds. It is estimated the annual sales of PIDs for GC detectors at $21
million and expect to rapidly capture a significant fraction of this market
owing to the superior performance capabilities of the ArSLID.&lt;br/&gt;
