visit by Dr. Rosalyn S. Hobson, Department of Electrical Engineering, Virginia
Commonwealth University to South Africa in August 2002 to confer with Dr.
Kimberly J. Battle, School of Mechanical Engineering, University of
Witwatersrand (WITS), Johannesburg. The purpose of the visit is to design a
partnership between the two universities that will include exchange of students
and faculty. During the visit, the professors will identify possible student
research projects and investigate the exchange program logistics. While at WITS,
Dr. Hobson will conduct a short course on neural networks. This planning visit
is supported jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and
the Directorate for Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
