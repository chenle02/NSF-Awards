ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0201131&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Blawzdziewics and Walz&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation: Yale
U&lt;br/&gt;Title: Particle Dynamics in Asymmetric Colloidal
Mixtures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is to develop a 'Markovian' reduced
description for the dynamics of large colloidal particles in a mixture. This
approach is based on the separation of the time scales characterizing the motion
of the particles and the surrounding macromolecules. With this approach,
considering that the evolution of the particles is governed by a generalized
Smoluchowski equation, the effect of the macromolecules will be captured by
depletion potential and the effective mobility tensor, the later having a
nontrivial dependence on particle separation and the distance from the
wall.&lt;br/&gt;
