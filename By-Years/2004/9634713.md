9634713 Russo Entanglement of rodlike polymers will be investigated by diffusion
measurements on model rods in binary solutions, liquid crystals, ternary
mixtures with other polymers, and dispersions in permanent, inflexible gels. The
methods to be employed include dynamic light scattering, fluorescence
photobleaching recovery and analytical ultracentrifugation. These studies will
illuminate the effects of molecular shape on entanglement, which is an important
determinant of the processibility of rodlike polymers. By comparison to an
extensive literature on entanglement in random flight polymers, the effects of
molecular rigidity can be realized. This proposed work also bears on the nature
of molecular composite precursor solutions and on anisotropic diffusion in
polymer liquid crystals, while illuminating how matrix topography governs
diffusion. %%% This grant falls in the area of molecular-level understanding of
polymer molecules in various processing environments, such as solutions, blends,
gels, etc., with emphasis on rigid-rod molecules such as liquid crystals. ***
