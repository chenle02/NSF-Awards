With this award funds are provided for partial support of the public outreach
program at the Soudan Mine Underground Laboratory, the country's only
operational underground high energy particle physics and astrophysics facility.
The Lab is hosted in a Minnesota State Park, where each year about 4,000 of the
Park's visitors venture 2,341 feet underground to see the facility, the MINOS
and CDMS-II experiments, and to learn about neutrinos and Dark Matter. The
proposed work is for two high school science teachers and two undergraduate
interns to work in the lab over the summer, and an outreach coordinator who will
contribute year round. Their primary duty is to help give the twice-daily
"physics tours" and explain the lab and the science to visitors of the park.
They then use this experience and their science education skills to improve the
lab's outreach program and develop lesson plans and educational materials for
use by the many school groups which visit the lab on field trips during the
school year. They also participate in research projects with the experiments in
the lab including MINOS and CDMS. The funds will also support the annual Open
House. Most years since 1989, the lab has been open, free to the community at
large for a day in the spring. Special displays are set up and hundreds of
visitors are shown around the lab by the participating scientists. This gives
the lab a high, positive profile in the community as well as share the science.
The posters and educational materials developed are available on the website and
used throughout the year.
