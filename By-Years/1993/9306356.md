9306356 Fownes Why does forest growth decline with stand age? An experimental
test of carbon acquisition and allocation over stand development. the overall
goal of this research is to understand the production biology of even-aged
forests. Biomass accumulation rates of even-aged forests typically increase at
first, peak, and then decline. The conventional explanation has been that leaf
area index, and thus gross while woody biomass, and thus respiration, continues
to increase until relatively little photosynthate remains for new growth.
However, this proposition has not been tested directly. Recent evidence, both
direct estimates of stand respiration and indirect indices of growth efficiency,
suggest that this explanation cannot be correct. We propose an integrated
experimental test of three hypotheses: (1) that respiration does account for
declining growth rate, (2) that nutrient availability decreases over time,
thereby lowering leaf area, photosynthesis, or both, or (3) that the pattern is
caused by shifting allocation of net production to infrequently-measured
components, particularly roots. %%% The significance of the research lies in
answering one of the fundamental questions in forest ecosystem biology. If the
respiration hypothesis is refuted, conventional explanations of stand growth
dynamics will be overthrown. Understanding the controls of stand growth and
carbon allocation will be crucial for predicting the response of tropical forest
to changing climate. The practical significance of the research will be in
formulating a comprehensive approach to plantation management, and in answering
such questions as how to optimize the plant-density/ rotation-length/ harvest-
size relationship, and whether late-rotation fertilization is likely to be
beneficial. The region around the experimental site is receiving serious
consideration for a commercial Eucalyptus plantation industry, and results will
be readily adopted into planning and management.
