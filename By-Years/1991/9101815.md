The time immediately following the metamorphosis and settlement of benthic
organisms is critical to their ability to become part of the existing community.
Because of their small size and simpler morphology, juveniles endure more
intense interactions with a wider spectrum of species. In addition, tremendous
changes in the ecological relationships between species can occur between life-
history stages and the importance of these ontogenetic changes in relationships
is unknown. This project will focus on the settling and juvenile stages of 7
dominant species within subtidal marine epifaunal communities along the coast of
southern New England. The study sites chosen exhibit extreme (1 to 2 orders of
magnitude) differences in larval settlement, and each has a distinct group of
dominant species. Experiments will be conducted to test processes that have the
demonstrated potential to alter the importance of predation to recruitment, i.e.
differences in larval settlement and competitive interactions involving
juveniles. Finally, we will examine how relationships change with life-stage.
The importance of any event occurring during juvenile life-history stages will
be judged relative to phenomena occurring during larval settlement and within
the adult community.
