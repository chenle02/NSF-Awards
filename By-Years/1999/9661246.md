9661246 Leaskey This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves
the processing of Si wafers for semiconductor applications to eliminate or
reduce contamination by undesirable metal ions. A major source of impurities has
been identified as the wafer carriers used in the high temperature processing.
Although carriers with high purity surfaces are available, with use the surface
purity levels significantly decrease because: (1) higher purity CVD coatings
spall and exposure lower purity bulk material and/or (2) contaminants in the
bulk diffuse with time and temperature to the surface. At wafer processing
temperatures above ~1100 C, SiC-Si carriers are used. The presence of Si
increases the potential for contamination due to the high diffusion coefficients
of many metal ions through Si, which are often many orders of magnitude greater
than for SiC. It would be desirable to replace the Si phase with a component
through which ion mobility is decreased. An innovative composite is proposed
which has the potential for long-term use without contamination and improved
mechanical properties. The components will be completely analyzed for relevant
properties including purity and mechanical properties. Demonstration of
fabrication of high quality components would lead to more extensive analyses of
prototype components to determine long term performance. The main application
would be as diffusion components to be used in semiconductor processing. The
composites could also be fabricated with lower purity levels and used for
applications requiring high temperature, corrosion resistant materials such as
engine and heat exchanger components.
