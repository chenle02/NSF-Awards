This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will focus on discovering
and characterizing the fainter members of the solar neighborhood: red dwarfs,
white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and extrasolar planets. The core science goals of
the RECONS (Research Consortium on Nearby Stars) effort at Georgia State
University (GSU) are to (1) reveal new nearby and young stars with proper
motions of 3 arcseconds/year down to undetectable levels, (2) move toward the
completion of the census of all stars within 10 pc, (3) substantially increase
the samples of red and white dwarfs within 25 pc, and (4) search astrometrically
the nearest red and white dwarfs for brown dwarf and massive planetary
companions with orbital periods up to a decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader
Impacts of this program include resources for professional and amateur
astronomers consisting of the Census of Objects Nearer than 10 Parsecs and List
of the Nearest 100 Stellar Systems, generating more than 13000 server requests
to the RECONS website in the first nine months of 2008. A parallax database has
recently been added. The program will support 1 postdoctoral researcher, 2
graduate students, and 1 undergraduate student.
