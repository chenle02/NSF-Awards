This award supports the Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2011 to be held March
24-26, 2011 at the University of California, Irvine. These seminars have been
held annually since 1981; they have become the most important regular conference
series for probabilists in North America. They bring together a diverse group of
accomplished researchers and young investigators in probability and stochastic
processes. The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of
the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to
discuss their work in an informal atmosphere. Modeled after P.A. Meyers
Seminaire de Probabilite, which propelled the French probability school to the
forefront of research in the seventies, the Seminar on Stochastic Processes was
created in the eighties by Chung, Cinlar, and Getoor to have the same boosting
effect on this side of the Atlantic. This initiative had a tremendous impact on
the probability community, reaching far beyond the limits of the North American
continent. Researchers from all over the world strive for an invitation as peer
recognition of their international standing. The list of past invited speakers
is a Who's Who in the world of probability. The scientific committee strives to
include successful young researchers, minorities and women in the list of
speakers. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be
given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to
junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference. The
Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many of the
most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year. The morning
invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the
field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives graduate
students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the
most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by
offering the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their
field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found
in more traditional meetings.
