The proposed study focuses on genome-wide adaptation to an extreme environment,
the aridity of desert ecosystems, across three rodent lineages. Understanding
the evolutionary history of traits that allow organisms to adapt to their
environments has long been a central goal of evolutionary biology. The project
will contribute to recent medical, agricultural, and academic research that has
been uncovering the genes responsible for complex adaptive traits and
determining the effect mutations in these genes have on mice and other mammals,
including humans. An especially important question is what is the extent of the
"genetic toolbox": how many evolutionarily viable solutions are there to a
common evolutionary problem, like thriving in an extreme environment? This
project potentially will further our understanding of convergence at the
molecular level and the repeatability of evolution. In addition, the
investigators will engage in research with undergraduates from underrepresented
groups and provide public and K12 outreach on this project.

Ultra-efficient kidneys are often associated with desert rodents who drink
little to no free water. This study explores the genetic basis of three
independent evolutionary origins of this trait. Transcriptomes will be sequenced
for three pairs of species, one desert adapted and one temperate adapted, and
sequence and expression data will be compared to answer: 1) is there convergence
at the amino acid level in desert taxa not seen in the temperate taxa? 2) Are
the same genes under selection in some or all of desert taxa? 3) Are there
convergent gene expression patterns in the desert taxa not seen in the temperate
taxa? The results from this research will provide essential insight into the way
organisms adapt to their environment and how genomes evolve.
