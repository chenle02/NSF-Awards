This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project tests the
feasibility of using a highly innovative polarized multi-wavelength light
extinction spectroscopy approach for on-line non-destructive characterization of
coated nanoparticles and nanoparticle agglomerates. From extinction measurements
and a database which contains numerically generated extinction values for
different sizes of coated spherical particles and their agglomerates shapes, the
size and thickness distribution of coated particles (or size distribution of
their agglomerates in terms of distribution of number of primary spheres and
fractal dimension) is determined. Currently available commercial instruments
cannot accurately characterize coated spherical particles and agglomerates.
Techniques such as electron microscopy involve time consuming sample preparation
and sample handling which alters sample morphology. The capability provided by
our proposed technology is extremely important in several applications relevant
to targeted functionality. The proposed instrument will help in developing
tailored coated nanoparticles for new applications.

Nanoparticles technology is well advanced and positioned to impact industries
related to pharmaceuticals, medical diagnostics, and biomaterials. If successful
the proposed instrument will enable new levels of quality in the manufacturing
of coated and agglomerated nanoparticles. Global market for nanoparticles in
biomedical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic applications are worth $
204.6 million in 2007 (Bcc research report, nano17D). This is expected to
increase to over $ 684.4 million by 2012, a CAGR of 32.0 %. The proposed product
will be a valuable characterization tool for many of these industries and the
technology, with its unique application potential, will pave the way for new
enabling technologies.
