A novel DNA transposon was found in a chlorate resistant mutant of Arabidopsis
thaliana. The element hybridizes to several distinct sequences in the
Arabidopsis genome and thus is a member of a new family of transposons.
Transposons are not only interesting in themselves but often prove to be
important tools for cloning genes and serving as gene vectors for their native
genome. We propose to characterize this transposon and develop it as a tool for
studying the genome of this important model plant system. %%% Arabidopsis
thaliana has become the focus of many molecular studies of plant genomes because
of the small size and limited repetitive sequences of the genome. Although the
maize transposable element Ac has been useful in obtaining mutants in
Arabidopsis, much effort has not yet led to the cloning of a gene. Thus the
possibility of an endogenous mobile element which can be characterized and
possibly engineered to provide a much needed tool for the study of this model
plant is exciting.
