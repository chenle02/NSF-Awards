This action is to provide R/T airfare to Japan for Professor Yeh. The purpose
of this visit is 1) to establish closer research interactions between the
Disaster Control Research Center at Tohoku University (and especially the
Tsunami Engineering Department within this Center) and tsunami researchers in
the United States, 2) acquire hard-to- obtain field data and historical data on
tsunamis (seismic sea waves) which could identify research needs to address the
potential tsunami threat to coastal areas in the U.S., 3) to facilitate the
interchange of information on tsunamis between Professor Yeh and researchers in
Japan, 4) to discuss with Professor Nobuo Shuto (a world renowned tsunami
engineering researcher) possible research cooperation, and 6) to visit coastal
sites subjected to past tsunami runup and damage.
