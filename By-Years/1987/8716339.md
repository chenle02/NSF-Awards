This grant constitutes the first attempt to use the new satellite imaging
facilities at McMurdo and Scripps Institute of Oceanography for research
purposes. Several studies of the surface winds of West Antarctica will be
undertaken; the satellite data will be supplemented by all available surface and
upper air data. Specific topics to be addressed include: 1. Delineation of the
time-averaged and time dependent surface airflow patterns over West Antarctica.
2. Description of the space-time characteristics of katabatic surges and their
precursors in the Siple Coast confluence zone. 3. Definitions of the
characteristics and conditions under which katabatic surges from Siple Coast
propagate northward along the Transantarctic Mountains to reach Ross Island.
Objective 3. has promise of developing into a method of midterm forecasting (12
hr) of considerable operational value. The Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio
State University is well equipped to carry out these studies.
