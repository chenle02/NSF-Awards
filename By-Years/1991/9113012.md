A three year program of very low frequency (VLF) observations at multiple sites
across United States is proposed for the purpose of 'imaging' ionospheric
disturbances that occur in association with lightning discharges. The first year
experiment involves measurement of amplitude and phase of VLF transmitter
signals at Puerto Rico, Huntsville, College Park, Houston and Stanford,
providing a grid of great circle paths over the continent. The location of
transient ionospheric disturbancesare determined by means of simultaneous
occurrences on crossing and collinear VLF paths. The lightning-induced
ionospheric disturbance events are recognized on the basis of their
characteristic signatures and occur due to (i) lightning-induced precipitation
of energetic particles from the radiation belts, and (ii) direct upward coupling
of lightning radiation to the lower ionosphere producing intense heating and
ionization. The second year program involves measurements at five closely spaced
sites in the vicinity of Huntsville, Alabama for the purpose of tomographic
imaging on a tight (but irregular) grid of paths. The proposed measurement
program synergistically benefits from Stanford observations at Palmer,
Antarctica and a recently developed three dimensional model of VLF propagation
in the earth-ionospherewaveguide. The third year observation program emphasizes
measurement of event occurence in the south western and south-cenbtral United
States region of known high thunderstorm activity.
