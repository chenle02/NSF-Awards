The research goal is to advance the state of the art in the design of planar
and spatial mechanisms, with particular focus on kinematic and dynamic accuracy
performance. Four topics will be investigated. In the first topic, kinematic
synthesis for closed chain mechanisms, the relationship between the sensitivity
to variations of link lengths and the location of the moving pivots of four
link, six link and other complex mechanisms will be investigated for the
objective of three and four position synthesis. The second topic, kinematic
synthesis for three dimensional open chain mechanisms, looks at design
guidelines for optimizing mechanism endpoint accuracy performance. In the third
topic, dynamic synthesis for open chain multi axis mechanical systems, a new way
of modeling three dimensional dynamic error as a function of frequency domain
transfer function gain and delay time variations between axes is developed. The
fourth and last research topic develops computer simulation tools for
identifying spatial accuracy of open chain mechanisms. The overall research
results are expected to be useful for practicing engineers in optimizing designs
of planar and spatial mechanisms early in the design process. Traditionally,
design for performance has been subordinated to the design for strength and
design for manufacturing functions. This research attempts to compensate for
that reduced emphasis.
