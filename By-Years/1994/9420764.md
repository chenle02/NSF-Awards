What accounts for the size and shape of the head and face region of humans and
our relatives continues to be a critical area of study for anatomists and
paleoanthropologists. The approach of Hylander's group has been to characterize
patterns of surface bone strain along the face bones of a monkey. Then, in
combination with various sorts of anatomical and physiological data, the strain
data are used to formulate and test different hyptheses about loading patterns
in various facial bones. One of the primary goals is to determine whether, how
much, and in which direction a given bone is bent, twisted and/ or sheared
during different chewing and biting behaviors. These data the allow some insight
as to whether certain aspects of the primate face are structural adaptations to
dissipate chewing forces. This work will help explain why primate (including
human) facial bones look the way they do. This is particularly important for
formulating functional and adaptive interpretation of the fossil record of both
human and nonhuman primates. Moreover, by characterizing the mechanical
environment of facial bones, these data may provide insights into how and why
facial bones respond to various sorts of altered mechanical stress, and thereby
contribute to a better understanding of processes related to skeletal
maintenance of mechanical strength.
