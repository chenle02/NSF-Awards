This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a Label Free Nucleic Acid Assay for Point-Of-Care (POC) Diagnostics
especially for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI).

The broader impacts of this research are to enable effective diagnosis and
treatment of chlamydia and gonorrhoeae in a single visit at the clinic and thus
avoid patients who currently go untreated because they are lost-to-follow-ups.
The ability to obtain easily available POC tests in primary care clinics, school
clinics, Emergency Department settings, or even at-home testing (OTC), may have
a far reaching impact on the rates of STIs in this country.
