In this project, the P.I. will investigate the effects of wind forcing and
remote forcing by equatorial variability on the circulation over continental
shelves. A model will be developed with realistic shelf and slope topography,
stratification, bottom friction, and measured wind forcing. Analytic theory and
numerical results will be used to understand basic properties of the structure
of the low- frequency flows. Three specific topics will be addressed: 1. Low
frequency motions on western boundary ocean shelves in general; 2. El Nino
effects on the western coast of North America; and, 3. Variability in sea level
and wind around Australia, and its effects on shelf circulation.
