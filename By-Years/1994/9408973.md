9408973 Okunbor Computer simulation of molecular dynamics is the study of time
evolution of the dynamical state of a system of interacting particles or bodies
by the computation of trajectories of particles based on the numerical
integration of Newton's equations of motion. Many-body and many-particle systems
arise in several applications, such as in studies of the dynamics of biological
macromoleculesin drug design, in the simulation of plasmas, in vehicle and space
structure simulation and in cosmology. The dimension of this system of ordinary
differential equations is of the order of tens of thousands. To solve such a
system requires an enormous amount of computer time. This project aims to
develop cost effective and globally stable algorithms for molecular dynamics
simulations, with an emphasis on schemes suitable for large systems. The project
concentrates on the development of integration methods that would facilitate:
taking much larger step sizes without sacrificing accuracy, extension of the
multiple-time stepping strategy to higher-order integrators and the application
of Psi Calculus for partitioning, scheduling and routing the arrays to the
multiprocessors to cut down the computation time by a significant proportion.
