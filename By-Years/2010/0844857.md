0844857&lt;br/&gt;Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will improve our understanding of biomembranes
reinforced by embedded skeletons using two representative examples: insect wing
and fish fin. The focus will be the correlation between the bio-architecture and
locomotion performance a boundary-integral model complemented by an immersed-
boundary model. The remarkable characteristics of lightness, durability,
deployability, and controllability of fish fins and insect wings may provide
ideal models for propulsion systems of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) or
micro aero-vehicles (MAV). Recent biological studies show that fish fins and
insect wings are anisotropically flexible and their locomotion capacity is
closely related to such flexibility, however, present state-of-the-art models
lag behind. This study incorporates both the fluid dynamics and the structural
responses based upon morphologically realistic designs. The research will also
be a vital part of a framework to understand the structure vs. function of a
broad range of biological systems which are structurally similar to fish fins
and insect wings (e.g. cell membranes or mollusk nacres). In pursuit of this
goal, the educational objectives are to enlist current graduate and
undergraduate student participation by initiating a curriculum in this direction
and to encourage other's participation in this interdisciplinary research
effort. Other activities include participation in various programs (e.g., the
COSMOS program) to reach out to K-12 students, underserved communities, and
previously excluded groups. The PI will also disseminate the results through a
dedicated website and an international/interdisciplinary research network
facilitated by the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN) focusing on fish
swimming and adaptations of fish to hydraulic environments.
