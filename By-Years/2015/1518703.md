Energy efficiency is a fundamental challenge facing the IT industry. Benefits go
beyond reduced power demands in data centers and longer battery life in mobile
devices. It is a fundamental enabler of future systems as we approach the limits
of silicon device scaling. Therefore, providing a novel and holistic approach to
energy efficiency in computer systems can have a transformative effect on IT and
society. Many important applications---e.g., computer vision, novel user
interfaces, signal processing, web search, augmented reality, and big-data
analytics---can inherently tolerate some forms of inaccurate computation at
various levels. With approximate computing, this fact can be exploited for
fundamentally more efficient computing systems. This is a direct analog to
Daniel Kahneman's model of how our brains work: they do cheap and quick
reasoning (using System 1) in an approximate way, and when required, they do
more expensive (and tiring) detailed thinking (using System 2). This research
project will develop a analogous model for computer systems, from hardware to
programming tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of approximate
computing requires significant innovation: programming models, tools for testing
and debugging, and system support with quality guarantees. This project will
develop a comprehensive solution across the system stack, from programming
language to hardware. To demonstrate the potentials, prototypes of compelling
applications amenable to approximate computing (e.g., computer vision) will be
created. The project involves work on systems, programming languages, formal
methods, and architecture, matching the inter-disciplinary expertise of the PI
team. In addition to research papers, the project scope also includes releasing
tools, benchmarks, and general infrastructure to the academic and industrial
communities. The PIs have a history of inclusion of minorities and undergraduate
students in their research efforts.
