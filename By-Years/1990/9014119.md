The remarkable recent advances in genetic engineering now allow industrial-scale
production of therapeutic proteins for human health care. With the introduction
of new production methods have come immense purification challenges. In order to
avoid untoward side effects of contaminants (many of which are as yet unknown),
therapeutic proteins must be ultra-purified to levels beyond the scope of
present technology. Thus, there is a great need for novel separation and
purification techniques which may be applied on an industrial scale. This multi-
investigator study is an effort to integrate several innovative technologies
Ä±such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography, (HPLC), electrophoresis, and
supercritical-fluid based separations! to provide a basis for industrial
ultrapurification of biomacromolecules. Applications of such new purification
and separation technologies will be tested on recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator, a life-saving therapeutic used in the treatment of heart attack
victims.
