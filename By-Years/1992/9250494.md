The Chemistry Department has identified laboratory improvement guidelines
including the needs: to incorporate work using smaller and more complex samples,
to emphasize real world chemistry, to use state-of-the-art instrumentation, to
increase laboratory efficiency so that more experimental work can be done, and
to increase the understanding of chemical health and safety. Acquisition of a
200 MHz FT-NMR Spectrometer with a variable temperature module will enhance all
but the last of those principles in five of our upper division courses. Specific
improvements include enhanced proton analysis, a new capability for 13C
analysis, the computer controlled acquisition and processing of data,
application of FT-NMR analysis to small samples, determination of kinetic and
thermodynamic parameters, and special pulse sequences for simplification of
complex spectra. In addition, the instrument will increase the range of projects
available to undergraduates doing research.
