The sedimentary sequence from lakes containing annual laminations provides a
powerful tool for the interpretation of paleoclimate history. These sediments
often contain a high resolutiol record of paleoclimate and paleoecological
change. Lakes containing such a record are rare in western North America. This
SGER award will focus on the retrieval of a sediment core from a lake with
laminated sediments in Yosemite National Park, California. The successful
retrieval of such a core has great potential for linking terrestrial, marine and
ecological histories with regional climate variations over the last 15,000
years.***
