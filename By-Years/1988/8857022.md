This is a PYI award for FY88. The objective of this five year research is to
develop advanced technologies for analyzing and designing advanced composite
structures. Specifically the fundamental damage mechanisms, which includes
matrix cracking, fiber buckling and delamination, and the resulting strength and
stability of the damaged composite will be studied analytically and
experimentally. The damage mechanisms will form the basis for assessing impact
damage and damage tolerance of composites as well as developing design
procedures for composite bonded/bolted joints.
