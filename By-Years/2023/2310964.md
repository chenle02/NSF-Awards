A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is organized as part of the
ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI),
the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems
research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications,
and performance. The conference and workshop will be held in Orlando, Florida,
in 2023; in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2024; and in South Korea in 2025. This award
specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority
to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in
addition to the PLDI conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening
participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive
mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of
researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and
programming systems research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
