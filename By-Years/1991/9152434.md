The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a superspeed centrifuge and a scanning
lifetime spectrofluorometer capable of both steady-state measurements and
kinetic measurements in the 100 picosecond-1 microsecond time regime. The
instruments are being used to introduce biophysical chemistry experiments into
the laboratory portions of upper level chemistry courses and independent study
projects. Included in the new curriculum is the study of inhibitor binding
following isolation and fractionation of chloroplast membranes and fragments.
