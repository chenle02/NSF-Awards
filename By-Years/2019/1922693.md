The University of Hawaii requests $501,697 for the purchase, fabrication, and
installation of a CTD winch for the Research Vessel Kilo Moana. The Office of
Naval Research (ONR) is providing funding for an accompanying launch and
recovery system (LARS). The Kilo Moana is a general-purpose research vessel
operated under a charter party agreement with ONR as part of the US Academic
Research Fleet (ARF) which is supported by the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS). Ship time is made available to academic researchers
funded by the NSF, ONR, NOAA, NASA, and other federal and state agencies. The
R/V Kilo Moana conducts a substantial portion of CTD operations in deep water,
up to 6,000 meters depth in the mid-Pacific Ocean. These operations require a
safe, efficient, and reliable means for transporting the CTD rosette from the
deck of the ship into the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is jointly funded by NSF/GEO/OCE/IPS and the Established Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
