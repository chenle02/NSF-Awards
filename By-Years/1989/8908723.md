This project is to support a group of U.S. experts to participate in a bilateral
exchange with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science on approaches to
robotics research and applications in the two countries. The purpose of this
exchange is threefold: (1) To compare and contrast R&amp;D on generic
technologies that include robotics in hazardous environments and in service-
related area; (2) To stimulate thinking about "strategic alliance" between the
two countries; and (3) To provide an opportunity (by site visits to Japan) to
observe recent applications of robotics, particularly in unstructured
environments. Among the results of this exchange will be a report by the
National Research Council and the U.S. Group on their recommendations of
potential projects and ways of joint research that cannot be easily done by each
country alone.
