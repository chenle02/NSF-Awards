This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support research into the
earliest era of the Universe. Using state of the art detectors in the
submillimeter region of the spectrum from the South Pole, Dr. Dragovan will
attempt to measure the degree of isotropy of the cosmic background radiation,
the radiation left from the Big Bang. By mapping the structure in the intensity
of the background radiation, one can then infer the distribution of the mass in
the early universe. This distribution is a key element in various theories of
the evolution of the Universe and the formation of the structures such as
clusters of galaxies that dominate the present day visible mass distribution.
