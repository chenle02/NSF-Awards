The Marine Systems Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire
will conduct a workshop to bring together scientists involved with the ocean
time series investigations and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
technologists. The goal of the workshop is to explore the possibilities of
improving the effectiveness of repetitive ocean time series data gathering
requirements through the use of AUV technology. The workshop will provide the
basis for incorporating ocean science input throughout the AUV conceptualization
and design process. Time series field programs provide a useful framework for
studying potential AUV applications in ocean sciences, because there are
specific, well-defined data gathering needs and evaluation criteria for
incorporating these needs into the AUV development process. Preliminary
information will be presented at the 7th International Symposium on Unmanned
Untethered Submersible Technology to be held at UNH in September 1991.
