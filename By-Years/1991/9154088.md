An annotated bibliography of more than 1200 items will be produced covering
Asian, African, Islamic Middle East, Latin American and precontact North
American science and medicine. This bibliography should be of value to teachers,
students and curriculum developers who want to include examples of the cultural
relativity of the scientific enterprise. The bibliography will be arranged by
place with an extensive subject index. The bibliography will be published and
the ideas disseminated to teachers through networks, partnerships, journals and
talks.
