The detection of thousands of exoplanets over the past two decades has provided
a Copernican-like shift in our view of the solar system. We now know that most
stars in our galaxy form with planets. We also know that low mass planets are
more common than the gas giant planets that were first detected in 1995.
However, the measurement of planet masses for true Earth analogs (similar in
mass and orbiting in the habitable zone) is not possible with current
instruments. This proposal addresses a key requirement for improving precision
by developing a precise, accurate, and stable wavelength calibration system for
measurements of radial velocities with a new generation of ultra-stable
spectrographs. This project will provide training opportunities for students and
early-career scientists and help maintain US competitiveness in an area of
science that captures the public imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tunable
Fabry-PÃ©rot (FP) comb is designed for stability at the level of 1 cm/s, and the
narrow lines can be used to calibrate out some of the instrumental
uncertainties. The emission comb spectrum is produced by filtering a bright
broadband laser-driven light source with the FP interferometer. The location of
the comb peaks is determined by the spacing of the FP cavity. To prevent
position drifts, the comb will be locked to a hyperfine laser transition with a
precision that exceeds 1 part in ten billion. To prevent changes in the free
spectral range or dispersion of the comb, the instrument will be placed in a
temperature-controlled vacuum enclosure, and the comb line dispersion will be
monitored for any required corrections with a second stabilized laser. The goal
is to reach better than 10 cm/s stability in the wavelength calibration of
modern stabilized spectrometers.
