In this project, the PI's will collect and analyze data on the distribution of
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) along 67 degrees South in the Pacific, between New
Zealand and the tip of South America. Hydrography and other tracer data will be
colected by scientists from Oregon State University, Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, and the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, aboard the Soviet
vessel, R/V Akademik IOFFE. This work constitutes a cooperative, international
study under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and is called line
S-4 in the WOCE science plan.
