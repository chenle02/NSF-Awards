A theoretical and experimental approach towards a more physically based modeling
of plastic deformation of thin sheets is developed. A suitable representation of
spatial homogeneities of materials microstructure, surface topography, and
plastic deformation properties of rolled aluminum sheet metals in terms of grain
clusters is developed. Theoretical and experimental research of polycrystal
plasticity models of the grain clusters based on crystal plasticity theories of
single crystalline grains is performed. Experimental investigation and finite
element analysis on the evolution of surface finish and formability of aluminum
sheet metals undergoing in-plane stretch operation is conducted. These
developments lead to a better die design and processing parameters.
