The nature of tribopolymerization will be studied for ceramic materials. Special
emphasis will be placed on the possibilty of using the sliding process to
generate insitu polymeric films which have useful triboligical properties. The
roles of local frictional heating and of exoelectrons in the polymerization
processes will be studied. The work is a collaborative effort between US and
Polish scientists, performed primarily in the US.
