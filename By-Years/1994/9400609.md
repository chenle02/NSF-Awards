9400609 Martin This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropologist from Johns Hopkins University. The student will observe and
interview workers in several Department of Energy (DOE) sites where nuclear
weapons are dismantled and hazardous materials managed. The project will show
how the cultural assumptions of workers affect their conceptions of the value of
their work. Specific hypotheses to be tested are that the conversion from
weapons to peaceful technology (from "making weapons", a masculine activity, to
"cleaning up", a feminine job) is seen by workers as a feminization and
deskilling of their activity. Methods include formal interviews of active and
retired workers, to assess changes in interpretations of the work over time, as
well as interviews with administrators and participant observation in community
life. This research is important because the transformation from war-production
to civilian goods involves changes in the cultural context of the work place.
Increased understanding of how workers conceptualize the value of their work can
help decision makers design programs of increased efficiency. ***
