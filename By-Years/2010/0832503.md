This Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project will further the air traffic
control and air traffic management research being conducted by Georgia Tech
mechanical engineering doctoral student Adan Vela. Mr. Vela is advised by
Professor William Singhose and Professor John-Paul Clarke at Georgia Tech. This
award will allow Mr. Vela to collaborate with Professor Daniel Delahaye at Ã‰cole
Nationale de l'Aviation Civile (ENAC) in Toulouse, France, to develop novel
algorithms to control and evaluate air traffic flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific research objectives are to develop a real-time air traffic resolution
algorithm to maintain safe air traffic separation over three-dimensional spatial
trajectories; pose air traffic resolution problems as an optimization program
that considers various cost aspects of air traffic control and fairness; study
and verify performance improvements of algorithm over existing air traffic
control methods using simulated flight data; and formulate methods for
determining the bounds of air traffic rates within which the algorithm will
ensure safe operation. The core purpose of this research is to enable safe and
efficient management of the US airspace even under increased traffic loads.
Furthermore, application of proposed algorithms is expected to reduce overall
operational costs in addition to reducing fuel emissions. This project has
strong mutual international benefits and will help to simulate further research
and educational collaboration between Georgia Tech and
ENAC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
