The 6th conference of the International Federation of Classification Societies
(IFCS) will be held in Rome, Italy, July 21-24, 1998. IFCS consists of the
classification societies of North America, Great Britain, Italy, France,
Germany, Belgium/Netherlands, Portugal, Poland, Japan, and Korea. While the
various member societies differ in emphasis and philosophies, they share a
common interest in problems of classification, cluster analysis, and data
analysis in such areas as biology, library science, statistics, medicine, social
science, psychology and philosophy.

This proposal will provide grants to help defray the cost of travel for
approximately 5 U. S. citizens or permanent residents to participate in this
conference. Grants under this proposal will be limited to the approximate cost
of airfare. This support will encourage those who might not otherwise be able to
attend IFCS 98, junior faculty in particular, to become part of the
international community of researchers in the fields of classification,
clustering, and data analysis, and to become aware of the many alternative
philosophies, uses of, and approaches to data analysis and classification-
related problems in particular.
