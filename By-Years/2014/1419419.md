This proposal outlines a Workshop for Aspiring PIs in Cyber-Physical Systems.
The invitation-only workshop will take place over 1.5 days, and include early-
career researchers with interests in cyber-physical systems who have not
previously been funded by the NSF CPS solicitation but who have submitted
proposals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will help aspiring PIs understand
what NSF (and importantly, the panels convened by NSF) are expecting to see in a
successful CPS proposal. The workshop will include exciting talks by CPS program
grantees as well as NSF CPS Program Officers, along with panel discussions with
researchers as well as program officers. The agenda also plans significant time
for discussions between aspiring PIs and panelists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop will enlarge the CPS research community. It will help early-stage
researchers better understand CPS program goals, provide opportunities for
interaction with program leadership, and result in significant improvement in
the quality of CPS project ideas from the community and better alignment with
program goals.
