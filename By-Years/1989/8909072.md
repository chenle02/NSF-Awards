In recent years, collections of workstations interconnected by high- speed
communication devices have come into widespread use. Though such collections
often have considerable computing capacity, much of it is generally
inaccessible, because only primitive means currently exist for offloading work
to idle or lightly-utilized workstations when back- logs of work develop. This
failure to take advantage of unused computing capacity reduces performance to a
fraction of what it might be. The objective of the project is to tap the latent
capacity of a network of workstations by designing and implementing distributed
scheduling algorithms that are suited to the unique features of this
environment. The approach, which combines measurement, analytic modeling,
simulation and implementation, includes several advances over previous
approaches. First, the availability of computing capacity is increased by
exploiting capacity at under-utilized, as well as idle, workstations. Second,
the robustness of distributed scheduling is improved by adapting the strategy
pursued to changes in the system environment. Third, robustness is further
promoted through the use of fully decentralized distributed scheduling
algorithms. Finally, utilization of latent capacity is increased by shifting the
responsibility for determining which processes can be advantageously transferred
to other workstations from the user to the distributed scheduler.
