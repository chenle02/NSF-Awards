Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on several
issues within the framework of the standard gauge theory of particle
interactions. The problem of the strange quark and gluon contents of the nucleon
will be studied. In particular, the physical origin and phenomeno- logical
consequences of 'anomalies' (the quantum violation of classical conservation
laws) which are related to these contents will be examined. This work has wide
implications for our understanding of the theory of the strong interactions,
quantum chromodynamics, and for our understanding of the nucleon.
