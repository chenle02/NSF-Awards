This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides for the acquisition of
a Vertical Microstructure Profiler (VMP) that will enhance the quantitative
investigations of small and microscale processes associated with near-surface
mixing in the northern and southern polar oceans. Such processes include mixing
where the primary energy source is conversion of barotropic tidal energy to
internal tides, dynamics associated with density currents over the shelf break
and continental slope, double diffusion, processes such as thermobaricity and
cabbeling associated with nonlinearities in the seawater equation of state, and
lateral intrusions at ocean fronts. The VMP resolves the smallest scales of
ocean variability - on the order of the several centimeters - which cannot be
resolved with normally available shipboard instrumentation. These high-
resolution observations are essential for computing the vertical eddy
diffusivity in the upper ocean, and for assessing and learning how to more
effectively parameterize the mixing associated with the velocity shear and the
equation-of-state processes.
