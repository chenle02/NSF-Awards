A two-year continuation of current research is proposed with projects designed
to uncover how variability, inheritance, and differential fitness affect the
evolution of morphological variation within species of animals. The polymorphic
tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum, will be a model to address three
questions. 1). Have changes in timing of development over evolutionary time
affected the origin of morphological variation within species? 2) Will simple
extensions of genetic models describing continuous variation in species? 3) Is
natural selection, especially through competition within species and
predictability of the aquatic habitat, a force maintaining morphological
variation within and between populations? These questions relate to the general
issue of how continuous morphological variation within a species is maintained
or converted into discontinuous morphological variation within or between
populations. Questions will be studied using laboratory and field experiments
and observations. These include morphometric analyses of changes in size and
shape as animals grow, complemented by descriptions of geographic variation in
morphology. Breeding experiments will quantify genetic and environmental
contributions to morphological variation among populations. Finally, several
experiments are designed to provide a means for relating variation in anatomy,
diet, and fitness. Collectively, the research projects proposed contribute to
our developing understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes
relating variation within species and the origin of novel evolutionary forms.
