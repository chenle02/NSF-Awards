This research is part of a long term effort to migrate techniques for
synchronous design to asynchronous design. The two focus areas are sequential
optimization and synthesis for testability. In the former, problem formulations
of input, output and input/output encoding are being investigated. In each case,
the problems of optimality, race-free encoding, and hazard free logic are being
solved simultaneously. In the latter, synthesis of fully testable asynchronous
state machines using partial or no scan is being pursued. Design tools,
incorporating the algorithms for optimization and synthesis for test, are being
developed.
