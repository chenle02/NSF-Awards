9553598 Katims The PACKETS Program is a system of classroom-based performance
activities to be planned, designed, implemented, and delivered by the
Educational Testing Service over a two year period. These authentic assessment
activities will promote learning and document that learning concurrently. The
two major goals of PACKETS are to develop a model PACKETS program for students
in grades 3-5 and to arrange for dissemination of the materials to reach as many
classrooms as possible. The development process is designed to ensure that the
materials work well in a variety of classrooms, with students and teachers from
diverse backgrounds. The process will include cycles of piloting, field-testing,
and revising, relying heavily on input from teachers, students, and other
practitioners. Major national educational improvement efforts, including the
Systemic Initiatives and the National Standards movement, place a high priority
on integrating assessment strategies with instruction. As a result of this
project, upper elementary teachers will have exemplary models of how to
integrate assessment with instruction, engaging their students in meaningful,
complex, and mathematically rich problems as a part of their regular
instructional programs.
