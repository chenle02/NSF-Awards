This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Mykhailo Shatruk from Florida State
University and colleagues Igor Alabugin, Susan Latturner, Biwu Man and James
Frederich have acquired a microfocus, dual source single crystal diffractometer.
In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of
the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and
angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a
molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact
many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and
biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as
research and research training of graduate and undergraduate students in
chemistry and biochemistry at this institution. Students are involved in
chemical and protein research. The resource is also utilized by neighboring
primarily undergraduate institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is
aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful
for studying temperature-, and light-induced spin-state switching in molecule-
based materials, for the identification of compounds prepared using molten metal
fluxes. The diffractometer is also being used in investigations of
phosphorescent molecules from halide perovskites for energy applications, and
for structurally characterizing supramolecular species made from contorted
carbon-rich molecules and nanomaterials. It is also employed for the
characterization of synthesized natural products used to evaluate protein-
protein interaction modulators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
