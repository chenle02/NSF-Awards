9803410 Pittel The investigator will study a series of interrelated problems in
asymptotic enumeration and combinatorial probability. The goal is to analyze
likely and unlikely behavior of large combinatorial structures such as random
graphs, trees, permutations, and partitions of sets and integers. This research
will develop new approaches based on combinatorial-algebraic principles and
ideas and analytical methods of probability and random processes. The connection
between combinatorics and probability is well known. It played a major role in
the early stages of development of probability theory, and some classical
problems of a combinatorial nature are traditionally used to illustrate how the
general theorems work in application to combinatorics. Among them are random
walks and allocations of particles among cells (boxes), the latter being quite
popular in various models of statistical mechanics. During the last 30-35 years,
there has been a tremendous outpouring of research in combinatorial probability
motivated by new problems in statistical mechanics (percolation theory, for
instance), polymerization theory, computer science (probabilistic analysis of
combinatorial algorithms), population genetics, etc. The terms random
permutations, mappings, graphs, partitions, etc. have become household names for
many researchers who have discovered the importance of analysis of random
combinatorial structures. The related theory of random graphs, inaugurated by
Erdos and Renyi in the early sixties, has been found indispensable in many
important applications. Characteristically, the deepest results have come via a
combination of fine combinatorial techniques and powerful probabilistic methods.
Besides the problems directly related to random graphs, the investigator will
study an optimal assignment problem with random costs, a possible connection
between the evolving random graph and the Diaconis- Shahshahani algorithm ("card
shuffling") for generating a r andom permutation, and various problems on random
partitions of sets and integers. The accent will be made on searching for
probabilistic and analytic methods which can be used for other combinatorial
structures important in applications.
