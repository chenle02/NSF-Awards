9412073 Tu The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
University of California, San Diego (UCSD) proposes to purchase a high-current,
low-energy ion gun system for growing large-bandgap III-V nitrides for high-
temperature electronic and blue emission optoelectronic applications. With mass
separation, the desired species can be selected to reduce background impurity
contamination. At energies below the damage threshold and higher than the
expitaxial growth threshold, and undamaged epitaxial layer can be achieved. With
a large ion-beam current, the growth rate can be substantial and practical. This
new capability of growing nitrides will allow a number of faculty members to
pursue--in a comprehensive and cohesive manner-issues in growth,
characterization, and processing; for example, the initial stage of epitaxy by
scanning tunneling microscopy; Schottky barrier height and ohmic contacts; and
dry etching characteristics. ***
