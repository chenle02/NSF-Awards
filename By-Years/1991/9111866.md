New types of semiconductor device structures based on the quantitative analogies
between ballistic (collisionless) transport in semiconductors and
electromagnetic propagation in dielectrics are being investigated. With electron
energies such that propagation is above all conduction band edges (as opposed to
below the barrier tunneling), these structures exhibit electron wave optical
effects including reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference.
Theoretical and experimental research is being conducted on the resulting
electron waveguides, negative resistance devices, tunable filters, tunable
emitters, interference diodes, and interference transistors for future
integrated circuits of higher speeds and higher levels of integration.
