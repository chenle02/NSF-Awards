For several years, many of the intermediate courses for undergraduate physics
majors at Lawrence University have included components that nurture skills to
use sophisticated computational resources creatively and independently. In this
project we are take thing the next natural step by adding computational
components to two advanced courses (Mathematical Methods of Physics and Advanced
Electromagnetic Theory), thereby broadening the spectrum of feasible senior-
level independent studies and introducing tools that become daily more crucial
to the practicing scientist and engineer. Specifically, we are incorporating
numerical treatment of 2D and 3D problems in wave propagation, fluid dynamics,
elasticity, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic theory. To support this
curricular development, we have added two 3D graphics workstations and a color
printer to our existing local area network. This hardware allows fast, thorough,
graphical examination of large data files resulting from numerical simulations
carried out locally or, more often, remotely via network access to one of the
national supercomputer centers.
