The importance and tectonic significance of interarc basins in the development
of convergent zones are recognized in modern settings where the plate tectonic
environment is well defined. However their identification and characterization
in ancient mountain systems require careful stratigraphic, structural,
petrologic and geochemical work in order to reconstruct their original setting
and subsequent history. This collaborative project between workers at the
University of Vermont and Middlebury College will examine the Missisquoi
Formation in western New England that has been suggested to represent a fore-arc
basin deposit. Results of extensive field mapping and geochemical studies are
expected to help place the Missisquoi Formation of the Taconic orogeny in Plate
Tectonic terms this allowing further refinements on understanding the Ordovician
Taconic orogeny.
