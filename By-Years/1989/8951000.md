The Department of Geology, Geography, and Environmental Studies at Calvin
College will purchase a Philips APD-3520 X-ray diffraction system. Training in
the principles and application of X-ray diffraction has been an important
component in most undergraduate geology curricula for many years. The
acquisition of an XRD system will benefit primarily upperclass majors in the
geology program. Students in mineralogy, optical mineralogy, and petrology will
learn through hands-on experience the basic concepts and techniques of XRD and
will practice such fundamental applications as identification of minerals,
characterization of cell parameters, and determination of chemical composition
of solid solutions. The overall effect will be much improved understanding of
crystalline solids in Calvin's geology curriculum. The college will match the
award with an equal amount of funds.
