The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Frank
Tittel of Williiam Marsh Rice University and Dr. Zsolt Por of JATE University,
Szeged, is to pursue two related topics: 1) novel ultrashort laser pulse
techniques and 2) production of nanostructures using direct laser ablation or
photochemical processing. These efforts are intended to contribute to
development of new broadband ultrashort laser pulse amplifiers, and to advance
our understanding of the production of nanostructures using direct laser
ablation. Results of this project should contribute to our knowledge of basic
physical mechanisms of UV laser ablation of polymers and should offer insight on
such important questions as whether new photochemically induced absorbers are
formed by direct photo dissociation, radical formation after a chemical
reaction, or other photochemical processes. Results may lead to refinements for
an interferometer capable of producing nanostructures in organic materials by
direct laser etching. This project in quantum electronics, waves and beams
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading researchers in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
