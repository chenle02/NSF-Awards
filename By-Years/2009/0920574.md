(99) The College of Engineering is building upon its five year success from
several NSF funded projects focusing on Service Learning Integrated throughout a
College of Engineering (SLICE). The current project, Community and Industry
Reaching into Computer, Lab and Engineering Sciences (CIRCLES) is extending the
incorporation of Service Learning into the curriculum. Faculty from other STEM
disciplines are being exposed to the Service-Learning concept and are
incorporating community based projects into their current courses. Students
choose one of several Service-Learning projects offered in their course and are
mentored by a community member active in that area. Currently, all engineering
students take at least one course with a Service-Learning component. Faculty are
seeing increased student participation in course work, an increase in the number
of underrepresented students in engineering courses and an increased ability of
students to apply engineering principles to workplace questions. One goal of the
project, to promote sensitivity and awareness of the sociological and
environmental consequences of engineering decisions, is being met while
strengthening the preparedness and diversity of the future engineering
workforce.
