A free neutron is unstable and decays via the weak interaction into a proton,
electron, and antineutrino with a mean lifetime of about 15 minutes. By
measuring the energies and directions of the emitted particles and the neutron
spin, details of the underlying interaction are revealed. We pass a beam of cold
neutrons (moving less than 2000 m/s) through apparatus designed to make precise
measurements of the neutron decay lifetime and angular correlations. Beause
neutron decay is a relatively simple system, absent the complications of nuclear
wave functions, these observables are related to fundamental theoretical
parameters directly and unambiguously. We use these results to test predictions
of the Standard Electroweak Model and search for evidence of new physics such as
scalar/tensor forces or new CP-violation. The precise value of the neutron
lifetime is needed to calculate the primordial abundances of light elements
produced in the early universe from Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

The neutron is a key building block of ordinary matter. When freed from the
confines of an atom, the neutron is unstable and will decay into other
elementary particles: a proton, an electron, and a lightweight neutral particle
called an antineutrino. Neutron decay is a useful laboratory for studying
details of the force responsible - the weak nuclear force - one of the four
fundamental forces of nature. We pass a beam of free neutrons through
specialized detectors that precisely measure the neutron decay rate and the
angles between the emitted particles. From this we can test and refine our
theory of the weak nuclear force and better understand the physics of the sun,
stars, the Big Bang, and important nuclear reactions.
