Abstract: Schwartz proposes to continue his research in the following general
areas: Complex Hyperbolic Geometry, Dynamics in Projective Geometry, and
Computer-Aided Mathematics.

The first topic can be described informally as follows. Suppose one suspends a
finite number of mirrors in space, and places an object in the vicinity of the
mirrors. Looking at the object through the mirrors, one might see an infinite,
regular pattern, like trees in an orange grove. On the other hand, one might see
a confused and chaotic pattern, full of partial and overlapping images. The
first case corresponds roughly to what s called a discrete group and the second
corresponds roughly to what is called an indiscrete group. The basic question
one would like to study is: which positions of the mirrors lead to the discrete
alternative? In the case of Schwartz's research, the space in which the mirrors
are suspended is a curved 4-dimensionaluniverse called complex hyperbolic space.
This space is an exotic cousin of the famous non-Euclidean spaces constructed by
Gauss and Lobachevsky more than a hundred years ago.

The second topic involves simple constructions in straight-line geometry. The
classical theorems in projective geometry, such as Pappus's theorem and
Desargues theorem, can sometimes be applied over and over again, rather than
just once. The result is a kind of dynamical system, involving an infinite
family of points and lines. The mathematics behind the dynamical system usually
transcends the mathematics behind the original result. For instance, one example
studied by Schwartz leads to connections with integrable partial differential
equations, determinental identities, and alternating sign matrices. Schwartz
proposes to continue investigating these dynamical systems.

The third topic involves computer aided mathematics. One frequently encounters a
situation where the computer says that a certain result is true, but a proof is
nowhere insight. Schwartz plans to investigate several situations where it might
be possible to use the output of the computer directly as the basis of a proof
that the result is true. In other words, the computation itself becomes the
justification of the result. More concretely, Schwartz would like to try to
deduce the entire orbit structure of certain kinds of dynamical systems based on
a finite amount of information on the orbit. Obviously such a goal would only
work in special situations.
