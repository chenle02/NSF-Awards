This is a proposal to understand the excitation of fast magnetosonic waves and
their interaction with relativistic electrons in the radiation belts. Fast
magnetosonic waves have long been observed near the equator in the
magnetosphere. They are thought to be generated by energetic (10s of keV)
protons with a ring distribution. Recent studies indicate that these waves are
ion Bernstein waves whose properties change to magnetosonic like but this is not
understood. The fast magnetosonic waves are thought to contribute to pitch angle
scattering and acceleration of relativistic electrons through Landau resonance,
bounce resonance and transit time scattering. The relative importance of these
mechanisms is not known. This research will use satellite data analysis, linear
kinetic dispersion theory, kinetic plasma simulations and test particle
computations to investigate the excitation of these waves and their interaction
with the relativistic electrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is a young
assistant professor and the work will support a graduate student.
