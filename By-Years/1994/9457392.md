This research investigates modeling and estimation of power consumption as well
as techniques for minimizing power at the various levels of design abstraction
(layout, logic, register- transfer and behavioral levels). Principles and
methods to guide the design of power efficient electronic systems are being
explored; and the impact of availability of low-power design techniques on chip,
module, and system level designs is being assessed. Topics being investigated
include: spatio-temporal power estimation; state assignment for low power; power
dissipation in boolean networks; common subexpression extraction; and FPGA
synthesis for low power.
