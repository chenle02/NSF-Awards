Fiber reinforced organic matrix composites are being used or proposed as
primary and secondary structures for numerous military and commercial
applications. The presence of flaws and residual stresses in these composites
are often caused by the fabrication and/or installation process. Moreover, the
structural behavior of these advanced materials is known to be affected by in-
service environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, pressure, impact,
etc.). These conditions induce residual stresses and microcracking in the
composite, and can irreversibly degrade the fiber/matrix interface. The proposed
research is designed to develop and demonstrate a novel automated NDE technique,
laser speckle shearing interferometry, capable of rapidly determining the
residual stresses and locating flaws in composites. By allowing fundamental
real-time measurements to be made in situ, the development of engineering models
can be attained, and thus will contribute to improved basic studies of composite
materials under various operational conditions. The technique is viable and
suitable for operation in a manufacturing environment or dept/repair facility
and in the field. Two minority undergraduate students and one graduate student
of engineering will assist the principal investigator in the proposed research.
