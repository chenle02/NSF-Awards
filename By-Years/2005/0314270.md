In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Weisman will extend his investigations to newly discovered
compounds of C60 and oxygen in order to understand their light- and heat-induced
reactions and structures. Experimental measurements will include reaction
kinetics, excited state lifetimes and spectra, and luminescence efficiency and
spectra. Further, extended studies will include fullerenes beyond C60 and C70,
such as C84, which is found in several isomeric forms. A special higher
fullerene is the elongated D5d isomer of C80. The photophysical properties of
this compound will be studied to help understand the relation between properties
of spheroidal fullerenes and single-walled carbon nanotubes. The recent
detection and interpretation of near-infrared emission of nanotubes will be
exploited in additional studies. These will address the energies, assignments,
and line shapes of additional nanotube transitions, the magnitudes and species-
dependencies of their fluorescence quantum yields, and other important
characteristics of these systems. The broader impacts of these studies include
potential applications to solar energy conversion, optical limiting, and
photodynamic medical therapy, as well potential developments that lead to
molecular-scale electronics and novel high strength materials.
