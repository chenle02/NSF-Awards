The study of voters and elections has shed considerable light on people's vote
choices and election outcomes. Scholars have learned a lot about the
distribution of preferences at particular points in time. They also can often
account for one election outcome being different from another. Yet, little is
known about the evolution of electoral sentiment over times, about how
individuals' vote choices and election outcomes come into focus. The current
study is addressed at redressing this imbalance, focusing on a set of empirical
questions: at what point during the electoral cycle do voter choices harden, so
that we can forecast from polls what the next election will bring? Also, at what
point can one read the election outcome from `fundamental` information? What
role does the election campaign actually play? The researchers undertake a range
of analyses, focusing on four different sets of data: 1) time series of
presidential trial heats; 2) time series of generic congressional poll answers;
3) state polls for presidential, gubernatorial, and U.S. Senatorial elections;
and, 4) survey data. The data set to be constructed will be of value to other
scholars interested in the topic, and, this project promises to enhance our
understanding of the question.
