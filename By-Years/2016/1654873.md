This proposal seeks NSF support for a three-day workshop on Geometry for Signal
Processing and Machine Learning to be held October 13?15, 2016 in Estes Park,
Colorado. The workshop is being organized by Ali Pezeshki, Colorado State
University (PI of this proposal), Doug Cochran, Arizona State University, and
Louis Scharf, Colorado State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will
explore applications that impel manifold modeling, and develop a framework for
solving inference problems on manifolds. Specific objectives of the workshop
include&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? identifying challenging problems of signal
processing and machine learning that lie outside the scope of subspace methods,
&lt;br/&gt;? identifying models and methods from modern geometry that address
these problems, &lt;br/&gt;? identifying a set of open research questions that
would inform NSF?s continuing and future investments in signal processing and
machine learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective is to develop a
theory as broad in its scope and as precise in its methodologies as modern
statistical signal processing. Such a theory would extend linear subspace models
and augment statistical reasoning with geometrical reasoning.
