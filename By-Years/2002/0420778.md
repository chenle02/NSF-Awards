The acquisition and implementation of a 680-channel Digital
Data&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition System (DDAS) for the Segmented Germanium Array
(SeGA) at&lt;br/&gt;the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory's (NSCL)
allows the&lt;br/&gt;identification of positions of interactions for gamma-rays
within SeGA&lt;br/&gt;detector crystals by pulse shape analysis of digitized
signals. Spatial&lt;br/&gt;resolution in the detectors with the DDAS implemented
will be at least&lt;br/&gt;by a factor of two better than that achievable with
the current analog&lt;br/&gt;electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SeGA photon
spectrometer is a $2M instrument commissioned in 2001,&lt;br/&gt;and is
currently the world's largest operational highly-segmented&lt;br/&gt;high-purity
germanium detector array for gamma-ray spectroscopy with&lt;br/&gt;fast exotic
beams. SeGA is central to the research of five faculty&lt;br/&gt;members, their
postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;at Michigan
State University and available to all users of the NSCL. &lt;br/&gt;Roughly half
of all experiments approved by the NSCL's external Program&lt;br/&gt;Advisory
Committee (PAC) require SeGA for gamma-ray detection. &lt;br/&gt;Participating
students will be exposed to the novel and potent&lt;br/&gt;applications of the
state-of-the-art digital technology and will have an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to
develop skills in signal processing, data analysis and&lt;br/&gt;computer
programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the proposed DDAS, the SeGA array will be
the world's first digital&lt;br/&gt;photon spectrometer for fast exotic beam
spectroscopy, ahead of several&lt;br/&gt;other efforts currently under
consideration, preserving the current&lt;br/&gt;world-leading role of the NSCL's
photon spectroscopy program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
