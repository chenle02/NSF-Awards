9601893 Robertson Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) replicates in nuclei of
cells which have excited the cell cycle. Proliferating cell nuclear
antigen(PCNA), an accessory factor for DNA polymerase gamma, was co-localized
with TGMV in infected cells but was absent in comparable, differentiated cells
of healthy plants. PCNA is the first example of a host protein associated with
geminivirus infections. The specific goals of this work are: 1) To determine if
TGMV infection causes the accumulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins 2) To
determine if the viral replication protein, AL1, causes an increase in the
expression of other host proteins and 3)To determine if TGMV DNA is
preferentially replicated or if chromosomal DNA is also replicated. %%% The
results of this investigation should lead to important insights into the
mechanisms and possible linkage of viral pathogenesis and cell cycle regulation
in the host plant. New approaches for the control of viral plant diseases may be
developed from the enhanced understanding of such interactions. ***
