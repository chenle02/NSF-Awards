The aim of this research is to contribute both the theory and applications of
multivariate splines. The theoretical questions to be addressed involve
dimensions of multivariate spline spaces, construction of local bases for these
spaces, and study of their approximation power. In addition to the traditional
spaces defined on triangulations, new spaces defined on triangulations of the
sphere or other 3D objects will also be investigated. The applications involve
the use of simulated annealing to construct optimal triangulations, the design
of shape preserving interpolation and data fitting methods, the use of radial
basis functions for penalized least squares fitting, and adaptive methods for
fitting functions of many variables.
