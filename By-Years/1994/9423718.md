9423718 WILSON Rapid growth is beneficial to animals because large size gives
advantages in competing with other animals, reproduction, and avoiding
predators. The practical benefits of rapid growth in domestic animals is obvious
in terms of dairy, egg, and meat production. Nonetheless, few organisms in their
natural environment grow as fast as they are capable, suggesting there are
negative effects. Although the positive effects of rapid growth are very well
known, almost nothing is known about the negative effects. This study will
examine the benefits of rapid growth and possible constraints on growth rate in
a common sport fish, the pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). Some
populations of pumpkinseed show a rapid juvenile growth rate in response to
competition with bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus). Fish from these populations
will be compared with fish from lakes without bluegill competitors (and known to
grow more slowly) to determine what effects rapid growth has had on: a) risk-
taking to obtain food, b) slowed or compromised skeletal development, c)
decreased ability to store lipids for the first winter of life, and d) decreased
immune response to both bacterial and parasitic infection.
