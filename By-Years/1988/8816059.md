Professor Gelbart is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies directed at understanding the
nature of amphiphiles. Amphiphiles are molecules which consist of a hydrophobic
oil-soluble portion, and an ionic or polar water soluble portion. Amphiphiles
aggregate to form micelles, and they are also involved in lipid bilayers which
comprise biological membranes. Professor Gelbart's research will focus on
several of the fundamental features of amphiphiles including the bending
elasticity of surfactant films, phase transitions between defect states of
amphiphilic lamellae, and successive orientational orderings in adsorbed
monolayers. The self-assembly process which gives rise to the micellar unit will
be studied in an effort to determine the way in which flow fields (viscous
forces) affect the size of micelles. When appropriate, Monte Carlo and molecular
dynamics simulations will be performed.
