9616195 Suppes Donor organs used for heart, liver, kidney, or other transplants
have severely limited storage times. Typically, the operation must be performed
within 24 to 48 hours for the best opportunity of success. The proposed research
will perform fundamental research which could directly lead to a method for
successfully storing or even freezing these donor organs at lower temperatures
without loosing organ viability for transplants. These new storage methods would
be a direct result of fundamental data of the impact of high pressure on tissue.
The proposed research will investigate the impact of high pressures, rates of
pressure changes, thermally induced freezing, and pressure induced freezing on
the viability of red blood cells and bovine sperm. The proposed program should
be considered as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research since little if any
cryobiology has been performed at the proposed high pressures. The proposed
funding is sufficient to determine if further investigation is warranted. ***
