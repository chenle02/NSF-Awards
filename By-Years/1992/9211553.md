This research consists of four separate, but related empirical projects aimed at
increasing our understanding of altruistic behavior and household saving. The
projects examine the relationship between monetary charitable contributions and
volunteer labor supply; the degree to which private intrafamily transfers are
affected by public transfers; the effects on household saving of the 1986
changes in the tax treatment of Individual Retirement Accounts; and the effects
of borrowing constraints on household saving and the consumption of durables.
The first study develops a theoretical model of household charitable behavior
that yields several important empirical propositions. These will be examined
using data from both the 1986 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and a new
dataset on volunteerism. The study of intrafamily transfers will be the first to
examine existing theoretical models and the responsiveness of intrafamily
transfers using data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics. The third study
will use the three-way SCF panel to analyze the effects of statutory changes in
deductible IRA contribution limits. It will extend the authors' previous work in
this area. The last project will investigate the duration of borrowing
constraints and the effects of these constraints on household saving and the
consumption of durables using the SCF panel.
