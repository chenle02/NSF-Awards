The long range goal of this research is to provide a unified treatment of
various algebraic structures consisting of a Boolean algebra with additional
operations. A major effort will be made to develop within that framework an
interpretation of computing programs and of related concepts that represents
more faithfully the operational properties of these concepts than does the
notion of a dynamic algebra. This will lead to other questions of general
interest concerning various classes of operators on a Boolean algebra. This
research is at the broad interface of logic, algebra and computer science. The
subject of universal algebra and lattices will be studied for their own right
and for their applications to theoretical computer science.
