The research team will investigate the fabrication and performance of
circularly-symmetric-grating, surface-emitting (CSGSE) semiconductor lasers. The
objective of the research is the development and demonstration of an AlGaAs-GaAs
semiconductor laser that emits a beam with a circular cross-section. Such a
laser has the potential to improve the efficiency with which light can be
coupled into an optical fiber, to reduce the divergence of the emitted beam, and
to serve as the basic element in a two- dimensional phase-locked array. Circular
grating will be fabricated in AlGaAs-GaAs semiconductor laser structures, grown
my molecular beam epitaxy, using electron-beam writing and chemically-assisted
ion-beam etching. Quantum-well laser structures grown on misoriented GaAs
substrates will be used to obtain the highest quality material and the lowest
threshold current density possible, and to minimize the possibility of
filamentary lasing. The circular grating will operate to produce oscillating
laser modes in the waveguide that are radially inward- and outward-going
circular waves. The use of a second-order grating will allow a circularly-
symmetric beam to be coupled out of the laser through the surface. The
fabrication and experimental evaluation of the laser will be accompanied and
guided by theoretical analysis.
