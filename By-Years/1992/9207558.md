It is becoming more common for biologists to collect multiple choices of the
same gene from a population, and to get the exact DNA sequence for each. By
looking at the differences that have occurred between the sequences, an idea how
long ago they diverged from each other can be ascertained. When DNA sequences
are collected for a single gene in a single population, they will be closer
relatives the smaller the population size has been small. More similar DNA
sequences are expected if the population size has been small. This project
investigates the statistical methods for using these DNA differences to estimate
the size of the population. The more complicated case of many populations will
also be investigated and the ranges of migration of genes among populations
estimated. Ultimately this will allow consideration of the times back to the
common ancestors of all modern humans and a formulation of a picture of how
small population sizes of the human species were hundreds of thousands of years
ago. To calculate the quantities that are needed for these estimates, the
different ways that the DNA sequences in our sample could be related to each
other must be calculated. Computers are used to randomly sample a large number
of possible genealogies. This is a promising method of exploring the statistical
meaning of population samples of DNA sequences. In this way, population sizes,
migration rates, and similar genetic parameters can be estimated without making
unrealistic assumptions. The computer programs developed will be freely
distributed as part of the PHYLIP package of computer programs for
reconstructing phylogenies.
