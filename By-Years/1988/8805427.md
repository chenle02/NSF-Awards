This research addresses the development of basic understanding of the processing
of metal matrix composites. Continuous fiber reinforced metal matrix composites
have extremely high specific strength and stiffness, and have potential use in
many advanced systems. Finite-element analysis, model experiments, and
mechanical behavior investigations will be used to develop process parameters
and an understanding of the basic factors governing the reliable processing of
oriented metal-matrix composites. The results are expected to provide a
significant basis for the processing of this high-performance family of
materials.
