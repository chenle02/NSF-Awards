During the last 30 years, the world economy has seen unprecedented economic
growth in a group of 'emerging countries'. During the same time period, these
countries have accumulated positive net positions in safe financial assets. This
award funds research in macroeconomics that builds and analyzes a new model to
investigate how the resulting increase in demand for safe assets from emerging
countries affects macroeconomic stability. This includes effects on both
industrialized nations and emerging countries. The research also considers
whether this change in the demand for safe assets increases the need for
macroeconomic policy interventions. The project will advance science by helping
us understand the role of banks in issuing liabilities and the mechanisms behind
the sever employment consequences of financial crises. It will advance national
prosperity by providing new insight into whether or not policy interventions are
desirable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model has financial intermediaries playing a
central role in the intermediation of funds from agents in excess of funds
(lenders) to agents in need of funds (borrowers). In this process financial
intermediaries issue liabilities and make loans. Bank liabilities are held for
insurance purposes by other economic sectors; they affect individual economic
decisions when these decisions involve significant risk. When the banking sector
expands, agents in the nonfinancial sector hold more financial assets, are
better insured, and are more willing to engage in economic activities that are
individually risky but desirable in the aggregate. As a result, the economic
grows. However, there is a downside. In the process of issuing more liabilities,
the intermediation sector becomes exposed to liquidity crises. Therefore, there
is a trade-off for policy between the benefits of an expanded financial system
and the costs of greater financial and macroeconomic instability. The project
studies the desirability of policy interventions in the presence of this trade
off.
