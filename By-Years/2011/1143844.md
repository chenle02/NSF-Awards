Members of the Math and Science Partnership (MSP) community are engaged
throughout the year in partnerships aimed at increasing K-12 student success in
STEM, and in research, evaluation and technical assistance projects that are
studying and supporting this work. The MSP program's annual Learning Network
Conference (LNC) brings together teams of STEM faculty and administrators from
higher education institutions and K-12 schools, education researchers and
evaluators, and personnel from supporting partners including community groups,
non-profits, government labs, and informal science education organizations.
Through this project, a team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is
organizing the January 2012 LNC, in close collaboration with MSP program staff
and a national planning committee consisting of members of various projects
representing the wide variety of projects in the MSP program. The project has
two primary outcomes. First, it is designing and organizing the LNC. During the
seven months leading up to the conference, the project team is bringing together
members of a national planning committee and facilitating the committee's
development of the conference theme and strands, orchestrating the conference
paper abstract submission and peer review process, and developing traditional
and creative, interactive activities to occur during the conference to achieve
the conference goals. Second, the project is providing technical assistance to a
subset of the papers being presented at the LNC, with the goal of readying these
for publication in national STEM journals. During a pre-conference session, the
organizing committee is helping the authors organize their papers around common
themes for submission to special issues of mathematics and science education
journals; papers not fitting a common theme are being encouraged to pursue other
STEM education journals or peer-reviewed conference venues for publication.
