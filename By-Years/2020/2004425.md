This award will provide support for the "1st COFI Workshop on the Intersection
Between Dark Matter and Neutrinos.” It will be held January 24-26, 2020 in Old
San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the headquarters of the Colegio de Física Fundamental
e Interdisciplinaria de las Américas (COFI) institute. The goal of this workshop
is to discuss the challenges of research at the intersection between dark matter
and non-accelerator based neutrino physics -- topics at the forefront of several
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has a particular focus on early career
scientists and graduate students, including local (based in Puerto Rico)
scientists and graduate students, and it will provide participant travel support
for a fraction of PhD students and junior postdocs travelling domestically or
internationally to enable them to participate in the workshop. The speakers will
consist of top scientists, postdoctoral researchers and PhD students in physics
in North America, Latin America and Europe. Priority will be given to female and
junior talented individuals. This conference will be attended by a significant
number of scientists belonging to under-represented minority groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of the research covered by the workshop
requires an interdisciplinary approach involving novel instrumentation and
analysis and theoretical development, as well as inputs from particle physics,
nuclear and atomic physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and computational science.
The objective of the workshop is to bring these groups together -- not only to
discuss current results and ongoing research, but also to develop a long-term
collaboration scheme to further advance the interdisciplinary nature of this
area and how to train the next generation to work across fields from the very
beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
