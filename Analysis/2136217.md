This Research Training Group project aims to enhance research in the field of
dynamics. Dynamics is a vibrant area of mathematics, originating with the work
of Poincar√© in celestial mechanics, that aims to describe the time evolution of
mechanical systems and of abstract models of such systems. Ten faculty members
at Northwestern University are leading undergraduates, graduate students, and
postdoctoral researchers in vertically integrated activities to enhance their
education and professional development. The larger goal is to increase the
number of researchers in the US who are well prepared to carry out work in the
mathematical sciences, with a focus on increasing the numbers from historically
underrepresented groups.

The specialties of the participating faculty cover a wide range of dynamical
fields and interact with numerous other areas of mathematics, including number
theory, combinatorics, partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, group
theory, probability, and representation theory. The project includes summer
thematic schools, research workshops, and research experiences for
undergraduates that will enhance training across the US, as well as revision and
expansion of the curriculum and other activities that will benefit graduate
students and undergraduates. The improved training is designed to lead to
greater competitiveness for US citizens and permanent residents at every level.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
