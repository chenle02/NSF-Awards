This project significantly improves the laboratory component of the freshman
level general education computer science course at Central Michigan University.
This teaching laboratory consists of 40 Macintosh SE microcomputers networked to
a Macintosh file server. A second Macintosh II serves as instructor station for
interaction with students. Laser and dot matrix printers supply the required
hard copy. The software used is user friendly, modern, and reflects the common
uses of microcomputers. The institution is providing matching funds in an amount
equal to or greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
