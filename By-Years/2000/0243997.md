The University of South Florida establishes an interdisciplinary Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site focusing on the modeling, synthesis
and characterization of nanomaterials. Twelve students are recruited every year
for ten-week summer research experience. Eight professors from the Departments
of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical
Engineering serve as research advisors. Students participate in research
projects with a focus on molecular science and its applications in
nanotechnology, including theoretical modeling, synthesis, characterization and
applications of nanomaterials. Students also attend workshops on
instrumentation, patenting and licensing, ethics in research, tours of local
high tech companies, and group social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
