This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Eric Hegg at the University of Utah to model
the active site of acetyl-CoA synthase. This unusual enzyme allows certain
organisms to use carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source. Model complexes
will be prepared that will lead to a better understanding of the active site and
the reaction mechanism of acetyl-CoA synthase. Ultimately this work will provide
important information concerning acetyl-CoA biosynthesis and enzymatic C1/C2
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated within this research is an
educational component designed to improve undergraduate biochemistry courses. A
major thrust of this plan is to develop and utilize computer-based laboratory
modules that will allow students to apply the concepts learned in class,
demonstrate real-world applications of the information covered in the course,
and expose them to the many new technologies required in modern biochemical
research.&lt;br/&gt;
