9205646 Kesler This is a study of several important features of greenstone gold
deposits, the largest hypogene gold deposits in the world. Research will be on
the Porcupine district, Ontario, where high-grade gold ore is well developed and
where we have collected over 400 barren veins from an area of 2000 km2
surrounding the deposits. Work will involve study of the structural setting of
high-grade ore, fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry of ore and
barren veins, and inclusion gas, stable isotope and radiogenic isotope analyses
of barren and high-grade veins. The research will include analysis of inclusions
in gold and related minerals, and an attempt to obtain isotopic ages on minerals
from different pasts of sheeted veins to determine the period over which the
deposits formed. The results are expected to provide insights into the source of
the gold-forming fluid and its relation to the evolution of Archean greenstone
terrains, as well as structural and geochemical parameters that could guide
exploration for these deposits.
