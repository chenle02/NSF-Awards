Research funding for the Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering at
Drexel University has grown 370% over five years. This increase occurred
although the laboratories are outdated, poorly organized, improperly ventilated
and inefficient. This Award will renovate most of the Department's civil
engineering laboratories so that they may accommodate the increased research
effort and allow continued growth of the research program. The laboratories were
built forty to eighty years ago and were last renovated over twenty years ago.
Within these labs the Department trains undergraduate and graduate students and
conducts its extensive research program. The current condition of the space
greatly hampers all aspects of this training and research. Test samples cannot
be installed and removed effectively. Faculty and students are forced to work in
areas where temperatures routinely reach 110oF. Dust from abraded concrete
floors threatens to contaminate experiments. Research efforts within the
Department include the world-renowned Geosynthetic Research Institute;
geotechnical and environmental engineering addressing issues of pollution
abatement, structural engineering focusing on earthquake safety and innovative
methods in masonry construction; and civil engineering materials research
developing improved methods of testing and using materials.
