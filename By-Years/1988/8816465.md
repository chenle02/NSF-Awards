This proposal will provide partial funding for the "1st World Congress of
Biomechanics". This new international conference will provide a useful and
coordinated mechanism for the dissemination of knowledge in this new and growing
field of engineering. Topics to be covered will include both current research
and projections for future needs and trends in biomechanics research. It is the
intent of the organizers of this meeting to consolidate the various small
national and international meetings into a single large one, so that an
interdisciplinary synergism can enrich the field of biomechanics.
