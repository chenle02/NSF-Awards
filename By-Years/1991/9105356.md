This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of an image processing
system and high-temperature stage for use with a petrographic microscope. The
system will be installed and operated in the Division of Geological and
Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. The Institute is
committed to providing matching funds. The equipment will be used to study and
interpret quantitatively the nucleation and growth of bubbles in silicate melts
in a range of chemical compositions corresponding to natural magmas. A
quantitative model of bubbling in magmas is an important step leading to an
interpretation of the origin of igneous rocks, volcanos, and an understanding of
the Earth's mass budget of critical gases such as H2O and CO2.
