This award provides continued funding for a 3-year REU Site Program in Membrane
Applied Science and Technology, at the University of Cincinnati, under the
direction of Dr. William B. Krantz. This 10-week summer program will provide 10
chemical engineering undergraduate students from other institutions with
research experiences with particularly emphasizing biomedical and pharmaceutical
applications. This Site Program will be linked to the Cincinnati site of the NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Membrane Applied Science and
Technology (MAST), the only block-funded membrane research center in the U.S.
Each student will be assigned a faculty mentor and will work with graduate
students in the MAST Center on challenging research problems defined by
interaction with industry, interdisciplinary research, and exceptional
facilities. In addition, the students will participate in a seminar focusing on
research methods, probelm solving, ethics, communications skills and a student
posters competition.
