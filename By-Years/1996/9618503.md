Knapp, Gillian AST 96-18503 Dr. Knapp will investigate the phenomenon of mass
loss in the late stages of stellar evolution. Her observational program will
allow the determination of the size, shape and velocity structure of the dusty
molecular circumstellar envelope of stars with the goal of providing insight
into the asymmetries of mass loss and the evolution of mass loss rates over
time. Two specific projects will be carried out : 1) mapping the radio
photospheres of stars with the VLA for comparison with structure observed in the
circumstellar envelope, and 2) investigating multiple winds in late AGB stars
using a large survey of molecular emission line profiles from circumstellar
envelopes. ***
