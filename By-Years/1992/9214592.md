In this proposal, the P.I. describe a research program focused on the RF
properties of superconductors, the relevant physics, and device applications.
Particular focus is on the RF properties of thin films to the high-Tc cuprate
superconductors; the properties of nanoscale superconducting transmission lines
for which nonlinearties and finite relaxation effects become important, and
nonlinear wave device applications of series array Josephson junction
transmission lines. The work involves RF measurements, device modeling and
circuit simulation, as required. The work is being carried out in association
with a larger, emerging program at Stanford on cryoelectronics.
