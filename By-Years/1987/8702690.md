This international meeting, "The Molecular Biology of Mitochondria and
Chloroplasts", will be held at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, N.Y. from
Tuesday, August 25, through Sunday, August 30, 1987. Emphasis will be on the
most recent advances in the biogenesis of mitochondria and chloroplasts and the
characterization, expression and transmission of the genomes of these
organelles. A broad spectrum of scientists working with plants, animals and
lower eukaryotes will be given a unique opportunity to discuss developments in
organelle biogenesis. This conference will not only deal with structural and
functional aspects of organelle, but also with the comparative evolution of
chloroplasts and mitochondria.
