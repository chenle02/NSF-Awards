This is a proposed joint research effort among three institutions: Hughes
Research Laboratory (HRL, James G. Nash), University of Southern California
(USC, S.Y. Kung), and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn, Richard P. Paul).
This effort is to develop a special-purpose systolic-array computer for use in a
robotics environment. Each of the three parties has special talents with regard
to this proposed research: HRL is concerned with the architecture and algorithms
for matrix-based linear algebraic computers; the research at USC is aimed at
mapping problems into arrays; and UPenn specializes in robot manipulator control
problems. The purposes of this effort are to interface a high-performance
systolic-array processor to a robot manipulator, to re-evaluate and improve on
the design of the processor, to develop new parallel algorithms for such
machines, to develop and evaluate various appropriate kinematic control
algorithms, and to develop algorithms for projecting problems onto machines of
this type. In the opinion of the program director, these are three first-class
researchers who propose research on an experimental system that may
significantly impact the robotics control area. Funding with the revised budgets
and added conditions in the attached documents is strongly recommended.
