The overall objective of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms involved
in the regulation of B. subtilis SOS genes following DNA damage and during
competence development. During the previous granting period we purified the B.
subtilis SOS repressor, cloned the corresponding gene, and characterized four
SOS operators. We showed that repressor inactivation in vitro requires RecA,
activated with single-stranded DNA and NTP, and we have evidence suggesting that
repressor is phosphorylated, but cleaved, under these conditions. We will
dissect the molecular details of repressor inactivation in vitro and confirm its
role in vivo by: (1) conducting kinetic studies in vitro and in vivo; (2)
isolating and characterizing mutants defective in the inactivation mechanism;
(3) identifying nucleotide binding and operator binding domains by cross-linking
analysis ; and (4) studying repressor conformation changes upon inactivation in
vitro and in vivo. We previously showed that during competence development B.
subtilis RecA is induced by a mechanisms that is distinct from SOS regulation,
whereas other SOS genes are induced by an SOS-like mechanism (Lovett, et al.,
1989). During the last granting period we showed that competence-specific RecA
induction is not accompanied by SOS repressor inactivation indicating the RecA
induction in competent cells is due to repressor displacement. We will
systematically test three possible ways in which displacement could occur. Our
recent discovery that E. coli Lex A blocks competence-specific RecA induction,
but not SOS-like induction will be exploited as a means to separate the two
induction pathways during competence development. %%% This research will provide
insight into an important mechanism by which cells repair damage to their DNA.
In addition, it will provide valuable research training to undergraduate
students at Williams College.
