theory of kinetic Alfven waves along auroral field lines in the Earth's
magnetosphere. Such waves play a major role in carrying energy from the outer
magnetosphere to lower altitudes where it accelerates the precipitating
electrons and ions that cause the aurora. The plasma processes that dominate the
physics in the lower regions of auroral field lines are inherently kinetic and
so are not well described by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory. The auroral
acceleration region is coupled to the collisional ionosphere and can change the
conductivity of the ionosphere. A detailed study of the kinetic processes that
accelerate auroral particles and the electrodynamic coupling of this region to
the ionosphere is necessary to understand the basic plasma processes that power
the aurora. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will focus on three main
processes that affect the coupling of the magnetosphere and ionosphere: (1)
cross-scale coupling by nonlinear interactions of Alfven waves and wave packets,
(2) evolution of the plasma density in the auroral zone, and (3) electron
kinetic effects and ionospheric feedback in the three-dimensional ionosphere.
These processes will be studied by analytical theoretical methods and numerical
models based on existing numerical codes. A reduced MHD description based on the
Strauss equations will be used to investigate nonlinear interactions across
perpendicular spatial scales in the auroral zone. This nonlinear model will be
extended to include two-fluid parallel dynamics which will enable the
investigation of density evolution on auroral field lines and the formation of
auroral density cavities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will serve the
educational purpose of training graduate students in methods of developing and
utilizing numerical plasma models. It will contribute to the understanding of
the geospace system, which will assist society in its understanding of space
weather processes that can impact communication and power systems. An
understanding of the plasma physics of the Earth's auroral zone may serve as a
model for particle acceleration processes in the solar corona as well as other
cosmic plasmas.
