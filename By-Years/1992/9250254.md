This project is aimed at a comprehensive redesign cf the laboratory component of
the three-course introductory undergraduate computer science course sequence at
Temple University. The objective is to better address the fundamental and
recurring concepts identified in the ACM/IEEE report Computing Curricula '91,
such as, complexity of large programs, levels of abstraction, binding, abstract
data types, information hiding and separation of concerns, evolution of
requirements, and software reuse. It is planned to introduce these topics by
integrating concepts and tools from current research and practice in software
engineering and object- oriented programming into the three targeted courses.It
is appropriate that the laboratory environment for this project provide
extensive support for the practice of modern techniques in software development,
graphical user interfaces, and adequate class libraries to enable student
projects of moderate to high difficulty. A UNIX based workstation laboratory
most closely meets the corresponding hardware and software requirements. The
equipment provided under this project consists of a SUN SPARCserver and ten
SPARCstations. The SPARC platform has available public domain object-oriented
software such as InterViews, NIHCL class library, and ET++. Good software
availability, excellent computing power, support for graphical interfaces, and
potential for future expandability of the server, are all significant components
of the system planned.
