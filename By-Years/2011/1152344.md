Prof. Cecilia Clementi of Rice University is supported by an award from the
Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of
Chemistry to develop multiscale protein models and new strategies to explore
complex free energy landscapes. This project uses coarse graining as the
starting point to develop multi-resolution protein models, which are combined
with a theoretically robust framework involving a supersymmetric generalization
of the Fokker-Planck diffusion equation, and a mathematically rigorous
definition of collective variables. These methods are applied to rapidly locate
rare event regions in molecular dynamics landscapes, and give a robust
foundation for benchmarking and creating new models of complex systems. The
developed methodology is used to characterize the functional aspects of protein
dynamics on timescales out of reach to conventional approaches.

The broader impacts of this research are in the biological sciences. Prof.
Clementi is involved with the development of courses in computational molecular
biology and an outreach program involving presentations to local schools.

This project is co-funded by the Molecular Biophysics program in Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biology.
