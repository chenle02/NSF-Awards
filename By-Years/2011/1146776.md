Starch is an important energy-storage compound for plants and it makes up a
significant portion of the human diet. In leaves, starch accumulates in
chloroplasts during the day, and is broken down at night to provide energy for
the plant when photosynthesis is not possible. The enzyme responsible for
breaking down most of the starch at night is &amp;#946;-amylase (BAM). There are
nine BAM or BAM-like genes in the Arabidopsis genome, six of which (BAM 1, -2,
-3, -4, -6 and -9) encode proteins that are targeted to chloroplasts. Of these,
only BAM1, -2, -3, and -6 are catalytically active. The focus of this work is on
BAM9, which is located in chloroplasts but is catalytically inactive.
Preliminary evidence from a mutant lacking BAM9, and from its structure and
pattern of expression, suggests that it might play a role in regulating starch
metabolism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three objectives of this work are to 1)
investigate the influence of BAM9 on the diurnal activity of the four active
plastidic BAMs in leaf extracts of mutants lacking the proteins, 2) characterize
the ability of pure BAM9 to bind starch and various small carbohydrates, and 3)
identify and characterize protein(s) that bind to BAM9. It is hypothesized that
BAM9 acts to inhibit the activity of one or more of the active BAMs at dawn when
starch degradation normally stops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help
to characterize the physiological functions of five plastid-targeted
&amp;#946;-amylases in Arabidopsis, and will shed light on how starch metabolism
is regulated in leaves, especially at the night/day transition. The project will
also train a number of undergraduates planning to pursue careers in science, and
a teaching/research postdoctoral scholar planning to pursue a career at a
predominantly undergraduate institution.
