Conference support for the workshop "Magnetic Fields from the Photosphere to
Corona: 2nd ATST-EAST Workshop in Solar Physics", 09-11 November 2011,
Washington, D.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two new large telescopes to study our
local star (the Sun) are under way. The ATST (Advanced Solar Technology
Telescope) is a project of the National Solar Observatory currently in progress,
while the European Solar Telescope (EST) is under discussion and design by the
European Association for Solar Telescopes (EAST). These two telescopes will
bring new enabling technologies and capabilities to the study of the
Sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop brings together the scientific and
technical communities behind the ATST and EST efforts. This meeting is the
second in a series intended to bring together precisely those scientists and
engineers involved in these two new US and European projects. The meeting allows
the participants to exchange ideas on science, technology, and operations of the
telescopes.
