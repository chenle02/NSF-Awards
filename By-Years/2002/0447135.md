EAR-0447135&lt;br/&gt;Weidner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USSA-2000, a Kawai-type
multi-anvil high-pressure apparatus, is a vital element in the Stony Brook high
pressure laboratory. The driving intellectual merit of the proposed work
includes the continuation of the following projects: acoustic velocity
measurements at high pressure and temperature, diffusion studies, phase
equilibria studies, polycrystal synthesis for elasticity measurements,
polycrystal synthesis for rheology measurements, and single crystal synthesis
for structure and elasticity measurements. This award will permit the
replacement of the first stage anvils and upgrade the hydraulic pumping system.
We utilize an anvil design that will accommodate the entire 2000 tons of the
loading frame, whereas the current anvils limit the maximum force to 1200 tons.
The new pumping system will allow automatic loading and unloading, thus saving
operator time and limiting operator error. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact of the proposed development include: graduate student education as part
of research projects, undergraduate education as it is highly used in our REU
summer program, support of research projects for the science community on a 'at
cost' basis. The expanded force capability will give the US community access to
a larger force - hence larger volume at-the-same pressure apparatus than is
currently available. This has proven quite useful with the 5000 ton apparatus at
Bayreuth. While the current system is at a lower force, it is an economical
upgrade that at least uses the full capacity of the existing loading system.&lt;
