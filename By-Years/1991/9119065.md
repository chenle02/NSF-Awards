The primary goal of this project is to learn more about the history of the solar
nebula by studying the chondrite meteorites. During the next two years the PIs
will: examine new chondrite finds related to the Renazzo and Al Rais
carbonaceous chondrites, continue study of the new CK group of carbonaceous
chondrites, analyze some CI-like carbonaceous chondrites and search for other
seemingly exotic chondrites, return to the L/LL chondrites and search for
evidence that will resolve the L/LL chondrites from the LL group. About 30
elements will be analyzed in the PI's lab using high precision neutron
activation analysis. This should provide important data which will contribute to
a better understanding of the formation of the solar system.
