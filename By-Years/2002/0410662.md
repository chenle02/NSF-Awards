From toasters to cell phones and from cars to airplanes, embedded software
implements and controls interactions of devices with their environment, and our
society is increasingly relying on such devices. Despite the proliferation of
embedded devices in almost every engineered product, development of embedded
software remains a low level, time consuming and error prone process. This is
due to the fact that modern programming languages abstract away from time and
platform constraints, while correctness of embedded software relies crucially on
hard deadlines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF-funded research aims at
developing novel model-based design and implementation methodology for
synthesizing reliable embedded software. Hybrid systems models, which allow
mixing state-machine based discrete control with differential equation based
continuous dynamics, are used for design and analysis. The research explores
ways of mapping such models to code guided by correctness, modularity and
portability issues. Technical challenges include bridging the gap between the
platform-independent and timed semantics of the hybrid models and the executable
software generated from it. This includes integrating generation of control
tasks with scheduling to ensure optimal performance. The component technologies
in the project are being implemented and integrated within a toolkit for
experimentation. A computer-aided infusion pump control system, and an unmanned
aerial vehicle using Piccolo avionics board, are chosen as target platforms for
demonstration of the feasibility and benefits of the approach.&lt;br/&gt;
