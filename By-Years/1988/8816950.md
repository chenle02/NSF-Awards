Sedimentary basins are among the most conspicuous results of Neogene
continental extension in the North American Cordillera, however, the connection
between structural development and sedimentologic response is less than clear.
This project will take advantage of an uplifted and dissected late Miocene-
Pliocene extensional basin exposed in the Panamint Valley and Death Valley area
of southeastern California. The work will involve mapping, chemical analysis,
sedimentology and age dating techniques to establish the structural history and
associated sedimentologic response. Results will provide an added dimension to
the subject of extensional tectonics.
