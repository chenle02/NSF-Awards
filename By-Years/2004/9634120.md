ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9634120 PI: Mei This is a study of a range of
problems that are of interest to the field of coastal engineering. The common
feature of the problems under study is that they have several contrasting length
or time scales. Asymptotic and numerical analysis as well as experimental
investigations are being used to investigate the underlying physics. The
problems under investigation are: a) Effects of surface waves on the
resuspension and transport of very fine sediments, b) Wave induced formation of
sand ripples and bars, c) Long-period harbor oscillations induced by narrow
banded short waves, and d) Subharmonic resonance of waves trapped in an array of
vertical cylinders. The subject of fine sediment erosion and transportation in
shallow water bodies is an important problem with serious environmental
implications. The study of long period oscillations and subharmonic resonance of
waves in an array of cylinders are of importance to the design of harbor
facilities. All four topics have an experimental and a theoretical component.
