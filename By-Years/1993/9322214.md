9322214 Mittler An REU Site will be established in the Physics Department of the
University of Massachusetts, Lowell. Undergraduate students will be given a rich
experience in physics research that will provide sufficient means for them to
seriously consider a research career in science. The students will carry out
their own research in the setting of a research group composed of other
undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty. This will foster both
student-student and student-faculty interaction. Each student will have a
faculty mentor. The students will be fully integrated into the research groups
and thus contribute significantly to the research effort. Another aim of the
program is to attract those students who would not normally have a chance to do
research and women, minority members, and the disabled, groups who are typically
underrepresented in physics. A supplementary ethics program will sensitize the
students to the ethics involved in scientific research. Students will be housed
on campus and be offered a number of cultural, community, and recreational
activities. ***
