A central focus for research in science studies is the relationship between
experts and society. This study will analyze the influence of social science
experts in encouraging democratic participation in the formation and
implementation of public policy. To explore this topic, secondary, archival, and
oral history data will be examined in a qualitative historical study of social
scientists employed in developing precursors to the U.S. "War on Poverty"
Community Action Programs. Alternative theories will be considered in an
analysis of the degree and nature of the impact of political and other social
forces on the activity of social science experts. These theories will also be
used to analyze conflicts in work roles and assumptions of the social scientists
in shifting from a "scientific" to a "professional reformer" model of expertise.
This shift occurred during this period. Other research questions focus on the
social scientists' conceptualization of community participation, the persons
served by their actions, and the impact those actions had. The results of this
study will expand our understanding of both the potential and limitations of the
use of social science experts in the promotion of citizen participation in
community reform initiatives. Results will include a book manuscript and
articles in refereed journals and other publications. This research has an
important and timely focus; its results will be useful and accessible to a wide
audience. The qualifications and track record of the investigator are excellent;
institutional support is very good; the research plan is sensible. Support is
highly recommended.
