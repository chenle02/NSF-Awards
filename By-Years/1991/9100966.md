The College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University has a REU program for ten
women and minority students. The REU program is conducted in conjunction with an
ongoing Undergraduate Summer Research Program, sponsored by the Texas
Engineering Experiment Station for the past nine years, and the Minority
Engineering Program. Students for the REU Program are selected from institutions
that have predominantly minority enrollments including the University of Texas
at El Paso, University of Texas at San Antonio, Pan American University,
University of Puerto Rico, and Prairie View A&amp;M as well as Texas A&amp;M
University, with at least half from other institutions. Individual research
projects are undertaken by the undergraduate students in conjunction with on-
going research programs, and regular faculty involved in these programs serve as
advisors for the participants' research activities.
