9729582 Jiang and Lin This award supports collaboration between H.X. Jiang and
J.Y. Lin, Department of Physics, Kansas State University, and Bei Zhang,
Department of Physics, Peking University, on fabrication and optical studies of
gallium-nitride microcavities. Gallium nitride and its allied alloys have
attracted considerable interest recently due to their applications for optical
devices which are active in the blue and ultraviolet wavelengths, and electronic
devices capable of operation at high temperature, high power levels, and harsh
environments. During the period of the proposed cooperative research,
microcavities and laser cavities will be prepared by the Peking University group
and picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence studies will be carried out by
the group at Kansas. The major goals of the research are to identify possible
lasing mechanisms in nitride lasers and to investigate and understand the basic
physical properties related to future nitride optoelectronic devices such as
microcavity lasers and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.
