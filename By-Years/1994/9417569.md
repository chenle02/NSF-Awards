9417569 Hassler The Catholic University of America's School of Engineering has
established a consortium of local-area high school that seeks to introduce
scientific and engineering concepts early in the educational experience. It is
envisioned that this program will promote engineering in the secondary schools,
and provide a much needed educational tool by providing a high speed modem
connection from each of the high schools (at present they include: Elizabeth
Seton High School; Georgetown Visitation Preparatory High School; St. John's
College High School; Gonzaga College High School; Bishop Ireton High School; and
DeMatha Catholic High School) to the worldwide Internet through a mentoring
program at the School of Engineering. Summer programs will provide teacher
training on specific engineering software applications and on general knowledge
and use of the Internet. This project represents a strong beginning to what
should be a continuing effort in redefining the educational process in science
and engineering.
