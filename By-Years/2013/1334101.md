Researchers have developed a sequencing application and associated
bioinformatics techniques to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens. Data and
samples are analyzed using the research team's bioinformatic approach that uses
a Bayesian reassignment model to accurately identify pathogens to a known
database with 1) high accuracy, even 2) with low coverage, and 3) with mixed
samples, 4) no need for sequence assembly, and 5) report back not only accurate
species diagnostics, but also relevant information on antibiotic/antiviral
resistance mutations. Most approaches currently used rely on old microbiology
techniques for growing cultures from samples (a week long process) and
identifying pathogens through visual inspection. This approach has the added
advantage, because it is a genomic approach, of also providing insights into
drug resistance through the identification of drug resistant variants thus
better informing treatment options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate and rapid
pathogen diagnostics is critical to a number of areas of commercial importance
including food safety, human health, and veterinary medicine. This approach has
the potential to revolutionize pathogen diagnostics in multiple areas including
food safety, hospital hygiene, veterinary care, and human health. The approach
used by the research team has the potential to be more rapid, accurate, and
cost-effective. It capitalizes on next-generation sequence data to characterize
the diversity and extent of pathogen infection.
