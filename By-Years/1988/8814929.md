This award provides partial travel support for 16 US academic, US graduate
student, and 3 foreign academic participants to a conference titled "Foundations
of Computer-Aided Process Design." The conference will address the current state
of the art in chemical process design with an introduction to product design and
design in other disciplines. It will provide an assessment of future needs in
computer-aided process design and of educational needs in chemical engineering
design. The proceedings of the conference will be widely disseminated. The
conference may contribute to greater economic competitiveness by helping the
infrastructure for the redesign of existing plants for better energy or
materials usage, for the design of new flexible plants for production of
specialty chemicals, and for the design new products themselves.
