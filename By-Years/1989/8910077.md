Metabolic Pathway Engineering (MPE), defined as the design, analysis, and
construction of biochemical pathways, is an emerging technology with broad
implications for the production of chemicals and the degradation of toxic
compounds. MPE involves adding genetic material to a host organism to modify an
existing pathway or to create a new one. The objective of this project is to
directly address key problems associated with MPE by constructing a new pathway
in E. coli. The model pathway selected for this research is the conversion of
glycerol to 1,3 - propanediol as carried out by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The first
step is to characterize the carbon flux and intracellular intermediate
concentrations of K. pneumoniae, as a basis of comparison with the engineered E.
coli. The final step is to then study the function of the new pathway in E. coli
and investigate its interactions with the host metabolism. This work is expected
to provide new insight into MPE and to provide a well characterized model system
for further research. In addition, 1,3 - propanediol is a useful chemical
intermediate, and it is possible that this work will lead to improvements in its
production.
