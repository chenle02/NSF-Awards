The Complex Systems Research Center of the University of New Hampshire will
acquire the computer equipment necessary to create a unified remote
sensing/georeferenced computer workstation for regional to global scale
ecosystem modeling. The workstation will enhance existing facilities in the
Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space at the university. New
research initiatives in global ecosystem studies and landscape ecology demand
mathematical models with improved spatial resolution and data with georeferenced
characteristics. Remote sensing systems and Geographic Information Systems offer
the possibility for obtaining the necessary data. Yet, these components remain
only discrete unrelated pieces of a potentially integrated system. This project
will bring these pieces together into a highly effective remote sensing
georeferenced modeling system. The computer workstation will have capabilities
for: a) grid and raster GIS, b) vector GIS, c) remote sensing and image
processing, d) point data management, e) array process, f) large database
management (eg. windowing) g) graphics, h) data capture and analysis, and i)
mathematical modeling. Support and facilities at the institution are excellent
as is the primary group of scientists who will make use of the facilities. The
research that the facility is capable of enhancing will be of fundamental
importance at a basic level. Additionally, global considerations such as climate
change, biological diversity and acid precipitation will be addressable by the
newcapabilities. An award is strongly recommended by the Ecosystem Studies
Program.
