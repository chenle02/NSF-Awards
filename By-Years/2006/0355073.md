This research project focuses on the study of quantum systems characterized by
increased complexity. It represents a continuation of the investigator's program
to use laser cooled atoms and optical lattices as a platform for studies of
quantum control and measurement. The project will focus on four main areas: (i)
continuous quantum measurements, (ii) model systems for the study of quantum
nonlinear dynamics, (iii) quantum chaos and quantum/classical correspondence,
and (iv) feedback control of quantum many-body systems. The broader impact
involves student education, applications to quantum information processing and a
broad range of collaborations.
