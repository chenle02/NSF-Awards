This project will provide research on a novel approach to microcomputer
translation of print material into braille and braille to print. Knowledge and
experience are derived from Raised Dot Computing's previous commercially
successful software design and applications development for visually impaired
computer applications. The merits of structured programming language translation
and formatting will be evaluated with respect to various applications: 1.
Construction of braille translation algorithms and tables applicable
microcomputer systems and/or applications software. 2. Implementation of braille
translation algorithms and methods for mathematics, computer code, textbook, and
literary formats. The approach seeks to significantly improve the production and
accessibility of information in braille for use by the visually impaired.
Improved access to microcomputers for the visually will enhance their access to
business, technical, and educational materials and information.
