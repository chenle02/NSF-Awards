Dinerstein, Harriet AST-9731156 Dr. Dinerstein will carry out a program of
spectroscopic observations to search for manifestations of shock activity in the
spectra of planetary nebulae. While shocks and hydrodynamical processes are
considered to be the primary mechanisms for the formation and evolution of the
structure of planetary nebulae, the instantaneous thermal and
ionization/chemical equilibria are still primarily treated as determined by
radiative processes. The PI will re-examine the overall contribution of shocks
to the observed spectra of planetary nebulae. Her observational work will
provide new tests and constraints for the hydrodynamical models and will
distinguish photo-ionized from shock-heated contributions to the observed
spectrum, allowing a more accurate determination of nebular properties such as
the density, mass, and composition of the emitting gas. ***
