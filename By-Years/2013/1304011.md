The Greenland Ice Sheet Monitoring Network (GLISN) is a broadband, multi-use
seismological network, enhanced by selected geodetic observations, designed with
the capability to allow researchers to understand the changes currently
occurring in the Arctic, and with the operational characteristics necessary to
enable response to those changes as understanding improves. GLISN was
established through an international collaboration, with 10 nations coordinating
their efforts to develop the current 32-station observing network during the
last four years. This project will continue operations of six key stations of
the network, as well as data quality control and data-management for the
network. It will also improve the telemetry capability at remote stations to
maximize the scientific utility of the data, reduce data latency, and reduce
logistics costs. Continued leadership by IRIS in the management and coordination
of the International GLISN effort will ensure continued return of high-quality
data from the full 32-station network. Observations from the GLISN network will
allow improved estimation of the Earth structure under Greenland, critical for
reliable estimation, interpretation, and prediction of changes in ice mass, sea
level, and the crustal stress state. These observations will also allow greatly
improved analysis of deformation within the ice sheet and at its calving margins
due to processes including discrete ice-loss events, melt-water drainage,
crevassing, and basal sliding. Seismic analysis provides unique information
about glacier dynamics and sub-glacial geology, complementing other remote-
sensing and in-situ observations. GLISN science and outreach will leverage and
enhance outreach and education programs undertaken by the IRIS Consortium and
its community.
