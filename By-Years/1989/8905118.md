The objective of this research is to characterize the role of tudor, a
Drosophila melanogaster maternal effect locus, in two central events of early
embryogenesis, germ cell determination and abdomen segmentation. The
experimental approach is designed to determine the mechanisms that specify the
spatial and temporal patterns of tudor product distribution during oogenesis and
embryogenesis. This will involve: 1) comparison of tudor mRNA and protein
distribution during germ cell formation and anterior/ posterior axis
establishment in wild type and maternal effect mutant embryos; 2) determination
of the RNA and/or protein sequences responsible for localization of tudor
products to the embryonic posterior pole; and 3) determination whether tudor
expression is required in late embryogenesis. Experimental objectives will be
carried out by introduction and expression of modified tudor gene constructs in
transgenic animals. These studies are expected to contribute to general
understanding of molecular mechanism(s) of embryonic cell fate determination.
