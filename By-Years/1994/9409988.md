9409988 Houze Many of the factors that are critical for understanding and
predicting weather that is disruptive to human activity occur on what
meteorologists term the mesoscale. Mesoscale phenomena are not well sampled by
the operational weather network; therefore, progress is made through episodic
field experiments specially designed to study mesoscale processes. Most
convective storms occur in organized units known as mesoscale convective systems
(MCSs). The Principal Investigator has three objectives that will be
accomplished using a combination of diagnostic studies and advanced numerical
modeling: study the fundamental nature of the dynamics and microphysics of the
three components of MCSs (convective regions, transition region and stratiform
region); study the impact of MCSs on large scale circulations; continue
climatological studies of MCSs including contrasting MCS structures from
different geographical locations. ***
