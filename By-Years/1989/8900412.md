This award will support the US-USSR Algebraic Geometry Symposium to be held
June 21 - July 14, 1989 at the University of Chicago under the direction of
Professor Peter May. Participants will include algebraic geometers from the
United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; the symposium has
been endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Sciences of
the USSR at their meeting in December, 1988. Research issues to be discussed
will range over a wide variety of topics in algebraic geometry, with the purpose
of planning and stimulating future joint research cooperation in the field
between mathematicians in the two countries.
