9218600 Klemperer The Tibetan Plateau is the most prominent continental feature
on our planet and probably one of the most controversial. The controversy stems
from the combination of inherent complexity and lack of data. Knowledge of the
crustal structure and lithology of the plateau is essential to addressing the
questions involved - questions that are central for the understanding of some of
the most fundamental processes shaping the continental lithosphere. Following a
decade of political efforts, the COCORP group managed to establish collaboration
with the Chinese Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources (MGMR) to collect
seismic reflection data across the Himalaya/Tibetan plateau. As the initial test
phase of project INDEPTH (International Deep Profiling of Tibet and the
Himalaya), a 100-km long profile has been collected in southern Tibet during the
summer season of 1992. The Crustal Geophysics group of Stanford University was
invited to conduct a "piggy-back" experiment. The group took a multi-
disciplinary approach, and acquired wide-angle reflection, cross-lines, gravity,
magnetic and remote-sensing data. Their purpose was to provide the lithological
controls so important in resolving between the wealth of existing models, and to
record auxiliary data needed for the complete interpretation of the main COCORP
profile. This project involves the analysis and interpretation of this unique
data set and will be undertaken in close collaboration with both the COCORP
group and the Chinese MGMR scientists under project INDEPTH. ***
