This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Luther College to
establish an REU Site where eight undergraduate science majors will study
heterogeneity in aquatic populations using the theories and techniques of both
ecology and molecular genetics. This integrated approach is designed to maximize
the potential for learning by both the student and faculty participants. The
students and faculty will carry out field and laboratory experiments aimed at
comparing and contrasting populations of the pulmonate snail Physa integra and
the caddisfly Hydropsyche orris from environmentally distinct habitats. The bulk
of the program will take place during a nine-week summer session. Bi-weekly
group meetings will consist of faculty and student research reports and
discussions of relevant journal articles. The participants will be required to
present the results of their summers' research at their home institution and at
appropriate scientific meetings.
