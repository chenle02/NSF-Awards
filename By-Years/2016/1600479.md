This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "SEAM 2016: The 32nd Southeastern Analysis Meeting" that will be held
March 13-15, 2016, on the campus of the University of South
Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the latest installment in a thirty-
one-year-long series of conferences covering a wide spectrum of subareas of
analysis. In particular, SEAM has become the leading conference venue in the
U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2016 will again span a broad
swath of analysis, featuring three plenary speakers who will address topics in
complex analysis (Stephen Gardiner), harmonic analysis (Alexander Volber), and
approximation theory (Doron Lubinsky). A highlight of the meeting will be
invited talks by five junior mathematicians: Tom Alberts, Kelly Bickel, Greg
Knese, Shahaf Nitzan, and James Pascoe. The conference program provides ample
opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
