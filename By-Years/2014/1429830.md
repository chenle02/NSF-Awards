Stanford University requests $3,500,000 over 36 months to acquire an extreme GPU
HPC cluster, called X-GPU, comprising 54 compute nodes built using the Cray
Hydra technology with FDR Infiniband. Each node has Intel Haswell 12-cores; 8
NVIDIA Kepler cards; 128 GB of DDR4 memory; a 120 GB SSD and two 1 TB hard
drives. energy-efficient, computational facility providing almost a petaflop of
computational power. It will be used by 1) at least 25 research groups
representing more than 100 students and postdoctorals at Stanford across 15
departments and 4 schools, 2) at least 8 collaborators from at least 7 other
institutions across the nation, and 3) by as many as hundreds of national
researchers through the NSF-sponsored XSEDE allocation system. The PIs plan to
offer 25% of X-GPU to XSEDE to offset the impacts from the planned retiring of
Keeneland, the current XSEDE resource providing heterogeneous parallel computing
with CPUs and GPUs to the national community.&lt;br/&gt;Identified scientific
outcomes enabled by this instrument include, but not limited to: astrophysics
and cosmology, bioinformatics and biology, materials modeling, and climate
modeling. The researchers have already invested significant efforts to develop
modeling and simulation codes that can demonstrate high performance on GPU-
accelerated clusters. The PIs plan develop software infrastructure and
educational materials to help the national community in the transition to fine-
grained parallel thinking and algorithm design, which is critical to effectively
use this novel high-performance, low-cost, energy-efficient architecture.
