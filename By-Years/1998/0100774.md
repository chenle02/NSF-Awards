Dr. Patrick J. Farmer of the Department of Chemistry, University of California
at Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, National Science Foundation, for
his work on modeling the chemistry of heme-based nitrite and sulfite reductases.
The various enzymes perform integral steps in the biochemical cycling of
nitrogen and sulfur, which are of importance in the global denitrification of
soil fertilizers and in the removal of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, which are
pollutants from industrial waste-waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies will
have implications for the global effects of modern agriculture, based on
understanding the chemical basis for the generation of non-carbon greenhouse
gases. The studies will provide a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate
students (some are Asian, Hispanic or from Eastern European countries) with
invaluable experience that will be relevant to the American economy, and will
form the training ground for the next generation of scientists.
