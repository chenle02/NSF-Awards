This project uses sea urchin embryos to provide a curriculum module for inquiry-
based high school biology. The curriculum is provided via a new open access
website, addresses several of the National Science Content Standards and
provides a range of activities suitable for all levels of high school biology.
The curriculum, through the website, will also provide instructional support
materials such as video demonstrations, animations, time lapse videos and image
galleries relevant to each exercise. Also included will be substantial material
for professional development, including descriptions relating each activity to
the national content standards, discussion of major ideas and concepts and links
to additional pertinent resources. For each lab concept, five types of
activities will be developed: classroom wet labs, virtual wet labs, web-based
bioinformatics labs, data manipulation activities and activities for accessing
the primary scientific literature. Each activity provides an independent lesson
and teachers will be able to create a custom module for one to six weeks of
biology curriculum in Grades 9-12.
