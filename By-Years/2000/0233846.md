This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
trace-gas detection system based on a novel laser spectroscopic technique called
Phase Sensitive Spectroscopy. This new spectroscopy technique may increase
sensitivity by an order of magnitude compared to existing capabilities, and it
is expected have lower capital and operating costs as well. The proposed
technique relies on measurements of phase shifts of an amplitude modulated laser
beam that occur when the laser is tune through a molecular resonance. Unlike
current technologies, the measured quantity is insensitive to variations in the
amplitude of the frequency components within the modulated laser beam. This
fundamental difference promises to eliminate the need for calibrations that are
currently required. Phase II will develop the fundamental understanding and lay
the groundwork for commercialization. A prototype instrument will be fabricated
by utilizing the 'backbone' of an existing commercially successful laser based
trace-gas detector. The detection limit, stability, and cost of the prototype
instrument will be characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial
applications are expected in monitoring gases in aluminum production and in
other industries as environmental regulation and work place safety may require.
