An investigation of why some of the bottom water originated in the Southern
Ocean is not renewed in the world ocean will be conducted using historical data.
This layer of unrenewed water sits between the heavier Atlantic Bottom Water and
the lighter Antarctic Bottom Water. The respective role of thermobaric and
cabelling instabilities in determining the depth and density to which the
catastrophic overturning reaches will be examined.
