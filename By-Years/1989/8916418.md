The heat shock or cellular stress response is a highly conserved cellular
response to a variety of potentially lethal physical, chemical, and biological
agents. The broad longterm objectives of this research program are to determine
the functions of members of stress protein families that have roles in the
normal cellular physiology of vertebrates. The project focuses on the 73
kilodalton mammalian heat shock cognate protein, hsc73, that can disassemble
clathrin cages in vitro and that promotes tranlocation of several proteins
across endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes. Models for the
mechnism by which hsp70 family members may repair damaged structures such as
nucleoli, solubilize aggregates of denatured proteins, or promote translocation
of other mproteins across membranes frequently invoke conformational changes.
However, no direct evidence of protein conformational changes has been obtained,
nor has the protein binding site(s) on any hsp70 family member been
characterized, nor are the features of the interactive proteins involved in
bninding to hsp70 family members known. The experiments proposed will directly
address the first two gaps in our understanding of this protein family and will
forge the way to filling the third gap. Two novel reagents that have not been
applied previously to studies of this protein family are featured in this
application, a small well-characterized protein apocytochrome c that binds
hsc73, and a vector construct capable of expressing functional rat hsc73 in E.
coli. Biophysical studies of the hsp70 proteins are almost nonexistent, and so
another goal is to obtain additional spectra using circular dichroism as part of
a search for evidence of conformational changes and provide basic physical data
on hsc73 such as exteinction coefficient and per cent helical content. Inducible
eucaryotic expression vectors have been constructed to produce hsc73 antisense
transcripts and to overproduce hsc73. Mammalian trnsformants have been developed
and studies are planned to identify and anlyze phenotypes associated with
cellular deficiencies in and overproduction of hsc73. This is a
multidisciplinary approach to the question of the function of heat shock
response proteins. The heat shock response, or stress response, is a ubiquitous
response of eukaryotic cells to a broad variety of stresses. Although there has
been a great deal of knowledge developed in terms of cataloguing the proteins
which are either induced or up-regulated in response to stress, the functions of
these proteins remain unknown.
