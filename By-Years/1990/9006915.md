This project will provide support to the University of Maryland, Center for
Environmental and Estuarine Studies (UM-CEES) for renovation of docking and
shore-based ship support facilities at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in
Solomons, MD in preparation for the transfer of operations of the research
vessel RIDGELY WARFIELD from the Johns Hopkins University, Chesapeake Bay
Institute to UM-CEES. The Johns Hopkins University has announced the closing of
its Chesapeake Bay Institute in December 1991. The R/V RIDGELY WARFIELD, a 106
foot shallow draft catamaran, has been operated by the Chesapeake Bay Institute
since it was built with National Science Foundation funds in 1967. The
relocation of the R/V RIDGELY WARFIELD at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory,
Solomons Island, MD will provide a new, mid-Bay, central site on the western
shore from which to launch scientific investigations. CEES, the environmental
sciences research arm of the University of Maryland System, is a multi-
laboratory institution with internationally recognized expertise in oceanography
and estuarine ecology. CEES and other institutions of the University of Maryland
System have been major users of the RIDGELY WARFIELD. The director of the
project is Dr. Douglas G. Capone, Professor, Chesapeake Biological Laboratory.
Oversight of ship operations will be the cooperative responsibility of a newly
formed Chesapeake Region Oceanographic Consortium composed of the University of
Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies, the Academy of Natural
Sciences Benedict Estuarine Research Laboratory, Hampton University, Old
Dominion University, The Smithsonian Institution, The University of Maryland
Eastern Shore, The University of Maryland System, and the Virginia Institute of
Marine Science.
