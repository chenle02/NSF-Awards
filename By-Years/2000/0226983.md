This research characterizes siting conflicts in Japan and evaluates how Japanese
siting approaches have addressed procedural equity. The research examines the
view of fairness expressed by different parties involved in siting two
underground rock laboratories (URLs), one at Mizunami and the other at Horonobe.
These facilities are designed to study the technical feasibility of geologic
disposal of high-level nuclear waste. Although neither of the URLs is intended
to store any radiological materials, local residents have expressed strong
opposition. By closely examining the siting processes of the two URLs through
intensive analysis of public documents and in-depth interviews, the research
will illuminate the role and significance of procedural equity. What are the key
elements necessary to achieve procedural equity? What are the public's major
concerns about the proposed facilities and the siting processes, and how have
implementers and regulators evaluated and responded to these concerns? Are
concerns different between host and neighboring communities? How do the key
actors perceive the current institutional arrangements (e.g., compensation
packages) that are designed to address procedural equity? How does the Japanese
process and experience differ from that outside Japan?

These case studies will offer new theoretical insights about the role and
significance of procedural equity. The research will contribute to scholarship
on risk communication and public participation by refining our und3erstanding of
the role of equity in environmental and risk decision-making processes.
