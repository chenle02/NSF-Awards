This research considers the analysis and control of a class of nonlinear systems
with bounded and switching control functions. Such systems have application to a
number of areas such as power systems, spacecraft dynamics and switched
electrical networks. Problems to be studied include controllability,
attainability and optimal control problems where the control appears linearly in
the cost for bounded control functions and minimum switch control problems for
bang-bang control systems. A systematic investigation of these problems for
linear-analytic two dimensional systems and bilinear systems in higher
dimensions will be investigated.
