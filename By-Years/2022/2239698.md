This project will develop novel connections between modern mathematics and
quantum field theory. Quantum field theories are an effective tool in modern
physics. The project will develop the mathematics needed to rigorously describe
and analyze such theories by leveraging recent innovations in abstract algebra
and geometry to explicitly describe quantum field theories in mathematical
terms. In addition to scientific advances, the project will both develop text-
based resources for mathematicians that will advance researchers' abilities to
access and deploy cutting edge methods in algebra and geometry and provide
support to community-based education programs in the Los Angeles area.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the PI will use homotopical approaches in
representation theory to provide rigorous mathematical realizations of
topological quantum field theories whose associated moduli of vacua are non-
compact. Topological field theories of this type arise naturally as twists of
supersymmetric quantum field theories. In producing the aforementioned
realizations, the PI will develop new relationships between representations of
quantum groups and the geometry of Springer
resolutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
