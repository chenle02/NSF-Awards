The aim of the proposed work is to study the behavior of low regularity
solutions to nonlinear wave equations. This problem is by now well understood
for generic equations. However, most nonlinear wave equations arising in physics
(e.g., Einstein's equations in general relativity) exhibit some kind of special
structure which, one expects, guarantees a much better behavior of solutions
than for a generic equation. It is precisely this type of equations that the
proposed research will focus on. This subject is largely unexplored, and, until
now, was considered &lt;br/&gt;to be out of reach. However, recent work of the
PI may hold the key to progress in this field.
