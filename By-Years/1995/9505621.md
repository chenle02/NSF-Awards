9505621 Lichtenberg The research concerns the theoretical and numerical study of
diffusion in systems with many degrees of freedom. The systems to be studied are
weakly coupled mappings with the uncoupled mappings being periodic in the action
space, and coupled oscillator chains. Local diffusion, averaged over action
space can be used to calculate the global diffusion properties of the coupled
system. The diffusion along stochastic resonance layers is known as Arnold
diffusion. This diffusion can be calculated within a three-resonance model, when
the system parameters can be appropriately controlled. Fundamental questions
such as the relationship to upper bounds on the diffusion, and to energy
equipartition will be addressed. The effect of the number of degrees of freedom
and the strength of the coupling parameter will be studied. Comparisons of
analytic approximations to the numerical results should allow an analytic
formalism to be developed that can be extended beyond the range of numerical
analysis. ***
