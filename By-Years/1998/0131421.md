The ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila excises an estimated 6000
specific DNA segments from its somatic nucleus during development. This project
aims to understand the regulation of this massive genome reorganization and
ultimately learn fundamental principles governing chromosome structure and
genetic stability. Understanding how particular DNA segments, called deletion
elements, are selectively excised is challenged by the fact that they are quite
diverse in size and sequence. The PI's approach toward understanding how the
cell recognizes these diverse sequences has been to understand in detail the
mechanism of deletion of two DNA segments, called the M and R deletion elements,
and thus identify common regulatory properties. In this work, these elements
will be mutagenized in order to identify the specific sequences that target
these DNA segments for elimination. Mutant deletion elements will be integrated
into the genome such that their excision can be monitored during the process.
This will allow the determination of mutations in the identified cis-acting
sequences that abolish the association between the element and proteins involved
in excision. A major goal of these mutational analyses is to delimit the
sequences that activate the non-genic transcription of deletion elements and
determine whether transcription is required for DNA deletion. To further explore
the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation of these DNA rearrangements, the
minimal requirements for this regulation will be defined. Several prior genetic
studies support a model that RNA copies of the element produced from parental
nuclei act as inhibitory signals that block DNA deletion of the homologous
element. This and other possible explanations will be tested. Combining studies
that address both genetic and epigenetic regulatory components will expedite a
comprehensive understanding of this process.

This project investigates a process of regulated DNA rearrangement that occurs
during development of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. The
cellular machinery that accurately rearranges the Tetrahymena genome likely
involves many of the components that ensure the proper genetic stability of this
organism. This research aims to understand how particular DNA segments are
targeted for elimination. Its long-term goal is to learn how removal of these
DNA segments affects the normal genetic stability of the somatic genome.
Investigation of this process in Tetrahymena should provide fundamental insight
into genetic mechanisms that operate in all organisms.
