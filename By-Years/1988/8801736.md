This project is mathematical research on algebras of operators on Hilbert
space. Interest in such algebras grew out of their role in certain formulations
of quantum mechanics, operators in the given algebra corresponding more or less
to observable quantities in the system being represented. Unlike those
customarily encountered in physical models, the algebras in the present study
are nonselfadjoint, and so fall into a less well-developed area of the theory.
More specifically, the behavior of certain nonselfadjoint operator algebras
under tensor products will be investigated in connection with an approximation
property for such algebras. Questions concerning hyperreflexivity of operator
algebras will be explored. A newly discovered correspondence between finite-
dimensional commutative subspace lattice algebras and finite simplicial
complexes that takes Hochschild cohomology to simplicial cohomology will be
further developed.
