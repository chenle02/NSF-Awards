This US-Croatian workshop on biocomplexity and sustainable ecosystem management
will take place in Dubrovnik, Croatia, during October 1-6, 2002. The U.S.
organizers are Carl Hershner and Anamarija Frankic from the College of William
and Mary Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Their Croatian counterparts are
Vera Zutic of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, and Adam Benovic of the
Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Dubrovnik. The workshop goal is to
define an interdisciplinary approach to research on and management of
biologically complex ecosystems in the Adriatic Sea, where natural and human
systems are interdependent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dubrovnik meeting will
bring together U.S. and Croatian researchers who have direct knowledge of the
Adriatic and the Chesapeake Bay and possess complementary expertise in coastal
and marine ecosystems research or social and economic sciences. Workshop
discussions will feature: 1) the functioning of large scale coastal ecosystems,
2) sustainable human interaction, 3) biodiversity changes, and 4) socio-economic
implications of management options. Results are expected to lead to a refined
theoretical framework for innovative collaborative projects that integrate field
studies and employ suitable biological, hydrologic, and socio-economic models
for the purpose of understanding and managing similarly complex marine systems
around the globe. &lt;br/&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;This biocomplexity workshop project
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
experts in the United States and South Central Europe to combine complementary
talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
