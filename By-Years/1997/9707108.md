9707108 Trotter This is an RPG project which will give the PI an opportunity to
develop a research project on diacylglycerol transport using a genetic approach
in yeast. DAG is an essential intermediate in lipid metabolism and is involved
in cell signaling. DAG moves between various membranes in the cell, but the
mechanisms that mediate the movement are not known. A mutant screen will be
developed using a fluorescent DAG derivative to find mutants in the transport
process. Eventually, the genes involved can be identified and studied. %%% This
is a Research Planning Grant project that will explore the development of
methods for identifying yeast mutants that are defective in lipid transport
between membranes. These compounds are important for membrane function and cell
signaling. This work may provide new information about how synthesis is
coordinated and regulated. ***
