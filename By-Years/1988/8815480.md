This conference brings together people in various areas of "molecular
engineering" who have well established reputations as leaders in their field.
"Molecular engineering" has been harmed by over-inflated claims for "biochips";
this conference will help lay a secure scientific and engineering foundation for
a promising field. Funding is recommended.
