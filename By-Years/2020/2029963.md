This project examines the impacts of COVID-19 and states’ and local governments’
social distancing directives on behavior, time spent with others, use of
technology, and mental and physical wellbeing. The objective of the project is
to investigate these daily life impacts in real time and to analyze how these
impacts are affected by sociodemographic characteristics that affect time use
and well-being. Data are leveraged from several hundred respondents’ daily time
use before the pandemic along with data collected during and after the pandemic
to create a natural experiment that isolates the effects of the pandemic on
changes in behavior. Among the products of this research are evidence-based
recommendations to address the social consequences of the
pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project collects data for the second and
third waves of a three-wave panel study, the second wave during the pandemic
with shelter-at-home and lockdown orders in place and the third wave after the
pandemic has subsided and orders have been relaxed. Data for these two waves
consist of survey responses and 24-hour time diaries collected from 2,000
respondents from online crowdsourcing platforms. This sample includes a smaller
sample from whom data were collected before the pandemic. Data are collected on
sociodemographics, typical sleep, work, and exercise patterns, and arrangements
for housework and carework to investigate effects on time use and
wellbeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
