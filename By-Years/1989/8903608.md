This project is concerned with classifying the quasi-thin finite simple groups
by means of the amalgam method. The principal investigator will analyze the weak
(B,N)-pairs of rank three corresponding to a reducible rank 2 parabolic. In
addition, he will determine the "small" amalgams. The classification of finite
simple groups has been a major concern for the past several decades with
implications for many areas of algebra. This research is concerned with
streamlining and revising portions of this classification, resulting in a
clearer understanding of the area. Simultaneously, it will provide new insights
into the geometry of these groups.
