It is proposed to measure absolute doubly differential cross sections for
secondary electrons ejected from atomic hydrogen by electron impact (threshold 2
KeV). A modulated crossed-beammethod will be used, and the atomic hydrogen beam
will be provided by a microwave discharge technique. The energy and angular
range of the measured secondary electrons will be from 1.0 eV to near the
incident energy and from 6 to 160 degrees, respectively. A particular emphasis
will be on the measurements in the low energy range for both incident and
secondary electrons. This research program will enable a crucial test of the
collision theory and three body continuum problem because the wave functions of
atomic hydrogen are known.
