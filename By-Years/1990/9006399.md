This award will support Professor William G. Moulton of Florida State University
in a research collaboration with Professors Nevill Clark and Alejandro Saenz of
the University of Costa Rica. The goal of their research is to study flux
pinning and vortex dynamics in high Tc superconductors. A Hall microprobe will
be used to observe fluxoid motion driven by both force and thermal gradients.
Studies will be made on thin films, produced at Florida State, of pinning forces
and vortex behavior as a function of magnetic field and tempera- ture. The
effect of the flux lattice and flux melting phases and the microstructure of the
films on the flux lattice and pinning also will be studied. It is hoped that
further evidence of 2 to 3D transitions can be observed. By providing expert
personnel and facilities in a project of mutual interest that contributes to the
scientific development of Costa Rica, this project fulfills the objectives of
the Science in Developing Countries Program.
