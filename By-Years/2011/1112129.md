With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Melikyan of
the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University-
Northridge to study the behavior of organic free radicals and cations being
supported on a metal-organic species. Specifically, the PI will continue his
work on propargyl systems in which the triple bond is "capped" by a cobalt
hexacarbonyl group, to study how these "protected" propargylic systems can be
manipulated for new bond constructions at the formal radical or cationic center.
Among the major research objectives are the development of sequential
alpha,alpha'-functionalization of polyunsaturated systems and the exploration of
intramolecular radical cyclizations yielding topologically diverse carbo- and
heterocyclic compounds.

The Broader Impacts involve training a cadre of undergraduate co-workers in
modern organometallic synthesis methods, and broadening participation through
the inclusion of members of groups historically underrepresented in the
sciences. Plans are included to integrate the research results and methodology
into the chemistry curriculum, and to widely disseminate research results via
publication in main line sub-disciplinary journals.
