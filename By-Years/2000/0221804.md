The Biocomplexity in the Environment (BE): Coupled Biogeochemical Cycles (CBC)
project will investigate the complex relationships between large-scale climatic
forcing factors, local climatic changes across the region, salmon population
dynamics both before and after European cultural impacts, and vegetation and
lake-ecosystem responses to these changes. Dr. Abbott, and colleagues, Bradley
and Francis (both from U Mass, Amherst), and Finney (U Alaska), will analyze
high-resolution sediment records from the region to provide detailed records
over large temporal and spatial scales. The two thrusts of the research are to
produce multi-proxy records of moisture and temperature variations during the
last 12,000 years from lakes in the Pacific Northwest and reconstruct salmon
abundance at one of these sites. The project will produce a sub-decadal to
century-scale climate history of the Pacific Northwest, and advance
understanding of its biogeochemical cycles. The project will focus on the
response of salmon populations and lake-ecosystems to climate change. The
broader impact of this research would be in the area of salmon management and
restoration in the Pacific Northwest.
