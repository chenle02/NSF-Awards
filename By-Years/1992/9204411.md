This three-year award supports U.S.-Ireland cooperative research in theoretical
physics between Robert F. O'Connell of Louisiana State University and J.T. Lewis
of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies. The investigators will study
stochastic processes in quantum systems with special emphasis on systems in
quantum optics and lasers, atomic and condensed matter physics which involve the
presence of a heat bath as an integral element. They will address the spin-boson
problem where a two-level system interacts with a radiation field, and problems
on blackbody radiation heat-bath and dissipative quantum tunneling. The
investigators will apply their results and methodology to study the effects of
quantum dissipation in systems that exhibit the phenomenon of chaos. The U.S.
group are experts in the theoretical aspects of quantum stochastic processes.
The Irish investigators bring complementary expertise in the theoretical and
experimental aspects of chaos in semiconductor lasers. Research in quantum
stochastic processes have wide implications for a variety of systems in physics.
This research will advance our understanding of quantum electrodynamics,
condensed-matter physics, laser physics and atomic physics.
