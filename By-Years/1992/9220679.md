The focus of this research will be on intramolecular 3+2 and 4+3 cycloaddition
recations of allyl cations with dienes. Alkoxyallylic alcohols, cyclopropane
hemiacetals and allylic sulfoxides will be used as progenitors of allylic
cations. A detailed study of regioselectivity and relative stereochemistry will
be made in the context of the synthesis of fused 6,7 and 6,5 bicyclic ring
systems. %%% With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Professor Michael Harmata of the Department of
Chem,istry at the University of Missouri, Columbia. Dr. Harmata will focus his
work on developing a class of reactions known as cycloadditions for the purpose
of constructing compounds containing 5,6 and 7-membered rings, structures often
occuring in important natural products.
