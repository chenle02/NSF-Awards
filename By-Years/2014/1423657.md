This project will investigate interfering cellular networks, which are networks
formed by operating multiple cells of a traditional cellular network over the
same frequency. In particular, it will develop efficient communication schemes
for such networks that (a) deal with interfering data flows between multiple
source-destination pairs (b) include cooperative strategies between nodes to
exploit resources such as a wired back bone of constrained capacity and
connectivity between access points and (c) robustly cope with channel
uncertainty. Throughout, approximated capacity characterizations or those that
are amenable to computation will be sought, with an emphasis on methods that
scale well to a larger number of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to
develop improved alternatives to communication methods employed in current
cellular networks. The importance of such improved methods in the design of
future generations of these networks is evident from the e-commerce that such
networks enable, the information they make easily accessible and the increased
efficiency of organizations they make possible today.
