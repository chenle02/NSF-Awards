Flow reactors are used for both fundamental kinetic studies and industrial
chemical manufacturing. Dynamic modelling for process control and kinetic
studies of flow reactors have involved lumped models consisting of coupled
nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In formulating these models, it is
assumed that the transport processes occur at time scales much shorter than
those of the chemical kinetics. Experimentally it has been assumed that, with
the stirring rate sufficiently high, the dynamical behavior depends only on the
chemical kinetics. In fact, bistabilities and time-dependent behavior can be
strongly influenced by the premixing configuration and the stirring rate, even
when the latter is relatively fast compared to the residence time. The PI's
research is in the area of studying the effect of mixing on the dynamical
behavior of flow reactors. Specifically, detailed experimental and analytical
investigation is planned of the mixing effects in chemical oscillators with the
dual goals of understanding the interplay between transport and chemical
reactions and of developing accurate mixing models for systems involving
multiple reaction steps. Another area to be looked at will be the mathematical
simulation of turbulent reactive flows in flow reactors. The PI plans to use the
probability density function method using Fokker-Planck closure based on
diffusion in the lamellar structures generated by the chaotic flow field. He
plans to look at the effects of reaction terms for nonpremixed feed flows.
