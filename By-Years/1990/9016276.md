The principal investigator (PI) will study the development of adaptive error
control algorithms for bandwidth-limited nonstationary communication channels.
These algorithms will be based on trellis coded modulation systems that have
been modified to make use of a feedback channel. The feedback channel allows for
the flow of channel state information from the receiver to the transmitter. The
transmitter uses this information to reconfigure data structures in accordance
with variations in channel noise and attenuation. Three basic questions will be
considered in the development of the adaptive algorithms. First, how can the
receiver derive channel state information from received data blocks? Secondly,
how can the receiver use the feedback channel to report this information to the
transmitter? Finally, how is the transmitter to respond to this information?
Adaptive schemes will be developed, analyzed and simulated for a variety of
channels.
