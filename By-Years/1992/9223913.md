This project will build and fly on balloons instruments for measuring the size
and other characteristics of particles found in the arctic stratosphere. These
condensation nuclei (CN) and polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles play an
important role in the destruction of ozone by catalytic action of chlorine. The
balloon measurements will be made at the same time as nitric acid (HNO3) vapor
measurements will be made by another team from Max Planck Institute, Heidelberg,
Germany. Nitric acid is one of the main constituents of the PSC particles. This
work is important to increasing understanding of the processes which cause the
annual springtime decreases of ozone in both polar regions, and also to help
understand the differences between the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere.
