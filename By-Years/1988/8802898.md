This proposal will provide a soft cover book to disseminate the knowledge and
experience gained form the 15 engineering design proposals that have been
recommended for funding in the BRAH program. In the future, hundreds of
undergraduate engineers will be working on projects that will greatly enhance
their own engineering education and provide a great service to the disabled
population. Engineering faculty and students will donate their time and talents
to provide prototype devices to aid the disabled, and, thus, improve their
quality of life and education. This proposal will supply a book documenting
these experiences and results so that they may be shared and utilized by others.
