The College of Oceanography at Oregon State University has requested several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V WECOMA, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabi- lities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -an upgrade for an
autoanalyzer that measures a variety of chemical constituents in seawater, -a
back-up command unit for an acoustic doppler current profiler, -replacement
sampling bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at depth, -a CTD for
profiling Conductivity and Temperature as a function of Depth, -an elemental
analyzer for routine shipboard use, -an upgrade for a multi-user sediment trap,
and -an ultra-cold freezer for storing samples awaiting analysis. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the University
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
