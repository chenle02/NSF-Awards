This research studies the problem of digital content distribution in conjunction
with the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights and laws from a
cryptographic viewpoint. Understanding, modeling and constructing the necessary
framework and tools for digital content distribution and rights enforcement are
fundamental for the development of future Digital Rights Management (DRM)
systems. Cryptography is a technology that, if applied correctly, has a
recognized potential in minimizing trust assumptions, alleviating production and
distribution costs, facilitating legal frameworks as well as mitigating threats
in the context of DRM systems. The methodological viewpoint of the present
research is to harvest the techniques of modern cryptography for the
specification and solution of various facets of the DRM problem and advance the
understanding of what cryptography can offer to future DRM technologies. The
present investigation provides a framework for modeling digital content
distribution systems together with the arrays of adversarial behaviors against
them and delves into the development of novel cryptographic constructions finely
tuned to DRM environments. Various cryptographic tools for DRM systems are
investigated, their interoperability and composition within a digital content
distribution system are studied and their threat mitigation capabilities as well
as interactions with legal frameworks are examined.&lt;br/&gt;
