It is proposed to synthesize a series of transition metal complexes that
exhibit thermochromic behavior. The types of complexes to be synthesized will
include those of the tetrcimetaillate salts, Schiff-base type ligands as well as
neutral amine ligands. In all instances, the conditions will be varied to
achieve optimum thermochromic behavior. The metals used in the study will
include first row transition metals as well as members of the third and fourth
transition series. UV-Vis and infrared spectroscopic measurements will be
studied at varied temperatures and pressures. X-ray crystallography (with
variable temperature capabilities) will be used to determine molecular
structures and therefore any structural changes that result from thermochromic
processes. Variable temperature NMR will provide a method to monitor structural
as well as magnetic changes of thermochromic solutions. The effect of
"environmental" conditions (temperature,moisture,natural acids, and UV light) on
both free and encapsulated thermochromic compounds will be examined.
