The objective of this work is to develop a comprehensive physical understanding
of how lymph moves in anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) and investigate the
anatomical and physiological control systems which lead to variations in the
movement of lymph. Lymph is the fluid that filters from the capillaries of the
circulatory system into the interstitial space as a consequence of the
hydrostatic pressure generated by the heart. The principal role of the lymphatic
system is to return this fluid back into the circulation. If this functional
role of the lymphatic system is prevented, fluid is lost from the circulation
much like a hemorrhage, and cardiovascular function declines eventually leading
to circulatory shock. Anuran amphibians form lymph, at about ten times the rate
of mammals. Hence the return of lymph to the circulatory system is an even more
critical variable to their maintenance of blood volume. Amphibians, in relation
to all vertebrate classes, have the most rapid compensatory ability to replace
lost blood volume with lymph and this lymph mobilization capacity varies with a
species' degree of terrestriality. Understanding how lymph moves is fundamental
not only to our understanding of how amphibians function at an organ system
level, but also aids our understanding of what adaptations are involved in the
colonization of terrestrial environments. Consequently, amphibians represent an
excellent evolutionary model system for studying comparative mechanisms involved
in how lymph mobilization regulates blood volume. Current models of lymph
movement are untenable from a physical perspective. The working hypothesis is
that lymph moves in response to pressure differences created by two mechanisms,
compartmentalization of lymph sacs creating sacs of different compliance and
skeletal muscle contractions varying lymph sac compliance. Compliance is the
relationship between lymph volume and pressure in a lymph sac. The primary
function of many of these skeletal muscles may be solely tied to lymph movement
and may represent the first vertebrate example of skeletal muscle fluid pumps.
The pathways for lymph movement will be delineated using dye-labeled plasma, the
pressures in these pathways will be monitored via implanted cannulae and
skeletal muscle contraction monitored via EMGs recorded from implanted
electrodes . How blood volume status influences the lymph sac pressures and
skeletal muscle activities will also be investigated. Comparative anatomical
data will then be collected to test what species' anatomical differences
correlate with differences in lymph flow.
