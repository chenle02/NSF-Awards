The research funded by this award will investigate the consequences of recent
global shifts in urbanizing processes. Population mobility, new communications
technologies, and volatile property markets underpin changes in cities the world
over. This research will look at how these forces come together, how they affect
urban life, and how they create new kinds of infrastructures and claims to urban
spaces. The overarching research goal is to better understand both causal and
experiential dimensions of mobility and urban migration, and to relate these to
global dynamics of urbanization and infrastructure development.

The research will be conducted by anthropologist Dr. Daniel Fisher of the
University of California, Berkeley. Because the transformations to be studied
are so broad and interconnected as to be unwieldy from a research perspective,
the researcher has chosen to focus his investigations on multiple facets in a
single site: Aboriginal urbanization in Darwin, capital of Australia's Northern
Territory. He will collect data using an innovative mix of anthropological
methods, including: intensive, long-term participant observation to understand
the wide variety of lived spaces, experiences, and communities; archival
research to track historical developments through administrative records, oral
histories, cadastral maps, and photographic materials; collaborative media
production to gain insight into everyday aspects of life through the media that
are also constitutive of that life; and social and cadastral surveys. Findings
from this project will contribute to the comparative study of contemporary
urbanization broadly and more specifically to understanding its intercultural
and infrastructural properties and their effects on marginalized populations.
Funding this project also supports research opportunities for American
undergraduate and graduate students. The researcher will produce online and
museological exhibitions as well as scholarly publications of his results.
