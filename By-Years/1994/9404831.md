This project uses discrete mathematics to study database queries concerning
searches of nucleic acid sequences that satisfy certain structural properties.
The specific aims are to provide a better understanding of the database and
genetic issues pertaining to search problems and to create tools for solving the
relevant database management problems. The proposed work will address issues of
physical design and efficiency and the interplay of various conditions on the
database and genetic structures involved. Finally, the project will develop an
interface that will allow complex structurally based queries to be framed in a
graphical manner. This proposal is being jointly supported by the Database and
Expert Systems Program and the Database Activities in the Biological Sciences.
