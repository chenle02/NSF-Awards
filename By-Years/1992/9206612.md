This project is designed to explore and quantitate the complex fluid dynamic
forces governing global pulmonary transport and local cellular mechanical
strain. From experimental work we have learned that the geometric design of the
lung induces specific flow effects such as asymmetric flow distribution, chaotic
mixing and variable pressure zones. Until recently the scientific community has
considered the pulmonary airways and vascular passive conduits to a relatively
simple gas exchange sheet. In the cells comprising these branching networks
however, evidence now points to an active participation in local flow regulation
as well as mechanical signal transcription (cellular release of secondary
messengers, altered ion fluxes, cytoskeletal changes and transcription bursts).
The applied forces and cellular strains are unknown and imposed within
bifurcations we have initiated a large scale transfer of aeronautic
computational fluid dynamic and supercomputer techniques to the biological
sciences. In conjunction with the NSF sponsored ERC for Computational Field
Simulation this project will initiate an exploration of the fluid dynamic forces
within small airways. This region has been chosen for initial exploration
because pre- existing data is available to cross check early model development.
