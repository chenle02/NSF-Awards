This project renews support for research on regulation, procurement contracting,
and political economy. The common theme among these three subjects is the
interactions between public agencies and institutions and private sector
organizations. The normative objective of the proposed research is to
characterize the efficiency of regulatory and public policies in settings
characterized by incomplete information, limited observability, and imperfect
verifiability. The positive objective is to explain the choice of regulatory
policies, government procurement programs, public expenditure programs, and
other public policies. A satisfactory explanation must bring together political
preferences, features of the public institutions that govern the choice and
design of policies and programs, and the interests of the private parties
affected by such policies. The specific substantive issues addressed are: 1) the
economics of regulation with an emphasis on multiparty models and on multiperiod
regulatory policies that are subject to evasion by political institutions, 2)
government procurement programs that are subject to year-by-year appropriations
and annual policy review, and 3) the political economy of government regulatory
and expenditure programs. The approach to be taken in this study is based on
game theory, microeconomics, and positive political science. Although most
economic behavior is shaped by public policies and institutions, these policies
and institutions are typically modeled as exogenous, resulting in predictions
that are either incomplete or are inconsistent with the subsequent policies
adopted by public institutions. A major contribution of this project is to
incorporate political behavior into economic analysis by treating both as
endogenous.
