The objective of this research is to improve the performance of existing nuclear
magnetic imaging and spectroscopy methods of applying the concepts of feedback
control. These methods are based on observing the fluctuations in nuclear
magnetization produced by sequences of RF pulses and, in the case of imaging,
applied magnetic field gradients. Conventional imaging and spectroscopy
techniques are open-loop processes in that measurements of the magnetization
state are used to optimize the pulse parameters between successive RF pulses.
This project focuses specifically on contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance
imaging. A feedback strategy that automatically adjusts pulse parameters to
enhance the contrast between specified chemical species is developed. The
control design is verified experimentally on a commercial imager using a sample
of water and oil. An adaptive control algorithm tunes the pulse parameters so
that the difference between the water and oil magnetization signals is
maximized. The significance of this research is twofold. First, it introduces
the imaging and spectroscopy communities to the advantages afforded by using
feedback. Second, it provides a foundation on which to consider further
applications of feedback concepts to nuclear magnetic imaging and spectroscopy.
