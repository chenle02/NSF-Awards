The principal investigators will study the high-pressure chemistry of materials
that comprise the Earth's mantle and core. Studies of phase equilibria,
thermodynamic properties, and structure will be carried out at high pressure and
temperature using the diamond anvil cell and a variety of spectroscopic
techniques. The work is crucial to an understanding of the Earth's deep
interior.
