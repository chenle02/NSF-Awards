Five research projects in dynamical systems theory are undertaken. The first
three are focused on advances within the subject.The goal of Project 1 is to
extend nonuniform hyperbolic theory (or the mathematical theory of chaos), from
finite to infinite dimensions, enlarging its range of applicability to include
certain classes of evolutionary partial differential equations. Project 2 is
about chaotic behavior in randomly perturbed dynamical systems, and Project 3
seeks to extend certain theories of autonomous dynamical systems to time-
dependent systems with slowly drifting coefficients. The last two projects
export dynamical systems ideas to two disciplines outside of mathematics:
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and theoretical neuroscience. Project 4
addresses issues related to the analog of local temperature in dynamical models
that are driven out of equilibrium. Project 5 pertains to neuronal networks,
seeking dynamical explanations for various phenomena observed by
experimentalists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator works with
systems that are large, random, or out of equilibrium, three characteristics
shared by many real-world systems. Scientifically, the proposed research will
(1) lead to significant advances in the theory of dynamical systems, (2) build
connections between dynamical systems and other branches of mathematics, such as
partial differential equations and probability, and (3) broaden the use
mathematics, the applicability of dynamical systems ideas in particular, in
engineering, theoretical physics and neuroscience. The cross-fertilization in
(2) and (3) will be beneficial to all the areas involved. On the educational
front, providing scientific training and guidance for young researchers is an
important part of the proposed activity. The Principal Investigator expects to
continue this activity using projects in the current proposal, and to continue
her public speaking and writing of expository articles as part of the process
for dissemination of ideas.
