The magnitude-7.8 March 3, 1985 earthquake in Chile and the magnitude-8.1 and
magnitude-7.5 September 19-20, 1985 earthquakes in Mexico significantly affected
engineered structures in and inhabitants of large densely populated urban areas.
National Science Foundation- sponsored investigations of these earthquakes have
yielded impressive results. This project will serve as a mechanism to transfer
this information to practicing seismic design professionals and other earthquake
hazard mitigation specialists in the United States. Applied Technology Council
and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute will organize a workshop for
NSF-researchers and U.S. practitioners and other specialists to: (1) summarize
and review the results of the NSF- sponsored investigations of these
earthquakes; (2) identify deficiencies in existing standards of practice
revealed by these research findings; (3) identify other lessons that have been
learned that would impact earthquake hazard mitigation policies and procedures;
(4) develop recommendations for improved standards of practice and other
earthquakes hazard mitigation activities, and (5) identify and rank research
needs.
