0223818&lt;br/&gt;Greenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award
supports US-India cooperative research in quantum statistics. US physicist Oscar
W. Greenberg, University of Maryland College Park and Indian collaborator Ashok
K. Mishra, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Tharamani will explore the
fundamental issues of mathematical physics that lie at the heart of quantum
mechanics. In recent years, physicists have begun to study and apply "new" forms
of statistics that are beyond the conventional fermi and bose statistics. The
collaborators will study the new statistics with particular regard to their
applicability to some basic postulates in physics that, due to technological
advances, can now be tested to high precision through experiment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This collaboration is likely to bring about
interesting advances in mathematical physics. It will also initiate a new
partnership between the University of Maryland and the Institute of Mathematical
Sciences, a premier center for research in theoretical physics. India has a
tradition of excellence in this field that includes S.N. Bose's contributions to
particle statistics (Bose-Einstein statistics). At best, this collaboration will
enable each scientist to bring a distinct cultural perspective to their research
on the statistics of elementary particles. This project is supported by the
Indian Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST)under the NSF/DST joint
program.
