Weitao Yang of Duke University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to develop and apply density functional methods for accurate
and cost-effective calculations of the electronic structure of large molecules.
Specifically, the next generation of functionals will be developed in terms of
Kohn-Sham orbitals via efficient computational techniques and systematic
construction. The optimized effective potential will be improved with respect to
accelerated convergence, linear scaling, and extension to periodic systems.
Accurate energy functionals and exchange-correlation potentials for given
densities will be used to guide the construction of new orbital functionals.
Applications include polymer polarizabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential
applications of these improved computational chemistry techniques are far-
reaching, and include a wide range of theoretical and modeling efforts in
chemistry, biology, and materials systems.
