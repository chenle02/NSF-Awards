9452100 Baird The rising demand for commercial wireless communication and remote
sensing products parallels the engineering advances which permit design of low-
cost (microstrip/MMIC), high-performance microwave circuits. An innovative
undergraduate microwave laboratory is developed to help meet the need for
students prepared in this area. The goal is to develop fundamental understanding
of microwave phenomena and basic engineering practice by (1) using meaningful
projects to excite students with knowledge that they can design, build, and test
low-cost microwave circuits, and (2) providing a learning environment which
permits students to simultaneously compare the results of theory, animated
visual simulations, and measurements.
