The PI proposes to carry out a wide range of scholarly and educational projects
related to his research interests in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics.
In his research, the PI makes substantial use of Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma to
tackle structural and enumerative problems. This Lemma is one of the most
powerful tools in modern combinatorics, it has applications not only in
combinatorics but in analysis and additive number theory as well. The original
form of the Lemma concerns dense graphs, but in many applications one would need
a sparse version of the Lemma. The PI plans to develop the theory of sparse
regularity, so that it might be applied to solve a wide range of problems.
Furthermore, the PI proposes to study phase transitions in bootstrap
percolation, which are related to models in statistical physics, such as the
Ising model. In addition to persuing his own research, the investigator proposes
a great variety of educational and outreach activities.

The understanding of complex discrete and combinatorial structures is crucial in
many areas of modern science and technology. The PI is convinced that the new
approaches and techniques resulting from his project will lead to further
developments, not only in Discrete Mathematics, but also in other fields such as
Information Theory, Computer Science and Statistical Physics. Since his area is
relatively accessible to a wider audience, the PI proposes numerous educational
outreach activities. He plans to organize several conferences, including one
whose participants will mainly be graduate students, to develop courses
providing a gentle introduction to a variety of powerful methods in modern
Combinatorics, including one for undergraduates, and mentoring students on their
own projects, leading to Masters and Ph.D degrees.
