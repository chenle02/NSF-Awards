9322045 Zielinski This award supports participation by a US research team from
the University of New Hampshire in an international collaborative effort to
collect and study an approximately 500 meter long ice core from the Penny Ice
Cap on Baffin Island, Canada. This project is collaborative with the Geological
Survey of Canada and Japan s National Institute of Polar Research. Field work
includes study of snow pits and shallow cores in addition to collection and
analysis of the main 500 meter long core. Laboratory work supported by this
award includes analysis of major ions (sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium,
calcium, chloride, nitrate, and sulfate), insoluble microparticles and
methanesulfonic acid. These data will be integrated with analytical data
collected in Canada and Japan and the complete set of analyses will be used to
construct a proxy record of climate and environmental conditions for Baffin
Island for the Holocene. These data from the Penny Ice Cap will complement
records from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP): specifically, these data
will provide information about climatic conditions at lower elevations that will
allow a useful comparison to interpretations from the GISP cores. ***
