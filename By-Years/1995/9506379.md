9506379 CHRISTENSEN This research is to develop and apply the Composite
Distribution Inversion technique to tomographic inversion of seismic data in
volcanologic and engineering tomography problems. The engineering application
involves tunnel detection between two lines of boreholes. The volcanologic test
will be to image magma chambers under the Redoubt volcano. Both problems provide
excellent three- dimensional anomaly detection objectives which should benefit
greatly from the reduced signal smearing of this technique. One of the products
of the research will be a publicly available three- dimensional tomography
program which properly handles topography and three-dimensional ray-tracing
problems typical of those in areas of rugged terrain. The improved tomographic
technique should prove useful in earthquake and volcano hazard estimation work.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
