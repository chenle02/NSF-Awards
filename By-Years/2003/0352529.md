This thirty-three month project will develop instructional materials for grade
6-12 students and will result in thirty-five additional online activities in the
areas of biology and Earth science building on the successful Virtual Courseware
Project, which resulted in a biology online lab with 20 activities. The
materials will be designed to support science teachers in their efforts to
implement inquiry-based learning activities in their classrooms. The products
will include web-based simulations and supporting materials covering many life
and Earth sciences topics and closely tied to the National Science Content
Standards. Each activity includes a step-by-step guide that provides an
overview, an open-ended simulation so students can design and carry out
experiments based on their own hypotheses, a performance-based assessment quiz,
electronic portfolios, student manuals and teacher guides.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teacher materials include online access to
quantitative results for their students by overall class average, by individual
student, by specific question and by learning objective. Teachers can access the
students' electronic portfolios and are provided portfolio assessment rubrics.
Teacher guides, content and context background and suggestions for implementing
for individual and group-based work are provided. Teachers from Los Angeles
schools are involved in the design of the instructional materials and in the
field testing. A commercial publisher will market the materials.
