The College of Oceanography at Oregon State University has requested several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V WECOMA, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -shipboard computer system
for the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, -a fluorometer for measuring
chlorophyll and other pigments in the water column, -a 150-kHz acoustic
transducer for the current profiling system, -a Rosette sampler system for
collecting discrete water samples at precise depths, and -several replacement
water sampling bottles. The instrumentation described above will increase the
capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering
projects.
