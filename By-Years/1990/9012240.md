This project will use the DSRV ALVIN to directly study the dynamics of turbulent
buoyant plumes emanating from active hydrothermal vents. The aim of the project
is to provide a sound basis for relating water-comumn measurements of the
effluent plumes to the thermal output of the underlying oceanic crust. The PI's
propose to mount an instrument package on ALVIN that will measure temperature,
conductivity (salinity), vertical and horizontal velocity, light attenuation
(particledensity), and concentrations of manganese, silica, and sulfide in real
time via in situ flow injection analysis. The instrument will also collect
discrete water samples for laboratory analyses. Data and water samples will be
collected in real time shile driving ALVIN through buoyant hydrothermal plumes
at several heights in the water column. Undiluted hydrothermal source fluids and
the surrounding water column will also be studied. Specific objectives incluse:
(1) characterization of vertical and lateral variation in physical properties,
velocities, chemical concentrations, and suspended particles within the buoyant
plume, (2) quantification of entrainment and dilution rates as function of plume
height, (3) determine turbulent variability in the buoyant plume and relate to
property variations, and (5) testing numerical plume models against field
measurements.
