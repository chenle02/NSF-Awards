This award will support Dr. Mihir Sen and an undergraduate or graduate student
of the University of Notre Dame (UND) in two planning visits to Drs. Francisco
Gonzalez and Ricardo Romero-Mendez of the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis
Potosi (UASLP, Mexico. The objective of the proposed visits is to plan research
and train students to advance current understanding of heat transport in
biological tissue. Ultimately, the collaborators aim to develop a mathematical
model and computer code with potential application to the analysis of a whole
range of phenomena that exhibit a thermal signature at tissue surfaces. These
applications, for example, are bound to be important in the diagnosis,
classification, and treatment of burn victims.

The proposed collaboration will join the strengths of the bio-engineering group
at UND in bio-heat transfer, with the expertise at the Mexican UASLP in thermal
therapies. Students from both institutions, graduate and undergraduate, will
participate in the proposed research. In addition, the collaborators will
incorporate the research into new and existing courses at the UND and at UASLP.
