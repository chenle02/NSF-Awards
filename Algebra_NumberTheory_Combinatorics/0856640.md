ABSTRACT

Institution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor Title: Combinatorics, Geometry,
and Algorithms

The Principal Investigator intends to work on a number of problems in
combinatorial enumeration and optimization, with algorithmic questions and
geometric approaches playing the central role. The project aims to develop
computationally efficient approaches to enumeration of integer points in higher-
dimensional polyhedra (such as polyhedra of non-negative matrices with
prescribed row and column sums), optimization of multivariate polynomials on the
unit sphere, computing simple approximations of complicated convex bodies (such
as polytopes associated with hard problems of combinatorial optimization), and
construction of symmetric polytopes with many faces. Related structural
questions concerning random integer points in polyhedra and concentration of
permanents of doubly stochastic matrices will be investigated.

In combinatorics and discrete optimization we are often interested in the
structure of very large, yet finite sets, where direct enumeration is
prohibitively expensive or impossible because of the size of the sets and
methods of classical analysis are not applicable because of the discrete
character of objects. The project aims to develop computationally efficient
asymptotic approaches to several hard problems which concern counting and
optimization in large discrete sets and describing the structure of a typical
object from such a set. Several of the considered problems are of interest to
statistics, physics, and engineering.
