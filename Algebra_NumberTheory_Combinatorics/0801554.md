The principal investigator's proposed research has three parts. The first
constructs representations using tools from topology and symplectic geometry,
especially the theory of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson, and extends those tools to
larger classes of varieties. The second tackles algebraic and combinatorial
projects that solve problems in the geometry of the associated varieties. This
subject is often called modern Schubert calculus; specific projects include
determining multiplication formulas inside the cohomology ring of flag varieties
and Grassmannians. The third focuses on computational and enumerative geometric
properties of varieties, such as Hessenberg varieties, that arise in areas of
representation theory including the Langlands program. The projects will
identify fundamental geometric properties of the varieties, like pure-
dimensionality, that are critical to advances in representation theory.

Geometric representation theory builds algebraic structures called
representations from geometric objects. This leads to deep insights connecting
different mathematical disciplines, including algebra, geometry, combinatorics,
and mathematical physics. Crucially, a geometric representation establishes a
table of correspondences between geometry and algebra. On one hand, the table
answers questions in representation theory via geometry; on the other, it
answers questions in geometry using algebra and combinatorics. The proposal
includes projects to foster student development at all levels and to provide
mentoring for women and other underrepresented minorities in mathematics.
