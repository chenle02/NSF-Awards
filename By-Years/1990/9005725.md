This collaborative research between Cornell University and Memphis State
University is to process data previously collected under NSF-supported PANDA
network deployment in the San Juan and Jujuy provinces of Argentina. Over 20,000
earthquakes in San Juan, and over 1000 earthquakes in Jujuy were recorded,
producing over 100 GBytes of digital seismic data. The objective of the project
is to study crustal and lithospheric structure and seismicity in two contrasting
areas of the eastern slopes of the Andean uplift where seismogenic crustal
shortening is occurring.
