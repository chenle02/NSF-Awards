Infectious diseases transmitted by tiny droplets of respiratory fluids affect
tens of millions of people worldwide. Better understanding of the mechanism of
transmission of infections can lead improvements in both treatment and
protection strategies. While the main focus of the project is on transmission of
tuberculosis, its broader societal impacts include potential applications to
other infectious diseases such as influenza and COVID-19. Educational impacts of
the project include training both graduate and undergraduate students in an
interdisciplinary environment with close interaction between applied
mathematicians and biomedical researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus
of the project is on the development of mathematical models describing transport
and deposition of droplets of respiratory fluids containing the disease agent
produced by cough or sneezing of an infected individual. Using a multiscale
framework, dynamics of an individual droplet and its interaction with the airway
wall is investigated and then incorporated into a global model based on Vlasov-
type equation for droplet transport in a geometry representing respiratory
airways. The effects of phase change such as evaporation and condensation on the
size distribution of the droplets and the nature of their interaction with the
wall are considered. A model of respiratory liquid accounts for the presence of
components such as proteins, surfactants, and salts. The key questions addressed
are the deposition location and size distributions of the droplets as functions
of the initial distribution, as well as environmental parameters such as
temperature and humidity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
