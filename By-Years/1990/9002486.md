This research is concerned with the algebraic K-groups of infinite fields. The
principal investigator is studying aspects of the geometric significance of some
filtration quotients of these K-groups. These quotients bring together various
fields of mathematical research including the homology of the general linear
group, the higher Chow groups of Bloch and certain scissors congruence groups of
polytopes. Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects arising from
the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations. This is one of the oldest
and currently one of the most active branches of mathematics. There are
widespread applications of algebraic geometry in mathematics, physics and
computer science.
