9319775 MOLLER The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of
research vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides support services
to those NSF sponsored researchers who require time at sea to complete their
investigations. All of these ships use oceanographic wire rope as part of this
research support. Arrangements have been made which allow bulk purchases of wire
rope resulting in considerable cost savings. Twelve reels of wire rope will be
purchased. The wire rope is stored until needed by the ship operators at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography on the west coast. Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine
Operations Coordinator, WHOI, will manage this project. ***
