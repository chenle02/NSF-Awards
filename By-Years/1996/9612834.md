The PIs will draw on newly available measurements to determine the limits of
model validity by comparing predictions with a representative set of direct,
large-scale maps of high-latitude convection. The database, furnished by the
SuperDARN system of HF radars, has demonstrated that these measurements resolve
the large-scale features of convection that the models predict. The PIs will
select a number of SuperDARN archival events as a testbed for model validation,
then generate the predictions of the models for the selected events and devise
evaluation schemes for gauging their success. The research will produce a
characterization of the predictive value of convection models, recommendations
for model improvement, and methods of combining models and direct measurements
to optimally map convection.
