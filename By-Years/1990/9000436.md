This Oceanographic Instrumentation acquisition project is provided under the NSF
Research for Undergraduate Institu- tions (RUI) guidelines. The Moss Landing
Marine Laboratory (MLML) of San Jose State University will acquire computer
hardware and software to form a small local area network with other existing
equipment. Students at MLML are discovering that multi-user, multi-tasking
computer systems are becoming more prevalent in marine science research and that
having access to this type of computer environment is important. The network
will also enhance department-wide computer use by distributing data bases, word
processing software, and data analysis software, including statistics,
oceanographic data reduction, mapping, contouring, and graphics. The
installation of this network will enhance all teaching and NSF-sponsored
research programs.
