9307547 Gould The focus of this research is mechanistic and structural studies
on a recently recognized class of oxygenase enzymes, hydroquinone epoxidases,
that catalyze the four-electron oxidation of a hydroquinone to an epoxyquinone.
This novel reaction-type is involved in the biosynthesis of numerous bacterial
and fungal metabolites, as well as in the action of vitamin K. The specific aims
propose: (1) to harvest larger quantities of the proteins through a sequence
involving microsequencing, cloning, and overexpression; (2) to identify the
native metal(s); (3) to determine the location of exogenous oxygen by the use of
oxygen-18; (4) to probe the latitude of the enzyme active sites in substance
acceptance; and (5) to examine the use of modified substrates with the capacity
to covalently modify the active sites. %%% With this award, the Synthtic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Steven J. Gould of the Department of
Chemistry at Oregon State University. Professor Gould will focus his work on the
study of a recently recognized class of enzymes, hydroquinone epoxidases.The
project uses a multi-faceted approach that blends synthesis, biosynthesis,
enzymology, and molecular genetics in order to better understand which reactions
are available in Nature and how they are linked to produce complex structures.
