Mathematical Sciences (21) In this special project the Center for Mathematics
and Quantitative Education at Dartmouth (MQED) is facilitating the dissemination
and adaptation of materials and resources that support efforts to improve
quantitative literacy. Working with the National Numeracy Network (NNN) - an
effort funded by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation - MQED is tracking and evaluating
the usage of online modules that are being developed by faculty at member
institutions in the numeracy network. The student audience for these materials
ranges from secondary school to first and second year college level. Modules are
adaptations of materials developed through collaborations with Hollins
University and Edmonds Community College that are part of the Mathematical
Sciences Across the Curriculum consortium formed as a result of a previous grant
DUE-9552462. Project personnel are also working through the Mathematics
Association of America and NNN to disseminate successful approaches through
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
