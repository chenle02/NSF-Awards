9411891 Hsu This project is to improve the performance of the universal panel
tester at the University of Houston by adding a data management system including
signal conditioner, storage channels, computer and necessary computer software.
This will allow the universal panel tester to use the load- control in the load
increasing phase and strain-control technique during the load decreasing phase
and switch from phase to another during a test. This is an equipment grant. ***
