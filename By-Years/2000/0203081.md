The International Children's Digital Library requests funds for a series of
stakeholder meetings. The purpose of the meetings is to explore and develop
strategies for implementing a comprehensive digital library of children's
literature. The Children's Library is dedicated to providing worldwide digital
access to children's literature. The meetings will be held in conjunction with
The Library of Congress' Special Collection Division. There will be six meetings
focusing on specific interests: writers, librarians, publishers, children's
advocates, technologists, and a summary meeting. The meetings will be held
between January and June 2002 at The Library of Congress in Washington D.C.
