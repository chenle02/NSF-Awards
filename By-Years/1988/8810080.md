Sense organs provide two parallel important functions. They serve to detect and
recognize particular stimuli, and to localize a stimulus in space; the animal
then can make appropriate behavioral responses with a correct spatial
orientation to the guided behavior. Electroreception is a special sense
exploited by several fishes that use electric organs to produce a discharge used
for object detection and communication. Unlike propagated sound that gives
timing cues for auditory localization, electric signals act instantly; unlike
straight rays of light that give sight lines for visual localization, the
vectors of the electric currents are often curved. This project examines the
guidance of oriented electrosen- sory behavior in electric fish using behavior,
physiology, and computer modelling. Video analysis in three dimensions will be
used to quantify the swimming path as a fish orients to distant electric
discharges that mimic other electric fish. This behavior involves aligning the
body axis parallel to the electric field vector, and swimming toward the current
source. The approach track will be correlated with the electric field derived by
computation that will include aquarium geometry, and both stationary and moving
electrodes. Electrophysiological activity will be recorded from the nerves that
innervate two classes of electroreceptors, to characterize the sensory coding of
the electric field parameters. The physiological results will be compared to
theoretical analyses of the electric field across the fish's skin, as a function
of geometry and skin resistance. Mechanisms of stimulus localization are
fundamental to sensory processing. This study uses a novel approach that will
provide a substantial contribution to understanding electrosense in particular,
and other sensory systems in general.
