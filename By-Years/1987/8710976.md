The research deals with the modelling of the auditory system. Specifically the
research aims to develop new algorithms for the automatic recognition of speech
by mimicking the function of the cochlea and central auditory neural networks.
There are three stages in the research: a) Neural Representation and Physical
Stimulus, b) Feature Extraction and Signal Processing, and c) Pattern
Recognition and Memory. This project is one supported under the Creativity
Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
