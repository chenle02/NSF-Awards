Proposal Number 0430066&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Richard N.
Taylor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-Adaptive Software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptive
behavior is required of many classes of software systems in which untimely human
responses to change are insufficient. Self-adaptive software systems address
this requirement by continually observing themselves and their environment in
order to effect autonomous modifications to their behavior. This research aims
to develop a methodology for the development of self-adaptive software centered
on ensuring a high-level of adaptation policy visibility, enforcing a strict
decoupling of policy specification &lt;br/&gt;from system implementation, and
supporting the independent and dynamic runtime evolution of adaptation
policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these objectives, the design of self-
adaptive systems through the integration of architectural models and knowledge-
based techniques is investigated. A specification of adaptation policies
&lt;br/&gt;based on architectural knowledge independent from system semantics is
included in software architecture models; these artifacts are leveraged to
implement knowledge-based reasoning to determine &lt;br/&gt;necessary system
modifications. Research results are evaluated in the context of space
exploration systems, which provide a rich set of examples sorely needing self-
adaptive capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research enables the principled
architecting of self-adaptive systems by elevating and specifying adaptation
policies as first-class architectural elements supported by the novel
integration &lt;br/&gt;of knowledge-based techniques for reasoning over the
space defined by architectural knowledge, adaptation policy, and system
modifications.
