This CAREER award supports the research and professional development of
Professor Clara Chan. Chan will investigate the polytope algebra and its
connections to the algebra of piecewise polynomial functions and cohomology of
toric varieties. She will also continue her work on cubical polytopes. The main
focus of the educational plan is to bring more advanced technology into
undergraduate mathematics courses at Virginia Tech, especially in the area of
Discrete Mathematics. The research component of this project is in the general
area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study
how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete
systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design
of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design
of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
