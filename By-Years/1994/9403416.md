9403416 Kouri Univ. of Houston This project in the theory of reactive molecular
dynamics is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program. The time-independent wavepacket (TIW) approach to quantum mechanics
will be developed and implemented into reactive scattering codes using
polynominal representations of the full Green's operators with absorbing
potentials and the spectral density operator. Both scattering and bound-state
Fermion systems will be treated. The possibility of deriving a TIW Kohn-type
S-matrix variational principle will be explored. The TIW method will be
implemented using distributed approximations functions to represent a function
evaluated on a discrete grid of points. The TIW method, recently invented
jointly by Donald Kouri and David Hoffman, offers an alternative to traditional
methods of solving the time-independent Schroedinger equation for scattering
states in the continuum (the S-matrix formalism) or solving the time-dependent
Schroedinger equation for wavepackets that evolve in time. The new TIW method
has computational advantages over each of these. Kohn has previously derived a
variational principle for traditional S-matrix calculations. One of the major
goals of this research project is the development of an analogous variational
principle for TIW calculations. The hope and expectation is that this research
in formal theory and computational methodology will significantly improve our
ability to make accurate and detailed predictions of molecular processes in the
gas phase. Possible future applications of this technology include computer
models of ozone depletion in the earth's atmosphere or high temperature
combustion processes in jet engines and waste incinerators.
