This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing award. The process of
updating a view in a relational database usually requires the translation of an
update into updates over the underlying base relations. This process can be
complex since the translation may not be unique. A generalization of the view
update problem in relational databases is equivalent to the update of an
intensional relation in a deductive database in which only the extensional
database can be modified. The aim of this research is to design and implement
update algorithms for stratified normal deductive databases by incorporating
disjunctions in the extensional part of the database. The algorithms consider
single insertions, single deletions and transactions. A fundamental structure
for the implementation of the algorithms are interpretation trees that are used
to compute answers to queries in disjunctive deductive databases. The research
also addresses the issue of integrity constraints in disjunctive databases. So
far, constraint satisfaction in disjunctive databases has been relatively
unexplored; nevertheless, it has been shown that there exists a strong
connection between disjunctive databases with constraints and the stable model
semantics for normal logic programs. Hence, the development of algorithms to
check integrity constraints will indicate directions to define procedures to
answer queries in normal logic programs under the stable model semantics.
