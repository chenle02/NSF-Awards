9318587 Chase Sweet Briar College on behalf of the Tri-College Consortium
requests support from NSF for connection of their campus networks to VERnet. The
Tri-College Consortium comprises Sweet Briar College, Randolph-Macon Woman's
College, and Lynchburg College. VERnet, the mid-level network offering services
in Virginia, will provide operations management and information services and it
will give the consortium 3 56 thousand bits per second connections to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. By linking to
the mid-level and national networks the Tri-College Consortium's faculty and
academics will maintain a position of leadership in research and educational
innovation by profiting from remote access to super computer centers, data bases
and information services, high speed communications, file transfer and remote
login, and access to library resources. This is also a unique opportunity for
the school to explore innovative educational resources.
