This project will provide for the continued dissemination of research results
from the Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) program through the use of the
WorldWide Web, electronically disseminated newsletters, and published reports.
The timely dissemination of news about the GEM program has been a critical part
in the past successes of the GEM program and will continue to be vital to the
future of GEM.&lt;br/&gt;
