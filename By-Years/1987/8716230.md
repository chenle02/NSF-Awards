The photosynthetic mechanism by which light energy is converted into chemical
energy will only be fully understood after the molecular architecture of all the
components involved in the process has been determined. Thus it is needed to
know how each polypeptide functions, how it is folded, how cofactors are
associated with it and how it is arranged with respect to other polypeptides and
to the membrane. The goal of Dr. Thornber's research is to contribute to an
understanding of the light energy trapping and its conversion into chemical
energy during photosynthesis. The major interest is in those photosynthetic
components that contain chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules. Recently he was
able to isolate and partially characterize nine carotenoid- chlorophyll-protein
complexes from higher plant thylakoids. For the first time it is now possible to
purify these nine pigment-proteins without losing any chlorophyll or probably
carotenoid, molecules that are present in the components in situ. Crystals have
also been made of two of them. A thorough analysis of each complex will be made.
