Grand Valley State University (GVSU) has received an award from the National
Science Foundation to purchase an automated genetic analyzer and
spectrophotometer for use in interdisciplinary faculty and student research and
teaching. The instrumentation will be used by faculty across a variety of
biological disciplines including Molecular Ecology, Behavioral Ecology,
Physiology, and others. Investigations designed to leverage the new equipment
include: 1) studying the role of hybridization in biological invasions, 2)
probing the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, 3) assessing
physiological changes in altered gravity conditions that simulate life on the
International Space Station, and 4) examining the population genetics of
cooperation and altruism in social insects. The instrumentation will heavily
impact student training at GVSU, an undergraduate institution, by providing
numerous research opportunities, experiences, and skills for students. In
addition, the instrumentation will be incorporated into a number of courses in
the Biology, Cellular and Molecular Biology, and other departments. This
National Science Foundation award will enhance the research environment at GVSU,
and will therefore encourage and prepare students for careers in science.
Findings and results from the research projects will be presented at regional
and national meetings, and in peer-reviewed journals.
