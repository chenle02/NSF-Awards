Researchers at Carolina Coastal University are developing a new course and
curricular materials that explicitly target scientific reasoning and
metacognition within a conceptual physics context. The main goals of this
project are: (1) to improve scientific reasoning, preparing non-STEM students to
be effective citizen leaders and developing underprepared physics majors into
reasonably competent science students ready for the rigors of an intense program
of study; and (2) to change student's views about science and knowledge
construction from a positivist-oriented view, where they regard science as an
existing body of knowledge, to a more constructivist-oriented view, where
acquisition of new knowledge is a creative endeavor requiring a variety of
epistemological resources.

One novel and potentially transformative aspect of this project is the attention
paid to issues surrounding student learning for two wildly disparate (at least
by surface appearances) groups of students---the non-STEM major and the first-
semester physics major. The investigators have shown significant insight in
recognizing that these two groups have similar educational needs; lessons
learned from both groups, and perhaps from interactions between the groups, will
be of great interest to the larger physics and scientific community.
