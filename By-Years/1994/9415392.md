This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program provides Purdue
University with funds for the acquisition of an atomic force microscope
(AFM)/scanning tunneling microscope (STM). This instrument will be shared
between the Purdue University High School Outreach Program, also known as the
Purdue Instrument Van Project, and the conventional undergraduate instruction
program in the Purdue Chemistry Department. In the former role, the surface
microscope will be used to demonstrate the underlying molecular and atomic basis
of matter to high school teachers and their students. It will join a number of
other instruments delivered to high schools by the Purdue Chemistry Van for
hands-on use by students. The equipment will also be used in the Instrumental
Analysis course taken by Purdue chemistry majors. This course has a laboratory
experience in instrumentation at its core and the addition of AFM/STM capability
will greatly improve the quality of this course.
