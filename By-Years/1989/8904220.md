This project focuses on a unique seismic data set, funded under an earlier NSF
grant, from the middle east rift zone of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii during an
eruptive phase in 1988. Preliminary analysis of these data reveals a number of
complex signals related to gas and magma interaction. The proposed project is to
extend earlier research on resonance models by attempting to realistically
incorporate the effects of bubbles in magma. This research has application to
the basic understanding of the physics of volcanic eruption and is therefore a
fundamental contribution to the study of volcanic hazards.
