This project will initiate a hands-on inquiry-based science curriculum in all
the elementary school classrooms of the Pasadena Unified School District. The
District is urban, multicultural and multiracial. The District's partner, the
California Institute of Technology (Caltech), is a preeminent research
university. Their combined effort will use a method proven during four years of
a very successful partnership between Caltech and one Pasadena pilot school. The
initial education for teachers will be presented in small groups each led by a
mentor teacher and a volunteer science professional. During these group meetings
the teachers will have an opportunity to investigate kit materials which they
will use later in their classrooms. The small group will work through the kits
in a cooperative learning environment, while the co- leaders emphasize the
philosophy and methods of hands-on teaching as well as the scientific subject
matter which relates to each kit. During the school year, resource teachers will
work with teachers in their classrooms, and meet with them during group
meetings. At these sessions teachers will be able to explore other science units
and exchange experiences and ideas with their colleagues. The total cost sharing
for the project will be 200% of the NSF portion.
