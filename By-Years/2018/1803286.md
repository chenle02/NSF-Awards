This project will support student travel to the 27th ACM International Symposium
on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2018). HPDC, the
premier venue for presenting the latest research on the design, implementation,
evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high performance and
high end computing, will take place over the week of June 27th in Tempe, AZ.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experience will include a set of co-located full-day
workshops with topics that include&lt;br/&gt; o Fault-Tolerance for HPC at
Extreme Scale (FTXS)&lt;br/&gt; o Software Engineering Methods for Parallel and
High Performance Applications (SEM4HPC)&lt;br/&gt; o The Ninth Workshop on
Scientific Cloud Computing (ScienceCloud)&lt;br/&gt; o The Eighth Interntional
Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers
(ROSS)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main conference takes place Wednesday through
Friday. This is a single-track conference that will include keynotes, paper
sessions, a poster session, a panel, and an industry/institutional session. The
recruitment strategy encourages diversity in participation. Active involvement
in major conferences is a valuable experience for students.
