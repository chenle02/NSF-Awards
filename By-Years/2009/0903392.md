CCF - 0903392 &lt;br/&gt;Optimization of Test and Diagnosis Infrastructure for
Multicore Chips&lt;br/&gt;Chakrabarty, Krishnendu &lt;br/&gt;Duke University
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of multicore integrated
circuits offers continued technological advances in computing through the on-
chip integration of processors, graphics accelerators, memories, and other types
of cores. Test solutions are needed to reduce cost and defect escapes, and to
facilitate repair and reconfiguration through diagnosis. This project is
therefore directed at new methods for comprehensive defect screening,
optimization techniques for test delivery, and diagnosis flows to quickly
identify faulty cores. It is structured around the following topics: (i)
generation of high-quality tests to augment core-level patterns, including tests
for power-management structures and clock-domain boundaries, and tests for the
interconnect fabric and interfaces to the cores; (ii) theory and optimization
tools for utilizing the interconnection fabric for test-data transportation;
(iii) optimization methods to reduce the time needed for identifying faulty
cores and clock domains. The project is being carried out in collaboration with
partners at Intel and AMD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will reduce test
cost and defect levels, and lead to higher shipped-product quality for
multicore-based systems. The test infrastructure will facilitate in-field
testing, diagnosis, and dynamic reconfiguration through the use of spare cores.
Resulting benefits for society include cheaper and reliable computing platforms
for a wide range of applications. Undergraduate and graduate students will be
prepared for the semiconductor industry. SRC Master?s Scholarships and PhD
Fellowships will be used as recruitment tools, especially for under-represented
groups. Tutorials at conferences and lectures at IEEE/ACM Chapters worldwide
will lead to broad dissemination of research results.&lt;br/&gt;
