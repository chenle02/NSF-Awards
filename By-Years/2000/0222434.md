The ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry is sponsoring a three-day meeting
entitled, "Polymeric Nanomaterials," in Sonoma, California, during the period of
November 17-20, 2002. The organizers are A. D. English, B. L. Farmer, and R. A.
Vaia. The conference has an outstanding collection of speakers from the U.S.,
