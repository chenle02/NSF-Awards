This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2014. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Lily S. Cheung is "Quantitative Imaging and Mathematical
Modeling of Sugar Allocation in Plant Roots" The host institution for the
fellowship is the Carnegie Institution for Science and the sponsoring scientist
is Dr. Wolf B. Frommer.

Understanding the biology of plant membrane transporters, the first step in the
uptake and utilization of water and nutrients, can lead to genetically improved
crops that are more tolerant to adverse environmental conditions and use
resources more efficiently. This project will produce the first maps of sugar
distribution in plant tissues and characterize their response to genetic and
environmental perturbations. The tools and analysis methods developed can be
applied to the study of other metabolites. This project will provide the fellow
with interdisciplinary training in plant physiology, quantitative imaging, and
computational biology. Additionally, this project will provide summer
opportunities in plant biology research to physics, computer science and
engineering undergraduate students who will be encouraged to apply principles
from their own majors to the study of biological systems.

Increasing the amount of sugars stored in plants is necessary to sustain the
growing demand for food and biofuels; yet how sugars are distributed between
different tissues within plant organs remains poorly understood. This project
seeks to develop quantitative models of sugar transport and metabolism in roots
that describe sugar allocation during development, with particular emphasis in
understanding the role of the recently discovered SWEET family of sugar
transporters in this process. Sugar patterns in plant roots will be
characterized using sugar concentration and membrane transport activity optical
sensors based on fluorescent proteins. The resulting measurements will be
integrated with gene expression and biochemical characterization of SWEET genes
to formulate predictive mathematical models of sugar transport and metabolism.
