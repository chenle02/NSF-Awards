9354160 Ross Cayey University College will design methods to further develop
itself as a Model Institution for Excellence (MIE) in undergraduate Science and
Mathematics. The MIE program will contribute to significantly increasing the
number and quality of Puerto Rican students entering and progressing through the
educational pipeline, and pursuing graduate degrees in the Natural Science,
Computer Sciences, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM). This comprehensive long
term program is possible at Cayey because of an existing commitment to this
objective. Cayey intends to sustain the success of the MIE program in the
Natural Sciences and Mathematics faculty and curricula with a balanced teaching
and research practice. The balance will be insured and enhanced by the creation
of a support structure with three components: Student, Research and Academic
development. The Student Development Component will deal directly with students
at pre-college, college and college-to-graduate levels. Specific activities will
be developed for recruitment of high school students, enrichment and support of
undergraduates, as well as information and support for college-to-graduate
students. Also, activities will be provided for the development of scientific
literacy to potential students, their families and members of the community. The
purpose of the Research Development component is to strengthen the overall
Science and Mathematics research capabilities. It will administer research
grants and handle specific research related activities in coordination with the
Academic component. The Academic Component proposes to complement the learning
experience with undergraduate research, creating a climate of excitement with
the learning process which comes from discovery. Such an experience is conceived
to promote students to move on to graduate SEM programs. As a whole, the
component will strengthen the undergraduate programs through the following
activities; revision of curricula a nd programs to integrate undergraduate
research as a unifying structure, co-curricular activities with visiting
specialists and speakers, renovation of teaching methodology, recruitment of new
faculty, and acquisition of modern equipment and instrumentation.
