The main purpose of the project is to explore why undergraduate students drop
out of STEM majors. The PIs propose to study a set of cognitive and motivational
variables to understand the reasons for dropout from STEM gateway courses. They
plan to employ a multimethod approach to study the process of undergraduate
students? dropout from these courses at Temple University, where such gateway
courses enroll 60% or more non-White students. Drawing on Dweck?s work, they
hypothesize that students tend to believe their own STEM ability is either a
fixed entity or malleable, and this affects whether they remain in STEM majors.
In addition to the quantitative part of the study a purposive sample of students
will be interviewed early and late in the semester in order to better understand
students? own reasons for dropout/retention decisions and their relationship to
entity/incremental beliefs. The students will be followed to document their
dropout status over the course of four years, allowing for a longitudinal
examination (using the statistical technique of survival analysis) of the effect
of cognitive and motivational variables on students? persistence. The primary
focus is on building knowledge in order to increase STEM retention and build
scientific capacity. The results of the study are likely to provide important
information about predictors of dropout and potential targets for intervention
that can assist universities and policymakers who are trying to increase
retention of STEM students. Undergraduate science majors from a high-minority
institution (Temple University) will be participants, and pre-service science
teachers will be targeted for undergraduate research assistants. The
interdisciplinary project aims at policy relevant and evidence based findings to
improve undergraduate and graduate STEM programs.
