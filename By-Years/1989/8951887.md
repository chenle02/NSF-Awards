Spectrofluorometric analysis, an indispensable tool in basic and applied
research in biochemistry, cell biology, and immunology, is being introduced in
the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory. Fluorometric assays, fluorescene
probes for structural studies of proteins, nucleic acids, membranes and other
macromolecular complexes, will be performed. The presence of the
spectrofluorometer will enhance the effectiveness of the biochemistry program.
The experiments developed will be published for use by other institutions. The
university will provide 50% matching funds.
