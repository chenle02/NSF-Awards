The research deals with a new type of double-spectrometer which allows a direct
correlation of complex quenching effects observed in optical absorption and
photo-electron Paramagnetic Resonance work on Gallium Arsenide. The study
centers on the characterizing native defects in Gallium Arsenide. One important
native defect is referred to as EL2. The research is to identify the origin of
EL2 and to gain control over its concentrations in Gallium Arsenide crystals.
