A request is made to fund replacement instrumentation on the R/V Endeavor, a
185? general purpose research vessel operated by the University of Rhode Island
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS)
research fleet. The request includes one item:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) 24-bottle
Carousel and CTD Conductivity sensor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
