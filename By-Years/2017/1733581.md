It has long been recognized across the sub disciplines of Experimental Physics
that there is an essential need to encourage and strengthen advanced
instrumentation research and development at universities, to engage faculty,
postdoctoral researchers, and students at all levels in the creation and
development of new, transformational instrumentation to meet the challenges of
near term and future experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinating Panel for
Advanced Detector (CPAD) Workshops are a valuable mechanism for helping to
foment interest and share and review developments in the critical area of
instrumentation development, and provide a meeting ground for experts from both
university and national laboratory communities. The third in this series of
Workshops, CPAD2017 will be held at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque,
NM, October 12-14, 2017, and hosted by the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPAD2017 will overview the science drivers for new
technologies in particle physics experiments, and approaches to these topics
through contemporary and planned experiments with US participation will be
discussed. Dedicated parallel sessions on forefront topics in calorimetry,
tracking, cryogenic detectors, trigger and data acquisition, photodetectors,
noble liquids, and related subjects will be convened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF
support for CPAD2017 will provide access to participation by younger scientists,
who will be central to and essential for current and future advances in frontier
research in Physics.
