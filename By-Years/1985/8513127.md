This study uses a specially constructed reactor to determine the effects of
operating reaction systems in a mode different from the steady-state conditions
normally employed for the vast majority of commercial systems. The study is
based on an approach referred to as "forced concentration cycling of the feed."
This method has a potential to improve catalyst selectivity and activity for
some systems. In this case, the results are also expected to contribute directly
to a better understanding of mechanisms of catalyzed reactions.
