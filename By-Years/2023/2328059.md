A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized annually as
a satellite workshop of the 2023 to 2025 ACM International Conference on
Functional Programming (ICFP). ICFP is the premier conference on the design,
implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. This award
supports students from underrepresented groups so that they can attend the
mentoring workshop in addition to the ICFP conference. The impact of the award
relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for
students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next
generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners with general expertise
in programming languages, and specific expertise in functional programming.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
