at the Oregon State University Core repository. The core repository serves as
library/storage for piston, gravity cores and dredged rock collections acquired
by Oregon State researchers and those in the surrounding region. Stored material

community, and allows long-term preservation of material for research and
educational purposes. The award supports personnel and equipment necessary to
respond to sample requests and to maintain the core collection in a suitable
condition. ***
