This project is a continuation of a previously funded project on the application
of Kalman filtering to power system protective relaying. The renewal addresses
several different areas including the use of the extended Kalman filtering (to
accommodate nonlinear models), the inclusion of fault security analysis, digital
protection of power system components with a minimum time methodology,
identification of the severity of system wide disturbances, and the computation
(identification) of the fault location. Included in the study are series
compensated lines, multi-terminal lines, high impedance faults, transformer
location, dynamic security assessment and evaluation, and the use of vector
signal processors in the implementation of the Kalman filter.
