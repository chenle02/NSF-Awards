This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of the debates and political currents leading up to the
ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, mandating an income
tax, in 1913. The project will primarily make use of historical documents to
comparatively analyze how the 16th Amendment was ratified in three states: New
York, Wisconsin, and Virginia. Results will be analyzed in order to shed light
on how ideas about distributive justice evolve in the real world. This research
will contribute to the growing effort to study important values and social
processes outside of the experimental social psychology laboratory. In this case
the central ideas involved are conceptions of distributive justice, and the
debates over ideas of fairness that occurred during the several decades prior to
the ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913 will provide the data to
illuminate how such conceptions evolve. In addition to the scientific gains to
be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly
promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it
contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough
training of the next generation of sociologists.
