The Delta Research &amp; Education Foundation (DREF) is following up on a
successful planning grant with the Science and Everyday Experiences (SEE)
Initiative. The SEE Initiative will be implemented by the Delta Sigma Theta
Sorority, a non-profit organization composed of 190,000 predominantly African-
American professionals, that provides programs and services to promote human
welfare. The program offers a five-year, comprehensive approach to the delivery
of resources designed to help parents and caregivers of African-American
children in grades K-8 effectively support informal science and math learning.
By partnering with the AAAS, SEE provides members of the 800+ Delta chapters
with leadership and professional development training in informal science
education. The first phase of training is a three-day professional development
workshop for Delta regional officers and members. Regional leaders are prepared
to conduct State Chapter Leadership Professional Development Workshops. State
Chapter workshops are 12-hour sessions that train 4,200 sorority members per
year to sponsor ongoing family science events. Finally, Delta members that are
K-12 or community educators will be designated as Parent Educators. SEE Parent
Educators will receive 40-hour training sessions from AAAS, which enables
participants to provide parents with 24 hours of informal science education. It
is anticipated that 2,800 SEE Parent Educators will be trained during the life
of the grant. Delta chapters are located in seven geographical regions, which
encompass 40 states and will serve as the primary mode of dissemination.
Promotion of the SEE Initiative will occur in conjunction with media partners. A
30-minute science radio talk show for families will broadcast nationally on
Radio One and inquiry-based science inserts will be placed in the Afro-American
Newspaper, which has a circulation of 6.5 million. Other outcomes include an
informational website, as well as science activity cards for families and
training materials. This project will impact 17,500 families per year.
