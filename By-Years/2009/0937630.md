This project builds on Dr. Recker's past work in the area of enhancing
technology integration into instructional development for teachers. The project
uses the web-based teacher authoring tool, Instructional Architect (IA) and a
technology-oriented teacher professional development model, called DLConnect.
Together, these help K-12 teachers in creating classroom activities for their
students using online learning resources found in the National Science Digital
Library (NSDL) and on the web. The current project substantially revises the IA
tool and enhances the DLConnect teacher professional development (TPD) model to
help teachers integrate NSDL resources with effective, inquiry-oriented
pedagogical practices. A rigorous research program examines and evaluates the
impact of this model on teachers' and their students' knowledge, attitudes, and
behavior toward technology-oriented instruction. Quantitative and qualitative
research methods are used to assess and evaluate research outcomes. Quantitative
methods use quasi-experimental studies to compare the inquiry-oriented TPD with
the existing, technology-oriented TPD model. Qualitative methods use in-depth
case studies to help explain results. This project supports teachers in crossing
the 'last mile' between producers of online resources and the teachers who use
them.
