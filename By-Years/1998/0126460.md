A collaborative research program will study adaptive and survival strategies of
microorganisms in biofilms. The collaborating team includes researchers at the
University of Buffalo and at Malmo University (Sweden). The program has three
objectives: as a clear test of the induction hypothesis with a well-studied
system, to identify the general and acid-specific stress proteins induced in S.
mutans H7 during the early stages of the acid tolerance response and to initiate
studies on their function; to establish the relationships between the acid
tolerance and starvation responses in S. mutans, as functions of the surface
energies of the substrata to which they have attached as biofilms; and to expand
the study of the induction of stress proteins to include the response of S.
mutnas to dynamic shear stresses that characterize relevant microbial biofilm
environments.
