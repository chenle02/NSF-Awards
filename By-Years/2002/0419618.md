The principal investigator will further explore the ensemble/superensemble
approach for numerical weather prediction using forecast experiments from a
range of different models. A superensemble approach performs an ensemble average
after the bias of the individual member models is removed, thereby increasing
the skill of the prediction above that of individual model forecasts. The PI
will extend this approach by using a suite of proxy models, which is called the
synthetic superensemble component, to address the issue of seasonal climate
anomalies. Variants of the synthetic superensemble will be explored with regard
to hurricane landfall, track and intensity, as well as heavy rain forecasts and
numerical weather prediction. Graduate students will participate in this
research.
