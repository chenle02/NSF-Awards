Montana College of Mineral Science &amp; Technology will initiate a 4-week
residential Young Scholars project for 24 students in grades 9-11 in earth
science (mineral education). Montana Tech, in conjunction with regional
minerals-based industries has established an activity-based Minerals Education
Program. During the summer program participants will be immersed in the field of
earth science, introduced to new concepts in geology, hydrogeology, geophysics,
mining, metallurgy, and environmental engineering, taught new field and
laboratory skills, and participate in active research alongside aspiring and
established professionals. New interests and skills will be sustained through
the school year by student participation in an Advisor directed research project
performed near the student's home area. Students will reconvene for a May
Symposium where industry, students, and instructors will share research results.
