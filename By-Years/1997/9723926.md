This award supports participation of graduate and postdoctoral students to
present their research at the Summer Neuropeptide Conference. Neuropeptides are
molecular compounds that are known in many cases to have effects on modulating
the activity of the brain and behavior. The meeting is not huge, and so it
represents an excellent opportunity for young scientists to make important
contacts with other scientists doing related work, to exchange the latest
information on theories and techniques, and to develop new collaborations,
including international ones. The NSF joins several other donors and agencies in
giving partial support to this meeting, with an emphasis on the NSF mission of
promoting infrastructure to develop the careers of young scientists. The travel
awards will have a substantial impact on the careers of the young scientists who
are able to attend.
