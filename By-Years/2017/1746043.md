The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and faculty at HBCUs.
The American Association For Advancement Science (AAAS) will organize two Making
&amp; Innovation Showcases to provide students and faculty from HBCUs with an
opportunity to implement and present technology prototypes. Additionally, AAAS
will conduct an evaluation research study exploring the impact of maker-related
activities on students, faculty, and institutions. The showcases will be held in
February 2018 and February 2019 jointly with the Emerging Researchers National
Conference in Washington, DC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the HBCU Making
&amp; Innovation Showcases is to encourage and support increased participation
in STEM-related innovation and entrepreneurship activities by students of color.
To meet this goal, AAAS will support at least fifteen student teams to
participate in the HBCU Making &amp; Innovation Showcases, provide students with
innovation-focused training at the showcases, and document and disseminate the
implementation of innovation activities at the institutions. Through this
project, students will create prototypes using hardware and software to address
one of the seventeen sustainable development goals of the United Nations. The
Making and Innovation Showcases will enable AAAS to promote innovation and
making on HBCU campuses and provide a platform to investigate the ways in which
making and innovation are supported and sustained at these institutions. The
impact of the activities will be studied using quantitative and qualitative
research methods.
