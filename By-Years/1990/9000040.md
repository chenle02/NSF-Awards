This SBIR proposal is aimed at (1) the synthesis of new ferroelectric liquid
crystals with ultra-high polarization, chemical stability and low viscosity, and
(2) suitable modifications that yield functional materials with broad
operational temperature ranges and fast electro-optic response times for use as
components in commercial ferroelectric liquid crystals devices that are direct-
drive or voltage limited.
