Far infrared magneto-optical and magneto-transport studies of interacting
electron gas systems will be investigated. The main thrust of this research will
be on quasi-3 dimensional (Q3D) electron gas based on wide parabolic well
structures grown epitaxially with gallium-aluminum arsenide heterostructures.
The research involves the study of Q3D magneto-plasmons in these systems with
the ultimate goal being the discovery of the Wigner crystal. The plans also
include the study of magneto-plasmons in the two-dimensional electron gas system
because of magneto-rotons associated with the fractional quantum Hall effect.
The equilibrium properties of the upper Hubbard band for silicon in doped
gallium arsenide will also be studied, as will impurity band formation in two-
dimensional delta-doped gallium arsenide.
