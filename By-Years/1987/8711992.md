This project provides for research opportunities for 20 undergraduate students
working at the Biotechnology Process Engineering Center. The Center conducts an
interdisciplinary program. The undergraduate students are able to do research in
four principle areas of focus: Genetics and Molecular Biology; Bioreactor Design
and Operation; Downstream Processing; and Biochemical Process System
Engineering. The activities are to cover a summer program which may be extended
into the following academic years.
