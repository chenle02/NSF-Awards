Carbon dioxide (CO2) has an effect on ventilation rate in animals, and some of
the cellular mechanisms for that regulation are known. In reptiles and
amphibians, some of the olfactory receptor cells in the nose apparently are
sensitive to CO2, but how these cells respond, and how they may contribute to
controlling breathing remains unknown. There is some evidence that the enzyme
carbonic anhydrase is required to detect changes in CO2 in other systems. This
project addresses the role of carbonic anhydrase in detecting CO2 in the frog
olfactory receptors. The physiological response of the summed receptor potential
of a population of olfactory cells in the epithelium is recorded before and
after application of an inhibitor for carbonic anhydrase. Histological
experiments will determine the location of carbonic anhydrase contained in cells
in the nasal epithelium, to correlate with the physiological data. Results will
increase our understanding of chemoreception and of ventilation control
mechanisms, and so will have impact on general physiology as well as sensory
neuroscience.
