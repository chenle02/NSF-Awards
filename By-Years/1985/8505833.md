Short-term annealing of implanted semiconductors using incoherent light sources
is currently being widely used. This research is concerned with the
establishment of a halogen lamp rapid thermal annealing system. The system will
be used in ongoing experiments aimed at the understanding of the basic process
and its optimization and in device fabrication. The latter includes both
microwave and optoelectronic devices. The availability of such a system in the
laboratory will enable more extensive studies in the various areas.
