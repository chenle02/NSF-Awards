When Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects B lymphocytes a latent state is
established in which the EBV genome is maintained as a multicopy episome and the
cells become immortalized. A small percentage of latently infected cells
spontaneously enter the lytic cycle. The molecular events which control the
switch from a latent to a lytic cycle are only partially delineated.
Reactivation of the lytic cycle is probably initiated by the Z transactivator
(Zta) encoded by EBV. Zta is a DNA binding protein belonging to the Jun/Fos
family of transcriptional activators. We have identified a new transactivator
encoded by EBV, designated Rta, which augments Zta activity. These
transactivators induce transcription from promoters which regulate the
expression of early lytic cycle genes. Unlike Zta, Rta activates EBV enhancer
elements located upstream of early promoters. Deletion and substitution mutants
of the gene encoding Rta will be engineered to identify amino acid domains
required for transactivation, nuclear localization, and phosphorylation. We have
generated a synthetic peptide-specific antibody which recognizes Rta. This and
other antibodies we propose to generate will be used to identify mutant and wild
type versions of Rta. Also, Rta protein will be purified for biochemical
analysis to determine if Rta activates gene expression by direct DNA binding or
by interaction with other viral or cellular proteins. The mutants of Rta will be
tested for DNA/protein-interactions as well to determine if these properties
correlate with biological function. Delineation of these functional domains will
help elucidate the mechanism of transactivation. The results of these
experiments are expected to greatly enhance the current knowledge of EBV gene
regulation. Because Rta has some of the properties of cellular transcription
factors, the information gained about Rta is likely to contribute to our
understanding of mechanisms of eukaryotic gene control.
