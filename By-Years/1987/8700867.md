This research program will explore the connections between exactly solvable
lattice models in lattice statistical mechanics and the representation theory of
Kac-Moody Lie algebras. The long term goal is to connect the present
understanding of exactly solvable models with that of the representation theory
of certain Kac-Moody Lie algebra. The immediate task will be the study of
specific solvable models and their relations to loop groups. Successful
accomplishment of the immediate research project will enhance the methodology
for solvable models in the statistical mechanics aspects of physics. This in
turn will lead to a better understanding, utilization and control of materials
and matters in technical applications as well as in our daily life.
