The overall goal of this research project is to clarify our understanding of
how cyclones (storms) and related atmospheric weather systems form and
intensify. The results are likely to contribute to improved skill in weather
prediction. Three phenomena will be investigated. The first are extratropical
cyclones, particularly cases where there is rapid intensification. The PI hopes
to identify the factors which cause cyclogenesis to be explosive. A second area
of study is directed at mesoscale solitary gravity waves. These waves represent
disturbances with the cyclone that typically are 100 kilometers wide and one
hour in duration and cause very rapid pressure falls and sometimes dangerous
winds. The third area involves the study of polar lows which are small intense
cyclones that develop primarily over the ocean in polar regions. For all three
topics, the PI will employ both observational and model- generated data sets.
The latter will be taken from simulations done with mesoscale model at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research.
