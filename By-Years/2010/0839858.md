(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solar wind - magnetosphere -
ionosphere system and the space weather phenomena it controls is a complex and
dynamic environment that has increasing recognition of potentially impacting
critical human technological infrastructure. To be able to forecast, and thus
adapt to, the impact space weather events may have on infrastructure as diverse
as satellite communications and power grids, it is necessary to develop accurate
geomagnetic models of the Sun-Earth environment. Due to the dipole nature of the
planet's magnetic field, the Earth's outer magnetosphere maps to relatively
small regions in the polar and auroral latitudes in both hemispheres. The
northern hemisphere is relatively well instrumented. However, lack of sufficient
observations particularly notable in the Southern hemisphere lessens our ability
to validate global models of the geospace environment. The main magnetic dipole
is offset and tilted, resulting in a weaker polar field in the southern
hemisphere. Seasonal ionospheric electrodynamic asymetries similarly result. The
magnitudes of both these effects need to be measured and more fully understood
to build reliable Space Weather models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks
continued development and deployment of a chain of magnetometers located along
the southern high latitude 40 degree magnetic meridian to provide conjugate
inter-hemispheric measurements complementing the data from the existing dense
Greenland west coast magnetometer array. Such measurements open the promise of
simultaneous data from northern and southern hemispheres to enable the
investigation of inter-hemispheric electrodynamic coupling throughout the entire
outer magnetosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
