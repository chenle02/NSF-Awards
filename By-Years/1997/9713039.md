9713039 Fred Taylor University of Florida CISE Educational Innovation: Synergy:
A CISE Learning Environment This CISE Educational Innovation award, involving
both the University of Florida and the University of Texas at El Paso, supports
the development of a new activity-based learning environment called Synergy.
Synergy provides undergraduate students with the opportunity to engage in hands-
on research-centric digital signal processing (DSP) studies within a simulated
professional engineering framework. A significant part of the project includes
development of a new capstone laboratory which is designed to provide students
with an experience which requires demonstrated unstructured problem solving
skills, clear and concise communications, planning and scheduling discipline,
Internet utilization, and personal accountability. The laboratory is being
developed with input from DSP projects from across areas of the institution
including engineering, medicine, education, architecture, computer science, and
others, and from industrial partners as well.
