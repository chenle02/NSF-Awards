The proposal is asking for travel support for US based graduate students and
postdoctoral mathematicians to attend a major conference in geometric group
theory. This is a great opportunity for these junior mathematicians to
familiarize themselves with the frontiers of research in this very active
subject and in the future contribute to it. In addition, many of the
participants (e.g. two of the main speakers) are anticipated to be women. Based
on initial inquiries, it is also likely that several of US based mathematicians
that will be supported on this grant, if funded, will be women.

Geometric group theory is a relatively new area of mathematics whose object is
study groups by first constructing a geometric object whose symmetries form the
given group and then to analyze the geometry of this object. An important
example of this is the group of symmetries of a free group, realized
geometrically as the so called "Outer space", constructed by Culler and
Vogtmann.
