A vision of NSF's biological collections programs is preservation of biological
collections in the U.S. and increased accessibility of collections data that
will lead to new discoveries through research, and a better understanding and
appreciation of biodiversity through improved education and outreach, resulting
in improved environmental and economic policies. This workshop seeks to engage
the community of herbarium curators and learn from the experiences of other
collection types to increase the speed and efficiency of digitization. The
activities proposed targets curators and managers across a wide spectrum of
institutions distributed across eighteen states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
supports participant costs for a workshop for herbarium managers and curators
with the goal to consolidate and standardize best practices across the
digitization process. The workshop would bring together experts from across the
U.S. in sessions hosted by the digitization HUB (iDigBio) and the Southeast
Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC) to evaluate and publish
community-wide standards for all stages of the digitization process. The
proposed activities will standardize best practices across the community,
increasing the speed and efficiency of digitization resulting in a reduction in
the cost of specimen digitization, a major goal of the NSF's biological
collections programs (CSBR and ADBC). These efforts will positively impact the
quantity and quality of digitized data made available to the research community,
government agencies, students, educators, and the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
