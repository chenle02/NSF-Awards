The Department of Science and Mathematics is purchasing gas chromatography
equipment and accessories for an atomic absorption spectrophotometer for use in
an upper division Environmental Chemistry courses for engineers. Nearly all
engineers are being required to deal with hazardous waste concerns associated
with industrial processing. The equipment is enabling students to analyze
industrial environmental samples for organics and inorganics at EPA/OSHA
mandated levels and with EPA/ASTM-based methodology and better understand the
capabilities and limitations of the analytical methods involved.
