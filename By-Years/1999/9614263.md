9614263 Bird One of the underlying goals of geological research is to
reconstruct tectonic and palinspastic circumstances at closely spaced time
intervals, and to develop on understanding of the mechanism involved. This
project involves a new approach to geodynamic modeling, in that it attempts to
develop a modeling algorithm that uses geologic observation to invert for the
displacement field. The work includes an extensive literature search for input
to the model. Results are expected to develop viable models for the tectonic
development of North America since 85 ma, and to tighten the links between
geologic research and geodynamic modeling.
