Non-volatile data storage devices, particularly those based upon NAND flash
memory and emerging phase-change memory (PCM) technologies, are revolutionizing
the way we access and manipulate information. They have many attractive features
compared to magnetic hard disk drives, including their compactness, shock
resistance, and faster data access. Flash memory is now preferred in portable
consumer electronics, and high performance solid-state drives (SSDs) are being
introduced in mobile computing, enterprise storage, data warehousing, and data-
intensive computing applications. Accordingly, there is a surge in interest in
the refinement, development, and expanded commercial use of these non-volatile
memory technologies. On the other hand, these technologies present major
challenges in the areas of device reliability, endurance, and energy efficiency.
These challenges can be overcome, in part, through innovative coding and data
handling techniques, which is the subject of this research project.
Specifically, the problems addressed include: (1) the design of efficient,
error-resilient rewriting codes for single-level cell (SLC) flash memories using
write-once memory (WOM) coding techniques; (2) the design of non-binary
rewriting codes for multi-level cell (MLC) flash memories, as well as codes that
tolerate asymmetric cell-level transitions and writing errors; (3) the
development of coding techniques that mitigate the effects of heat accumulation
in PCMs; and (4) the design of error-correcting codes for PCMs with stuck
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves the information-theoretic
analysis of flash memory and PCM channel models, the development of novel coding
schemes, and system performance evaluation. A unique aspect of the project is
the use of the facilities of the Non-Volatile Systems Laboratory at UC San
Diego, providing an experimental platform for device characterization and
empirical performance comparisons of new coding techniques and architectures.
