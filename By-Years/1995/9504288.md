9504288 Mairson The goal of this research is to investigate the computational
resources required to implement correct, optimal evaluation mechanisms for the
lambda calculus. Because lambda calculus is a foundation for the design and
implementation of programming languages, such research could contribute to the
understanding of programming language implementation. Moreover, it would
integrate approaches to computation that emphasize semantic issues as well as
those of computational complexity. The solution to optimality proposed by
Gonthier, Abadi, and L vy will be analyzed. The computational correctness of
this scheme in an elementary, first-principles sense will be established and its
computational complexity will be analyzed. Ultimately, a version of a correct
evaluator whose complexity is polynomial in a reasonable cost model for lambda
calculus will be put forward that the lambda calculus may be regarded as a
"first class" formalism in the sense of the invariance thesis, the
computationally efficient version of the Church-Turing thesis. The static
semantics as a possible foundation for a lazy environment model will also be
investigated. ***
