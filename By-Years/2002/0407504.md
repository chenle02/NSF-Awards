This project will address these issues; under-prepared Native students, poorly
designed &lt;br/&gt;courses, and a need for water and wastewater technicians.
The project proposes to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the literature regarding Native
American and Native Alaskan learning styles &lt;br/&gt;and to design, develop,
deliver and evaluate six short, online technical courses for the
&lt;br/&gt;Environmental Technology Program at UAS - Sitka. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Sound teaching strategies, designed and tested through this project,
will be adopted for &lt;br/&gt;the rest of the UAS - Sitka Environmental
Technology Program, and other technical &lt;br/&gt;distance program at the
university will be encouraged to use them. Strategies will also be
&lt;br/&gt;appropriate for other STEM courses and programs, and could be
valuable for Native &lt;br/&gt;American students throughout the country. Skills
developed, during study in the security &lt;br/&gt;of their home community, will
encourage Native students to enroll in STEM programs &lt;br/&gt;and should
increase retention and graduation rates.
