The attractive forces between cellulose fibers will be measured on the molecular
level with the aid of a surface force apparatus. Bare fibers and fibers with
absorbed layers of polymeric binders will be used and the effects of moisture
will be determined. The results will be compared with results for Langmuir-
Blodgett films deposited on the mica measuring surfaces of the apparatus. The
study will provide fundamental information on the structure-property relations
for paper.
