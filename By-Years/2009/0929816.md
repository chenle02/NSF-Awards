The twelve-month project of the Maryland Institute for Minority Achievement and
Urban Education (MIMAUE) involves the holding of a national conference for at
least 100 teachers and administrators who work in classrooms with large African
American and Hispanic student populations. The conference theme is "Helping
Teachers become Cultural Relevant Teachers: Developing New Tools for a New
Generation." The conference brings together top national researchers and
practitioners around a theme of importance in order to promote high achievement
among urban and minority students. A specific outcome in relation to the
workshop sessions involves having facilitators bring some of their work in their
own classrooms to be used as a stimulus for the new work that teachers and
administrators will analyze in some of the conference sessions. After the
conference, a sample of the local teachers will be observed after three month,
six months, and nine months in order to assess the extent to which the ideas
from the workshop have influenced their teaching. Conference participants will
also send a mail survey at the six-month point to determine the impact of the
conference on classroom planning and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
