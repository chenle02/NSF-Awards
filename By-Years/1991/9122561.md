The objectives of the proposed research are to provide both a qualitative and a
quantitative evaluation of the different diffusion testing methods; and to
determine the effect of cell size and test duration on the determination of
effective diffusion coefficients. Comparisons of the measured effective
diffusion coefficients will be made with respect to the type of test, the
dimensions of the test cell, and the test duration. The effect of the use of
retardation factors determined by both batch equilibrium and column test methods
on the calculated effective diffusion coefficients will also be explored. This
research should have a significant effect on the test procedures used to
evaluate the potential for contamination due to diffusive transport through low-
hydraulic conductivity waste containment barriers.
