9400908 Frenkel This award supports research in algebra and quantum field
theory. The principle investigator will study the connections among vertex
operator algebras, quantum groups and modular tensor categories. He will also
work on the categorification of these algebraic structures, as well as, problems
related to their q-deformations. Conformal field theory is an important physical
theory describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter
physics and classical motions of strings in string theory. Besides its
importance in physics, the beautiful and rich mathematical structure of
conformal field theory also has interested many mathematicians. New relations
between different branches of mathematics, such as representations of infinite-
dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves, the
Monster sporadic group, modular functions and modular forms, elliptic genera,
and knot theory, is revealed in the study of conformal field theory.
