Djuth 9304571 A high speed radar processor for improved studies of the Earth's
ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Many emerging techniques for the operation of
large radar facilities used for atmospheric research require high data
throughput rates and computer processing speed. As a result, much of the data is
averaged in a way that adversely affects the spatial and temporal resolution of
the measurements. The computer system developed as part of this Phase II SBIR
award will greatly increase the utility of a variety of existing radar systems
through the use of a flexible, high-performance radar processor. Preliminary
tests at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico indicate that major improvements i
the resolution and accuracy of the radar observations can be achieved through
the implementation of computationally intensive radar techniques. The Massively
Parallel Spectral Processor developed under this award can be directly applied
to a wide range of large to mid-sized radar systems used to probe the Earth's
atmosphere. It can also be adapted for imaging radar applications, incorporated
into certain tactical radar systems, and converted into a processor for the
nuclear sciences. ***
