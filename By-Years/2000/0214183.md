The objective of this project is the development of a quantitative tool that can
be used to predict chromatographic performance as a function of adsorbed protein
structure for given protein mixture/media/mobile phase combinations and to
select/design hydrophobic media and mobile phase conditions. This tool will
promote the process-scale use of hydrophobic media, resulting in simpler, more
robust processes that reduce cost-of-goods and time-to-market for new and off-
patent protein drugs. This project will advance the state of the art of
hydrophobic chromatographic systems by addressing the following specific aims:
(1) validate generic mechanisms for protein unfolding on adsorption to
hydrophobic chromatographic media, (2) correlate linear and nonlinear protein-
media interaction behavior using quantitative structure retention relationships
(QSRRs) to connect protein retention to descriptors of native protein, perturbed
protein, surface and solution physical properties, (3) develop a fundamental
theory for protein-media interactions using a Langevin dipole approach to
calculate protein-surface preferential interaction coefficients (PICs), and (4)
predict chromatographic performance for complex mixtures by coupling QSRR
correlations and/or PIC theory for protein-media interactions with a
macroscopic/engineering description of chromatographic
operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative effort among
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and
the University of Virginia with expertise in biochemical engineering, applied
biophysics, chromatographic separations, and thermodynamic modeling and
computational chemistry. This collaboration, with the proposed regular program
of team colloquia, laboratory rotations and industrial internships, is expected
to provide a rich research and educational environment for the students and
faculty alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
