9552559 McCreedy The Franklin Institute and the Girl Scouts of the USA will
develop, implement, and evaluate "Girls at the Center," a family outreach
program that will foster girl-centered, learning within the context of the
family. Partnerships will be promoted between local science and technology
centers and Girl Scout Councils. It is a multi- component program that will
increase girls' and their families' understanding of and interest in basic
science principles and processes. Consisting of a series of family-oriented
activities that coincide with the school year, science/technology centers will
serve as the hosts. These museum-based activities will be supplemented by home-
based activities. The activities will follow the constructivist theory of
education and will cover a broad menu of scientific disciplines including
ecology, energy, and human physiology as well as science careers opportunities.
They will be linked to the requirements for the Girl Scout recognition (badges)
program. It is building on the success of a previously NSF funded project
"National Science Partnerships for Girls Scout Councils and Museum" and is
expected to reach 75,050 girls and 112,575 adults in 25 sites across the US
during the funding period. It will be institutionalized and will continue to
operate in those sites as well as expand to other sites after the NSF-funded
period.
