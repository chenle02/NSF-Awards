This research carries out field measurements of soil properties, develops
constitutive modeling of the soils, and extends numerical analysis of soil
structure interaction for site characterization and design of foundation such as
retaining walls, embankments, and sheet pile walls. The study will establish the
validity of the modeling and the numerical analyses methods by conducting field
measurements before, during, and following a large construction activity. This
research program, therefore, provides an opportunity to evaluate the adequacy of
current design procedures in field conditions.
