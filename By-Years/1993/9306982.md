In collaboration with experimental gravity wave research groups at Stanford
University, Louisiana State University and the University of Maryland, Prof.
Wellstood will design, construct and test sensitive dc Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device (SQUID) measuring systems which are specifically configured
for use in ultralow temperature Weber-bar gravity wave antennas. At a measuring
frequency of 1 kHz and a temperature of 50 mK, the SQUID systems will achieve an
energy sensitivity of 100 h/2 within 2 years and 10 h/2 within 3 years. To
ensure testing of the systems under realistic conditions, the performance of the
SQUIDs will be measured on superconducting resonant motion transducers as well
as in conventional well-shielded cryogenic probes. At the end of the two test
periods, a working SQUID measuring system with the appropriate sensitivity will
be delivered for incorporation into an antenna which is cooled to 50 mK. By
using a high performance SQUID measuring system on an ultralow temperature
antenna, the sensitivity of the antenna to gravitational radiation will be
greatly improved, and there will be a much better possibility of actually
detecting gravitational radiation for the first time.
