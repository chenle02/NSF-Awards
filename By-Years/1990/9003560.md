This project addresses lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake. In most natural disasters, there is significant direct
impact on human populations: specifically injuries and death result from the
hazard itself, or as a result of the particular hazard's effect on the
infrastructure. While advances in engineering have certainly lessened this
impact over the past several decades, there are still many unanswered questions
as to the precise cause and severity of injuries occurring during natural
disasters. By applying techniques developed in the relatively new field of
earthquake injury epidemiology, the research described in this proposal will
enable a detailed epidemiologic study to be made of the injuries resulting from
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the County of Santa Cruz. Preliminary quick-
response field reconnaissance - already performed - coupled with comprehensive
follow-up data collection and interviews will enable a detailed accounting of
all the injuries in the County resulting from the earthquake. This information
will be of significant use for earthquake preparedness and hazard mitigation
activities. In addition, collection of the data will enable the testing of the
research methodology for application in future events.
