9311268 Campbell Genetic variation of Isotria medeoloides a rare and endangered
species of North American orchid, is unknown. The investigators propose to use
Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), which permits minimally destructive
sampling of the plants, to explore the population structure of this species. To
test a possible link between rarity and genetic variability, they will contrast
percent variable (polymorphic) loci between six populations of this rare orchid
with that of six populations of the only other species in the genus. To see
whether population size affects genetic variation, three large and three small
populations for both species will be compared. %%% Knowledge of the population
genetics of this species would better enable managers of this Federally
Endangered orchid to meet longterm recovery goals, ascertain relative importance
of the populations, define a minimum viable population size, and measure changes
in total diversity over time.
