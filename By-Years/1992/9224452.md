This project will provide support for shipboard scientific support equipment for
the research vessels ATLANTIS II, KNORR and OCEANUS, operated by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science
research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for
ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing similar activities. This project will
allow the institution to install a gantry crane, three hanger doors and a hoist
on the KNORR, upgrade navigation and communications on the KNORR, replace deck
lights and improve satellite communications on the OCEANUS, upgrade computers
and Fax capabilities on the ATLANTIS II and KNORR and install a barograph on the
KNORR.
