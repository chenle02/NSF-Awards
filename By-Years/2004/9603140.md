This award supports a planning visit by Drs. Bennett and Rhie, from Livermore,
California, to travel to South Africa for the purpose of examining the telescope
at the Boyden Observatory (owned by the University of the Orange Free State) to
assess its suitability for inclusion in a project to search for extra-solar
planets using a global microlensing follow-up network of optical telescopes
located in the Southern Hemisphere. Future collaborative research opportunities
will also be discussed. The principal investigators will meet with Dr. Peter
Martinez, Department of Astronomy and Institute of Theoretical Physics and
Astrophysics at the University of Cape Town, Dr. Robert Stobie, the Director of
the South African Astronomical Observatory, and with members of the University
of the Orange Free State.
