A separator of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal breaks the graph into
small pieces. A cycle separator is a simple cycle whose vertices form a
separator. Finding separators is an essential part of divide-and-conquer
strategies for many graph-theoretic applications. The PI has recently discovered
that, surprisingly, every graph has a cycle separator and such a cycle separator
can be efficiently computed by depth-first search in sequential and parallel
computations. Consequently, depth-first search now assumes a new role as a
divide- and-conquer tool. This linkage between cycle separators and depth- first
search has never been available before, and promises to bring about
unconventional applications of depth-first search. This project is intended to
explore new possibilities opened up by the search- separator linkage.
