9418042 Agnew This award provides modest funding for the acquisition of four
portable radios needed for communications in remote field locations. The radios
will be used by researchers from the Pinyon Flat Observatory of the University
of California at San Diego who are involved in field projects measuring crustal
deformation using the Global Positioning System (GPS) for accurate geodetic
determinations of regional strain in connection with earthquake and tectonics
research. The field operations often leave individual workers with equipment at
isolated and remote sites for significant periods of time. The radios are
necessary for technical communications among workers at several such sights as
well as for safety considerations. ***
