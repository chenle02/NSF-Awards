The University of Arizona joins Arizona State University in the multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center named Connection One:
Telecommunication Circuits and Systems. This center has the potential to have a
significant impact on the broader telecommunication industry, which has become
an essential element of the national economy. Because of the increasingly
multidisciplinary nature of telecommunication research projects, an integrated
research effort that brings together researchers from a number of technical
areas is essential for achieving significant technological advances. Connection
One provides a collaborative environment that will facilitate this research
effort.
