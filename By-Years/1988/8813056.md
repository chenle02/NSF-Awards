This project focuses on AMS radiocarbon measurements to determine the ages of
foraminifera shells from deep sea sediments cores. The objectives of the study
are: (1) to determine how the radiocarbon age of deep water in the tropical
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has changed over the last 20,000 years, and (2) to
establish a detailed chronology for the abrupt climatic transitions associated
with the last glaciation. The project is a cooperative effort between American
and Swiss scientist. This work is important because it would provide a
fundamental record of rapid climatic events that occurred near the end of last
glaciation and will enhance our understanding of the response of the climate
system to internal readjustments that affect deep ocean water production.
