Dally This research focuses on the evaluation of the prototype MDP components,
the assembly of a single-board (64-processor) J- Machine system, the revision of
the MDP component design as required, and the assembly of a 16-board
(1024-processor) J- Machine system. The Concurrent Smalltalk and the Concurrent
Aggregates programming systems are being installed on the J- Machine and some
small applications are being demonstrated.
