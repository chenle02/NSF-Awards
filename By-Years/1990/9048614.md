In a workshop held in Budapest and organized by Dr. William Rutter of the
University of California-San Francisco and Dr. Laslo Graf of Eotvos Lorand
University, U.S. and Hungarian biochemists will discuss results of their joint
research on serine proteases. In particular, their discussions will address
functional interactions of catalytic residues and related issues of enzyme
catalysis. This supplement will ensure aequate representation of junior U.S.
scientists in the meetings with the intention of encouraging new international
research partnerships.
