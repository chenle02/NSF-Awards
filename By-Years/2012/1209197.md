The goal of the University of Virginia ADVANCE Program is to increase the number
of women, including African American, Latina and Asian American women, in the
STEM disciplines and to create an empowered collaborative, participatory form of
community that draws on the collective capacity of women faculty, their male
colleagues and administrative leadership allies to identify and ameliorate the
structural and cultural barriers to women's full participation in academic STEM
careers. Through several clearly defined initiatives that include semester-long
facilitated dialogue processes to improve departmental climate, re-imagined
spaces, a focus on the intellectual and life history of senior and retired women
to amplify women's presence, an interactive search and selection portal, an
innovation tournament to tap the power of diversity and divergent thinking, and
an Advance Enhancement fund to support STEM women's research and scholarship,
the University of Virginia will engage both women and men faculty in open and
authentic dialogue about a shared and inclusive future for the institution.
Drawing on a complex, diversity systems theory of change as adaptive, this
transformation initiative will lead to seminal social science results and
promote interventions to render institutional physical environments more
welcoming for diverse groups.
