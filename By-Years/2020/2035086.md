This award will contribute to the Nation's health and welfare by developing new
mathematical and computational tools to inform the design of volunteer schemes
for out-of-hospital health emergencies such as cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest
occurs when a patientâ€™s heart enters an atypical rhythm. Death follows rapidly
unless the patient receives medical attention. Lives can be saved if the patient
receives cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quickly. Recently, volunteer
schemes have arisen whereby volunteers install an app on their smartphone that
tracks their location. Volunteers near a cardiac arrest are notified by the app
and can choose to respond, thereby saving valuable minutes in the response time
to initiate CPR. Volunteer schemes are emerging worldwide, but key questions
relating to their design remain unanswered. For example, how many volunteers are
needed to ensure impact on survival rates, and when one can potentially recruit
volunteers of multiple types, which should be prioritized? This project develops
research methods to answer these questions and others. Related research
directions address the potential impact of broadband connections that enable a
remote paramedic or doctor to advise on-scene treatment by a paramedic or
ambulance officer, and how to prioritize dispatch decisions in periods when
emergency services are severely loaded and/or traffic is
congested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award develops mathematical and
computational tools to inform the design of volunteer schemes. Central
principles include the integrated use of spatial Poisson point processes to
model volunteer locations with convex optimization to solve problems relating to
the distribution of volunteer capacity across a city to maximize patient
survival. The related question of ambulance dispatch when ambulances are
severely loaded is addressed through use of approximate dynamic programming,
exploiting deep neural networks to approximate both the value function and the
choice of policy. Simulation optimization will underlie some aspects of this
work. In that context, the use of biased gradient estimators in search will be
explored. Most methods for gradient estimation in simulation optimization result
in biased estimators which are viewed in practice as unsatisfactory. This
project will explore their potential efficacy; they have been seen to be of
great value in some examples and the research will explore their potential more
broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
