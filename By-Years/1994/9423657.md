This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from Stanford University. The project is to analyze records from the Carlisle
Indian Industrial school, one of the first non-reservation boarding schools for
American Indians which operated in rural Pennsylvania from 1879 to 1918. The
project will focus on the lived experience of pupils, as revealed through school
records and interviews with descendants of school alumni in three regions of the
country: S. Dakota, New Mexico/Arizona, and New York. The project will examine
how cohorts of students changed as the social conditions of the home communities
changed over time. This research is important because it will provide a more
complete picture of an institution through which the state shaped Indian
identity. The information the study will generate can be used in a variety of
educationally oriented materials showing the development of Indian identity with
respect to the state. In the contemporary world the demise of the USSR has been
associated with ethnic violence against a controlling state (i.e., Russia
against the Chechens in 1994-95). Advances in our understanding of how ethnic
identities are formed in response to state policies can help policy makers avoid
mistakes in dealing with ethnic minorities.
