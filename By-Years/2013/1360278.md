Over the last decade, plasma researchers have observed the surprising result
that when a plasma expands along a weakening magnetic field, beams of high speed
ions shooting out along the magnetic field spontaneously appear. Expanding
plasmas are common in nature, such as the atmosphere of the Sun, and in 21st
century technology, such as in some rocket engines and industrial systems. This
project explores the stability and the detailed structure of the ion
acceleration process in hopes of developing a better understanding of the most
important processes responsible for the ion
acceleration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will measure the stability
thresholds for spontaneously forming double layers (sheaths) in expanding single
and multiple ion species plasmas; the effects of neutral density in the double
layer region on double layer structure and stability; and the spatial structure
and plasma parameter dependence of the electric fields in the expansion region
that result in the formation of multiple ion beams. Integrated with these
investigations is the application of new diagnostic tools for the measurement of
densities and flows of ions and neutrals in low temperature plasmas. The
formation and stability of double layers in single-ion and multi-ion plasmas is
a fundamental plasma physics question with important ramifications for systems
ranging from space plasmas to plasma thrusters. Beyond the scientific
contributions that this research will make to our understanding of double layer
formation and stability, the broader impact of the work involves the training of
graduate students in a research environment that emphasizes the synergy between
basic and applied plasma physics; improvement of the percentage of women and
minorities obtaining advanced degrees in physics; attracting high quality
undergraduates into physics through involvement in cutting-edge research
activities; and support of a STEM education initiative that extends to over half
the counties in West Virginia and that is continuing to expand.
