Researchers have developed large-scale Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAA)
that enable products requiring ultra-low-power computation and computing within
a programmable and configurable framework. This project plans to use the FPAA
ICs to demonstrate core signal processing functionality for widespread use and
begin the process of iterating and getting feedback regarding performance, power
levels and features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact from the FPAA ICs
could empower a range of electronic devices and require a factor of 1000 times
less power consumption than current digital approaches. This approach could
enable a wide-spread change in low-power electronics. An additional impact from
this technology will create an ecosystem for additional technological growth, in
a range of applications spaces, empowered by programmable and configurable
analog ICs eliminating the need for highly costly process of custom analog IC
design, fabrication, and testing. This approach enables a range of new
approaches to be realized, many applications not even envisioned.
