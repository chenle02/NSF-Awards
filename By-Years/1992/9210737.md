The project deals with a topic of great importance in many industrial
separation and purification operations, i.e., the transport of materials across
surfactant-laden interfaces separating two macroscopic fluid phases. At the
colloidal level, an understanding of the dynamic processes in microemulsions
systems as affected by the interfacial structure of the surfactant layer can
lead to better mechanistic descriptions of such diverse phenomena as e.g., phase
transitions, emulsion stability, transport in cells and membrane mimetic media,
and biocatalysis in reversed micellar systems. To better understand the factors
influencing these and other interfacial transport processes, the PIs plan to (i)
investigate the role of compressible and incompressible surfactant layers in
retarding the transport of solutes across interfaces separating two bulk phase,
(ii) examine the kinetics of formation and coalescence of reversed micelles at
such interfaces, and (iii) study experimentally the rate of association of probe
molecules with their transport through, highly curved surfactant interfaces in
water-in-oil microemulsion, (iv) develop a theoretical model for the interaction
of solute molecules with the surfactant interface, and of the formation and
destruction rates of micelles at the interface. The thermal and structural
relaxation behavior of microemulsion systems will also be addressed. To these
ends, the PIs will employ two complementary experimental techniques. A unique
diffusion cell has been designed which enables the introduction of a step change
in concentration of the transferring solute very close to the interface without
causing any disturbance of the interface itself. The Iodine Laser Temperature
Jump (ILTJ) method, a relaxation technique, will be used to identify and
quantify the interfacial diffusion time scales characteristic of the
microemulsion systems.
