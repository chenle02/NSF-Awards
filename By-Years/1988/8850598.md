A conference to stimulate science and mathematics faculty at outstanding
liberal arts colleges to become actively involved in the scientific preparation
of teachers by redesigning science and mathematics courses will be planned and
convened by the Consortium for Excellence in Teacher Education (CETE) and
Middlebury College, the home institution of the director of CETE. Membership in
CETE is comprised of the following institutions: Brandeis University, Brown
University, Connecticut College, Dartsmouth College, Harvard University,
Middlebury College, Mount Holyoke College, Princeton University, Smith College,
Swarthmore College, University of Pennsylvania, Vassar College, Wellesley
College, Wesleyan University and Yale University. The conference will seek to
produce collaboration among scientists, mathematicians, and educators in
modernizing course content, incorporating recent educational research results,
and in the case of science courses, providing hands-on experiences at CETE and
31 other liberal arts institutions located in the eastern half of the United
States. Participants will also examine other components of teacher preparation
programs and define the role that liberal arts institutions have in preparing
mathematics and science teachers. A major report: Undergraduate Teacher
Education and the Liberal Arts: Creating Models of Excellence will be published
as a result of the conference. The conference should result in strengthening and
deepening science and mathematics education at liberal arts colleges. Cost
sharing by CETE and Middlebury College is 12.6%
