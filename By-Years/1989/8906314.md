The purpose of this fundamental bioengineering research is to determine the
means for providing three-dimensional images of single, living cells. The PI
will conduct a research program of experimental and theoretical investigations
designed to reconstruct the cellular anatomical three dimensional image. Such
studies should illuminate anatomical and physiological processes in real time.
Information from such studies could have a significant influence upon the
investigation of cellular physiological processes.
