9705996 Carter The PIs propose to hold an American Geophysical Union Chapman
Conference on Microgal Gravimetry in St. Augustine, Florida, from March 3-6,
1997. Dr. W. Carter, Dr. Glenn Sasagawa and Dr. B. Richter are Co-convenors. The
conference is being held to bring together experts in the development and
operation of gravimeters with documented resolution and stability of 1 microgal
level or better with researchers, scientists and students that make use of
microgal gravity observations. Areas of application include marine tectonics,
mantle heology, volcanology, hydrology, civil engineering and a number of other
fields. The scope of the conference will cover existing instrument design and
performance assessment, reports on current observing programs and the
interpretation of early results, as well as future directions and applications
of the field. ***
