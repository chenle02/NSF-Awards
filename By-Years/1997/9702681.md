9702681 Many practical problems such as compile-time analysis of programs,
verification of concurrent systems, planning by intelligent agents, and
diagnosis of physical systems have in common the fact that they can be easily
specified using logic. However, attempts to execute such specifications using
traditional logic programming techniques usually do not terminate, and are thus
impractical. This project seeks to create a logic programming system which can
solve such problems and draws on recent research in tabled and constraint logic
programming. Tabled logic programming, particularly the XSB system, terminates
for large classes of programs, and permits reasoning in the presence of
inconsistent information through its semantics for default negation. Constraint
logic programming allows problems in theories such as the real numbers to be
expressed declaratively and solved automatically. The project will create a
unified computational basis for the two paradigms using XSB as a starting point.
For certain problems in the verification of concurrent systems and in program
analysis, large programs based on C already have been replaced with a few
hundred XSB rules with no loss in efficiency. The project will increase the
number of such problems for which a logic-based specification leads to an
efficient, practical system. ***
