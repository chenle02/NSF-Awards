Through a biography of Harland Goff Wood this project will examine the forces
that shaped the development of biochemistry in the United States. Wood's career
reflects the intellectual history of U.S. biochemistry, from his early research
(with Chester Werkman) that identified and elucidated the process of carbon
dioxide fixation, through later studies of the enzymes involved in that
metabolic process, to his last work on the structure and sequence of genes that
code for those proteins. Wood also built a strong training program in
biochemistry at Case Western Reserve University Medical School, and through his
mentorship conveyed to students both the craft of science and its ethos.
Finally, Wood involved himself in the public issues of the day, through service
to professional societies, journals, and the nation (as a Presidential Science
Advisor).
