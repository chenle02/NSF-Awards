Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
at the University of California at San Diego to acquire a high-field NMR
spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include: 1) Molecular mechanisms of biological oxygen transport and
utilization 2) Dynamics of metalloenzyme reactions 3) Synthesis of biologically
active compounds 4) Proton transfer reactions in chemical and biological systems
5) Catalytic hydrolysis of phosphate diesters and oligonucleotides 6) Chemical
defense in marine organisms 7) Natural products chemistry of marine molluscs.
