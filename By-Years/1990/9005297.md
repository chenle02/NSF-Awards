This award provides one-half the funds required for the acquisition of a gas-
source isotope ratio mass spectrometer to be installed and operated by the
Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie
Institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed. Recent
improvements in the design of gas-source, isotope ratio mass spectrometers have
greatly expanded the application of stable isotope geochemistry to research in
the evolution of life and inorganic geochemical processes. This instrument will
be used in a number of research projects including studies of mass transfer
processes in the Earth's crust and upper mantle and isotopic fractionation in
biochemical metabolic reactions.
