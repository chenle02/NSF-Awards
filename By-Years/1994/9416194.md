9416194 Nicholson This study will acquire deep crustal seismic data, originally
obtained using dynamite in the 1940's and 1950's, from the Ventura Basin, San
Fernando Valley, and Los Angeles Basin. Modern deep crustal seismic data across
these areas would be almost impossible to collect today due to prohibitive costs
and local governmental regulations. The existing seismic data set, once
acquired, will be stored at the Southern California Earthquake Center. The data
will be analyzed and interpreted using well data and seismicity to help resolve
the seismic behavior, subsurface geometry, and seismic potentia of active faults
in the Ventura Basin and San Fernando Valley. The data will be integrated into a
three-dimensional image of subsurface basin geometry and fault structure, and
then compared with existing two-dimensional models from balanced,
retrodeformable cross-sections. The results will help provide a basis for
understanding the geometry, tectonic development and seismic hazard potential
along strike of major fold and faults systems in the Ventura Basin and San
Fernando Valley areas.
