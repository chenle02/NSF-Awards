9711957 Filippelli This project will determine the accumulation rate of P in
sediments from a variety of continental margins over glacial/interglacial time
scales. Sites will include those dominated by terrigenous versus marine
accumulation, and both open and restricted marine settings. The goal is to
determine whether there are consistent patterns in P accumulation, and assess
the role of continental margins in the global oceanic P budget. ***
