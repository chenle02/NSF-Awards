The devastating tsunami waves of March 11, 2011, along the northeastern coast of
Japan caused severe damages to coastal communities. The unusual, very high-
energy conditions achieved by the March 11, 2011, Tohuku Tsunami afford a unique
opportunity to greatly advance our understanding of the geological effects of
tsunamis in coastal areas. While much of the immediate post-tsunami research is
focused on damage assessment, this particular project aims to understand the
dynamics of tsunami waves and their impacts on natural landscapes. Prompt access
to the field areas is crucial for this effort in order to obtain evidence of the
tsunami wave effects. Current disaster response reconstruction efforts are
quickly erasing the traces of the event in developed areas. Natural, undeveloped
areas of interest in this project will also quickly lose evidence of high-water
indicators and subtle sediment layers because of rainstorms, human disturbance,
and other post-tsunami processes. This project will integrate numerical modeling
with field measurements and remote sensing. A large group of collaborating
Japanese scientists, unfunded by this project, will facilitate the operations in
the field areas, and the quantitative modeling efforts by the U.S. team will be
supplemented by collaborator from Finland, who will be funded by his own sources
independent of the project funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results obtained from
this study will contribute to tsunami hazard assessment by greatly advancing the
scientific capability to recognize and understand the effects of high-energy
tsunami waves that may be preserved as geological evidence of ancient tsunamis
on potentially hazardous coastlines around the world. This new understanding
will prove particularly relevant to hazardous coastlines in the western U.S. In
particular, the potential earthquake zone off coastal Washington and Oregon has
many similarities to northeastern Japan in regard to tsunami hazards. Tsunami-
vulnerable areas also occur in California, Alaska and Hawaii.
