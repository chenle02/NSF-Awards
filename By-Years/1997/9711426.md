In this RUI project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Spiegel will utilize amplitude-calibrated forced
Rayleigh scattering (AC-FRS) to investigate small-molecule diffusion in polymer
solutions. This method will be used to measure photoproduct and ground-state
probe diffusion in order to develop in-situ optical control of molecular
diffusion through polymer solutions and solids, including nonlinear-optical
polymer waveguides. Initial experiments will examine photoinduced changes in the
diffusion coefficients of azobenzenes and spiropyrans within polar-pendant group
polymers. The diffusion of uncharged molecules across microscopic lengths
through complex solutions such as polymers is a commonly occurring process in
chemistry, chemical engineering, and biology. Nonetheless, there are many
fundamental physical issues which have not been addressed. This project will
look at some of the interactions which are important in understanding how to use
light to control the rates of diffusion of neutral particles in polymer solids
and solutions. This type of phenomenon has implications for high-speed nonlinear
fiber optics technology.
