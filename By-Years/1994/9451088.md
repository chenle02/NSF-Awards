9451088 Pletsch It is no secret American students generally avoid mathematics
courses. This is particularly true of minority students, half of the T-VI
student population. It is these very skills, however, which can allow Native
American, Hispanic, and White students to better positions. Albuquerque T-VI's
mathematics faculty is in the process of reforming its mathematics curriculum to
meet the needs of the future work force and to make it more relevant, hands-on,
and interdisciplinary. The computer classrooms on the two largest campuses of
TVI are dedicated to the modernization of the mathematics curriculum with the
focus on intermediate and college algebra. While according an appropriate place

numerical: the representation of mathematical concepts by data sets, (b) the
graphical: the pictorial illustration of mathematical concepts, and (c) the
descriptive: the verbal and written presentation of concepts computer literacy.
