This research program is directed toward the characterization of non-idealities
in various types of integrated circuit capacitors for the applications in high
precision switched capacitor circuits. A simple integrated circuit containing
only three capacitors and external control circuitry precisely measures such
non-idealities as the ratio mismatch between capacitor values, voltage
coefficient, and charge-voltage hysteresia. Test-integrated circuits with
various types of capacitors available in NMOS and CMOS processes will be
fabricated and non-idealities will be measured. Figure of merit for each
capacitor type will be determined based upon the measurement for high precision
integrated circuits. Circuit techniques to reduce the effect of non-idealities
will also be studied.
