"Exhumation Processes: normal faulting, Ductile flow, and Erosion" to be held in
Crete, October 9-12, 1996. The conference will examine the timely subject of how
exhumation processes operate to bring deep-seated rocks to the surface. Results
are expected to review this subject and synthesize present knowledge in order to
