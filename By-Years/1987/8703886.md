The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student populations. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. Southern University will use
RIMI support to study viscous laminar flows in helicoidal pipes. The helicoidal
pipe is the first basic extension of a curved pipe. Researchers will investigate
the temperature field in a helicoidal pipe that is maintained under a uniform
wall heat flux condition. Data collected under these conditions may be used in
designing more efficient heat exchangers that require coil type heat exchange
elements. The heat transfer problems will be addressed theoretically and
experimentally. The principal investigator is a prolific contributor to refereed
journals in the area of convective heat transfer for laminar flows in multi-
passage circular pipes. The Foundation has supported this project because the
participation of minorities in meritorious heat flow research will be enhanced.
