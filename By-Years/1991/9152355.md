The functioning of important compounds from drugs to enzymes to retinal
pigments is related to their structure, geometry, and stereochemistry. The two-
semester organic chemistry laboratory will be revised by focusing on the theme
of isomerism, because students frequently have difficulty learning these
structural concepts in the abstract and appreciating their importance. Several
experiments will be implemented in a problem-solving format that will involve
students in learning about optical isomers and chirality, structural and
geometric isomers, and tautomers. The instruments needed for these new
experiments and to improve existing experiments include an FTIR
spectrophotometer and a polarimeter. The grantee will match the NSF award from
non-Federal sources.
