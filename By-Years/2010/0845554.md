The Principal Investigator will provide travel support for U.S. students and
British scientists to participate in a conference on universal heliophysical
processes, to be held in October 2008 as an activity under the auspices of the
International Heliophysical Year.

The conference program will be organized around five categories of universal
plasma processes that are rigorously outlined in a report by the National
Research Council, entitled "Plasma Physics of the Local Cosmos." The program
will feature extended discussions led by invited moderators following a limited
number of invited papers. This project has been approved as a Chapman Conference
by the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and AGU staff will handle all meeting
arrangements, registration, and advertising.

Enabling the attendance of key conference participants will facilitate the
presentation of a comprehensive program on a topic that lies at the forefront of
research in space physics. This project will help develop strategies for
studying universal plasma processes and enhance students' careers.
