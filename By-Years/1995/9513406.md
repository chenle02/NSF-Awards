The allocation of water is a complex system, involving externalities, public
goods, and shared production facilities. Such complex systems have employed
central authorities to solve coordination problems and dictate solutions to the
allocation problems. In a world of rapid technological and environmental change,
government solutions may move too slowly to allow a society to adapt
efficiently. Smart, computer-assisted markets provide the promise of developing
flexible decentralized solutions to complex problems. Smart markets allow
private market allocations to instantaneously account for coordination problems.
They also can incorporate environmental or distributional constraints; thus,
individual decision makers can respond to a changing environment, allowing
society as a whole to adapt rapidly. This research develops, tests, and
implements a generic smart market for water allocation which will be initialized
for application in California. The research provides an empirical testbed for a
smart market for water allocation in any arid land: other applications will
simply involve a different network configuration and supply sources whose
parameters can be used to initialize the appropriate nodal trading system.
