*** 9732621 Hyde The proposed project continues a summer undergraduate research
program already in place for the past four summers at Baylor and currently
supported by both Baylor and the National Science Foundation. Seven students
will be selected from open applications with the program advertised at
universities around the nation, smaller undergraduate institutions with little
or no research capability and historically minority institutions. Complete
application information, departmental research information as well as the
ability to apply to the program "on-line" is provided through a World Wide Web
page located at www.baylor.edu/~Truell_Hyde/Scripts/URC.html. allows
identification and recruitment of outstanding students from small, private
institutions in the Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Kansas areas. The
NSF Fellows will interact during the summer with Baylor undergraduate and
graduate students from both the United States and several foreign countries.
They will participate in twice weekly seminars, social activities, an end of the
summer Undergraduate Research Symposium and specially designed classes in
various physics research fields of interest. As in the past, it is expected that
at least some of the summer research done by the NSF Fellows will result in peer
reviewed publications. Trips to nearby industries and research facilities,
social activities as well as joint research seminars will be offered (as in the
past) in cooperation with other REU activities that will be held on the same
campus. This provides for a much larger number of NSF Summer Fellows with which
to interact during the ten week period and aids in producing a "large" program
feel. ***
