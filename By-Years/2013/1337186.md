The project develops evaluation tools around the concept of "science activation"
a construct that includes: fascination with science, valuing science, perceived
autonomy, competency belief, and engagement in scientific sensemaking. This
enables evaluation of a broader range of outcomes beyond achievement test
scores. The project will build on research activities and turn those findings
into measures, surveys, and protocols that can be used in both formal and
informal settings with 11-15-year old youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
instruments and toolkit developed through the project will help other
organizations to collect, analyze and interpret similar data.
