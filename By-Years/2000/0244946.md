This project involves measurements of collisions between polarized protons at
the&lt;br/&gt; Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The measurement of
scattering cross sections, with the&lt;br/&gt;dependence upon initial state spin
orientation, yields insight into the spin configurations of the&lt;br/&gt;quarks
and gluons that make up the proton.&lt;br/&gt;The immediate goal for this
project will be measurement of the dependence of forward neutral
pion&lt;br/&gt;production on the transverse components of the initial state
proton spins. Toward this goal,&lt;br/&gt;calorimetry is to be installed in the
very forward directions of the STAR detector. This set of&lt;br/&gt;measurements
is expected to produce the largest spin dependence in proton-proton collisions
at&lt;br/&gt;RHIC and is naturally our first objective as the new polarized
facility comes on- line. Recent&lt;br/&gt;theoretical progress has increased the
importance of this kinematic region. Complete&lt;br/&gt;measurements in STAR,
with both longitudinally and transversely polarized proton beams and
with&lt;br/&gt;calorimetry and tracking covering a wide range of scattering
angles, have the potential to&lt;br/&gt;characterize the quark and gluon spin
structure of the proton.
