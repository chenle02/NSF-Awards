This proposal is part of an integrated scientific program to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice on a transect between
Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska. It will measure variations in temperature and
salinity through Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) survey, and otherwise
investigate density structure and the water column dynamics, using Expendable
Current Profiler (XCP) measurements. This proposal will obtain fundamental
information that has never before been available as well as provide
indispensable collaborative information for a larger biological component of the
science program. Two Polar Ocean Profiling buoys will be deployed during the
ships transit that will make an existing network of autonomous buoys complete
and that will eventually allow calculation of the Arctic Ocean water mass volume
and its seasonal and interannual variations.
