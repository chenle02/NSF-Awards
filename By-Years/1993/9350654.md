The proposed project will provide studentswith "hands-on" experience with
distributed operating systems in a realistic environment. The students in the
Operating Systems and related courses will be able to experiment with the
hardware and software aspects of a distributed operating system. This will lead
to a better understanding of the basic concepts e.g. fault tolerance, load
balancing, incremental growth, computational speedup and transparency which are
not available in a traditional centralized operating system environment. To this
end, it is planned to use Minix 1.5 (a UNIX look alike), an open, unprotected
operating system with a networking kernel. The requested equipment comprises ten
486DX workstations connected via ethernet, each running the Minix 1.5 networking
kernel. The machines in the existing operating systems laboratory (obtained
through NSF/ILI grant USE: 8851239, with PC/XTs) will also be connected via
ethernet to the new machines.
