The proposed project is to examine the effects that partially penetrating wells
and ellipsoidal inhomogeneities have on the three-dimensional capture zone. The
results of this project will help determine whether modeled pump-out systems are
actually performing as predicted, for certain cases. Preliminary recommendations
on improvement of pump-out system design could come out of this work. The most
important issues to be explored are: 1) the importance to model wells as
partially penetrating; 2) the relationship between the depth and width of the
three-dimensional capture zone and the discharge rate of the partially
penetrating well; 3) the effect that ellipsoidal inhomogeneities have on the
width and depth of the capture zone of a partially penetrating well, as compared
to the homogeneous aquifer. This work will be done for the purpose of developing
more realistic and useful modeling techniques for use in pump-out system design.
Development of engineering heuristics and tools will be the final outcome.
