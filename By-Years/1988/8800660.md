Several questions in two broad observational areas will be addressed: (1) the
intrinsic line and continuum properties of QSOs, and (2) the physical properties
of the QSO absorption line systems which arise in intervening material. The goal
of the work in the first area is to gain a better understanding of the continuum
energy production processes in QSOs, through observation of the spectral energy
distributions of a large number of objects from the X-ray to the far IR, and
modeling of the accretion disk and nonthermal components. Further clues to the
nature of the continuum production regions are given by monitoring the
variability of mildly variable objects, to see which spectral components vary
together, and which vary separately. The goal of the work in the second area is
to understand the physical conditions and origins of the clouds which give rise
to the QSO absorption lines, by obtaining very high resolution spectra of high
redshift QSOs. The types of systems to be studied include the Lyman or forest
lines, which may arise in primordial or protogalactic gas clouds, the metal line
systems which probably arise in the halos or disks of galaxies, and the very
thick damped Lyman or systems, which probably arise in galaxy disks. Interactive
activities include teaching a special topics course in astronomy, giving guest
lectures in introductory astronomy courses, participating in the University
honors program, joining the colloquium committee to bring women speakers to the
University, and giving public lectures at the University planetarium. This
project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities
for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of
science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science
and engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and
engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By
encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment
in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
