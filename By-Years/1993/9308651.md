9308651 Barmak This project examines grain structure and grain boundary
diffusion in thin film niobium aluminide polycrystalline films of different
thicknesses and microstructures. The kinetics of Nb3Al formation are studied
with calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy. A model for the Nb3Al
formation will be modified based on the measurements of shape, growth rate, and
nucleation density. Nucleation sites will be linked to microstructural features
of the reactant layers. Direct measurements of the composition of Nb3-xAl phase
will be made by analytical electron microscopy. An increase in the Al
concentration of the Nb3-xAl phase with an increase in the total boundary area
of the Nb3Al layer should provide direct evidence for the role of grain boundary
diffusion in the reaction. %%% This research has relevance to thin film devices
used in the microelectronic and magnetic thin film industries. ***
