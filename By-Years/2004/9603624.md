In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Gullion will develop a high-resolution magic-angle spinning
NMR technique which allows measurement of internuclear distances between dipolar
and quadrupolar nuclei. Specifically tailored pulse trains synchronized with the
sample rotation will recouple the dipolar interactions between the desired spin
pairs, providing structural information of complex solids in a straightforward
manner. The first applications will be to the interactions between bound water
and cellulose as well as to a polymer blend of cellulose with polyacrylonitrile.
These experiments will fill a void in MAS NMR distance-measuring techniques.
Solid-state NMR techniques similar to those being developed in this work have
been applied to a number of interesting chemical systems, including biological
solids, zeolites, and polymers. As such, they demonstrate the importance and
wide applicability of these structural techniques to such diverse areas as
materials science, structural biology, and the study of catalytic systems.
