This research program concerns the development of new mathematical algorithms
for identifying critical information in data sets that has the potential to
reveal biological or chemical threats to humans. The starting point for this
work is the observation that modeling a threat over variations in its appearance
serves as the foundation of robust detection algorithms. Mathematical tools from
geometry and topology enable the design of algorithms for extracting information
from sets of data that enhance traditional processing methods, leading to
smarter sensors. The graduate students trained in this program will earn
doctorates in mathematics while the undergraduates will have the opportunity to
be mentored on topics of national interest early in their careers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the development of mathematical
modeling algorithms for data on abstract manifolds. In contrast to data clouds
captured by sensors generating points that exist as a configuration in Euclidean
space, this project encodes data as points on matrix manifolds. The mathematical
framework requires only three features: the geometric context, the notion of
distance between two points, and the ability to compute the perturbation of one
point in the direction of another. Additionally, one can exploit information
related to the statistics of points on matrix manifolds. This research program
aims to explore the geometry of these spaces for the purposes of anomaly
detection and characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
