This project supports the Electronic Instrumentation course of the Scientific
Instrumentation Option program available to physics majors. The course consists
of one lecture and six hours of laboratory per week. The revised course focuses
on data acquisition and manipulation. The intent of this course is to produce a
senior or graduate-level student who can walk into almost any science
laboratory, determine the sensor and microcomputer needs for the laboratory,
connect the various sensors and cards to the computer, write simple software to
perform the data acquisition task, and then analyze the resulting data
knowledgeably to minimize the effects of noise or transducer nonlinearities.
This course is taught concurrently with a semester lecture course on Fourier
transforms, Laplace transforms, Z transforms, and their applications. This
project specifically funds the purchase of equipment for the laboratory in
support of this course revision: 10 IBM-compatible PC workstations with I/O
cards, Ethernet Linkage, and a large variety of sensors.
