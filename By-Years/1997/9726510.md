ABSTRACT OPP-9726510 OPP-9726417 OGILVIE, ASTRID ROGERS, JEFFREY UNIVERSITY
OFCOLORADO OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY The project will examine the relationship
between changing climatic conditions in the vicinity of Iceland and the
abundance of Atlantic cod for the past 1000 years. The combination of climate
and fisheries records will be used to determine possible impacts of climate-
induced changes in cod fisheries on human populations. Of particular importance
will be an examination of the societal response to climate change and fisheries
abundance during two of the most dramatic climate events to occur in the North
Atlantic region during recorded history, the "Little Ice Age" and the "Medieval
Warm Period". The research will involve an interdisciplinary approach in which
physical, climate, historical, and sociological evidence is gathered to examine
effects of significant changes in the environment on human populations that
depend on resources controlled in part by climate-driven systems. Therefore, the
project will make a significant contribution to the determination of the human
dimensions of global change in the North Atlantic during two periods of
significant climate fluctuations.
