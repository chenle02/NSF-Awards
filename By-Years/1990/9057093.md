This PYI grant will extend previous studies of coupled modulational
instabilities and non-linear focusing of collinear waves to media with relaxing
nonlinearities and to media which are Brillouin-active. The dependence of the
transition from absolute to convective instabilities on external parameters will
be determined and the evolution of the instabilities will be studied through
analytic modeling and numerical simulation. Collaborations with experimentalists
will be carried out.
