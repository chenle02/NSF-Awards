This award is for a postdoctoral fellowship. The investigator will study how
elevated ultraviolet-B due to anthropogenically induced decreases in
stratospheric ozone affects numerous vital cell functions in photoautotrophic
organisms such as photosynthesis, motility, pigmentation, nitrogen fixation and
growth. The effects of UV-B may be augmented at cold temperatures by decreased
metabolic rates for cellular processes such as DNA repair mechanisms. Although
the impact of increased UV-B on aquatic polar ecosystems is reasonably well
known, a basic understanding of the genetic and cellular regulation of
photoprotective mechanisms in photoautotrophs is still lacking. This
investigation will specifically investigate acclimation at a systems level by
examining the effect of UV-B radiation on patterns of gene expression and
regulation of the photoprotective compounds, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs)
and scytonemin. This work will be conducted using a model organism, the
cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme whose genome has recently been sequenced. The
photoprotective value of MAAs and scytonemin will be tested by assessing changes
in survival in strains depleted in these compounds followed by assessing the
combined effects of UV-B radiation and low temperature stress on gene expression
and photoprotection. This genomic approach will utilize systems biology tools
such as high density microarray analysis with the goal of building an integrated
regulatory and metabolic network model providing a comprehensive view of the
roles played by MAAs and scytonemin in UV acclimation.
