This project proposes to conduct a study that investigates various aspects of
leadership development in mathematics and science education while addressing
four questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the characteristics of current
leaders in science and mathematics education in crucial arenas of educational
activity?&lt;br/&gt;2. What educational and professional experiences led them to
their leadership positions?&lt;br/&gt;3. What do these leaders see as the
desired future directions for mathematics and science education?&lt;br/&gt;4.
From where will the next generation of leaders come?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
order to address these questions, the project will: 1) interview a systematic
sample of mathematics and science education leaders in crucial areas; 2) review
their curriculum vitae and products of their professional work; 3) analyze
existing national databases that provide information about this leadership
community; 4) review literature that expands understanding of leadership in the
context of education; and 5) study program documents from leading programs of
preparation of mathematics and science education leaders.&lt;br/&gt;
