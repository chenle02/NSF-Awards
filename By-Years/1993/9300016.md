9300016 Jonckheere The proposed research is aimed at achieving a deeper
understanding of the closed-loop (robust) stability issue in feedback systems
under uncertain parameters. Three different directions of attack of the problem,
all inspired from algebraic and differential topology, are proposed - the
Simplicial Approximation Theorem, The Morse Theory, and Obstruction Theory. From
there, new "simplicial" algorithms for computing the stability boundary in the
space of uncertainties emerge. The general feature of these algorithms is that
they are based on the idea of simplicial decomposition of the space of
uncertainty. A byproduct of this approach is the elucidation of the topology of
the separating boundary, bounds on the Betti numbers of the stability, and most
importantly, its structural stability under perturbation of the parameters that
have been declared "certain." ***
