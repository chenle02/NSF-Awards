This project is aimed toward the elucidation of intracellular signalling
pathways that involve calcium in the transduction of hormonal and environmental
stimuli in higher plants. The project is focused on the necessity and
sufficiency of changes in cytosolic calcium activity in aleurone cells from
wheat seeds after hormonally- or environmentally-induced germination. The early
signal transduction events in the seed culminate in a change in gene expression
in the aleurone cells. Cytosolic calcium activity changes will be determined in
individual cells fluorometrically, and changes in calcium channel activity that
underlie the redistribution of calcium will be assessed by patch clamp studies.
Finally, the timing of the changes in gene expression will be compared with the
timing of shifts in cytosolic calcium activity. The thrust of the project is to
link transient shifts in cytosolic calcium activity with specific changes in
channel activity and with changes in transcription and translation. %%% This
study is directed toward intracellular signalling pathways in higher plants. In
the process of seed germination, much is known about hormonal activation of the
aleurone cells in the seed and much is known about the changes in gene
expression that follow several hours after hormonal stimulation, but the
intermediary steps of hormonal reception and intracellular signal transduction
that lead to altered transcription and translation remain elusive. This project
will provide significant, new information on the involvement of calcium in the
cascade that culminates in altered gene expression in developing seeds of wheat.
