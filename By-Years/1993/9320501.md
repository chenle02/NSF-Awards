The rates and mechanisms of prototype isomerization and fragmentation reactions
of small hydrocarbons will be examined. The molecules selected for study are
sufficiently small to allow high-level molecular orbital calculation for
comparison to experiment. The studies will include: (1) the rate of cis, trans
ethylene-1,2-d2 isomerization, (2) the relative energy barriers for structural
vs geometric isomerizations of cyclopropane-1, 2-d2 and cyclopropane-1,2,3-d3,
(3) energy barriers for fragmentation of cyclobutane-1,3-d2, (4) the
stereochemistry of conversion of bicyclo 1.1.0 butane-2,2-d2 to butadiene, (5)
rate and mechanism of the 3,4-elimination of molecular hydrogen from
cyclopentene, and (6) the stereochemistry of reactions of
vinylcyclobutane-2,3-d2 to cyclohexene and to ethylene plus butadiene. This
grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor David K. Lewis at Colgate University. These results of this research
will provide fundamental information about processes where carbon-carbon and
carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken and formed. A long-standing question about
these processes is whether the bonds are broken in a stepwise manner or in one
step. These mechanistic aspects will be probed by the thermal decomposition of
deuterium labeled compounds and compounds with unique three-dimensional
structure. Theoretical predictions, based on sophisticated calculations, will be
compared to experimental results which will be a test of the theory.
