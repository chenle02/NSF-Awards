There is a strong need for the development of innovative processing methods to
ensure a strong and competitive technological base for the steel industry in the
future. The liquid oxysulfide phase in the iron-oxygen-sulfur system could
function as a smelting medium for the production of metallic iron from oxidic
and sulfidic ores. Potentially, the smelting process could be carried out at
temperatures that are several hundred degrees below those in the blast furnace
hearth and in steelmaking furnaces. The technology that could be based on
oxysulfide smelting could have many advantages, some of which are high
volumetric throughput, conservation of energy, and production of a very pure raw
material for subsequent processing into steels. It is possible that the pure
iron product might lead to completely new kind of steels, and eventually new
methods of processing steels. A physic-chemical study will be undertaken of the
thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions and processes that would be of generic
importance in the development of possible methods for the bath reduction and
smelting of iron ores in which the bath would be liquid oxysulfide phase in the
Fe-O-S system.
