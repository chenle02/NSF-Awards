The purpose of this fundamental bioengineering research is to produce a
mechanical engineering model of the growth of cartilage. Such a model is
important and necessary in the investigation of the growth plate cartilage. The
PI will conduct a research program of experimental and theoretical
investigations designed to illuminate the growth dynamics of the cartilage of
the leg. Information from such studies could have a profound affect upon
clinical treatment of dwarfism and leg length deformities in children.
