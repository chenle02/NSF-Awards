Dr. Ilan Benjamin is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform molecular dynamics simulations of chemical
reactions at liquid interfaces. This is fundamentally important since in many
chemical systems the interesting and relevant chemistry occurs at the interface
between two immiscible liquids, at the liquid-solid interface, or at the liquid-
vapor interface. Dr. Benjamin plans to study the effect of the media on chemical
reactions which occur at the interface between a liquid and its vapor, and at
the interface between two immiscible liquids. The method of molecular dynamics
computer simulation will be used to find how the unique characteristics of the
interface affect the equilibrium properties of a chemically reactive system,
such as the solvation free energy, the equilibrium constant, the activation free
energy and thus the transition- state-theory rate constant. A major part of the
study will use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to investigate the influence
of the solvent on time-dependent properties of the chemically reactive species
at the interface. This includes energy decay, barrier crossings, solvent
fluctuations caused by the presence of the solute and their effects on the rate
of reaction.
