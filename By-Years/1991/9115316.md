The research is aimed to delineate the effect of relative motions at interface
on dynamic response of structures and foundations. It will provide a new and
improved understanding of the mechanism of load transfer in dynamic soil-
structure interaction as affected by roughness and fluid pressures. It is
anticipated the outcome will lead to improved designs of a wide range of
geotechnical problems. A new test box will be developed to simulate behavior of
saturated sand-concrete interfaces. A comprehensive series of laboratory tests
will be performed and used for the development of a constitutive model based on
the disturbed state concept and hierarchical plasticity models.
