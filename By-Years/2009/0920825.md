Cubozoan jellyfish (box jellyfish) include some of the most venomous animals in
the ocean, and their habitat includes nearshore areas in use for human
recreation. Recent evidence suggests that two less venomous species of
cubomedusae are invading local North Carolina waters in large numbers, just off
of popular beaches. Furthermore, these jellyfish belong to an animal group,
including corals and anemones, with the simplest and most primitive
multicellular nervous systems. Despite this simplicity, these animals have very
rich behavioral repertoires and can successfully avoid obstacles, swim toward
dim light sources, and respond to brief shadows. These properties underline the
importance of understanding the neural control of behavior in this very active
group of jellyfish: to better understand how to adapt human recreational
activity to the expanding habitat of these venomous animals and to gain insight
into the evolution of nervous system function, in general, related to behavioral
variability and muscular control. As voracious predators on small fish and
crustaceans, their impact on commercially valuable species has yet to be
evaluated. Finally, information on the neural control of behavior in cubomedusae
may be useful in animal-inspired marine robotics that may be of use in both
commercial and military applications. This project will use a combination of
electrical recording from neurons and muscles, structural examination of
neuromuscular organization, and behavioral observations to describe the rapid
and accurate turning abilities in response to both visual and mechanical
stimuli, and to describe the strong swimming abilities of the jellyfish.
