9417038 van Geen This project will test the hypothesis that accumulation of Cd
is enhanced in suboxic sediments, potentially altering the global oceanic
inventory. Cd is one of two tracers used to infer nutrient content of the deep
ocean, and at present results from Cd do not agree with those of the other
tracer, 13-C. Determining the cause of the discrepancy will permit more accurate
estimates of past ocean nutrients, which are related to primary production and
therefore to the global carbon cycle. ***
