Cutting, Simon IBN#9418291 University of Pennsylvania An unusually small
developmental protein. Spore formation in the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis represents a simple example of cellular development that has been well
characterized morphologically, physiologically and genetically. Interestingly,
this prokaryote has certain similarities to development in higher organisms.
Most notable is the formation of two cell types during the course of
sporulation. These two cell types (of which one is destined to become the spore)
are, at first, separated by only two layers of membrane and are thus reminiscent
of the compartmentalized structures found in eukaryotic cells, (e.g.,
mitochondria). Similarly, adjacent daughter cells in a multicullular
differentiating organism are separated by only two membrane layers. B. subtilus
may be able to serve as a simple model to address how information is
communicated throught membranes. In this proposal the structure and function of
an extremely small developmental protein, SpoVM, will be determined. The 26
amino acid, 3kD, SpoVM protein is crucial for the development of B. subtilis and
is able to interact with phospholipid membranes. The hypothesis is that SpoVM is
involved in intercompartmental communication between the mother and daughter
cells. This proposal will investigate the nature of the cell-cell communication
process and the role that SpoVM may play. The specific aims are: to isolate
suppressors of a spoVM mutant, to determine the cellular location of the
protein, to determine whether it is an oligomer, to examine its structure by CS
spectroscopy and NMR, to carry out liposome binding and channel conductance
experiments, to search for interacting proteins, to identify regions of
functional importance and to screen for homologues in other spore-forming
bacteria.****
