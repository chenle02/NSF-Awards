The proposed research consists of studies of chemical processes of importance
in the atmosphere which involve cloud particles. There are strong indications
that polar stratospheric clouds are chemically very active, transforming stable
chlorine compounds to a form that efficiently promotes ozone depletion. The
studies in this proposal are aimed at elucidating the mechanism for such
processes, and at measuring parameters such as chemical reaction rates, which
are needed to model the behavior of the polar stratosphere and to predict future
effects of the release of man-made chlorofluorocarbons. More specifically, the
PI plans to characterize the various ices of atmospheric interest (which consist
of water with varying amounts of HNO3, H2SO4 and HCl) by means of thermal
analysis techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry, and by infrared
and ultraviolet spectrophotometry and to measure the vapor pressures of HCl for
the various ices as a function of the ice composition via mass spectrometry. The
PI also plans to determine reaction probabilities for ClONO2 and N2O5 vapors
interacting with ices containing amounts of HCl which are appropriate for
stratospheric conditions.
