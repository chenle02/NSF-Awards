This research will examine high-frequency nonlinear waves with applications to
problems in continuum mechanics. Asymptotic methodology will be developed to
analyze hyperbolic waves in several space dimensions and resonant wave-wave
interactions. Application areas include mach configurations in reflected,
focusing, and refracted shocks, nonlinear caustics, resonant interaction of
sawtoothed waves, passage through resonance of nonlinear waves, nondispersive
surface waves, and weakly dispersive short waves.
