9301674 Teicholz This research will develop a predictive model of project
performance based on measures of organizational and technical integration during
the design and construction process. The outcomes predicted include: cost,
schedule, quality of the engineering-procurement-construction (EPC) process, and
completed facility quality, i.e., how well the completed facility meets the
needs of the owner/operator. Input variables include measures of the
organization and technical integration on the project, the types of contracts
among the project team, and other factors.
