This study is a comparison and evaluation of the modern arctic climate as
simulated by seven general circulation models (GCM). While most GCM's project an
amplified climatic response in polar regions to increasing concentrations of
greenhouse gases, the responses of individual models vary, and appear to depend
to some extent on the formulation of the model. The objective of the
intercomparison study is to identify the common biases for all seven models, and
the differences in biases among models with respect to such climatic simulations
as sea-level pressure, temperature, precipitation, storm tracks, clouds, and
radiation exchange. Model performance will be constrained with existing data
sets whenever feasible. The GCM's to be evaluated are those developed by the
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR CCM2), the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory of NOAA (GFDL), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA
(GISS), the Numerical Weather Center of NOAA (NMC), the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office
(UKMO). Computation time will be made available on the CRAY Y-MP of the Ohio
Supercomputer Center.
