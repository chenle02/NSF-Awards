9720482 McKay This theory project develops a position-space renormalization-
group approach to study driven diffusive lattice gases; the theory will be
modified and applied to interacting cases and systems with quenched randomness.
Systems driven far from equilibrium are prevalent in nature and particularly
challenging with respect to fundamental understanding and property prediction.
The models to be studied in this project are simple prototypes related to a
variety of complex systems such as biological populations, binary fluid flow
through random media, and fast ionic conductors. %%% This is a research
enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in
Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic
materials science knowledge at a fundamental level. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through undergraduate
student participation in research. ***
