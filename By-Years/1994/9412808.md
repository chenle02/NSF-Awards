The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methodology. The use
of an oxonium ion-initiated pinacol rearrangement for carbohydrate, nucleoside
and nucleotide synthesis and the construction of polyquinane networks from
squarate esters will be highlighted. Also, a plan to construct the first sigma-
allyl cation and the syntheses of new transition metal catalysts for
hydrogenation will be carried out. With this renewal award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Leo A. Paquette of the
department of Chemistry at the Ohio State University. Professor Paquette will
focus his work on the development of new methodology for application to the
asymmetric synthesis of natural products.
