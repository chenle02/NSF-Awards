The National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) will undertake a study of
conventional industry (such as metallic and plymeric materials) trends,
interests and activities in nanomanufacturing technologies, as a preparatory
input activitity to the NSF Workshop on Three-Dimensional Nanomanufacturing:
Partnering with Industry, planned in conjuction with the NSF Design and
Manufacturing Grantees Conference, Birmingham, AL in January 2003. Industry
respondents will be polled on their organization's plans for R&amp;D,
investments, staffing, production implementation, success stories, and plans for
future products incorporating nanotechnology. The survey may be accessed at:
