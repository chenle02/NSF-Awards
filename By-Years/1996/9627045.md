9627045 de Acosta The investigator proposes to contribute to the study of basic
questions in Large Deviations related to some important stochastic sequences or
ppocesses. This includes the development of suitable abstract mathematical
tools, the identification of models which lead naturally to interesting large
deviation questions, and the computation of the analytical expression of
specific rate functions. The scope of the project includes the following
situations: (i) trajectories of Markov processes (ii) trajectories of certain
classes of semimartingales (iii) empirical measures under various dependence
conditions. A fundamental theme in Probability Theory and its applications is
the study of situations in which a sequence of averages constructed from a
stochastic sequence converges in some sense to a deterministic limit. Large
Deviation theory deals with the problem of estimating the small probabilities
that the averages will deviate from the "typical behavior" represented by the
limit. Here are two situations to which the proposed research has direct or
potential relevance; (a) Probabilistic models are increasingly used in analyzing
the performance of complex communication systems and computer networks. Large
Deviation theory (in particular, large deviations of certain Markov processes)
is a powerful tool in the analysis of rare events (that is, deviations from
"normal behavior") in large systems of those types. (b) Large Deviation theory
is very useful in the analysis of rare events associated to thermodynamic limits
in several important models in Statistical Mechanics.
