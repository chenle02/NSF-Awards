The principal investigator will conduct melting experiments at high pressures
and temperatures on ultrabasic rock compositions utilizing the multianvil high-
pressure laboratory at SUNY/Stony Brook. The main aim of this work is to
understand the nature of melting and the evolution of magmas in the Earth's
mantle.
