0108768&lt;br/&gt;Goulden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a workshop proposal
submitted by Dr. Clyde Goulden, Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia, to
request travel expenses to enable 12 U.S. scientists to attend the meeting of
the East Asian Long-Term Ecological Research Network in Ulaanbaatar, and then
presentations and field experiments at Hatgal on Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia, from
July 2-10, 2001. Mongolia lies in the transition zone between the cold
continental desert, and the taiga boreal forest of Siberia. The Mongolian LTER
(MLTER) includes ecosystems of the Gobi, semi-desert, steppe/forest, taiga
forest, and freshwater habitats, and is an important network for global
environmental research. The scheduled activities include focused presentations,
hands-on research training and in-situ field measurements in a range of
ecosystems. The purpose of this workshop is to exchange research results in
ecology and to foster collaboration among the scientists from the U.S. and East
Asia. The NSF and the Mongolian National Academy of Science jointly support this
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
