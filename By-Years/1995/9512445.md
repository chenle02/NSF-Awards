This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Michigan Technological University acquire a 300 MHz
NMR Spectrometer. The research activity to be supported includes: areas of
synthetic organic chemistry, natural product chemistry, bioorganic chemistry,
ceramics synthesis, physical chemistry, and polymer chemistry. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist
for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
