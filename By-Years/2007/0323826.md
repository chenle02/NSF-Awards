Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TCUP Planning Grant: University of
Alaska Fairbanks &lt;br/&gt;Northwest &amp; Chukchi Campuses &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this planning grant is to conduct an assessment of
STEM &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, student needs in science, technology, and math,
plus transitional &lt;br/&gt;factors in student advancement. Based upon this
information an institutional plan &lt;br/&gt;for STEM programming will be
developed and a STEM implementation grant &lt;br/&gt;written, including tools
for evaluation and student tracking. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The planning period
will occur for 12 months and will include four goals with &lt;br/&gt;overlapping
timelines: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Assessment of STEM Infrastructure (October 01,
2003 - March 31, &lt;br/&gt; 2004) &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Assessment of Student
Needs (October 01, 2003 . March 31, 2004) &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Assessment of
Transitional Factors in Student Advancement &lt;br/&gt; (October 01, 2002 .
March 31, 2004) &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Creation Of An Institutional Plan &amp;
Implementation Grant (April 01, &lt;br/&gt; 2004 . August 31, 2004) &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The results of this planning grant will be the assessment of
Northwest and &lt;br/&gt;Chuckchi campuses ability to provide a 2-year STEM
transfer program; an &lt;br/&gt;assessment of Alaska Native student retention in
science, technology, and math &lt;br/&gt;coursework/programs; an assessment of
high school to 2-year and 2-year to 4-&lt;br/&gt;year science, technology, and
math skill transition; and finally an institutional plan &lt;br/&gt;for STEM
courses and programs out of which a full TCUP grant proposal will be
&lt;br/&gt;written including the development of instruments for STEM program
evaluation &lt;br/&gt;and student tracking. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
