The aim of this project is to experimentally characterize the kinetics of
thermally induced (spontaneous) DNA bubble formation. The bubble kinetics
(opening and closing times) will be directly measured in specific DNA sequences,
and the effects on the bubble's stability of temperature, ionic strength, and
protein binding to the single-stranded parts will be studied. The experiments
will use Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) at the single molecule
level to detect bubble formation and bubble closure for a wide range of
timescales that have not been explored so far, from sub-milliseconds to many
seconds. The work is based on the recent development of an instrument for high-
throughput single-molecule imaging, and a protocol for the internal labeling of
DNA hairpin molecules with FRET pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
involve multiple educational components. The Principal Investigator's laboratory
has prepared the ground for the participation of students at the graduate and
undergraduate level in all stages of the research, from sample preparation,
single molecule data acquisition, to data processing. Students will come from
multiple programs, biophysics, molecular biology, and applied physics. The
collaboration with theoretical groups will expose even more students to the
research effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is provided by
the Division of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Molecular
and Cellular Biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
