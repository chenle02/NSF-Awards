This awards supports the research of Professors C. Delzell and J. Madden to
work in real algebraic geometry. They will work on a general theory of local
real algebraic geometry connecting singularities with intersections using
notions from ordered fields. They also intend to work on relations between
lattice ordered rings and real algebraic geometry, Lipschitz continuity and
differentiability of abstract semialgebraic functions and smoothly varying
solutions to Hilbert's 17'th problem. The research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed
to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood
for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the
simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in
fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding
theory and robotics.
