This project will support the construction of visitor and graduate student
housing units (totaling 8 bedrooms and associated shared living and kitchen
facilities) at Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO). In the last 4 years
SkIO has invested a great deal in research equipment and facilities including
the construction of a 32 m circumference racetrack flume, an organic
geochemistry laboratory, the purchase of an ICP-MS, a GC-MS, an image analyzer
and a Silicon Graphics graphics workstation. The availability of these
facilities and access to coastal marine environments has increased the demand
for visitor housing to the extent that current facilities (9 bedrooms total) are
reserved approximately 18 months in advance. Since many research grants are only
24 months in duration, this long lead time is hampering collaborative research
efforts. Additional on-site housing is necessary for students and visitors
because SkIO is located on a barrier island with no access to public
transportation. Given the excellent array of research facilities available for
visiting faculty research and graduate student training, the institution is
limited in the number of visitors that can be accommodated and students housed.
The Institute's remoteness from Savannah prevents students and visitors from
seeking housing in town, for both cost and travel time considerations. * * *
