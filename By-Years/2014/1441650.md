Computers today are so complex and opaque that a user cannot possibly hope to
know, let alone trust, everything occurring within the machine. While software
security techniques help ensure the integrity of user computations, they are
only as trustworthy as the underlying hardware. Even though many proposals
provide some relief to the problem of hardware trust, the user must ultimately
rely on the assurances of other parties. This work restores hardware trust
through a simple, small, and slow pluggable hardware element. This project
investigates techniques that provides a kernel of trust that keeps even the most
aggressive systems in line without slowing them down and is easy to
manufacture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this slow but trusted hardware element to
be useful in real world systems, it must not degrade system performance
significantly. To achieve this goal, this work develops two complimentary
techniques: dependence-free parallel verification of executed instructions, and
cryptographic hash-based memory integrity assurance. Additionally, cryptographic
hashing also ensures code integrity and prevents the processor from executing
its own malicious code. A combination of these techniques provides a secure
hardware environment where users need not worry about their data being
compromises, as long as their software is also secure. Therefore, when combined
with well-developed software security techniques, this work provides a
significant increase in the level of trust users place in their computing
systems.
