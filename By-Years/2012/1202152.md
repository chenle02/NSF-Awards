The Principal Investigator (PI) will perform a comprehensive theoretical study
of the poorly explored and important regime of weakly collisional reconnection
in plasmas, where Coulomb collisions play a role, but where reconnection
electric fields are comparable to, or larger than, the Dreicer limit for runaway
electrons. These results will have direct scientific application to describing
reconnection processes in the solar corona and transition region. The PI intends
to quantify the practical consequences of such reconnection, such as bulk plasma
heating and particle acceleration, using self-consistent modeling and state-of-
the-art, fully kinetic, particle-in-cell simulations with a Monte-Carlo
treatment of the Coulomb collisions, in order to provide a first-principles
description of the relevant physics.

The PI notes that this research will have widespread applications in a variety
of sub-fields of plasma physics. This project's educational objectives include
the training of a postdoctoral researcher in reconnection physics, petascale
computing, and scientific visualization. In addition, the PI's employer,
SciberQuest, Inc., has an ongoing partnership with the San Diego Supercomputer
Center's internship program entitled "Research Experience for High School
Students" (REHS). As part of this project, the PI will mentor two students per
year through the REHS program.
