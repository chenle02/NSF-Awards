Dr. Matthew J. Fisher has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Fisher's doctoral degree was from the University of California at
Irvine under the supervision of Professor Larry E. Overman. Dr. Fisher intends
to continue research at Yale University under the sponsorship of Professor
Samuel Danishefsky. Dr. Fisher's area of postdoctoral research will be tandem
radical-cation polyolefin cyclization by photolysis of iminium ions containing
an intramolecular olefinic donor and a cation trap. The Postdoctoral Fellowships
in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
