In 1985 Jones assigned to a knot a polynomial with integer coefficients, and in
1989 Witten came up with a path-integral interpretation of this polynomial. Upon
taking parallels, one can consider a sequence of polynomials. The volume
conjecture relates an asymptotic behavior of this sequence (evaluated at complex
roots of unity) with the Riemannian (mostly hyperbolic) geometry of the knot
complement. The PIs propose to study this and related conjectures that relate
quantum topology and geometrization.

A knot in 3-space is a flexible rope that is allowed to deform without crossing
itself. The width and length of the rope are irrevelant, and its beginning and
end coincide. For example, a rubber band is an example of a knot. In the middle
of 19th century, Kelvin postulated that chemical elements (such as gold,
aluminum) are made out of knots; thus different knot types explain the variation
of observed chemical elements. More than a century later, string-theory offers a
similar view of the world, where elementary particles are vibrating in the
fabric of cosmos, along knotted circles. Whether string-theory explains the
world is a key question. Meanwhile, it is known that string-theory has deeply
influenced mathematics.
