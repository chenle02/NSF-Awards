The major focus of this research is a detailed investigation of the atomic and
electronic structures of oriented, single crystal surfaces of several
geochemically and environmentally important oxide minerals (alpha-SiO2, alpha-
Al2O3, and alpha-Fe2O3). The samples will be studied before and after reaction
with water and electrolyte solutions by surface-sensitive synchrotron radiation
methods including X- Ray Standing Waves, Surface Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine
Structure, and core level photemission techniques. The results of these studies
will ultimately find application in the environmental geochemistry field in
understanding how water and aqueous metal ions interact with mineral surfaces. A
second focus of this project is the continuation of a high temperature x-ray
absorption spectroscopy study of silicate liquids. Data collected on Ni2+ and Ge
in Ni-germanate liquids and on Ni in silicate liquids will be used to obtain
quantitative information on the local environment of these cations as a function
of temperature.
