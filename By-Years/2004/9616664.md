Abstract 9616664 Papen This project will continue the operation of a sodium
resonance lidar at the South Pole in order to study the vertical structure and
dynamics of the atmosphere from the lower stratosphere to the mesopause. During
the third year of the project, an iron resonance lidar will be added which will
extend the measurements of the dynamics and temperature structure to 100 km
altitude. Additionally, an airglow imaging camera will be used to study the
horizontal structure. When used in conjunction with the normal balloon-borne
radio sondes which are regularly flown from South Pole, the final complement of
instruments will provide extensive data on the temperature structure from the
surface to 100 km altitude; the nature of the polar stratospheric clouds, which
are important to ozone chemistry; the variability and frequency of occurrence of
metallic layers in the mesosphere, which play a role in communications as well
as chemistry; atmospheric gravity waves; and many other phenomena, some of which
are unique to the South Pole. ***
