The investigator continues the methodological/theoretical/algorithmic
developments and the software implementation of smoothing spline ANOVA models.
Through the inclusion/exclusion of selected terms in functional ANOVA
structures, rich modeling options are made available in the settings of
regression, density estimation, and hazard rate estimation; the popular additive
models are special cases. Among specific tasks in this phase of the research are
(i) the separate model configurations of variables of different natures such as
geographic locations and time for seasonal effect, (ii) conditional density
estimation on generic domains which induce regression models with all sorts of
responses including multivariate ones with mixtures of discrete, continuous, and
possibly other types, (iii) Fast computation for multivariate density estimation
which makes nonparametric graphical models practically feasible, and (iv) hazard
estimation with censored lifetime data and frailty terms. Also explored are the
spectral analysis of non-stationary time series and spike trains.

As nonparametric extensions of the widely used (generalized) linear models, the
methods being developed provide empowering modeling tools for researchers in a
broad spectrum of application areas to extract fine features from the ever
larger data sets they collect; documented past applications were found in
biomedical studies, epidemiology, natural resource management, etc. The end
product of the proposed research is open-source software with a friendly user-
interface in a popular platform with a diverse user base, which facilitates the
routine use of the tools being developed by practitioners and thus enhances the
infrastructure for information-processing.
