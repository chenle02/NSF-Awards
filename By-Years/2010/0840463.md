With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor John P. Toscano from John Hopkins
University will acquire a matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of
flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometer that will be housed in the Department of
Chemistry's Mass Spectrometry Facility on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins
University. The instrument will provide both routine and specialized analytical
mass spectral services to about 23 total users, from five different departments
(Chemistry, Biology, Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical and
Biomolecular Engineering, and Geography and Environmental Engineering) as well
as additional users from institutions within the immediate area (Morgan State
University, Towson University, and Loyola College). The major users from the
Chemistry Department, D. P. Goldberg, M. M. Greenberg, J. P. Roth, J. P.
Toscano, J. D. Tovar, and C. A. Townsend will use this spectrometer for studies
of corrolazines and DNA damage and repair, characterization of oxidative amino
acid modifications in heme-containing oxygenases and peroxidases and HNO-induced
modification of proteins involved in cardiac signaling pathways,
characterization of molecular electronic materials and organic conjugated
polymers and detection and characterization of covalent intermediates in modular
and iterative biosynthetic enzymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MALDI-ToF-mass
spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights
of very large molecules, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-ToF
mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique, especially in
studies involving biomolecules. This research will have a significant impact in
a number of areas, especially chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will
also be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
