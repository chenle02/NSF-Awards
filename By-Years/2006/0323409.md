This exploratory research project is aimed at the development of an integrated
manufacturing process that can directly produce functional synthetic fibers for
biological and chemical protective clothing. Such protective clothing materials
are extremely important and urgently needed by medical workers, first
responders, and military personal. Most protective clothing and respirators
(such as N-95) are made of polyolefin fibers by directly using fiber
entanglements or adhesives to hold fibers together in dense and stable sheet
forms. A melting extrusion process is the only process that can be potentially
used for incorporation of new functions on the fibers, which is the reason for
proposing this research for reactive extrusion. The researchers propose to
employ halamine structures as candidates for self-decontaminating agents and
ally group as reactive group in controlled radical reactions to incorporate
halamine structures to polymers in the reactive fiber extrusion process.
According to the requirements of possessing both halamine and reactive, allyl
groups, 3-allyl-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (ADMH), is proposed as the first reactive
monomer for this process. The aim is that the functional synthetic fibers
incorporated with ADMH structure will be able to provide self-decontaminating
functions on chemical and biological protective clothing.

The outcome of this research can significantly increase protection for first
responders and military personnel. This proposed integrated manufacturing
process is an environmentally friendly and energy efficient process. The study
has great impact to homeland security as well as to textile education and
textile materials research.
