9629074 Whitney This Career Development proposal seeks to characterize the
effects of fluid composition (H2O:CO2) on crustal melting and products, and to
characterize how pluton and migmatites are related to on another. This research
will resolve several questions concerning crustal magmatism by integrating
experimental, analytical, and field study of three migmatite complexes that are
inferred to have formed by partial melting of crustal rocks and that are
spatially associated with silicic plutons. A new intermediate-level class for
undergraduates will be created based in part on going and proposed research in
Turkey. This new class (Geology, Environment and Civilization) will focus on
giving students a basic understanding of earth systems and human interactions
with the physical environment, emphasizing the role of geology in the
development and evolution of ancient and modern civilizations. All stages of the
research will be integrated with the undergraduate and graduate petrology
curricula at UNC-CH.
