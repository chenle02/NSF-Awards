Lee This research addresses some key requirements for the design for manufacture
of very small supercomputers used in intelligent machines such as portable
robots. This multidisciplinary effort is centered on developing a compact rapid
prototyping and manufacturing center. Microscale laser lithography, flip-chip
soldering and robot controlled pick-and-place techniques are being used.
Simulation studies validate the design before prototyping. Research is
concentrating on the self-aligning mechanism with an emphasis on the reliability
of solder joints, fuzzy logic modeling with focus on the process modeling and
optimization, and further improvement of thermosonic bonding technology.
