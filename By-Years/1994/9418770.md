9418770 Dehn This award supports a 12-month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Jonathan Dehn at the Geological Survey of
Japan, Sapporo, Japan. Dr. Dehn will work with Dr. Takarada at the Hokkaido
Branch on a research project entitled, "Japan STA Program: Computer Modeling of
Volcanic Eruptions." The modeling of a volcanic system from eruption to
deposition has been missing in volcanology. Dehn and Takarada will study the
volcanogenic particles created during low energy volcanic eruptions throughout
Japan. This data will be used to formulate modular quantitative models of the
eruptions. Each physical component of the volcanic eruption will be modeled
including vesiculation, fragmentation, ejection, subaerial transport, subaqueous
transport, deposition, deformation, secondary fragmentation and mass wasting.
The research team will develop a modular computer program for each component
which can be added or deleted from the whole model in order to simulate nearly
any volcanic condition. This model would be an important basis for comprehensive
modeling of volcanic systems, and could be come a useful tool not only in the
understanding of active systems but also in interpretation of ancient volcanoes
and their deposits. The model would be of great use in volcanic hazard
determination as well as modeling of eruptions on other planets. ***
