Statistical evidence, reports, and testimony play an increasing role in
decision-making, ranging from the actions of individuals and private
organizations, to those of the courts and other public authorities. Because of
their expertise, statisticians are called on for information and advice, in
these various settings. With these roles come ethical questions concerning
appropriate behavior in difficult situations. What is the statisticians'
responsibility to employer or client, for instance, when called on for testimony
in a courtroom or before the Congress, or when asked by the media for comment?
How should statisticians respond when they disagree as to the treatment of
uncertainty in statistical analyses, or the methods of evaluation of statistical
studies, or the sufficiency of data for making a decision or ruling? This
project begins a process whereby the American Statistical Association (ASA) can
enhance the knowledge of statisticians and decision makers about the issues of
professional responsibility facing all of them in these various settings. With
advice from a broadly representative Steering Committee, the Association will
plan and hold a workshop on the role of statisticians as expert witnesses. Using
the census undercount and environmental topics as initial cases for exploration,
the workshop will focus on issues that arise for expert witnesses in courtrooms,
in Congressional hearings and on regulatory expert panels. The workshop report
will address the roles of statisticians and of the organizations and
institutions calling on them in inhibiting or enhancing ethical behavior.
Material from this and later workshops will be organized into a text using a
casebook format accessible to students, practitioners, and users of statistics.
