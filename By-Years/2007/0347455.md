Wireless networks have grown rapidly, resulting in increased productivity
afforded by untethered mobile communications. The end-to-end communication
problem for wireless networks includes physical layer (PHY), Medium Access
Control (MAC), and routing issues. This effort aims to provide a joint solution
to the end-to-end problem, encompassing all three areas, to maximize efficiency
by attempting to unify the theories that support them, namely information
theory, queuing and graph theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the MAC
problem is being investigated for a variety of situations, incorporating diverse
traffic characteristics, advanced physical layer technologies, and potential
denial of service, and efficient protocols are being designed. The effect on
routing of channel fading is being investigated. The novelty of the project is
in the use of information theoretic techniques, such as entropy bounds and error
exponents, to analyze MAC and routing, thus complementing queuing and graph
theoretic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to increase the
efficiency of wireless networks, whose development is important for the
continued growth of global productivity. The project will result in the
understanding and design of efficient MAC and routing protocols, which
explicitly incorporate PHY characteristics, and are capable of handling
practical wireless channel impairments, arising in diverse wireless networks.
The results will be of importance to the communications industry in designing
high-end competitive products. Further, the project will develop graduate
student expertise in information theoretical techniques for wireless networking,
and will allow several more undergraduates and graduates to participate through
instructional experiments. &lt;br/&gt;
