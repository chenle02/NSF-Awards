9420920 Cox This project addresses two pressing theoretical questions in the
area of superconducitivity. First, what is the origin of superconductivity in
the heavy fermion materials? Second, can the odd-in-time reversal Cooper pair
really be found in a physical system? To address these questions,
superconductivity in the heavy fermion materials will be studied using a variety
of techniques based upon the primary assumption that it arises from odd-in-time-
reversal Cooper pairs whose microscopic origin is in the two-channel Kondo model
using a variety of techniques. Effects of doping, disorder, and symmetry
breaking fields will be studied as well. Several phenomenological approaches
will also be attempted. This study should answer definitely whether the two-
channel Kondo model is a viable candidate for a comprehensive theory of heavy
fermion superconductivity and whether odd-in-time-reversal pairing may have a
solid basis in these materials. %%% In this work a variety of theoretical
techniques is used to study a class of materials known as heavy fermion
materials. In some ways these materials act as if the electrons have a much
larger mass than an isolated electron. These materials are of special interest
because at low temperatures they superconduct in a way that cannot be understood
using the traditional theory of superconductivity. Here a particular model will
be studied to see if it agrees with the known properties of heavy fermion
superconductors. Understanding superconductivity in these materials should
contribute to the theory of superconductivity in high temperature
superconductors, with the ultimate goal of being able to design materials which
are superconducting at higher and higher temperatures. ***
