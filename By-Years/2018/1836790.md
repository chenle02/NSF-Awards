The proposed project seeks financial support for increasing the diversity of
speakers and enhancing student participation at a Conference to be held from
June 24 to 27, 2018 at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The "76th
Device Research Conference (DRC)" will focus on a variety of devices ranging
from semiconductors to organic, molecular devices, as well as spin and quantum
devices. The Conference will host world-renowned researchers in advanced devices
as invited speakers, whose expertise range from design, to fabrication
characterization and applications. In addition to technical talks, short courses
on highly relevant topics presented by renowned world experts will greatly
enhance the usefulness of the conference to attendees. This year's course will
be on future computing technologies based on architectures beyond traditional
von Neumann computing. The technical program will provide student participants
with the opportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic
physics, and their engineering applications. Exposing the next generation of
researchers to these important disciplines is critical to maintain the supply of
STEM workers with the skillsets necessary to address emerging commercial trends.
The information will be disseminated through the conference proceedings which
will be available online through the IEEEXplore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
