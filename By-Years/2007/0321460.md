With more than 20,000 species, legumes are one of the two most important crop
families in the world. Among cultivated plants, legumes are unique in their
ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis with bacteria known as
Rhizobia. Since they are not limited for nitrogen, legumes have remarkably high
levels of protein, a property that is both biologically and agriculturally
significant. Nearly 33% of all nutritional nitrogen comes from legumes, and
legumes are the single most important source of nutritional protein throughout
the developing world. Legumes also synthesize an impressive array of secondary
compounds with anti-cancer and health promoting effects. Not surprisingly,
legumes play a central role in nearly all cropping systems and are universally
viewed as essential for secure and sustainable food
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among legumes, Medicago (Medicago truncatula),
a species closely related to alfalfa, is widely considered the preeminent model
for genomic research. Medicago has a compact genome of approximately 470 million
base pairs, simple Mendelian genetics, short generation time, relatively high
transformation efficiency, and extensive collections of phenotypic mutants and
naturally occurring ecotypes. Excellent cytogenetic research demonstrates that
the Medicago genome is organized into separate gene-rich and gene-poor
regions.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, gene density in the gene-rich portions of the
Medicago genome is nearly as high as in Arabidopsis. Thus, the Medicago genome
is favorably organized for genome sequencing likely to capture nearly all of its
gene-space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To sequence the gene-space of Medicago, a group
of U.S. laboratories will completely sequence the gene-rich regions of six of
Medicago's eight chromosomes. This work will be closely coordinated with
colleagues in the European Union, who will sequence the gene-space of the
remaining two Medicago chromosomes. In the process, sequences likely to contain
genes will be identified and this information will be integrated with existing
genomic information about Medicago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important
beneficiaries of the Medicago genome sequence will be legume researchers - from
genomicists to breeders - who will finally have a reference genome sequence
representing most legume-specific properties. With the Medicago sequence in
hand, detailed studies of legume-specific gene families, developmental
processes, and biochemical pathways, gene cloning based on comparative genomics,
discovery of pan-legume genetic markers - plus a genomic system ideally
positioned for evolutionary comparison with Arabidopsis - will be available to
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
