Driven by prevailing applications that process extreme volume of data, the quest
for large memory capacity has become increasingly strong. Conventional DRAM-
based memory is facing severe technology scaling limitations such as process
variations, which hinders the growth in memory density at reasonable cost. Such
challenges inspire the search for alternative memory technologies such as the
emerging non-volatile Resistive RAMs (ReRAM). ReRAM exploits resistance of
Metal-Oxide-Metal structure to represent stored information. It has shorter read
and write latency, and better write endurance when compared with other non-
volatile memories. ReRAM exhibits superior scalability and can be architected to
build high-density memories using a crossbar structure, or 3D stacking. Such
features make ReRAM a competitive technology as a DRAM replacement to achieve
significant large memory capacity for modern data intensive applications.
Education objectives will be achieved through broad dissemination of results via
publications, research seminars, tutorials, software demonstrations, conference
participation, and technology transfer initiatives. Continuous student training
will be carried through involving graduate, undergraduate students, especially
underrepresented students in this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are
major difficulties in building a large memory using the crossbar ReRAM
architecture. The reliability of the memory is challenged by its large sneak
leakage, operation disturbance and endurance. This research aims to tackle those
challenges by investigating novel cell-array organizations and management
techniques to reduce sneak leakage, minimize disturbance, prolong the lifetime
and improve the overall reliability of the new memory structure. This research
will ensure that future resistive memories can be developed to become reliable
at high density, which helps to fuel the continuation of Moore?s Law in memory
advancement.
