The project will investigate the breaking of Rossby waves in the subtropical
upper troposphere, and its consequences for the atmospheric general circulation.
Wave breaking occurs when the wave amplitude becomes large, and results in
mixing of potential vorticity. Nonlinear dynamical processes in the wave-
breaking regions, including potential reflection of wave energy towards the
source region, are not well understood. The role of these processes in
generation of intra-seasonal-to-seasonal variability in the Northern
extratropical winters is also unclear. Dr. Magnusdottir (UC Irvine) will study
the involved dynamical processes using simple theoretical models and a suite of
numerical models of increasing complexity. She will analyze the impact of the
seasonal cycle and continentality on the nonlinear reflection of wave energy,
and search for evidence of reflection in observations. The analysis of dynamical
processes leading to, and resulting from, the breaking of Rossby waves in the
upper subtropics should lead to improved understanding and modeling of tropical-
extratropical interactions and the atmospheric general circulation.
