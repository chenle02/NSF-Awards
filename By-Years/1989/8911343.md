The proposal is to look at various problems at the quark gluon interface with
nuclear physics. This includes the deuteron electromagnetic form factor at high
momentum transfer, the nucleon-delta transition form factor at all momentum
transfers, and the distribution amplified of gluons in a glueball.
Electrodisintegration of heavy ions, and the effect of quark clusters in
hadronization in deep inelastic scattering from nuclei will also be explored.
