9307704 HARGUS The disappearance Native American languages is a serious
problem, requiring both scientific documentation and revitalization efforts.
This is a linguistic study of the verbal morphology, phonology and syntax of a
subarctic Athabascan Indian language (Babine-Witsu Wit'en) still spoken in
British Columbia, Canada. The objective of the study is to provide a model of
the morphological structure of verbs based on an understanding of the
interaction of verbal morphology with syntax and phonology. Research will be
conducted through native speaker interviews. Local objectives are to stimulate
interest in linguistics among native speakers and to facilitate language
pedagogical efforts throughout this language area. ***
