The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the
stabilization of temperature-sensitive formulations. Temperature-sensitive
formulations, such as protein drugs and vaccines, require costly cold-chains for
the transportation and storage. This requirement not only poses significant
costs and great quality challenges for these products, but also may not be
fulfilled under extreme environments or in certain regions. This unmet need may
consequently limit the use of life-saving drugs. Enabling transportation and/or
storage outside cold chains will resolve these problems having significant
commercial markets and benefits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
focused on a technology towards thermally stable formulations. This innovative,
multifunctional technology based on ice-binding polypeptide (IBP) platforms, in
particular, applies previously unaddressed roles of IBP in thermal stabilization
and carbohydrate crystallization controls to enable the stabilization of heat
sensitive formulations/products during transportation and storage. The IBP
stabilization technology can efficiently stabilize temperature-sensitive
proteins and formulations under a wide range of temperatures, which may
eventually enable the transportation and storage of these formulations outside
cold chains. The ultimate goal is to enable cold-chain free transportation and
storage of temperature sensitive formulations/products using the IBP
stabilization technology. Specifically, the goals in this NSF I-Corps project
are to understand the market needs by extensive customer interviews, to identify
ideal customers, and to develop IBP stabilization technology to fit the
identified customers' needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
