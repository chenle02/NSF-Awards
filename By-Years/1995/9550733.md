9550733 Hrabowski The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) has made a
major commitment to be a major producer of minority scientists, mathematicians,
and engineers. UMBC's highly successful Meyerhoff Scholarship Program, initiated
in 1988, is designed to facilitate the recruitment and retention of minority
scholars into these fields. NSF support is requested to expand and enhance
current efforts. Four groups of forty-four outstanding African American students
scholars would be financially and academically supported, through the bachelor's
degree, with the understanding that they will continue on to a graduate or
professional degree. Each student would receive strong academic enrichment and
support, beginning with a summer bridge program prior to entering the
University. A UMBC faculty member would work with each student on a significant
research project, and each students would be assigned a practicing scientist or
engineering professional as a mentor. UMBC has received support from individuals
and corporations for this program and is committed to continuing its efforts.
These students will form a cadre of talented professionals who will move into
leadership roles in their chosen fields in science and engineering. They will
also serve as group/role models to succeeding classes of students scholars. ***
