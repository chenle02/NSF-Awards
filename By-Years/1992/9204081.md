This award is made by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Research and
Molecular and Cellular Biology under the Materials Synthesis and Processing
Initiative. The broad goal of the research is to understand the conformations
and surface interactions of biomolecules at condensed phase interfaces, and the
chemical mechanisms of bioadhesion. The specific goals are to understand the
interactions between adhesive peptides and surfaces and to use these insights to
synthesize and characterize new biocompatible polypeptides having enhanced
adhesive and elastic properties. The focus of the work will be on peptides
related to the repeating decapeptide that comprises mussel adhesive protein
(MAP). The results will be applied to the design of new materials consisting of
adhesive and elastic polypeptide sequences. These adhesives are also expected to
be biocompatible and stable in vivo, providing a valuable new class of materials
for use in medical and bioanalytical applications. %%% This research will
provide new insights into the relationships between peptide and protein primary
structure; into the chemical interactions governing biopolymer adhesion and
folding at surfaces; and in the development of novel biocompatible adhesives
with optimized mechanical properties.
