They will continue their studies of defects, disorder and phase transition in
materials. The principle research techniques are X-ray and neutron scattering
and computer modeling/simulation. The materials they will investigate as part of
their ongoing program include: a) graphite intercalation compounds, b)
quasicrystals and c) superconductors. They also plan some new work on epitaxy
and coherency in GaAs films on (100) GaAs crystals.
