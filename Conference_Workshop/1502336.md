The conference "Elementary, analytic, and algorithmic number theory: Research
inspired by the mathematics of Carl Pomerance" will be held June 9-11, 2015 at
the University of Georgia in Athens, GA. The focus of this meeting is on three
subfields of number theory: elementary number theory (which studies the basic
properties of the natural numbers), analytic number theory (which takes a
statistical perspective on these questions), and algorithmic number theory
(which investigates how computers can be of assistance in answering number-
theoretic questions). These three areas of mathematics are highly
interconnected, with results in one area often stemming from progress in the
other. While of fundamental theoretical importance, ideas from these fields have
also found numerous applications outside of pure mathematics, digital security
being a prominent example.

The conference will feature six hour-long plenary talks and fourteen invited
30-minute talks by experts in these fields. The talks will highlight the current
state of research in these fields and draw attention to the central open
problems. On June 8, the day prior the start of the main conference activities,
the organizers will host a special day of talks by young researchers. The goal
here is to give visibility to up and coming mathematicians and to encourage
interchange of ideas - both vertically (among students, junior faculty, and
world-class researchers) and horizontally (among researchers in different fields
of number theory).
