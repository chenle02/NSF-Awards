Proposal Title: The Use of Arrays of Sensors and Actuators to Control Convective
Flows

The PI and his students will undertake a theoretical and experimental study of
active control of thermally induced convective flows. Because such flows are
nonlinear with many degrees of freedom, effective control is quite difficult.
The research will extend previous work to develop means by which all sensors can
interact with all the actuators simultaneously. Numerical simulations will be
carried out to study the dynamics of the controlled system, and experiments will
be conducted in upright circular cylinders with different aspect ratios, using
different liquids having a wide range of Prandtl numbers, while employing arrays
of micro-fabricated sensors and actuators. This is a fundamental study that has
the potential of enabling control strategies for modifying transport phenomena
in significant industrial processes. The research should also facilitate the
integration of active control strategies with thermal transport into new
educational materials.
