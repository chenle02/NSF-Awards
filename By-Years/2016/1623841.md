Lignin is a plant-derived biopolymer that is the main byproduct of paper and
cellulosic ethanol production. While &gt;100 million tons are generated
annually, only a small fraction finds technological application. In plants,
lignin acts as a binder between cellulose fibers, so it has natural interfacial
functionality. The Washburn Lab at CMU has developed a strategy for preparing
high-performance surfactants based on a lignin core grafted with water-soluble
polymers. The I-Corps team will be focused on exploring applications of these
lignin surfactants in delivering herbicides used in agriculture. Many herbicides
have low solubility in water, and a broad range of chemicals is used to apply
them in the field. However, many of these chemicals are toxic and persistent in
the environment. In addition to being based on a renewable resource, lignin-
based surfactants are biocompatible and biodegradable, making them a potentially
high-impact chemical technology in agricultural
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team is exploring applications
of this technology as an adjuvant for the delivery of agrochemicals. The
combination of reducing surface tension, low solution viscosity, and strong
affinity for aromatic compounds that are common herbicides make these an
attractive candidate from a performance perspective, and the intrinsic natural
biodegradability and lack of toxicity could address many of issues facing the
current generation of surfactants used in agriculture. However, agrochemical
adjuvants represent a complex class of chemicals, and it will be critical to
interview experts in chemical companies that make other adjuvants, formulations
companies that sell directly to farmers, and end-users to understand better
their needs. In addition, preliminary pilot-scale manufacturing will be
performed to prepare kilogram quantities of materials for field tests and to
assess variables such as coupling efficiency and kraft lignin source on the
properties of the final product.
