Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will attempt to shed light
on the origin of the masses of the quarks and the leptons (the electron, its
neutrino, and related particles). Models of the masses of these particles which
are consistent with observed particle - mass related phenomena such as the solar
neutrino deficit will be studied. Models of neutrino masses are important as
guidance for future experiments aimed at searching for evidence of these masses.
In addition, the origin of the masses of the elementary particles is one of the
outstanding puzzles of elementary particle physics, so that studies of masses
are very important.
