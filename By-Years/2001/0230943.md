Professor Steve Leone of University of Colorado is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on alignment and
control of small molecules. The work involves use of shaped ultrafast laser
pulses for phase and amplitude control of electron dynamics within bonded
species. This proposal seeks to continue development of experimental methods in
this area, this time utilizing triatomic molecules, e.g. SO2. In addition, high
rotor states of the Li dimer will be utilized. Sophisticated genetic algorithms
will be explored as a means of tailoring matter-field interactions to optimize a
desired outcome. The work will provide much needed data for theoretical advances
in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to control molecular processes
utilizing lasers could have implications in areas such as quantum information
science. This pioneering study will explore the capabilities and limitations of
laser control of molecular events in diatomic and triatomic species. &lt;br/&gt;
