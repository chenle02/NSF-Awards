Tom Parker will continue his work in gauge theory. This is currently an
extremely active and important part of mathematics. It is important in
mathematical physics because of its significance in quantum Yang-Mills theory
and in topology because of its implications for diffeomorphism types of four
dimensional manifolds. The central objects of study are the moduli spaces of
self dual connections on vector bundles over a four dimensional Riemannian
manifold. Parker's intention is to investigate the geometry of these spaces as
Riemannian manifolds. This will build on the present topological descriptions
and will help to provide answers to some problems of physical interest.
