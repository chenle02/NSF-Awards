The genus Mimosa is a diverse group of tropical and sub- tropical plants. Dr.
Rupert Barneby has finished the first complete systematic monograph on the genus
since 1875. The New York Botanical Garden proposes to publish this monograph in
its Memoir Series. Dr. Barneby's monograph will bring together several
generations' knowledge of this diverse tropical plant group. Much of Barneby's
research has been supported by National Science Foundation. The proposed
publication will be used world-wide as the authoritative treatment of an
important plant genus. Ecologists, horticulturists, systematic botanists, and
investigators in diverse other fields will benefit from this monograph.
Publication in the Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden Memoirs will ensure
a wide readership, and will catalyze further research.
