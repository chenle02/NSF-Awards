9412684 McGeary A deep multichannel seismic reflection survey of the Aleutian
arc and the extensive Alaskina continental shelf will delineate and
differentiate arc magmatism and terrain accretion. The high-quality images of
the deep structure of the crust and uppermost mantle, when combined with the
well-mapped onshore geology, should allow the principal investigators to
constrain the mechanisms of accretion and magmatism.
