9630694 Crill This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental
Geochemistry &amp; Biogeochemistry solicitation, NSF 96-2. It is being jointly
funded by the Division of Earth Sciences, Atmospheric Sciences, and
Environmental Biology. The proposed research will address the biogeochemistry of
methyl bromide, a trace gas that plays a central role in stratospheric and
tropospheric ozone balance. Limited information is available about its sinks,
particularly the irreversible uptake and degradation by deposition to soils. The
PIs propose to determine the effective CH3Br loss rate and the controlling
chemical, physical, and biological parameters on representative soil and
vegetative surfaces at near-ambient gas phase mixing ratios. The proposed
research has three objectives: (1) to determine the rate and ubiquity of CH3Br
consumption by soils at near ambient levels, (2) to determine in a quantitative
manner the controls on soils consumption of CH3Br, and (3) to determine the
magnitude and seasonality of deposition rates of CH3Br by direct measurements of
soil exchange using chambers over a mature forest soil and an agricultural soil
in the northeastern U.S..
