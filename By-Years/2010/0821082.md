With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Michael
J. Shaw and colleagues Yun Lu, Eric J. Voss, Paul E. Wanda and Chin-Chuan Wei
from Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville upgrade an Electron
Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This spectrometer will allow a core
of users to pursue research in: (1) functionalization of conducting molecular
wires, (2) changes in cell membrane fluidity during apoptosis, (3) regulation of
reactive species by plants and animals and mechanisms of NO synthesis, (4)
efforts to eliminate organic solvents in organic synthesis, (5) Cleavage of DNA
by metal-bipyridyl complexes, (6) sol-gel synthesis of variable composition
glasses, (7) free radicals in xenon difluoride reactions, and (8) study of
porous bimetallic cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
EPR spectrometer yields information on the molecular and electronic structure of
molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free
radicals, short-lived species that are often essential for the initiation of
tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, such as inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, biology,
the environment and battery manufacturing. The spectrometer will also be used as
a training tool for the students while generating useful knowledge and serving a
broad base of users in Southwestern Illinois. &lt;br/&gt;
