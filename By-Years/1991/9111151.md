This is a proposal to support a Colloquium on Cellular and Tissue Engineering at
the upcoming fall meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society. The meeting
will be held on the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville on October
12-14, 1991. The research area of the Colloquium is developing rapidly, it
presents new engineering challenges, and it has the potential of achieving
significant impact through the development of better health care technology. The
area is also promising in the opening up of new avenues for potential commercial
developments.
