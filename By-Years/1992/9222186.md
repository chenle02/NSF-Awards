This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electrochemistry. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Murray and his students will pursue studies in (1)
the dynamics of electron self-exchange reactions and electron transfer cross-
reactions in polymeric phases and at their interfaces; (2) the diffusion
dynamics of redox solutes and of redox-labeled polymers within polymeric phases;
(3) the design and synthesis of new redox polymers and mixed valent polymer
phases; and (4) the electron transfer chemistry of selected redox proteins. The
polymer phase experiments involve polymer melts and glasses rather than the more
conventional monomeric fluid solvents. %%% This research will lead to the design
of new electrochemically based measurement tactics for obtaining data useful in
understanding the fundamental principles involved in electron transfer and mass
transport dynamics. Also, it should lead to new classes of redox polymer
electrolytes and new insights into their physical chemistry that will enable
their effective utilization in novel electrochemical sensor technology.
