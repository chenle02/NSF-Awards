The Department of Chemistry will purchase a HE Ne laser for use in the
undergraduate laboratory. A laboratory course in laser spectroscopy for
undergraduate junior and senior science majors will be developed. The goal of
this course is to give students the opportunity to study a special topic in more
detail than is possible in their science courses and, at the same time, to
provide an enjoyable laboratory experience. The course is divided into three
sections. The first section will involve the use of a He Ne laser with a
collection of optical components to study the properties of laser light. Also,
the chemical processes of lasing action will be explained. In the second
section, students will explore the uses of two types of laser spectrometers, a
continuous-wave system using an argon ion laser source and a pulsed system using
a nitrogen-pumped dye laser. In the last section, students, in small groups,
will be given one or two projects which will make use of the above laser
systems. The projects will involve solving a stated problem rather than
following a cookbook procedure. The object of this approach is to encourage
students to think creatively and to interact with other students in solving
problems.
