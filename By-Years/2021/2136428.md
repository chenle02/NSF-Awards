The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to speed up the diagnosis of bacteremia, the
root cause of bacterial sepsis, a life-threatening condition wherein the bodyâ€™s
response to an infection injures its tissues and organs. Each hour of delay in
administering an effective antibiotic is associated with an estimated 7.6%
increase in mortality. This project can impact the treatment and currently
expensive care of 1.7 million US patients (49 million worldwide) annually.
Poorly suited antibiotics contribute to roughly 270,000 sepsis deaths each year
in the United States. This project will advance a rapid (1 hour) identification
of antibiotic susceptibility to enable switching from broad-spectrum antibiotic
treatment to targeting the specific organism causing sepsis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-I project
explores the feasibility of a fluorescence system to detect bacterial metabolic
activity and determine antibiotic susceptibility in an hour, with the goal of
achieving high sensitivity and specificity while lowering false positive or
negative rates common in early results This project will advance the technology
in three critical areas: (1) designing a disposable test cartridge that
integrates the separation of bacteria from whole blood and introduction of
fluorescent dye; (2) limiting background fluorescence to increase result
accuracy; and (3) developing software that provides users with easily
interpreted results and reliable process control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
