This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site at the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Arizona for another
three years. NSF funds will provide stipends for nine students with the
University of Arizona providing stipends for an additional ten students.
Students will apply to the REU program and once selected by a faculty/student
committee, they interview several of the 110 participating faculty sponsors
before deciding with whom they wish to work. This matching process insures that
students will be working on a problem that is of interest to them and fosters a
productive working relationship. Students then pursue their research problems as
part of a research group. In addition to students' research, lab meetings and
seminars, the program offers an orientation that includes radiation and
laboratory safety training and a weekly brown bag lunch where students and
faculty discuss issues and careers in biology and biological research. There is
an annual Undergraduate Biology Research Conference and an Undergraduate Biology
Colloquium Series featuring world renowned biologists. The common thread that
unites the program is that students are all involved in independent research on
some problem in biology.
