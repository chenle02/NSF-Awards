This award supports the organization of CPSWEEK-Cyber Physical Systems Week, the
first instantiation of a conference cluster that brings together three
previously separate conferences under the banner of Cyber-Physical Systems. The
constituent conferences are: Hybrid Systems - Computation and Control (HSCC),
the Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS), and
Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN). CPSWEEK is held in St Louis
from April 21 to April 24, 2008. NSF funding supports student participation in
the conferences and the associated workshops and poster sessions.
