Development of theoretical models for electron and positron collisions with
atoms will be developed. Both perturbative and non-perturbative techniques will
be used. Perturbative calculations, exact to second order will be made for
electron and positron scattering from helium, sodium and the heavier rare gases.
Optical potential model calculations will be made using a close coupling
approach for the same atoms.
