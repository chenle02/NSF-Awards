The University of Hawaii will initiate a six-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Environmental Science for 40 students entering grades 10-12. Students
will study an urban estuary and explore potential environmental enhancement.
Studies will include biological, chemical, geological, and physical assessment
and evaluation of potential environmental enhancement using a civil engineering
approach and computer modeling.
