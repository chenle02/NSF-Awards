Determinants of human physical development have long been a central question of
physical anthropology. This dissertation improvement proposal intends to assess
the use of bilateral asymmetries as a measure of pre-natal stress. In order to
investigate the relationship of stress to asymmetry, the student will study
cohorts of full-term infants of appropriate for age weights and compare the
level of asymmetry exhibited in that group with the level seen in full-term
growth retarded newborns. Additionally, the parents of all infants will be
measured for the same suite of bilateral traits. This will allow estimation of
genetic versus environment effects. The researchers hypothesize that the normal
weight infants will exhibit less bilateral asymmetry. Additional, all newborns
will be followed over one year and measured at defined intervals. This will
allow estimates of longitudinal changes in bilateral symmetry, a poorly
documented aspect of human biological variability.
