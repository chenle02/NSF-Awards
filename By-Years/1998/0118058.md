&lt;br/&gt;Spilhaus, A.
Frederick&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0118058&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide
funds for a Chapman Conference on Exploration Geodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Chapman
Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union
(AGU) and are designed to promote opportunities not normally available through
the format of larger meetings. Funds will be used to support participant travel
expenses. Travel grants will be made on a competitive and need basis. The
convenors expect to issue approximately 12 awards at an average of $1,000 per
award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conveners of the conference seek to bring
together an international cross section of the geodynamics modeling community,
with the likely industry beneficiaries of "exploration geodynamics" in mineral
and petroleum exploration. The targeted audience will be leading practitioners
of geodynamic modeling, exploration managers and scientists from exploration
divisions of leading resource companies, and, to catalyze the interaction,
consultants and academics who have been instrumental in bringing basic science
through to industry. Graduate students will be strongly encouraged to attend
through a reduced registration fee and preferential access to travel
grants.&lt;br/&gt;
