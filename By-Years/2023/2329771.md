This award provides student subsistence for the 2023 Oregon Programming
Languages Summer School (OPLSS). This summer school provides an important and
valuable educational opportunity for students to study foundational topics
related to programming languages and verification. The focus of this year's
school is "Types, Semantics, and Logic". The significance and importance of the
summer school include: instruction on how to build and reason about reliability
and correctness of computing systems; building international community and
cooperation in foundational research areas; and enhancing education of US
students, including students from underrepresented groups, by exposure to and
interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based
students, the school will thus train the next generation of researchers and
practitioners in both industry and academia. This year's edition of the summer
school has an all-woman roster of lecturers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
