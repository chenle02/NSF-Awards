&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics and has a
very rich history. Modern number theorists are interested in the field of
algebraic numbers (numbers that satisfy a polynomial equation with rational
coefficients) and its group of symmetries (which is an example of a Galois
group). The conjectures of Langlands and Fontaine-Mazur then predict that
representations of this group are intimately related to objects from distinct
branches of mathematics such as representation theory, analysis and algebraic
geometry. Progress on these conjectures has led to some spectacular results such
as Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and has been a driving force for much
development in neighboring fields. Objects of fundamental interest in this
theory, such as elliptic curves, play a large role in cryptography and internet
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the
correspondence, predicted by Langlands and Fontaine-Mazur, between Galois
representations and automorphic representations. This correspondence is still
largely conjectural but there has been much progress in recent years. The proof
of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture has been considerably generalized to rather
general potential automorphy theorems that apply to Galois representations of
arbitrary dimension. Such results have led, for example, to a proof of the Sato-
Tate conjecture. On the other hand, these results have the restriction that they
apply only to Galois representations with distinct Hodge-Tate weights. This
restriction rules out some well known examples of Galois representations such as
Artin representations and the Tate modules of abelian varieties of dimension
greater than one. The principal goal of this project is to develop modularity
results that apply to Galois representations with repeated Hodge-Tate
weights.&lt;br/&gt;
