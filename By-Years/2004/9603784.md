Abstract 9603784 Chiles The goal of the proposed research is to understand how B
lymphocytes grow and divide. B lymphocytes are cellular components of the animal
immune system and their major function is to produce antibodies or
immunoglobulins. Antibodies are proteins that bind foreign substances and aid in
their elimination from the body. When the immune system detects foreign
substance, B cells initially respond by growing and then producing antibodies.
Proliferation of B cells is controlled by both extracellular growth stimulatory
and inhibitory signals acting principally in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The
intracellular mechanisms by which these different signals produce changes in the
growth response of B lymphocytes are unknown. The present work focuses on the
regulation of a protein kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdck4). It is
proposed that Cdk4 is a necessary component in B cells which functions to
mediate the action of extracellular growth signals. Cdk4 has been shown to
activate cellular proteins involved in promoting cell division and maturation in
many non-lymphoid cell types. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the
activation of Cdk4 by growth promoting and growth inhibitory signals in primary
B cell is the major focus of this study. A comprehensive analysis will be made
of the regulation of intracellular proteins that control the activity of Cdk4,
including G1 cyclin and Cdk inhibitor proteins (Cdk-1s). Studies will also focus
on ascertaining whether Cdk4 is required for cell cycle division by blocking the
expression of Cdk4 in B cells The results of these studies will define the
regulation of key cell cycle regulatory components which directly control the
clonal expansion of primary B lymphocytes. These studies will be done in normal
B cells, whereas most studies are done on cell lines. These studies are aimed at
determining the regulation of the cell cycle in response to growth stimulatory
and inhibitory signals which control the expansion of mature normal B cells. ***
