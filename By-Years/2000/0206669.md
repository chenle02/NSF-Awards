This project will use a 2.5-dimension parallel-particle-in-cell (PPIC) computer
code to simulate the interaction of Alfven waves and plasma in the ionosphere.
The simulations will be driven either by imposed current sheets or by imposed
perpendicular electric fields as boundary conditions. Accelerated electrons and
ions in the structure drive waves which in turn affect the charged particles.
The waves and particles react back on the potential structure. The simulation
thus provides a self-consistent feedback loop. The technique will be used to
study (1) the electrodynamics of two-dimensional auroral mesoscale potential
structures in the return current region, (2) the formation of double layers, (3)
the processes which generate counter streaming electrons, (4) transverse ion
acceleration, and (5) the role of electron phase-space density holes in
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.
