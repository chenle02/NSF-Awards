This award supports the research of Professor P. Edelman to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate the combinatorics of hyperplane
arrangements. This will include a detailed study of the counterexample to
Orlik's conjecture and a continuation of work on h-complexes and h-shellings.
The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to
find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be
organized. And, so it is extremely important to modern communications, for
example the design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of
algorithms in computer science.
