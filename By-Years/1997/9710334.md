Cambria County Area Community College will use this grant to connect the Hiram
G. Andrews Center to the Internet. The Hiram G. Andrews Center is one of the
nation's oldest postsecondary trade and technical schools dedicated to the
comprehensive rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. Located in rural
Pennsylvania it needs the Internet connection to be able to access information
resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will
benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community
in general. The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
