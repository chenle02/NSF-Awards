The proposed project, "TERRACORPS," will develop an ecological science program
for grades 6 to 8 through performance-based series of classroom activities, real
life applications, and dissemination activity stages. Thirty-six modules of
instruction will represent life, physical, and earth science topics. General
activities in field studies, plus correlative units in social science, math, and
language arts will be included in the project. The units will be arranged into
three levels of proficiency, each with increasing skills and higher levels of
measurement, concepts, and knowledge. A video-based teacher training component
will be developed for instructional support. "TERRACORPS" will be implemented
with 600 students in twelve initial sites the first year followed by 1200
students and twenty sites the second year. This is a strong project involving
cooperation among numbers of Jet Propulsion Laboratory/NASA, a school district
and university faculty. The proposal addresses a clear need for creating global
awareness at this grade level and promises to have a substantial impact
throughout the nation by providing a replicable model.
