The National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)
will establish a new standing Committee on Global Change to serve inter alia as
the U.S. National Committee for the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program
(IGBP): A Study of Global Change. This committee will provide guidance to the
Federal agencies concerning planning and implementation of U.S. Scientific
activities in support of the IGBP and will serve as the primary channel of
communication between the U.S. scientific community, interested Federal
agencies, and the IGBP's international nongovernmental planning and coordinating
bodies. The new committee will coordinate its efforts closely with those of
other NAS/NRC committees working in related areas and will assure that the
Geosphere-Biosphere Program (SCGB) is kept fully apprised of the U.S.
Committee's activities.
