Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for biological production in the ocean.
Diagenetic processing and burial efficiency of P in marine sediments exert a
major control on marine biogeochemical cycles. Over geologic time, the level of
P in the ocean will be controlled to a large extent by its rate of burial in
marine sediments. This is crucial to the development of realistic, predictive,
biogeochemical models and to the interpretation of the sedimentary record.
Detailed solid-phase p data, generated using a new selective sequential
extraction (SEDEX) technique, will be collected for a diverse suite of typical
marine environments and one river-estuary-delta system (the Mississippi). Phase
s responsible for P retention by marine sediments will be identified by
examining solid-phase P redistribution with depth in sediments in conjunction
with pore water and other solid-phase data. This approach provides insight into
the early diagenetic chemical reactions responsible for formation and
preservation of these phases. Diagenetic modeling will be used to test
interpretations made on the basis of solid-phase and pore water data and to draw
further conclusions as to rates of the chemical processes inferred. Comparison
of the quantity and chemical nature of solid-phase P to pore water gradients
over fine-scale (mm) depth intervals near the sediment-water interface will
permit quantification and characterization of P cycling and burial efficiency
near this interface. The extent of biogeochemical processing of particulate P
during transit across a particular continent-ocean interface will be quantified
by comparing solid-phase P speciation in Mississippi River/Estuary suspended
matter with that in associated deltaic sediments. Depositional environmental
controls on P burial will be generated from which to construct a global marine P
budget.
