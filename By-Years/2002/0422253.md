This project is attracting and supporting students to the areas of mathematics,
engineering science, drafting, multimedia, computer information systems,
information technology, and computer systems and networking. Technology
Opportunity Pathway (TOP) provides 30 scholars who demonstrate academic skills
and personal readiness with scholarships. Intellectual Merit: The scholarship
program objectives are to (1) increase the number of students, including those
from underrepresented groups, as a result of targeted recruitment and
scholarship aid; 2) improve student persistence and GPA with orientation,
mentoring, tracking, and support services; and 3) provide assistance for
students to transfer to a four-year institution or to seek employment in a
technical field. The TOP Team consists of five faculty members and the Dean of
Enrollment Management. Recruitment materials and support service activities are
being developed to promote the program to traditional and adult learners. TOP
scholars are selected based on financial need, academic merit, professional
readiness, and personal information. The TOP team is developing and maintaining
relationships with local businesses to promote internships and career and
transfer opportunities. A significant component is the required participation in
college and TOP student services activities. Meetings and workshops feature
guest speakers and skills to provide scholars with useful information, training,
and survival strategies aimed at educating a highly skilled technical workforce.
These meetings help form a community of faculty and peers and promote lifetime
learning skills and professionalism.

Broader Impact: The program outcomes are being compiled at the end of each
semester and summary data is being reported on a TOP Scholar page linked to the
college website. Presentations are being made at statewide and national
conferences. The principal investigators are collaborating with other CSEMS
projects and sharing program outcomes with colleagues through publications and
at professional conferences.
