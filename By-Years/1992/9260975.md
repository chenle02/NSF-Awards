This Phase I SBIR project investigates a new fiber-optics sensing and
communications system, Smart Skin Array Technology (SSAT) which shows promise in
detecting and measuring localized cracks in civil engineering structures caused
by earthquakes. The proposed approach extends the existing advantages of fiber
optics for sensing to the development of localized, real time, high reslution
surface crack sensing array systems. Application of such systems would lessen
the need to interrupt facilities' use for maintenance inspection purposes. The
investigation consists of sample fabrication, testing and analysis to
demonstrate technical feasibility within a laboratory environment. Also the
hardware and software specifications for data acquisition, recording and display
of cracking events will be developed.
