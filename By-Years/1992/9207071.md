In its many guises, harmonic measure lies at the heart of many deep problems
arising in complex function theory, potential theory and, of late, analytic
dynamics. The definition is particularly simple. For a given domain in Euclidean
space of any dimension, a function is defined to equal one on a given subset of
the boundary and zero on the rest of the boundary. Harmonic measure is that
harmonic function on the domain possessing these boundary values (or the value
of the function at any specified point). It is also the probability that a
Brownian path issuing from a fixed interior point first hits the boundary in the
given set. The main theme of this research is to explore the fine structure of
harmonic measure on fractal boundaries and to relate it, by means of fractal
approximation, to certain stochastic properties of harmonic measure of general
domains. This work begins a systematic study of the so-called dimension spectrum
which describes properties of harmonic measure. It is relevant to the large
deviation theory in stochastic processes. The main topics of study are: 1.
Estimates of universals bounds for the dimension spectrum. 2. Fractal
approximation theory. 3. Properties and numerical parameters of the dimension
spectrum for particular Julia sets and other important classes of fractals.
