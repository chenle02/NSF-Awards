This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Miami University at Oxford for the
renovation and repair of Culler Hall which houses the atomic-molecular-optical
and the condensed matter-magnetics research and research training activities of
the Physics Department. This building was constructed in 1960 and has not been
renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $725,000 and $964,471 provided by
the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and
research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve the
current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of the
quality and quantity of research that can be conducted by providing adequate
power, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and lighting and by
reconfiguring the space for more efficient use. The renovation will at the same
time create a flexible research facility with a subdivision of space easily
adaptable to changing conditions and research interests. This award contributes
to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the
conduct of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and master's
degree students in a Physics department with a strong commitment to student
involvement in research training activities. This renovation will increase the
number of students who can be accommodated in a program which has won awards for
its quality.
