This proposal involves empirical and theoretical studies of collective decision
making (e.g committees) with a special emphasis on the processes through which
the participants sufficiently resolve associated conflict of interest to achieve
a decision while striving to satisfy their own purposes within the formal rules
governing the decision process of the group. Thus, the project's focus is on
those collective decision situations in which the conflict of interests is
sufficiently compelling that they are resolved through a competitive process,
governed by the formal rules, rather than through a cooperative search for
equity. Ultimately this research could have important implications for
collective decisions involving multiple jurisdictions such as siting a facility
for disposal of hazardous wastes where one community may have the right to
exclude the site from its own territory but be unable to site the facility in
another jurisdiction.
