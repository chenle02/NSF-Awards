9453095 Demee-Benoit The San Francisco Zoological Society will use this planning
grant to involve representatives of their audience in the development of the
learning experiences that will be encorporated into their new exhibit program
"ZooWEB: Worldwide Education for Biodiversity." They will bring together an
Advisory Panel made up of representatives of a broad spectrum of potential and
current zoo visitors (traditionally underserved groups, formal education
specialists, people with special needs, family groups, scientists) and science
educators to meet with the zoo's Planning Team who are developing the master
interpretive plan called ZOO Web. ZooWEB will adapt ecological themes and topics
from the section of Systems and Interactions in the California State Science
Framework for Public Schools. The planning activity is a modification of a
business model designed to understand and meet customer needs by constant
improvement of product and service quality pioneered by W. Edwards Deming. This
is a considerable departure from the traditional manner in which zoo
interpretation is developed. Thus, the Zoo will implement a new approach to
exhibit development, one that begins with focusing on visitors' interests in
science, their needs, learning styles, perceptions of zoos, etc. Data will be
gathered by a number of techniques including focus groups, interviews, and
surveys. Results of the planning activity will be broadly disseminated.
