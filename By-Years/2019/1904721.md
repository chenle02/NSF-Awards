This award will support meetings of the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar
(PNGS) to be held at the University of British Columbia, the University of
Washington, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, Portland State
University, and Lewis &amp; Clark College, beginning in Spring 2019. PNGS
meetings generally feature six invited research talks by leading experts in
differential geometry and geometrical analysis. The meetings also include
discussion sessions in which the speakers and participants assess the state of
various areas in geometry and highlight open problems in these
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of very active researchers in
geometry scattered throughout the various colleges and universities involved in
the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar. PNGS meetings will bring these
researchers together for consultation, collaboration, and stimulation of new
ideas. A significant number of research programs have been initiated as a result
of interactions at past meetings. The PNGS series is especially valuable for
graduate students in geometry at the participating universities which have small
geometry groups. PNGS meetings give these students an excellent opportunity to
see the broader picture of research in geometry. The meetings are also very
valuable for the growing number of geometers working at some of the smaller
universities in the region, such as Pacific University, Seattle University, and
Idaho State University. More information can be found on the conference website:

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
