Discrete optimization is one of the most important areas of operations research,
and deals with the methodology of finding optimal solutions to problems
involving variables which must take integer (i.e. non-fractional) values. Its
applications occur in numerous areas of science, technology, management, etc.,
and include problems as diverse as those of determining the optimal locations of
warehouses, VLSI chip design, airline crew scheduling, etc. The main goal of
DO'99 is to provide an overview of the current state of the art in the field of
discrete optimization. For this purpose, 23 of the most prominent researchers
active in this field will provide state of the art presentations of various
subareas of this discipline. The current project's objective is to make it
possible for a larger number of junior researchers, post-doctoral fellows and
graduate students to participate in the meeting and attend the lectures of these
world-renowned experts. At the same time, these participants will also have the
opportunity to present papers about their own research, and to establish
contacts both with the senior participants and with their peers. The funds made
available through this project will be used entirely to provide stipends for
participants.
