ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0221472&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of
tropospheric halocarbons as a source for stratospheric halogens and ozone
depletion is well recognized. Industrial production of longer-lived CFC's have
been banned under the Montreal Protocol and Clean Air Act, however the time
scale for recovery of the ozone layer from such molecules is on the order of
decades. As a result, attention has shifted towards the shorter-lived
halocarbons that respond more rapidly to changes in emissions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers at the University of
California at Irvine will continue their ongoing efforts to understand the role
of the oceans in the biogeochemical cycling of low molecular-weight halocarbons,
like methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl). In this phase of their
research, oceanic degradation studies will be continued in order to extend prior
spatial and temporal coverage of the oceans, and to include methyl chloride
(CH3Cl). The degradation of other natural halogenated compounds such as
dibromomethane (CH2Br2), bromoform (CHBr3), and methyl iodide (CH3I) will also
be studied in coastal seawater. The proposed measurements will result in revised
estimates for the uptake of atmospheric halocarbons by the oceans, the extent to
which the oceans can buffer atmospheric halocarbon concentrations, and the
production rate for these gases in the surface oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
