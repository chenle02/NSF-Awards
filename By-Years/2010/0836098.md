OISE 08-36098 Ann Stapleton University of North Carolina - Wilmington

This is a planning visit that provides support for the PI and one of her
undergraduate students to travel to Cardiff University in the United Kingdom.
The US principal investigator is Ann Stapleton from the University of North
Carolina at Wilmington. The foreign collaborator is Gerlad Richter, an expert in
photochemistry and biochemistry. The primary purpose of this visit is to
establish a long-term collaborative partnership between the PI and Professor
Richter.

The focus of their research is on ultraviolet-B (UV-B) photoreceptors. No UV-B
photoreceptor has been identified despite intensive effort by scientists world-
wide. Mutant characterization of a candidate protein from Arabidopsis thaliana
has provided intriguing mechanistic hypotheses for further biochemical analysis.
Biochemical characterization of the first UV-B photoreceptor is key to
understanding ozone depletion effects, such as prediction of the potential
extent of trophic level alterations with increased UV-B. Together, the
researchers will order a synthetic gene with optimized codon usage for E. coli
expression.
