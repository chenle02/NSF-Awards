A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V
Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by
Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System. BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for
profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New
York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the
ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but
specifically work in support of the BATS program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 157
days funded in 2015, all but 38 of which (76%) were for NSF. In 20165, the
vessel is scheduled to sail 160 days with 120 (75%) of them funded by NSF. With
this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTD System Upgrades
$156,617&lt;br/&gt;Meteorological System Upgrades $20,367&lt;br/&gt;Data
Acquisition System and Network Upgrades $20,260&lt;br/&gt;
$197,244&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present
proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF
13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and
its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
