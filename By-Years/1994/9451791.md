9451791 Budnik A new undergraduate laboratory course in neurosciences will
expose students to the fields of neuroanatomy and neural development, and will
emphasize recent advances in these two disciplines that have resulted from
genetic approaches. Students will be introduced to state-of-the-art technologies
that currently play such an important role in neuroscience research. The main
idea underlying this course is to develop these techniques around interesting
scientific questions that will teach the students about the fundamental
organization of the CNS, and about the process of doing science. This course
will become one of the focal points for an undergraduate neuroscience and
behavior "concentration" within the university. In recent years, the philosophy
of life science education at the University of Massachusetts is shifting from a
"textbook" science education for undergraduates to a more hands-on approach. The
proposed laboratory course will be part of a more extensive research experience
for undergraduates. Our long range goal is to create an integrated training
curriculum that would attract undergraduates to careers in biology in general
and to neuroscience in particular. The requested equipment will serve the formal
laboratory in one semester, will serve other courses in the neuroscience
concentration, and will be the center of an honors laboratory and Research
Experience for Undergraduates during the summer and intersession.
