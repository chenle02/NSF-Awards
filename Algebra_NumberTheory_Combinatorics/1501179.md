This project will study the structure of certain finite-dimensional Hopf
algebras, their categories of representations, and spherical fusion categories.
The main part of this project concerns some categorical arithmetic invariants
such as dimensions, exponents, Frobenius-Schur indicators, and representations
of the modular group associated with modular tensor categories. These arithmetic
invariants are closely related among each other, and they serve as important
tools for studying these algebraic structures. A basic question is the
relationship between the prime factors of the dimension of a simple object and
those of the quasi-exponent of the underlying category. Any progress here would
help in proving a conjecture of Kaplansky on semisimple Hopf algebras that
remains open. The project also concerns the classification of Hopf algebras
whose dimensions admit a simple prime factorization. Progress on the preceding
basic question would also help in classifying finite-dimensional Hopf algebras.

The appeal of symmetry has been guidance for understanding the nature of
science. Some symmetry can be described in terms of algebraic structures. For
instance, the symmetry of platonic solids can be described by some finite groups
of spatial rotations. Hopf algebras and tensor categories are generalizations of
groups which can also describe the symmetry of some physical systems. They
appear naturally in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics such as
conformal field theory, statistical mechanics, and quantum computations. Thus, a
deeper understanding of these algebraic structures is of fundamental importance
and it will eventually be useful in the other areas of science.
