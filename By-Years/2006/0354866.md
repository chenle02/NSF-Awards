This grant provides funding for the development of statistical methods for the
effective monitoring of curves that represent the quality of a process or
product. In most current statistical process control applications in industry it
is assumed that that quality can be adequately represented by the distribution
of a univariate quality characteristic or by the general multivariate
distribution of a vector consisting of several correlated quality
characteristics. In many practical situations, however, the quality of a process
or product is better characterized and summarized by a relationship between a
response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Thus, at each sampling
stage one observes a collection of data points that can be represented by a
curve (or profile). In some calibration applications, the profile can be
represented adequately by a simple straight-line model, while in other
applications more complicated models are needed. In this work control charts
will be developed and evaluated to monitor such process and product quality
profiles. This application will be related to functional data analysis and
methods will be developed for linear profiles, nonlinear profiles, and those
currently handled using splines and wavelets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results
of this research will lead to more effective use of industrial data to
characterize and monitor the quality of processes and products. In particular,
the methods can be used to monitor calibration relationships and avoid the over-
calibration of measurement devices. This lowers costs and improves measurement
accuracy. Applications exist in the pharmaceutical industry in the monitoring of
non-linear dose-response curves of successive batches of drugs. Applications
have been identified and data have already been obtained in semiconductor
manufacturing and in the calibration of chemical and other measurement
processes, including one at NASA. &lt;br/&gt;
