The notion of interpolation indicated by the title of Professor Slodkowski's
mathematical research project may be explained as follows. Mathematical objects
of many sorts frequently come not singly but in whole families, individual
members of which are located by specifying the value of a parameter. (For
instance, a famous family of Banach spaces is indexed by the set of real numbers
greater than or equal to one, with plus infinity thrown in for completeness.)
The general problem of interpolation is: given members of the family located by
extreme values of the parameter, fill in all the rest in some natural, optimal
way. The particular interpolation problems addressed by this project have
fundamental implications for mathematical analysis. More specifically, these
problems have to do with multivariable complex interpolation theory and some
related aspects of complex convexity. They are divided into three broad
categories. The problems in the first group deal with the interpolation of
infinite-dimensional spaces, regularity questions, and interpolation of convex
and polynomially convex sets. The second category of problems concerns
polynomially convex hulls. The third has to do with multifunctions that satisfy
analogues of the function-theoretic properties of analyticity and harmonicity.
