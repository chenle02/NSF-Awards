This award supports research in the general area of noncommutative ring theory.
The principal investigator will investigate the structure of skew polynomial
rings, quantum coordinate algebras, noetherian rings, and related rings. This
research is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object
having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the
additive operation satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation
is not required to do so. An example of a ring for which multiplication is not
commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of
noncommutative rings has become an important part of algebra because of its
increasing significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
