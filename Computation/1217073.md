The objective of this project is to create and implement new methods for
improving the performance of filtering, or data assimilation techniques, applied
to non-linear, non-Gaussian systems. Many problems in computational statistics,
artificial intelligence, and geophysics involve such systems, and utilize
specialized Monte Carlo sampling methods, called particle filters, for data
analysis and forecasting, and for better understanding of the underlying
phenomena. The principal investigator studies variational data assimilation
methods to demonstrate that targeted ensemble generation using those methods
delivers more effective filter performance, and that dynamic adaptation of the
size of the particle ensemble improves the computational efficiency of the
filter.

Statistical computations are an essential tool for the solution of problems in
such diverse areas as artificial intelligence, industrial and consumer
electronics, robotics, weather systems, climate change, ocean ecosystems, and
land surface processes. The proposed research improves statistical computations
required for the analysis, estimation, and forecasting of information that
arrives over time, and contributes to a better combination of theoretical models
with observational data. In addition, the project involves the training of
undergraduate students in applied scientific research.
