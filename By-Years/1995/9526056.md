9526056 Haimes Floods produce every year escalating losses that impact the
economic and environmental well-being of important regions of the Nation.
Protecting against these natural disasters is the goal of the project by which a
model will be developed that will improve the accounting, in a systems-
engineering framework, for: a) the significant coupling in the performance of
distributed flood-control structures, including non-structural measures; b) the
costs, risk and benefits of the flood-control systems evaluated over many years
and for multiple events; c) the potential evolution of economic development and
physical conditions affecting the performance of the system; and d) the multiple
and often conflicting objectives will incorporate data from floods occurred in
the Mississippi River basin and will benefit the assessment of risk, and the
design and implementation of sustainable flood mitigation measures. ***
