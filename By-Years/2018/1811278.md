The research projects involve the interplay between the study of algebraic
structures and topology, the study of shapes or spaces. Algebraic topologists
use algebraic structures to describe and simplify topological phenomena.
Spectra, which represent cohomology theories, are algebraic structures built out
of topological spaces and hence are useful for translating from one field to the
other. In one project, with co-authors, the PI will develop algebraic models for
several different topological settings in spectra. The PI continues to train
graduate students and disseminate research results. In addition, the PI is
involved with several organizations that promote the participation of women and
underrepresented minorities in mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
the first broad project the PI will continue her work with various coauthors on
developing homotopical settings for comodules and coalgebras. The motivations
for this project include applications to algebraic K-theory, connections with
chromatic homotopy theory and string theory, and development of computational
tools. In a second broad project, the PI continues to study when derived
equivalences can be realized by underlying richly structured equivalences. This
includes recognizing some homotopy categories as rigid, or having a unique (up
to equivalence) underlying homotopy theory (as has been shown, for example, for
rational circle-equivariant homotopy theory) and also recognizing some homotopy
categories as being modeled by non-equivalent homotopy
theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
