Cognitive radio is a promising paradigm for dramatically increasing the
utilization of wireless spectrum to support the continuing exponential growth in
wireless traffic. Research on cognitive networks has mainly focused on sensing
of spectrum opportunities and managing radio resources such that the primary
users' quality of service is not compromised. Much less attention has been paid
to the coexistence of secondary users, which may be associated with different
cognitive networks and seek to operate in the same frequency bands. Effective
coexistence of such users is essential for the success of future cognitive
networks, and is the main objective of this project. In addition, the
particularly open nature of cognitive radio raises significant new issues for
the security and privacy of the transmitted data, as well as new opportunities
for malicious behavior among cognitive or outside entities. The project
addresses all of these issues in a holistic
framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coexistence requires effective allocation of
radio resources in time, frequency, and space among multiple cognitive secondary
users, while respecting primary interference constraints. The investigators are
developing theoretical bounds for such radio resource management schemes and
designing low-overhead distributed algorithms, which account for the incentives
of competing secondary service providers as well as the stronger security and
privacy measures needed in a cognitive environment. Information-theoretic
physical-layer security techniques are being utilized to develop provably secure
paradigms for secondary cognitive users and game-theoretic models are being
adapted to study the robustness of these networks to various jamming attacks and
other malicious behavior.
