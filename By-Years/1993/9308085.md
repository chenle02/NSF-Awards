Lo This research is on a class of concurrent error detecting (CED) methods for
design in CMOS VLSI. The basis for the research is a novel built-in current
sensor which is critical to new design methods for CED circuits in static CMOS.
This technique is being applied to designs of floating point arithmetic units,
processor control units, on-chip cache memories, and fast fourier transform
processors. Algorithms for partitioning realistic faults into subsets, those
that are detectable by the current sensor and those that are not, are being
developed. New design rules for hardware redundancy are being explored.
