This grant is under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be utilized in the
following projects in the mathematics department: connections between finite
simple groups and nonassociative algebras; hyperbolic partial differential
equations describing plastic flow; closed form solutions of differential
equations; and some problems in optimization, with various applications.
