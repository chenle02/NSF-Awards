9312587 Shayman The proposed research project deals with supervisory control of
nondeterministic discrete event systems. Discrete event systems are systems
which involve quantities which take on a discrete set of values and which are
constant except at discrete times when events occur in the system. Examples
include communication networks, intelligent vehicle highway systems,
manufacturing systems and computer programs. Supervisory control theory was
developed to provide a mathematical framework for the design of controllers for
such systems in order to meet various qualitative constraints. A research
program on the supervisory control of nondeterministic systems will be
undertaken. Supervisory control of both untimed and timed systems will be
studied under complete as well as partial observation. Centralized as well as
decentralized, hierarchical and modular control techniques will be developed.
Efficient computational techniques to verify the existence of supervisors, to
synthesize them when they exist and to synthesize minimally restrictive
supervisors will be obtained. Both off-line and on-line computational techniques
will be considered. The results will be applied to the problem of integrated
management of communication networks. ***
