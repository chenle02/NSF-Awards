Graphical models provide means to capture uncertainty present in complex,
unstructured data in a succinct manner. They are particularly suited for
performing inference computation at scale. They hold potential to become primary
way to model uncertainty in modern data-driven decision-making tasks. This
project will enable this by developing efficient methods to learn graphical
model representation from observations. The outcome of this project will have
wide ranging impact in society and industry. This will include, but not
restricted to, our ability to understand human behavior in social networks,
processing information captured in biological experiments, automated language
and speech processing as well as capturing inter-relationship between various
financial instruments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A generic application of Graphical
model requires solving two basic tasks. First, given data, what is an
appropriate graphical model? And second, given a graphical model, how does one
perform inference from partial observations? Historically, domain knowledge was
used to choose the model, for example Hidden Markov Models in speech processing.
Therefore, a significant amount of effort has been devoted to the second
problem, of developing inference algorithms (for example, Belief propagation).
However, it is not at all clear what type of model to use for most modern
applications. Thus for modern applications the first problem of learning the
model is paramount. The goal of this project is to develop understanding, both
conceptual and algorithmic, of the problem of learning GMs from observed data.
One aspect of the project is to derive new lower bounds in order to understand
the interplay between fundamental statistical and computational limits. Informed
by these lower bounds, the project will seek to determine new and relevant model
subclasses for which learning is tractable accompanied by efficient learning
algorithms.
