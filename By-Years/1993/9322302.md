9322302 Weidner This award provides funds to continue a successful REU Site at
Furman University for another year. The proposed program will provide a
stimulating biological research experience for twelve talented students
recruited from Furman University and smaller, less research-oriented colleges in
South Carolina. The program is especially aimed at women, minority students, and
persons with disabilities; and such individuals will make up the majority of the
participants. Approximately half of the students will be rising seniors and half
will be rising sophomores. Approximately six research groups will be formed,
with the majority of groups consisting of a senior, a sophomore, and a faculty
research director. Research areas range from ecology to molecular biology. The
The goal of the program his to support productive, publishable research
involving undergraduates, with a special focus on promising younger students.
The program builds on a strong tradition of undergraduate research in a liberal
arts environment at Furman University and a successful NSF/REU program over the
past two summers. ***
