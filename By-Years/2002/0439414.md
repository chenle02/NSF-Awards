OISE-0439414&lt;br/&gt;Clift &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a
U.S.-Vietnam cooperative research project between Dr. Peter Cliff, Woods Hole
Institute of Oceanography and Professor Nguyen Anh Duc, Vietnam Petroleum
Institute to reconstruct the history of the Song River, Vietnam. They proposed
to analyze sediment sources from a core consisting 6 age intervals from a
petroleum borehole in the Honai Basin, Vietnam. This is a sophisticated approach
using Nd isotopes to study an important question in Asian tectonics. The results
can provide useful information on the effect of Himalayan uplift on this river
delta. This cooperation provides a good start for the limited interaction
between the geophysical communities in the U.S. and
Vietnam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
