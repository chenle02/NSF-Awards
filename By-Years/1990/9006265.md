The objective of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of the
factors that affect the energy costs of existence and costs of transport in six
species of ants. These insects have served as an empirical basis for economic
models of foraging and territorial defense; however quantitative tests of such
models have been limited by the absence of comparative data on actual energy
costs. Using sensitive computer-assisted sampling techniques developed in the
laboratory, the investigators plan to measure the metabolic rate of individual
ants at rest and actively exercising. They will examine the effects on energy
cost of such ecologically relevant variables as 1) body mass, 2) ambient
temperature, 3) running speed, and 4) load mass and mode of carriage. The first
comparative data on ventilation patterns in exercising insects will be gathered.
The goal is to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive body of data on the
energy transactions of an ecologically important group of small insects. Results
of the study will allow ecologists to accurately estimate energy costs from a
few easily measured environmental variables. Such an ability should encourage
more quantitative tests of ecological theory based on economic models. In
addition to these contributions to basic science, the proposed research should
have several practical applications, The work to date has made several technical
advances in the analysis of gas exchange in small insects, including the
development of software and instrumentation. The detailed analysis of gaits in
ants may prove useful in small machine robotics. In addition, data from the
study will help applied ecologists estimate changes in energy flow due to
habitat alteration in desert ecosystems.
