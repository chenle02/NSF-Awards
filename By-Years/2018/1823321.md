Title: HoloCamera: An Immersive Gigapixel Cyberinstrument for Creating Precision
Virtual Environments &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtual worlds need high-quality
realism for effective use. The HoloCamera will meet these needs. Using several
cameras and a computer cluster it will directly create dynamic virtual worlds.
Users will be able to freely move about and observe these virtual worlds as if
they were actually present there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HoloCamera will
advance the state of the art in light field capture and rendering, high-
performance computing, and embedded signal processing. The facility will aid
medical education and training, interactive imitation learning for robots, and
capturing fluent sign-language use in native signers. Virtual and augmented
reality offer exciting ways to educate students, particularly those from
underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM) disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
