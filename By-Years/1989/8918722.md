This research deals with the strength of pelletized aggregates of particle.
Aggregates will be examined by microscope to determine their geometry,
especially the radial variation of porosity. Pore size distributions will be
inferred from liquid penetration at low pressure. Stress-strain relationships
for individual agglomerates subjected to tension, torsion, shear will be
measured using a "nanotensilometer." The rupture of individual aggregates
suspended in a liquid undergoing shear in a cone and plate viscometer will be
observed. Aggregates of particles are encountered in materials processing, water
treatment, and elsewhere. Methods to assess and control aggregate strength where
needed.
