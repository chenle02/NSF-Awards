9452137 Towsley SUNY at Geneseo is a liberal-arts college with a significant
portion of its student population enrolled in majors in Mathematics, Computer
Science, and the various Natural Sciences. Calculus I is a required course in
most of these programs and highly recommended in the others. To improve the
effectiveness of Calculus I (and eventually Calculus II and III) a computer
laboratory session of two hours per week is being added. The lecture session is
being decreased from four hours per week to three. The goals of the laboratory
component are 1) to enable the student to explore a wider variety of
mathematical situations than are available to hand calculation, 2) to develop
understanding of the concepts of the calculus through writing and exploration,
3) to present applications of Calculus which are too detailed for lecture
presentation, and 4) to enable the students to use mathematical software such as
Mathcad. To equip this laboratory this project supports the acquisition of 30
computers, networking materials, and software. Approximately 1100 students per
year use the laboratory.
