A three-year investigation of Greenland's influence on the atmospheric
circulation of the North Atlantic region is proposed. Observational analyses and
mesoscale simulations will examine the impact of extremes of the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) on Greenland cyclonic activity and describe the casual
mechanisms. In particular, the influences of Greenland topography including the
role of the katabatic winds are evaluated. The observational analyses will
provide details on cyclone climatology in this important, yet little-studied,
region. The mesoscale numerical model to be used is the Pennsylvania State
University/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model version 5
(MM5) modified for ice sheet meteorology. The numerical study will be divided
into two parts: a moderately high resolution set of seasonal simulations to
produce detailed statistics for both phases of the NAO, and a set of very high
resolution simulations of representative cyclonic events to better understand
their dynamics.
