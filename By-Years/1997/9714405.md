9714405 Adams Adams is currently Director of the new National Institute on
Mentoring of the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in
Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM). Prior to that, he served as Executive
Director of GEM. Originally created as an outgrowth of corporate and university
concerns to increase the number of underrepresented ethnic/racial groups who
enter and complete the engineering master's degree, currently GEM operates
programs and conducts activities that address the underrepresentation of ethnic
minorities in engineering, science, and mathematics from precollege to doctorate
levels.
