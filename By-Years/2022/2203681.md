With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professor Ramanathan's group at Dartmouth College is working to
improve the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy which
is widely used to characterize chemical, material, and biological systems. NMR
also underpins magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is widely used for
clinical diagnosis and brain mapping. The techniques developed by the Ramanathan
group will enable NMR studies of smaller sample volumes allowing the study of
novel materials and chemistry at the nano and microscale. The control of quantum
systems, a key element of the project, is central to the future development of
quantum technologies, a strategic national priority. The project will train
multiple undergraduate and graduate students and will also develop a portable
magnetic resonance laboratory to demonstrate fundamental quantum phenomena to
middle- and high-school students and the broader
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Room-temperature dynamic nuclear polarization
(DNP) via substitutional nitrogen or P1 centers in diamond will be used to
hyperpolarize nuclear spins, both within and external to the diamond. The goals
are to (i) identify the sample characteristics and experimental conditions that
give rise to the largest DNP enhancements; (ii) further improve the DNP
enhancements by hyperpolarizing the P1 centers via their coupling to optically-
excited NV centers; and (iii) investigate the use of P1 centers in diamonds to
enhance the signals of nuclei outside the diamond comparing both direct
enhancement from electrons to nuclei outside the diamond and indirect
enhancement where the transfer is relayed via the 13C nuclear spins in the
diamond. These studies will contribute broadly to the development of methods for
magnetic resonance at the mesoscale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
