The research focus of this project will be on the testing of low acoustic loss
material for the construction of a massive "Truncated Icosahedron Gravitational-
wave Antenna" (TIGA). The most promising TIGA fabrication process identified so
far is to explosively bond a number of aluminum plates to build up a large block
of aluminum from which to machine the TIGA. U.S. Industry has the capability to
produce such material. The main emphasis of the research will be to test the
acoustic loss of samples at cryogenic temperatures and attempt to find a
fabrication process and post-fabrication processing that will allow the
intrinsic low acoustic loss of aluminum to be retained in samples prepared by
this technique. This characterization of this new material will be an important
input for the planning of the next generation of acoustic gravitational-wave
receivers throughout the world.
