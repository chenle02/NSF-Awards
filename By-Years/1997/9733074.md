9733074 Wade Males and females are different. Most species, including humans,
are sexually dimorphic. While body shape and size may be the most apparent,
there are differences in physiology, neural function and behavior. Considerable
evidence indicates that, in vertebrates, hormones secreted by the gonads during
a limited, sensitive stage of development differentiate the neural substrates
underlying sexual dimorphism. Several model systems have been developed to
exploit the relationship between gonadal steroid hormones, brain structure, and
sexually dimorphic behavior including bird song, rat reproductive behavior, and
electric discharge patterns of weakly electric fish. Dr. Wade has developed a
reptile model system to examine how structural and biochemical changes within
the brain regulate behavior. Reptiles are a pivotal group in vertebrate
evolution since they are direct ancestors to both mammals and birds. Using a
variety of neuroanatomical, behavioral, and classical endocrine techniques, she
will address what causes behaviors to be different in males than in females and
decipher the factors that stimulate behaviors seasonally in adulthood. Moreover,
as part of this CAREER award, Dr. Wade will develop a course emphasizing
comparative aspects of neuroanatomical and hormonal regulation of behaviors. The
integration of her teaching and research will provide students with a greater
opportunity for first-hand experience in the neural and endocrine factors that
influence the structure and the function of the brain.
