This project involves an experimental study of the moisture transport process
that occurs during the drying of granular porous media. In principle, the
mechanisms are quite simple--diffusion of water vapor in the gas phase owing to
gradients in the partial pressure and convection in the liquid phase owing to
capillary forces. Recent visual studies have clearly indicated that the
influence of local heterogeneities is dominated by two parameters: the Bond
number (ratio of surface tension effects to gravitiational effects) and the
variance of the particle size distribution. To explore a wide range of Bond
numbers, the investigator will use packed beds of glass spheres ranging from 100
to 1000 microns. The influence of the variance of the particle size distribution
will be explored using mixtures of spherical particles and mixtures of crushed
glass particles.
