Automatic annotation that uses expert input remains a challenging problem. The
teams plans to use a mixture of methods from visual perception research, user-
centered design, and image-content based methods. The application field will
initially be categorization of biomedical images, which have potential for
research and teaching, as well as clinical diagnosis. A closely integrated set
of visual data, from users who also provide verbal data for production of
annotation should information both image classification schemes and database
organization. The project has two major aims: to combined visual perception
research and user-centered design to do feature identification and develop
appropriate metadata; and to design and build a usable, multimodal, gaze-aware
content-based image retrieval system for interactive search and retrieval of
multiply-classified images. Evaluation will include both retrieval performance
and system usability metrics for both experts and novices. Graduate students
will be an ongoing part of the research. Outcomes will be disseminated through
journals and conferences, and data will be made available on a shared website.
