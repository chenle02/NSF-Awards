The objective of this research is to investigate the capability and application
of hyperspectral imaging technology to provide accurate and quick identification
and quantification of building damage. Compared to optical and multispectral
sensors, hyperspectral sensors can acquire simultaneous earth images in more
than 200 narrow and often contiguous spectral bands through the ultraviolet,
visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. To achieve this
objective, the suitability of hyperspectral images to differentiate object
classes and to assess the damage severity based on observed spectral changes
will be determined. Furthermore, hyperspectral bands? sensing capability will be
evaluated in the presence of various forms and degrees of cloud cover. The
outcomes are expected to 1) expand the body of knowledge in using remotely
sensed data for damage detection and quantification; 2) improve our
understanding of the progression of wind hazards and their multi-faceted effects
on built environment; 3) provide abundant high quality data much needed to
calibrate and validate risk models for insurers and public
agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are achieved
by integrating research in curricular development, enhancement of research
infrastructure, increased diversity, and broad dissemination of findings and
discoveries. These activities collectively will provide valuable training
opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and will nurture the next
generation of experts in wind engineering and remote sensing. They will also
contribute to the formulation of efficient and effective strategies for
windstorm response, recovery and mitigation that minimize human suffering and
economic losses. &lt;br/&gt;
