The project will improve our understanding of the genesis and evolution of
tropical synoptic disturbances in the northwest sector of the Pacific. The
structure of the background monsoonal flow in this region during northern summer
(with westerlies in the western and easterlies in the eastern part of domain)
allows for interesting dynamical interactions involving tropical waves and
cyclones. Dr. Chang will investigate the dynamical processes, particularly,
nonlinear interactions in the vicinity of confluent mean flow, to advance the
understanding of tropical cyclogenesis. Tropical cyclones in this region are
often disastrous, taking tremendous toll on human lives and the economies of
Southeast Asia. Investigation of the conditions under which tropical synoptic
disturbances evolve into cyclones can lead to improvement in cyclone
forecasting. Together with co-PI, Dr. Roger Williams, Dr. Chang will dynamically
model the interactions between the background monsoonal flow and tropical
disturbances using barotropic, baroclinic, and primitive equation models, to
better understand their evolution.
