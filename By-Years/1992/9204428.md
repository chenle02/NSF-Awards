The tectonics of Southeast Asia involves accretion and amalgamation of
disparate cratonic fragment and blocks over a considerable range of time. The
Hunan Block of South China for example accreted to the Yangtze craton, but the
age of attachment is poorly constrained and estimates range from Precambrian to
Mesozoic. This project will examine Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks in the Hunan
block paleomagnetically to determine prior positions of thee constituent rocks
and therefore to constrain the time of collision. Results will be of utility not
only in South China geology, but in understanding Southeast Asia tectonics.
