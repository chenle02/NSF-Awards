0078210&lt;br/&gt;Friedman, W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interleukin-1B (IL-1B) is a
potent and pleiotropic cytokine produced by glia in the brain which influences
many different cell types. When IL-1B interacts with receptors on glia, it
activates a specific intracellular signaling cascade inducing production of many
growth factors and cytokines. Specific neuronal populations in the brain, in
particular hippocampal neurons, also have receptors for IL-1B, however neurons
do not produce cytokines and growth factors in response to IL-1B. The distinct
signal transduction pathways activated by this cytokine determine the functional
response of different cell types. In these studies, therefore, we will elucidate
the different signaling pathways that mediate the actions of IL-1B in neurons
compared to astrocytes. In addition, one of the growth factors which is induced
by IL-1B in glia is nerve growth factor (NGF). One of the NGF receptors (p75) is
also induced by IL-1B in glial cells, suggesting that NGF has effects on glia
distinct from its well-characteristic neurotrophic effects on neurons. These
studies will investigate the signaling pathways and functional consequences of
NGF on glial cells.&lt;br/&gt;Growth factors and cytokines influence many
different cell populations, but induce distinct responses which are cell type-
specific. Elucidation of the signal transduction pathways activated in neurons
and glia by a pleiotropic cytokine such as IL-1B will allow insight into how a
single factor can activate different signaling events and functional
consequences in distinct cell types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
