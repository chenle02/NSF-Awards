The conference Group Actions in Riemannian Geometry will be held May 15-18,
2014, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The purpose of the
meeting is to study questions from, and related to, Riemannian geometry in the
context of symmetry. The first day and a half will feature a workshop focused on
Ricci solitons and symmetry. The remainder of the conference will bring together
a cross-section of experts from across the field, highlighting recent advances
in Riemannian geometry in the presence of symmetry.

Riemannian geometry is one of the oldest branches of modern mathematics. The use
of symmetry has been an essential tool in the field since its inception and
continues to be a fruitful source for building examples, to test conjectures,
and test new ideas within the field. This meeting will expose junior and senior
mathematicians to a variety of techniques and applications of group actions from
across a broad spectrum of subdisciplines. In doing so, we hope to create new
relationships across disciplines and promote the cross-fertilization of ideas.
