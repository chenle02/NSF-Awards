The strategic objective of this conference at Suzdal is a deeper integration of
the Russian geophysical community  back into the global geophysical disciplines
with targeting of the younger Russian generations as potential scholars for the
years to come. With the above goal taken into account, over 40 invitations were
sent out to leading scientists from USA , Asia and Europe from within various
subfields of the sciences of the Earth. We will also bring over young American
scientists to set some examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to now for over two
decades conferences of such enormous dimensions have not been held in Russia. At
the conference there will be a discussion on the current state and latest
achievements in the study of global and regional processes within Earth bowels
and their appearance on the surface and in geophysical
fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest world developments in the study of the
structure, content and rheology substance of the Earth mantel will be presented,
as well as the mechanisms that lead to generation and evolution of the
lithospheric plates, Earth mantle convections, occurrence and rise and
introduction of the hot spots into the plumes of the lithosphere, processes in
zones of subduction, in particular influence of water on the  mantel,
lithospheric, and bedrock tectonic and seismic
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest observational data, precise
laboratory measurements, theoretical research, mathematical modeling, and in
particular, modern supercomputer technologies will also be brought to the fore
during these discussions.
