9632148 Tatum Both majority and minority scholars have argued for the
incorporation of minority perspectives into criminological literacy and the
study of crime. This research will assess the utility of the criminological
literature of African-American scholars for mainstream theorizing and helping to
frame testable hypotheses of crime causation. After identifying and describing
theories and perspectives advanced by African-American scholars, the research
will use content analysis to: (1) analyze underlying assumptions; (2) analyze
the conceptualization and use of core theoretical variables; (3) identify
literature that may be classified as African-American criminology" and describe
the boundaries of this theoretical knowledge; and (4) assess what these theories
and perspectives add to mainstream criminology and the study of crime and
violence. The identification and analysis of this literature can further lead to
the empirical testing of minority theories, the revision of mainstream theories
and the creation of new theories and paradigms. %%%%
