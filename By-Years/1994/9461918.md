The advancement of pollution control technologies is being treated as a high
priority in the U.S. One important step involves the development of ultra-high
performance systems for the removal of fine particles from processing streams or
plant effluents. In this program, LSR Technologies, Inc., will investigate and
develop a novel electrostatic precipitator (ESP) concept with controlled solids
reentrainment and turbulence intensity. The concept eliminates deficiencies
generic to the conventional ESP and associated with: high or low dust
resistivity; particulate space charge effects; rapping reentrainment due to
mixing of gas and broken dust layers; and seepage due to leakage from below the
precipitator over the hoppers. It also reduces the intensity of turbulence in
the ESP, in turn improving gas/solids separation efficiency. The Phase I
research will focus on proof-of-principle testing which will include an analysis
of the effect of controlling turbulence intensity on precipitator performance.
The Phase II effort would include extensive testing at the pilot-scale level.
