The workshop will address the themes: design as a social process; social and
political issues in design; social issues the design for a hopeful future;
instrumental approaches and methods for optimizing designs; and the confluence
of ethics and design. The workshop will attract 75-100 engineering design
faculty from around the country, and it will foster discussion among these
faculty of the issues cited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Mudd Design Workshop
provides a unique opportunity for engineering design faculty to come together to
discuss engineering design methods and pedagogy in a forum specifically for that
purpose. The workshop successfully fosters innovation in engineering design
education and leads the way to the adoption and teaching of better engineering
design methods.
