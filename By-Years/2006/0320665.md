With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will acquire an ultrafast
infrared light source. This equipment will enhance research in the following
areas: a) studies on the rates of energy flow, the dynamics of bond breaking,
the formation of new species, and the existence of short-lived chemical
intermediates on surfaces and in bulk media; b) studies on the ultrafast
dynamics of low-lying electronic states relevant to nano-structures; c) use of
nonlinear spectroscopic measurements for interface-specific probing of molecular
vibrations; and d) experiments to harness the imaging capabilities in
neuroscience investigations and to explore the use of IR pulses to trigger the
firing of neurons.

These new capabilities will be of direct and major significance to the many
graduate students and post-docs involved in its use. The existence of a
laboratory support structure will make it possible for students without
extensive expertise in ultrafast spectroscopy to perform new measurements
relevant to their research program. The impact of the infrared light source will
also be felt at the undergraduate and high-school level by enhancing students'
scientific training and stimulating their interest in scientific careers. In
addition, the development of IR optical methods for probing and triggering nerve
cells could lead to an understanding of the neuron function and in time to new
treatments of neurological and psychiatric diseases. With respect to the
development of molecular design principles derived from studies of polymer
surfaces, new and improved biomaterials and alternatives to conventional
photolithography can be obtained.
