Measurements of spin degrees of freedom will be utilized to elucidate the
reaction mechanisms contributing to few nucleon and hadron reactions. A majority
of the measurements use high energy electron and photon beams at the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The few nucleon component utilizes a
focal plane polarimeter, constructed jointly by William and Mary and Rutgers
Universities, to measure spin transfer in reactions. One such measurement will
provide an improved measurement of the electric form factor of the proton. The
hadron component is centered at the large acceptance detector (CLAS) at TJNAF.
