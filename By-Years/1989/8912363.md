This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
will provide travel support for U.S. scientists, primarily young investigators,
to attend and participate in the VIIIth International Symposium on the
Photochemistry and Photophysics of Coordination Compounds, which is being
organized by Peter C. Ford and Richard J. Watts of the University of California
at Santa Barbara. This biennial conference brings together knowledgable
scientists from around the world to discuss recent advances in the physical and
chemical properties of excited states of metal complexes. This important area
has as its ultimate goals the understanding of photosynthesis and the photolysis
of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen, and thus deal with two fundamental
issues of our time: food and energy. The selection process for receiving a
subsidy to attend the conference will guarantee that a reasonable number of
young investigators will be able to participate.
