Personal computers will be integrated into introductory physics laboratory
classes for engineering, physics, and other science majors, for Honors Program
students, and for elementary education majors. Application of computers will be
introduced gradually, beginning with arithmetic manipulation of data entered by
hand and proceeding, in subsequent experiments, to statistical analysis, data
acquisition, and simulation. Computers will be used in all fourteen of the
experiments done in a one-semester course, and they will be used to collect data
in nine of the experiments. Use of the computers will make the laboratory much
more interesting to most students, will permit some new experiments, and will
relieve the time-wasting drudgery that students dread. The university will match
the award with an equal amount of funds.
