9453861 Linn Although the Internet offers a vast resource of scientific
information and experiences, even experts regularly report confusion,
frustration, and inefficiency when participating in network activities. What are
promising roles of human and electronic guides to the Internet? The project will
explore tradeoffs between human and electronic resources, group and individual
exploration, as well as between immediate and long-term benefits. How can
Internet tools encourage students to continuously build on their ideas and
integrate information into more abstract, comprehensive explanations or models?
As the information highway reaches homes, schools, and the workplace we seek to
prepare students who will continue to use it long after they complete their
science courses. How can we help students solve personally relevant problems,
develop a firm foundation of science understanding, and continue to explore
scientific questions? The project will draw on the Internet participants to
create innovative approaches that dramatically improve what scientists can
contribute and what educators can deliver. The project will document particular
solutions as well as identify broad strategies to capitalize on this amazing
resource. The project will research solutions that encourage learners to link
and connect ideas rather than to isolate them and that allow students to solve
relevant, personally compelling problems rather than perform exercises. Project
networking tools will build on Mosaic and World Wide Web to take advantage of
the science information on the Internet. The tools will help teachers design
activities that draw on Internet information, guide students as they complete
projects, and allow students from all over the Internet to jointly discuss
topics that interest them. A central research question for this project concerns
the sort of guidance each type of user needs to organize knowledge including
users who are autonomous as well as those who are not. ***
