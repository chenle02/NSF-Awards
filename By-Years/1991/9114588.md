This research activity is designed to develop the theoretical and experimental
knowledge base to enable the development of the next generation metal cutting
machine tool. This machine tool is characterized by the properties of high
speed, high power, high accuracy and high static and dynamic stability. The
characteristics of high speed and power are necessary to reduce costs involved
in machining. The key to achieving this goal is the development of statically
and dynamically stable machine tool sub- systems, integrated to form a highly
stable machine tool. Sub- systems such as stiff high speed spindles and new-
material, light- weight, stiff structures will be researched and developed.
Major control issues, such as spindle speed control to avoid chatter and servo
systems with continuous updating of drive dynamics to reduce following error,
will be addressed. Modelling and simulation of machining processes will be
conducted, on a large scale, to allow the incorporation of these models into
further development of Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing systems. The
research is focused on developing models of machine tools for the aerospace and
automotive industry, which represent the two largest segments of manufacturing.
Systematic research of this nature cannot be provided by the domestic industry
which is extremely fragmented and battered by overseas competition. This work
will however, provide for a revival of the domestic machine tool industry,
through cooperation and technology transfer, while greatly benefiting a major
segment of the manufacturing sector of the United States.
