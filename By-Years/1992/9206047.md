The principal investigator will theoretically and experimentally study multi-
component chemical diffusion in silicate melts. The primary goal is to derive
and validate a model for multi-component diffusion in which the required
quantities are self-diffusion coefficients and thermodynamic properties that can
be obtained in separate experiments. Results of the research will have great
importance in igneous petrology and will have wide application to processes
occuring within the Earth.
