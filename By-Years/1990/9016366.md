This award supports the establishment of a National Ice Core Curatorial Facility
to be located on the grounds of the Denver Federal Center, operated as an
extension of the U.S. Geological Survey's Core Research Center (CRC) by the
University of Colorado at Boulder and the U.S. Geological Survey. The Facility
will provide 50,600 cubic feet of safeguarded core storage at -35 degree
celsius. Refrigerated examination room, holding, staging and changing areas will
be provided as well as instruments and equipment for routine core examination
and processing. Additional facilities will be available at the Core Research
Center. The Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado will
be responsible for the Facility, and will provide direction and communication
with the scientific community. The University will also provide a background of
relevant research and educational activities that will enhance the Facility and
provide new scientific opportunities. The USGS will provide the physical
facilities and staff, operate and maintain the Facility. The USGS will also act
in a curatorial capacity, providing for the processing, cataloging, and
distribution of samples- an area in which CRC personnel have over forty man-
years of experience.
