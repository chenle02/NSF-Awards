Linear programming is perhaps the most widely used tool of applied mathematics,
and the demand for more efficient and more robust algorithms is great.
Professors Ben Israel and Ben Tal are in the intermediate stages of development
of a new solution method based on their notion of "canonical bases", and will
continue their promising work with theoretical and computational efforts.
