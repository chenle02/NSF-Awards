Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research concerns the design, synthesis and
analysis of an artificial protein which will have the ability to create a
relatively long-lived charge separated state when excited with short bursts of
light. The process of charge separation is the first, most important step in
photosynthesis, and this construction will allow researchers to examine the
underlying physical processes which support charge separation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the design of a three cofactor
helical bundle protein domain which binds its cofactors by three orthogonal
mechanisms: the primary donor molecule will be a zinc(II)-phthalocyanine which
binds specifically to mono-histidine pentacoordinate sites. The acceptor
cofactor binding site will be a hexacoordinate bis-histidine site which tightly
and stably binds a variety of iron-containing macrocycles. The donor site will
contain a C-type heme covalently attached in vivo using the cytochrome C
biogenesis system. This charge separation domain will be covalently attached to
the flavoprotein reductase domain of phthalate dioxygenase reductase, enabling
the donor to be poised for electron transfer to the primary donor phthalocyanine
cofactor via the natural protein chimera by the simple addition of NADH. The
intended final product will be a simple, robust modular protein domain which
will serve many different scientists and engineers in their creation of solar
energy-driven devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This work
will not only improve the understanding of the engineering of charge separation,
it will result in a series of protein domains with tunable kinetics and
energetics which can be used in the creation of light-activated nanodevices.
CCNY, a public, city university, has an extremely diverse multi-ethnic student
body. An educational plan, which introduces undergraduates, graduate students
and New York City Public High School teachers to the interdisciplinary science
of biophysics, will be developed.
