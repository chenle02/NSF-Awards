0211025 Harte This LTREB project will continue an 11-year climate manipulation
experiment and a 6-year climate-gradient study, thereby providing longer-term
data sets to be used to test two hypotheses concerning the linkages between
climate and ecosystems. The first hypothesis relates to the effect of climate
warming on carbon sequestration, the second to climate controls on plant species
richness. Climate change can alter carbon stocks in plants, litter, and soil,
resulting in feedback which could either enhance or retard the anthropogenic
buildup of atmospheric CO2. Such feedback could be especially strong in montane
and high-latitude ecosystems where soils are carbon-rich, vegetation is
sensitive to climatic variables such as length of growing season, and climate
change is expected to be large due to snow-albedo feedback. The complexity of
whole ecosystems renders prediction of the magnitude of this carbon-balance
feedback a major challenge in ecology today.
