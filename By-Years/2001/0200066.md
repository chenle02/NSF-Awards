0200066&lt;br/&gt;Herring &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will
support activities of the newly formed University consortium UNAVCO, Inc. that
is a non-profit membership-governed organization, which supports and promotes
Earth science by advancing high-precision geodetic and strain techniques such as
the Global Positioning System (GPS). Part of the funds will support the
operation of the president's office that oversees the financial management of
UNAVCO, Inc. and provides a focus for community activities. The remainder of the
funds will provide support for planning workshops and studies for the Plate
Boundary Observatory (PBO), which will provide new insights into earthquake and
volcano dynamics in the Western United States and Alaska. The four pre-PBO
workshops to be held in 2002 will address the type of instrumentation and
monuments to be used in PBO; the coordination of PBO activities in Canada and
Mexico; the characteristics of the strainmeters to be used in PBO; and the
management structure to be developed for PBO. The study to be funded will
address the design criteria to be used in deploying the PBO instrumentation.
