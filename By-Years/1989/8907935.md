Support for increased participation of the U.S. engineering community in
activities of international engineering organizations, specifically the World
Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) and the Pan American Federation
of Engineering Societies (UPADI) is provided. WFEO, currently headquartered in
London, comprises 85 national members and several regional associations of
engineering societies. UPADI, headquartered in Venezuela, has national members
from 27 Western Hemisphere countries and is an international member of WFEO.
UITA is headquartered in Paris and is a federation of thirty technical
organizations, without national members. The U.S. engineering community has made
great strides toward the creation of more effective, more unified international
engineering organizations. New U.S. appointments have been made to major WFEO
Technical Committees, the management of WFEO has been strengthened under new
leadership, WFEO and UITA have agreed to cooperate on joint projects of mutual
interest, and links with major international programs are being developed. The
U.S. is also playing an enlarged role in UPADI. Enhancement of these efforts,
will strengthen the voice and influence of U.S. engineering internationally,
help to encourage the further development of joint activities between
international engineering organizations, and provide other important benefits.
