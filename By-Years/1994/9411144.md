9411144 Komanduri This award supports cooperative research between Ranga
Komanduri, Oklahoma State University, and Hou Zhenbin, Tongji University
Shanghai, China. The proposal is for cooperative research on thermal aspects of
manufacturing processes and materials. A variety of manufacturing technologies
such as low-pressure CVD diamond coating techniques, magnetic field assisted
polishing of advanced ceramics, laser assisted machining of materials, and
conventional machining of superalloys will be considered. Advanced materials
considered include diamond, ceramics, glasses, and composites. Initiation of
investigation on some of these processes is proposed, with the expectation that
collaborative work would continue beyond the duration of the award. This award
supported under the U.S.-China Cooperative Research Program.
