9505125 Bryant The proposed research lies in the area of exterior differential
systems. The proposer seeks to classify systems of various types which admit
non-trivial conservation laws, and to develop effective algorithms for computing
integrable extensions of a given system. The proposer also wishes to understand
the geometric invariants of a control system and to investigate control
algorithms. The main tools to be used are Cartan's method of equivalence and
Cartan-Kahler theory. Exterior differential systems generalize systems of
partial differential equations; their study is heavily geometric and heavily
computational at the same time. Control theory is used extensively in such areas
as manufacturing and robotics; the proposed research may help to create more
efficient design algorithms based upon a deeper understanding of the geometric
invariants involved.
