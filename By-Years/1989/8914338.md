This award supports cooperative research in nuclear physics to be conducted by
Stuart Pittel of the Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware in
Newark, Delaware collaborating with Alberto Etchegoyen of the National
Commission on Atomic Energy and Pedro Federman of the University of Buenos
Aires, both in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Also participating will be Richard
Casten of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Jonathan Engel, a postdoc at
Bartol. The research will focus on two important contemporary problems in
nuclear structure theory. One is a systematic study of neutron-proton monopole-
monopole effective inter- actions with the goal of obtaining a simple form for
this important component of the effective nuclear force, valid over the whole
range of elements. The other is to develop a new approach to nuclear shell model
calculations to be applied to a study of the shape transitions which occur in
the neutron-rich strontium-zirconium-molybdenum region of the periodic table.
The current work builds on previous collaborations resulting in ten publications
with the Latin American scientists in this proposal and twelve more with others.
The earlier focus of cooperative research with Dr. Federman was on the
development of a unified shell model of nuclear deformation. The new work will
add an international dimension to active research.
