Proposal title: Scaling Up: A Workshop to Explore Building Systemic
Communication Capacity for Next-Generation
Scientists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 1255633&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Nancy Baron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Science communications
proficiency is an important skill for STEM graduate students but is not a
typical part of STEM graduate education nationally. At the institutions that do
offer such science communications training, instructional approaches are highly
variable, reflecting an absence of standards and evaluation metrics. The
workshop will 1) inventory science communications training for STEM graduate
students nationally, (2) identify high effective practices in science
communications training with attention to curriculum, approaches, and
evaluation, and (3) define a roadmap that gives concrete recommendations to
university administrators and funding agencies for national implementation and
scale-up of science communications training. The workshop will involve IGERT
PIs, science communications trainers, science communications researchers, and
individuals from national agencies and organizations with a high interest in
STEM graduate student communications training. Products of the workshop will
include a white paper to NSF that identifies best practices for science
communications training and specifies a roadmap for national scale-up of
effective practices; publications in the peer-reviewed literature and other
media; and briefings of officials at organizations with capacity to foster
changes in graduate education (e.g., NSF, Council of Graduate Schools, and
AAAS).
