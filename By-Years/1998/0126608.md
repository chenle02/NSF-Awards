The principle objective of this workshop is to bring together experts from both
domestic advanced networks and HPIIS to develop metrics. These metrics will be
used to quantify the use of HPIIS network links, to classify research use of
these advanced networks and to collect success stories for each classification.
A future objective will be the reporting of the numbers of published papers and
people trained over time.
