The long term objective of Dr. Carrier's work is to develop an understanding of
the mechanical and neurological linkage between the locomotor and ventilatory
systems. The aims of the present investigation is to increase our understanding
of 1) the role that the axial musculo-skeletal system plays in locomotion, and
2) the mechanical linkage between the locomotor and ventilatory systems. This is
an N.S.F. Young Investigator Award.
