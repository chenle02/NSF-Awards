9406006 Boyer This collaborative project will test the generally accepted
critical wedge theory for the development of fold and thrust belts, by an
integrated field and laboratory study of rocks in the Lewis thrust sheet in
northwest Montana. According to the theory, strain should vary within the thrust
belt as a function of the geometry of the sedimentary prism. The stratigraphy of
the area is well known and lends itself to a test of the model. The geometry of
the pre- deformational Proterozoic, Paleozoic and lower Mesozoic sedimentary
basins will be determined and the amount and distribution of strain will be
compared with that predicted by the model. Whether the existing theory is upheld
or not, the results will have far- reaching significance for other fold and
thrust belts, and for the prediction and recovery of oil and natural gas
reserves in similar tectonic settings.
