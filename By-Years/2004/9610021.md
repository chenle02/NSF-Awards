This proposal must be considered in relation to the developing interagency
National Space Weather Program which is proceeding from the strategic plan phase
to the implementation phase. As discussed in the proposal, however, the space
weather requirements for the commericial space community are not well defined.
In this project, site visits to commercial space users will be utilized to
determine space weather impacts to specific systems and how space weather
nowcast and forecast products could be utilized by their operations to improve
efficiency and effectiveness. Data collected during these visits will be
utilized to determine customer needs for space weather bulletins, alerts,
warnings, and forecasts. The analysis will include a cost saving/cost avoidance
trade-off study to establish the relevance of space weather services to the
commericial sector.
