EarthTalk Incorporated is producing and distributing 282 "Edge of Discovery"
radio programs. Each of the 90-second programs will explore an area of on-going
research and will feature "actualities" or recorded voices of scientists
explaining their work. The programs will be carried on 700+ public and
commercial radio stations. The broadcast programs will be supplemented by an
"Edge of Discovery" web presence that will contain the radio programs themselves
plus a "More Info" section for each program that includes references to printed
articles and links to other web sites on the day's topic as well as
supplementary background material such as transcripts of interviews with
scientists. The "Edge of Discovery" web page also will feature a "Meet the
Scientists" section in which a new scientist will be profiled each month, and it
will feature live online "chats" with scientists six times each year.

The producers/hosts for the series are Deborah Byrd and Joel Block who created,
produced and hosted the highly successful radio series Earth and Sky. The Senior
Producer is Marc Airhart who will be primary liaison with the team of
researchers and writers. Review of all material developed for the projected will
be done by the project's review committee of 95 scientists.
