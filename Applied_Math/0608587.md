We study periodic solutions of the Vortex Filament Equation (VFE), a nonlinear
partial differential equation that models the self-induced dynamics of a vortex
line in an ideal fluid. The VFE is closely related to the cubic focusing
Nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation, a canonical soliton equation arising as
model of nonlinear wave propagation in a variety of situations (from water waves
in deep water to nonlinear optical media). Our research has several goals
including: a deeper understanding of the topological properties of closed vortex
filaments associated to the class of finite-gap solutions of the NLS equation
(the periodic analogues of solitons); relating the linear stability of periodic
NLS solutions to the linear stability of the corresponding vortex filaments; and
studying perturbations of the vortex filament flow that preserve knot energy
functionals.

Our work concerns a canonical model of the dynamics of filamentary structures in
fluids (such as smoke rings traveling through the air, or loops of intense
vorticity generated by a strong underwater current). Despite its simplicity,
this model has a rich class of solutions that realize many interesting
topological features: we find knotted vortex loops of increasing complexity, and
observe topological changes such as strand crossing and self-intersections. Many
areas of mathematics are brought together to address questions such as the
topological properties of knotted filamentary structures, their stability, and
their energetics. This work also continues to integrate research and education,
by providing undergraduate students with research experiences aimed at better
preparing them for graduate programs, and by supporting graduate students
involved in advanced research at a primarily undergraduate institution.
