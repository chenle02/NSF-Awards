The undergraduate research participation project in the UNLV Physics Department
will be continued during the summers of 1996-1998. The research efforts are in
the areas of atomic, molecular and optical physics, astronomy/astrophysics, and
condensed matter physics. Students will have the opportunity to obtain hands-on
laboratory experience using lasers, to analyze astronomical data on workstations
using image analysis software, and to perform numerical computation and
simulation using the UNLV computer facilities. This proposal builds upon the
successful experience of the past four years as a REU site, in which
undergraduates have engaged in research in the department. Students will be
recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from other colleges and universities,
with special attention paid to selected schools in the West and Mid-West.
Applicants from institutions where research opportunities are limited will be
given higher priority over those from major research universities.
