This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
investigate a new class of mm-wave phase-locked loops (PLLs) for ultra-wide
bandwidth applications. Current mm-wave PLLs are based on injection-locked
frequency dividers, which have many locking limitations that affect their
operating range. These limitations translate to limited data rate
communications, and low resolution in imaging and spectroscopy applications.
This work proposes a fundamental change in the design of mm-wave phase locked
loops, combining the functions of the oscillator and injection-locked frequency
divider through the use of N-push operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this proposal is manifested in its goal of developing new
circuit techniques for mm-wave applications that efficiently utilize the wide
bandwidth available and lends itself to operation at even higher frequency at
the mm-wave/THz boundary. The proposed approach is expected to achieve an order
of magnitude improvement in the phased-locked-loop operation range and simplify
the design of the fundamental oscillator and the selection process of the
frequency divider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful effort will provide the
scientific community with design and optimization techniques for novel PLL
topologies with superior performance compared to traditional architectures. The
proposed approach can be employed for stable, wideband electronic-based THz
sources having numerous applications including radio astronomy, atmospheric
sensing, biological research, wireless communications, radar, and chemical and
explosives detection. Undergraduate students will be involved in the
experimental work. Planned outreach activities include developing hands-on
activities for "Design your Future Day," an annual workshop organized for female
high school students.
