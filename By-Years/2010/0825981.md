The objective of this research is to combine atomic force microscopy (AFM), high
resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomistic modeling to:
(1) explore the scientific basis of wear at the nanoscale; and (2) test the
hypothesis that macroscopically strong carbon-based materials can be used to
form wear-resistant nanotips. The science of wear is largely unexplored, yet is
critically needed for enabling nanotechnology applications including all tip-
based nanomanufacturing (TBN) processes (e.g., nano-scale machining,
lithography, manipulation, data storage). Carbon-based materials may be ideal
for TBN due to their high strength, low friction and wear, and stable surfaces.
We will leverage collaboration with industry and national laboratory partners
for this work.&lt;br/&gt;The societal impact of this work is twofold. From a
technical standpoint, it will aid in the implementation of TBN processes for
industry, and in the broader development of a scientific understanding of wear
at the atomic scale. From an educational standpoint, this research will train
engineers at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels in
interdisciplinary concepts in nanomanufacturing. The PIs will integrate lectures
and labs on TBN processes into undergraduate and graduate courses, and will
widely disseminate the results of this work to science and engineering
professionals through presentations, publications, cyber-infrastructure, and
discussions with industrial collaborators. A high school teacher will be
supported through established research experience for teachers (RET) programs.
Women and underrepresented minorities will be recruited to be part of the
research team and as participants and beneficiaries of the outreach efforts.
