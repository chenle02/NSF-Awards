The goal of this collaboration between the PI and Bernhard Steffan of the
University of Passau is to study issues related to modeling and verification of
distributed systems. Two specific threads of research will be pursued. The first
involves the incorporation of notions of action priority into the semantic
foundations of concurrency and an exploration of its practical impact on
reasoning about system designs. The second is devoted to the design and
implementation of an open tool architecture that will facilitate the development
of new and improved verification tools. The results of this research will be new
and useful extensions to system design methods and a framework for improved tool
support for system designers.
