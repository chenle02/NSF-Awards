The meeting on Eukaryotic DNA Replication will be the second meeting held on
this subject and follows the highly successful meeting on this subject that was
held in September 1987. The meeting will be devoted to fundamental research
topics related to chromosome duplication, structure and function, and will
include important areas of biological research in the areas of cell growth and
cell cycle control, DNA amplification and drug resistance, virology and
developmental biology. The need for this meeting is evidenced by the rapid
advances made in this field over recent years. The meeting will ensure that
recent results will be communicated and discussed in an atmosphere of face-to-
face contact, which should enhance progress.
