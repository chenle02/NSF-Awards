The high-performance computing (HPC) community is embracing artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques for countless pursuits, from driving ground-
breaking scientific discoveries to protecting our national security. As newly
emerging machine learning and date-centric workloads proliferate in HPC, current
workload-management systems cannot keep up with the significant challenges
introduced by the diverse mix of applications co-running on heterogeneous
systems. This project tackles the problem by developing new workload-management
methods to catalyze the convergence of HPC, AI, and data analytics. It will
develop fundamental improvements in HPC workload management to promote the use
of large-scale supercomputers for emerging data-centric applications (HPC4AI).
Meanwhile it will exploit advanced AI technologies, especially multi-objective
reinforcement learning, to empower job scheduling and resource allocation in HPC
(AI4HPC).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop an intelligent
workload-management framework named MINT in which distinctive computational
resource requirements of hybrid workloads will be automatically identified and
fulfilled to achieve extreme resource efficiency and satisfactory user
experience. Key research thrusts are: understanding performance implications of
diverse workloads on supercomputers via model-driven analysis; new intelligent
multi-resource scheduling methods; smart resource-allocation strategies for
minimal workload interference; and extensive evaluation of the proposed
framework through trace-based simulation and testing. The deliverables include a
new workload-management framework and open-source software releases for
intelligent management of hybrid workloads on extreme-scale
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
