9505579 Fornari This is a detailed filed investigation of the relation between
volcanic and tectonic features, and the distribution of hydrothermal activity
and associated biological communities at the Lucky Strike segment of the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge. The aims of the program are to map the Lucky Strike hydrothermal
vent field, to determine the geographic distribution, structure and biological
characteristics of the vent sites, to obtain a detailed geological data set for
a magmatically robust slow- spreading ridge segment, and to sample using the ROV
Jason the fluids, biota, and sulfide substrates. ***
