Dr. Leonard Fine and other members of the Chemistry Department at Columbia
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Participants come from colleges and universities throughout the
United States. In addition to chemical research, the program offers field trips
to visit industrial research laboratories and their research staff, training in
publication preparation and research presentation, and special communal housing
and lunchtime activities to further the development of student-student and
student-faculty interaction.
