The Missouri Botanical Garden is a National Systematics Research Resource Center
committed to the acquisition, preservation, and study of plant specimens for
scientific purposes. Its herbarium serves as a permanent repository for plant
specimens, including many types, and other specimens not available at other U.S.
institutions, with a strong emphasis on the Neotropics and tropical Africa. The
collection is heavily used as a resource by the botanical systematic community
for monographic, floristic, and numerous other kinds of studies and accessed
through loans, and personal visits. This project will support, for a three-year
period microscopes, supplies and staff to enhance the loan specimen program and
visitor support services.
