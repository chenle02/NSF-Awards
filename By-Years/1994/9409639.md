An experimental study of partially premixed flames is proposed. The flame
structure and pollutant emissions will be determined as a function of the degree
of mixing, turbulence conditions, and fuel mixture properties. A clever burner
design is proposed to give variable mixedness conditions. The degree of mixing
will be measured using fluorescence tomographic imaging from fuel flows seeded
with either acetone or NO. Fuels to be studied include H2, CH4, and C3H8.
