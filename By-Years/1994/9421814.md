A belt of streamers extending from a band encircling the sun comprise the
densest portion of the solar corona. Recent research indicates, contrary to
superposed epoch analysis of streamer belt data near Earth, this belt may be the
source of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are responsible for geomagnetic
storms. Data shows high variability, consistent with its activity in the
heliosphere, yet few studies have focused on its complexities. This project's
aim, at both basic and applied levels, is to (1) construct a morphological model
of the streamer belt, and (2) establish a prediction scheme for geomagnetic
storms. The investigator will draw from combined field and plasma parameter
streamline constants, and analyze them to separate dynamic interplanetary
effects from those of solar origin. The resulting streamer belt morphology data
will serve as a basis for any future quantitative streamer belt module of a
global circulation model of the heliosphere.***
