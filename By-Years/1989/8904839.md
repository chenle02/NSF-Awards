Adaptive Acid Tolerance Response of Salmonella typhimurium Salmonella endure
intervals of acid stress in widely diverse environments ranging from pond water
to fused phagolysosomes infected macrophages. This research investigates a newly
discovered adaptive response which contributes to survival of these bacteria in
acid environments. The acidification tolerance response (ATR) is induced when
cells are shifted from pH 7.4 to pH 5.8 for one doubling. Subsequent exposure of
the adapted cells and unadapted cells to pH 3.3 results in a rapid, logarithmic
death of the unadapted cells but marked survival of adapted cells. This research
investigates the ATR phenomenon at the biochemical, genetic and molecular
levels. Experiments include measuring the internal pH, buffering capacity,
proton influx and proton efflux of pH 5.8 adapted vs. unadapted cells and
examining polypeptides produced during adaptation. To initiate the genetic
studies, a series of selective procedures have been developed to screen for ATR-
related acid-resistant and supersensitive mutants. Each mutant gene must affect
adaptive acid tolerance, alter the expression of specific ATR polypeptides and
be defective in the adaptive acid tolerance mechanism(s) identified during the
biochemical investigations.%%% This system of adaptive acid tolerance is most
certainly of major importance to Salmonella in surviving acid environments both
in nature and in an infected host. The multifaceted study presented here will
open exciting new areas of research into how other organisms, both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic, handle acid stress.***//
