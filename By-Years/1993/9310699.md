9310699 Jacob The relationship between science and commerce plays a crucial but
little understood role in modern society. For much of its existence as a nation,
for example, US entrepreneurs "imported" scientific work from European nations
to use in the development of American industry. Currently, Japanese
entrepreneurs are said to be taking advantage of scientific and technological
knowledge produced in the US and Europe. But how do entrepreneurs take advantage
of scientific developments in order to establish commercially profitable
technological enterprises? One way to get at this critical question is to
examine the historical record. This is what Professor Margaret Jacob is doing.
Professor Jacob, working with six to eight graduate student research assistants
over the three years of this grant, is continuing her study of the cultural
foundations of Western industrialization. Her goal is to show the dynamic
interaction of industrial culture with political and economic realities within
national and comparative contexts. The nations she is comparing are Britain,
France, the Netherlands and Belgium (then the Austrian Netherlands). She is
undertaking a study of the cultural history of the Industrial Revolution that
factors scientific and technological knowledge into a complex picture of the
values, attitudes and beliefs that permitted industrialization to occur. Her
model depends upon the techniques of the cultural historian trained in the
history of science and technology. The focus of this research -- to be conducted
in three languages in libraries and archives of Wales, Birmingham, Manchester,
Paris, Troyes, Brussels, Mons, Rotterdam and the Hague -- is the actors in the
industrialization process: entrepreneurs, agents of governments, members of
scientific societies, scientific lecturers, and engineers, most in their home
countries, a few as foreign travelers seeking to sell or buy (or steal!) skills
and knowledge. ***
