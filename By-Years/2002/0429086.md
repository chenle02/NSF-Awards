This small planning grant will examine the topic of animal disease intentionally
introduced for purposes of terror and economic disaster. In particular, planning
for a network-accessible database would be undertaken to support new network-
centric policy and protocols. Human factors such as cooperation, coordination
and communication will be considered as contributors to accessibility and
information clarity. The planning process will include specialists in animal
diseases, information technology, organizational analysis and uptake of
innovation, and public policy. The state of Texas will provide the test bed to
examine the way 1) policy and regulation are understood, 2) information is
transferred, 3) decisions are made, and 4) decisions and regulatory demands are
implemented.
