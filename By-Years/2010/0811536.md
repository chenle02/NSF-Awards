The internet today provides a wide range of services associated with web sites;
examples include getting a stock quote, making an airline reservation,
compressing a file or inverting a matrix. Each service may be likened to a basic
operation in a computer, the internet computer. An application is a program
written over the basic services, i.e., an orchestration of the services. This
research is directed toward designing, implementing and studying an appropriate
model of orchestration that would allow us to develop wide-area applications
succinctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as structured programming gave programmers
effective tools to organize the control flow of sequential programs, this
research introduces mechanisms to organize the communication, synchronization
and coordination in programs that run on wide-area networks. The objective is to
develop a robust model of structured wide-area programming, which has constructs
to orchestrate the concurrent invocation of services to achieve a goal -- while
managing time-outs, priorities, and failure of sites or communication. Specific
research goals include enhancing the model to support transactions and
extensible data formats, evaluating our model's effectiveness in coding and
verifying sizable applications, developing the theoretical foundations for a
process algebra for the internet, and designing implementations on distributed
platforms with integration to existing languages.&lt;br/&gt;
