This application is for the purchase of a narrow bore 600 MHz NMR spectrometer
which will be placed in an established NMR spectroscopy center. A common
interest of this group of investigators is the application of 13C and 1H NMR
isotopomer analysis for metabolic studies. Over the last 10 years we have
developed the tools for unraveling the metabolic information provided by 13C-13C
and 13C-1H coupling in tissue metabolizing 13C enriched compounds. Although
these methods were refined largely for interpretation of spectra from the
isolated heart, it has become clear over the last year that isotopomer analysis
is applicable to quantitation of complex pathways in other tissues and for
metabolic studies in humans. The basic reason for this request is to improve
sensitivity and chemical shift dispersion to allow more reliable quantitative
analysis of metabolic pathways. This advance will allow the use of smaller
samples including the isolated mouse heart or a few mls of human blood, better
time resolution in our kinetic studies of intact tissues, and additional 13C
fractional enrichment data provided by a single 2D heteronuclear multiple bond
correlation spectrum, all of which will dramatically improve our ability to
exploit the power of isotopomer analysis to interrogate intermediary metabolism.
Our view is that for the next decade at least, the single most fruitful method
for the analysis of intermediary metabolism will be 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy.
Although in vivo 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy is the most exciting application of
isotopomer analysis, it is unlikely that appropriate whole-body MRI/MRS systems
at the necessary field will be widely available any time soon for clinical
research. On the other hand, analytical NMR spectrometers suitable for
isotopomer studies of human blood or urine are already in place in virtually
every medical school in this country. We will apply these powerful methods in
cell culture, small animal models and in human voluntee rs, with the ultimate
goal of using isotopomer analysis for evaluation of intermediary metabolism in
patients.
