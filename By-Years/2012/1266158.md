This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
the conference "Focus Program on Noncommutative Geometry and Quantum Groups"
that will take place from June 3-28, 2013, at the Fields Institute in Toronto,
Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject matter of this wide-ranging conference
is noncommutative geometry and related topics. One of the deepest principles in
mathematics, dating back to Descartes's "La Geometrie" in 1637, is the
equivalence between geometry and algebra. Geometric objects can be studied by
algebraic tools, and algebra can be studied by thinking about it geometrically.
Noncommutative geometry is the study of geometry when the associated algebra is
noncommutative. Far from being just a generalization of conventional geometry
for its own sake, noncommutative geometry is in fact forced on us by the basic
principles of quantum mechanics, which require physically observable quantities
to correspond to noncommuting operators on a Hilbert space. This event will
explore the ramifications of such noncommutativity in a number of different
contexts. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
