This IGERT project is a multidisciplinary program of education and research
focused on biomechanics. Biomechanics is the study of phenomena in biology that
is broadly concerned with the mechanical characteristics of cells, tissues, and
organs. It deals with both structural aspects - for example, the strength of the
cytoskeleton and the Young's modulus of the cell - and dynamic aspects - the
motion of fluids in biological microchannels and the action of biological
micromotors. Understanding these phenomena and processes requires combining
methods, tools, and styles of research from biological and physical sciences,
and from engineering. The IGERT program is intended to offer Ph.D. students an
education designed to make them proficient in the methods of both biological and
physical sciences. The research component of the program will generate improved
understanding of important and relatively unexplored biological processes; it
will also use this understanding to design inanimate systems that mimic aspects
of the biological systems (biomimetic systems). The educational component will
combine thesis programs that require co-advisors from biological and physical
science and engineering, research rotations through laboratories with different
styles of research, and active interaction among students with different
backgrounds. The program will support 10 students per year, and involve 20
faculty at Harvard in the departments of biology, chemistry, and physics, the
Division of Applied Science and Engineering, and the Medical School. Many of
these research groups already collaborate in other projects: the proposed
program will strengthen and extend these collaborations, to the benefit of both
students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program
intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers
with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and
personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is
intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing
innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile
environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary
boundaries. In the fifth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-
one institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of science and
engineering supported by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;
