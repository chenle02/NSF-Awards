The State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNY-SB), in cooperation with
Princeton University and the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, will establish a Science and Technology Center for High-Pressure
Research. The Director of the Center will be Professor Donald J, Weidner of
SUNY-SB. The goals of the Center are: to determine and interpret the properties
of Earth materials at high-pressure; to design and construct the next generation
of high-pressure devices for applications in physics, chemistry, and materials
science, as well as the earth sciences; to apply high-pressure research to
better understand the Earth's interior and to resolve fundamental questions
about its evolution, structure and dynamic state; a better understanding of the
interiors of other planets; to apply high-pressure research to improve
understanding of synthetic materials of interest to materials science. To
accomplish these goals the Center will undertake the following programs: design
improved multi-anvil presses capable of higher combinations of pressure and
temperature on experimental samples of larger volume; new designs for ultra-high
pressure diamond-anvil cells, permitting more uniform conditions of pressure and
temperature over larger sample volumes; develop capabilities for measuring
calorimetric effects, elastic constants, electrical conductivity, and the
rheology of samples while subject to pressure and temperature; instrumentation
of x-ray beamlines for high- pressure experiments at the National Synchrotron
Light Source at Brookhaven; synthesis of new materials, including super-hard
materials and new phases theoretically predicted at high pressure and
temperature.
