This award by the Division of Chemistry: Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, and the Division of Materials Research: Solid
State Chemistry Program, to Professor Alicia M. Beatty at Mississippi State
University supports studies on the synthesis and characterization of hydrogen-
bonded inorganic/organic hybrid materials. The supermolecular synthetic approach
will establish new methods for the preparation of inorganic/organic hybrid
layers with organic pillars (homo-metallic clay mimics) and hybrid layers with
hybrid pillars (hetero-metallic clay mimics). These novel materials are expected
to have broad use in catalysis, chemical separations, and molecular recognition,
as well as potential applications in the development of magnetic solids and
semiconductors. The educational plan provides students and teachers in fifteen
high schools in the Mississippi State region with an opportunity to participate
in chemical research. Professor Beatty particularly focuses on encouraging women
as well as underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged
undergraduate and high school students to take part in her research and
educational activities. Annual continuing education classes focusing on crystal
growth, clay chemistries, and zeolites and minerals will also be offered to
Mississippi science teachers.
