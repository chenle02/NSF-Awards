This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
research on interstitial hydrides by Dr. Robert Bau of the Chemistry Department,
University of Southern California. Single-crystal neutron diffraction will be
used to determine the location of hydrogen atoms in a variety of organometallic
hydrides. Emphasis will be placed on metal cluster complexes in which hydrogen
is suspected to be in 4-coordinate or 5-coordinate sites. Attempts will be made
to correlate the structural results with NMR data for reference use, and
variable temperature measurements will be taken in both neutron diffraction and
NMR experiments. Compounds to be investigated include carbonyl hydride clusters
of ruthenium, osmium, rhodium and platinum. Metal cluster compounds are
important in many areas of materials and inorganic chemistry as well as
catalysis, and subsurface hydrogen may have a role in reactions of metals in
catalytic reactions. However, interstitial hydride in metals is not well
understood. In this research, the structural characteristics of interstitial
hydride in a number of unusual environments will be determined. These include
hydrogen atoms which may be surrounded by four or five nearest-neighbor atoms,
rather than the more commonly observed six, and also cases in which contain two
hydrogen atoms share the same interstitial space. These studies will also expand
knowledge about movement of hydrogen into interstitial spaces with different
geometries and temperature dependence of hydrogen movement in metal hydrides.
