The Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) at Ohio State University will be a
base for interdisciplinary work by mathematical scientists and biological
scientists on a broad range of biological problems. The mission of the MBI is
(i) to develop mathematical theories, statistical methods, and computational
algorithms for the solution of fundamental problems in the biosciences; (ii) to
involve mathematical scientists and bioscientists in the solution of these
problems; and (iii) to nurture a community of scholars through education and
support of students and researchers in the mathematical biosciences. To promote
its mission and overall goals, the MBI will build upon existing research efforts
in the mathematical biosciences and will encourage human research development
and intellectual growth.

The MBI will establish emphasis year programs, current topic workshops,
educational problems, and research projects. Participants in MBI programs will
be recruited nationally from the disciplines of the biosciences, mathematics,
and statistics, and will include senior researchers, postdoctoral fellows, and
graduate students. To increase the impact and cohesion of the program, there
will be efforts each year to connect to and build upon progress achieved in the
preceding years. The MBI will hold special workshops on current topics in the
biosciences that offer opportunities for mathematical involvement. The Institute
will also conduct summer educational programs in the mathematical biosciences
for college instructors, students, and high school teachers.
