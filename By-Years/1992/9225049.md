The workshop has a simple purpose: to explore the feasibility of designing,
building, and using common infrastructure. The key working product of the
meeting will be a document that addresses the following issues: 1. Can we agree
on a common set of representations to support our varied research efforts? 2.
How can we design these representations and their support software? 3. What
would it cost to design, implement, adopt, and maintain them? The final point of
consensus should be a recommendation for how to proceed after this workshop.
