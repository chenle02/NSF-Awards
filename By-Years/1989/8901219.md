They propose to conduct a three-year study of the structure and properties of
discotic liquid crystals and liquid crystal polymers. Both known and new
compounds will be synthesized, purified, and characterized optically and
thermodynamically. Their structures will then be studied via x-ray diffraction,
with particular emphasis on single-domain, high resolution studies of the
columnar phases, in a suspended strand geometry. Discotic liquid crystals are
typically composed of molecules with a rigid, disk-shaped core, and 4-8 flexible
alkyl tails. In addition to orientationally ordered nematic phases, these
molecules can order into columnar structures, with long range two-dimensional
positional order of the columns but only short range order along each column;
such columnar phases can be thought of as complementing the one-dimensional
smectic phases formed by many rod-like mesogens. Although discotics have been
studied for over a decade, little is known about the structural order,
conditions for stability, and phase transitions of these unusual materials. The
materials to be studied include: a) hexa-n- alkylthiotriphenylene and related
analogs, which display an unusual transition from a disordered columnar phase to
a closely related helical incommensurate crystalline phase; b) phthalocyanine
and related organometallic liquid crystalline compounds, which have potentially
important applications as anisotropic organic conductors; and c) discotic liquid
crystal polymers incorporating a variety of mesogenic units, including
triphenylene, phthalocyanine, and "Tubular" cores.
