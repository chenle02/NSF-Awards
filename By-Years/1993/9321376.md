9321376 Waddington This award is for support for a three year project to obtain
temperature logs in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) and Greenland
Ice Core Project (GRIP) boreholes at Summit, Greenland using the U.S. Geological
Survey's (U.S.G.S.) high precision temperature logging system. Temperatures will
also be logged in several dry holes near GISP2 and GRIP, since the upper 100
meters in the main holes have been thermally disturbed by the drill domes and
drilling activities. The data are needed to derive surface paleotemperatures
directly from the present-day temperature transients remaining at depth at these
sites, and to better calibrate the isotope paleothermometer over the past 25,000
years. Simultaneous inversion of high precision data from both deep holes will
allow isolation of the paleoclimate signal from ice dynamics effects. The
temperature data may also allow detection of rapid shearing in the silty basal
ice, thus providing a test independent of the borehole deformation. ***
