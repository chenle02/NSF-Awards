Wiley J. Youngs and Claire A. Tessier, Department of Chemistry, University of
Akron, are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program for the synthesis and study of heterocyclynes. These cyclic polyalkynes
contain silicon, germanium, platinum, titanium and other heteroatoms that will
tune the size and chemistry of a binding pocket. The project will also extend
heterocyclynes to complexes containing metal-metal bonds, dipocket
heterocyclynes that contain a Lewis acidic site and a Lewis basic site,
heterocyclynes that have larger pockets or can act as molecular tweezers, and
heterocyclynes that have unique materials properties such as liquid
crystallinity, semiconductivity or non-linear optical activity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterocyclynes are a key building block in supramolecular
chemistry. These analogs of tribenzocyclotriyne have well-defined pockets that
can selectively bind metal ions and other guest species. They are also potential
components of molecular electronics. Students trained in this area will develop
skill in synthesis, spectroscopy and crystallography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
