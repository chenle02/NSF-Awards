The School of Ocean and Earth Sciences &amp; Technology at the University of
Hawaii will continue shipboard technician activities associated with the
research vessel MOANA WAVE, a 210-foot vessel that is owned by the Navy and
operated by the University. A significant portion of the MOANA WAVE's operating
schedule in recent years and again in during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored
research projects. The Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-
sea component and an ashore component. The at-sea component consists of
instructing scientific personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;
mainte- nance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation;
instruction and supervision of deck operations; and providing logistics
assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific parties. On shore activities
include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing
equipment and assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on the
vessel. Shipboard technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities
for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the successful
completion of research projects at sea. The level of activity and amount of
support are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel, and its
scientific outfit and capability.
