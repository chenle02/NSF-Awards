Diamond-bearing rocks of the Dabie Shan metamorphic province of South China are
among the most unique rocks exposed on the surface of the earth and present a
major challege to tectonicists in terms of explaining their origins. Mineralogy
of these rocks indicate that they originated at the surface, were then subjected
to enormous pressures by burial, and finally exhumed to the surface. Although
much attention has been paid to the petrologic character of the affected rocks,
little work has been concentrated on the structures that are ultimately
responsible for their unique history. This project is geared to conducting such
studies and will attempt to establishe the geometry and kinematics of the
structures and will establish timing and cooling relations.
