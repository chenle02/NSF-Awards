CTS-9613827 YANG This grant will provide funds for travel grant awards to U.S.
authors of papers accepted for presentation and U.S. plenary lecturers at the
Second Joint USA/China Chemical Engineering Conference to be held in Beijing,
China on May 29, 1997. The First Joint Conference was held in 1982, also in
Beijing. This was a highly successful conference that served as a "door-opening"
meeting to Chinese chemical engineering by the U.S. delegation. The Second Joint
Conference will serve as an ideal forum for U.S. opportunities for cooperation.
As in the First Conference, the AIChE and its Chinese counterpart, Chemical
Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC), will be sponsors of the
Conference. In addition, the counterpart chemical engineering societies of
Germany, Japan and Korea will join as co-sponsors, thus expanding the scope and
impact of the Conference. The Second Conference will be the largest formal
international conference in Chemical Engineering. The proposed budget of $25,000
will provide for 20-25 partial travel grant awards to U.S. authors of papers and
invited plenary lecturers at the Conference. Travel awards will be made based on
the following considerations: (1) scientific or technological merit of the
paper; (2) availability of other sources of travel funding; (3) professional
qualifications relative to age and position; (4) institutional and geographical
distribution. All awards will be made in full compliance with the Civil Rights
Acts of 1964. NSF travel policies with respect to U.S. air carriers will be
followed. ***
