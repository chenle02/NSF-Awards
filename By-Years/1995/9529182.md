ABSTRACT CTS-9529182 The objective of this research is the investigation of the
hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over cobalt-nickel Fischer-Tropsch catalysts
supported on a series of mixed oxides, including manganese-zirconium oxide,
manganese-vanadium oxide, and niobium-zirconium oxide. A major interest is the
yield and selectivity in the gasoline range - C5 to C11 hydrocarbons. The
supported catalysts are tested alone as well as in combination with hydrogen-
exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite. The effects of process variables such as temperature,
pressure, space velocity, carbon monoxide/hydrogen ratio, and zeolite/catalyst
ratio on steady-state product distributions are also investigated. This award to
a historically black college is made under the Research in Undergraduate
Institutions announcement. The research is relevant to the production of
gasoline from nonpetroleum sources such as coal, natural gas or biomass.
