Abstract&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0126144&lt;br/&gt;Heizler and McIntosh&lt;br/&gt;New
Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cogenetic biotite
and sanidine from volcanic rocks often yield discordant 40Ar/39Ar ages. The
typical age discordance is between 0.2 and 1.0 Ma. The discordance has important
implications for detailed, high precision volcanic history studies, for
intercalibration of K/Ar with U/Pb and other geochronological methods, and the
age of flux monitor standards. This proposal will investigate the causes of the
biotite/sanidine discordance through detailed geochronological analyses of two
well-studied Mid-Tertiary volcanic sequences from the Mogollon-Datil volcanic
field of New Mexico. The expected outcome of this study could be far reaching,
if it is shown that biotite ages are plagued by inaccuracy that is not evident
in individual analyses. Because biotite is the most commonly dated volcanic and
plutonic mineral phase and it often yields highly precise apparent ages,
determination of accuracy of biotite ages is essential to a wide variety of
tectonic, volcanic, and geological studies.&lt;br/&gt;
