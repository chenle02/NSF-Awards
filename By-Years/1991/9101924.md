Dr. Robin L. McCarley has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. McCarley's doctoral degree was from the University of North
Carolina under the supervision of Professor Royce Murray. Dr. McCarley will
continue research at the University of Texas-Austin under the sponsorship of Dr.
Allen Bard. Dr. McCarley's postdoctoral research will involve the use of
scanning tunneling microscopy to image biological species on surfaces. Longer
term, he plans to focus on the molecular engineering of surfaces involved in
electrochemical processes. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
