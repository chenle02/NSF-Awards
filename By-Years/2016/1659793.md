The Division of Ocean Sciences provides support via this award for a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of California San
Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) located in La Jolla, CA. The
program supports a 10-week summer internship program that invites sixteen
undergraduate students from across the country to Scripps to participate in high
quality collaborative research with Scripps faculty and researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The breadth of ocean-related sciences at Scripps makes it
accessible to students from practically all science and engineering disciplines,
including physics, chemistry, geology, mathematics, ecology, physiology,
molecular/biotechnology, environmental sciences and technology/computer science.
Program components include a comprehensive research project, research seminars,
career workshops, graduate school preparation, field trips, and participation in
a final research symposium. Students receive a stipend, travel funding to attend
the program and housing for the duration of the program. Students may receive
support to present their research at scientific conferences. The goal of this
REU site is to attract and retain a diverse pool of talented undergraduate
students in marine and earth science and related fields.
