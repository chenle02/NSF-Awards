The authors propose to use new submillimeter and millimeter observations of the
Sun from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to model the low and middle
chromospheres of sunspots and magnetic flux tubes in plage. This program will be
a continuation of an exploratory solar program they recently completed to open
the JCMT to solar research. Under this program, the JCMT gave the authors the
first submillimeter observations of the chromospheric supergranular network, of
sunspots, and of prominences, opening these fundamental solar phenomena to the
powerful LTE diagnostic tools of the far infrared continuum. The new program
will be based primarily on analysis of the large amount of high-quality data
already obtained. However, further observations will also be made on the JCMT.
These will include the development of improved mapping techniques, observations
at longer wavelengths (out to 2 mm) and observations of intensity variations due
to oscillations and possibly fares, using SCUBA, the 100 element bolometer array
under development at the JCMT. The new program will also include preliminary
analysis of observations of the total solar eclipse of 1991 July 11 over Mauna
Kea.
