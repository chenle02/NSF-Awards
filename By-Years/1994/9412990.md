9412990 Rubinstein This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research type project
to evaluate the possibility of using the grain growth associated with
recrystallization to locate the elastic-plastic interface in front of a crack.
Such knowledge would be useful in evaluating theories of fracture mechanics. The
main issue is the development of temperature-time pattern for the sample heat
treatment to yield the most sensitivity at the elastic-plastic interface. ***
