9310586 Krauss Conversational gestures are unplanned, fluent hand movements that
often accompany spontaneous speech. Traditionally it has been assumed that such
gestures serve a communicative function - i.e, that speakers use them to convey
information to an addressee in much the same way they use language. However, the
empirical evidence supporting this assumption is tenuous, and recent research
suggests that gestures convey relatively little semantic information. In
contrast, the lexical access hypothesis views conversational gestures as an
intrinsic part of the speech production process, and hypothesizes that their
primary function is to help the speaker retrieve words from the mental lexicon.
however, these gestures may convey nonsemantic information about a speaker's
internal state, and such information can affect the interpretation of the spoken
message. In this way, gestures may play an important role in the regulation and
maintenance of social interaction. A series of experiments will explore the
functions conversational gestures serve for speakers, the kinds of conceptual
contents whose expression they facilitate, the nonsemantic information they
convey to addressees, and the role that this kind of information plays in
interpersonal communication. The results of these studies will broaden our
understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying human communication. The
methodology developed also has applications in research on communicative
disorders in which speakers experience difficulty in word retrieval. ***
