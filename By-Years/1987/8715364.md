This research is a Cooperative effort between Professor A. P. Meliopoulos of Ga
Tech Research Corp./ECS-8715364 and Professor George J. Cokkinides/ University
of South Carolina at Columbia/ ECS-8715038, and is focused on the formulation of
a methodology probabilistic simulation of the compsite (generation plus
transmission) power system. The formulation is based on a probabilistic
representation of the electric load, customer-owned generation availability,
transmission availability, etc. Major operating practices such as economic
dispatch together with pertinent system constraints such as random forced
outages are included the aim of the work is new reliability and transmission
loss evaluation techniques currently not available.
