This project will continue two unique research projects that investigate
fundamental physics occurring in Earth's core. First, we will make novel
measurements of turbulent convection that simulates Earth's core using the
unique rotating magnetoconvection device that was designed and developed in our
laboratory. In particular, we will carry out detailed measurements of turbulent
convection, rotating convection, magnetoconvection and rotating
magnetoconvection in liquid gallium. This data, providing the first measurements
of strongly turbulent rotating magnetoconvection, will allow us to better
understand the fundamental convection dynamics in core settings. Second, we will
carry out quasigeostrophic two-dimensional numerical models and three-
dimensional laboratory models of core convection influenced by core-mantle
boundary (CMB) topography. These models will be used to determine how CMB
topography can affect core flow patterns, how core-mantle torques are generated
between the fluid and the topography, and at what height of topography core flow
is significantly altered. This will be the first investigation covering a broad
range of parameter values that will provide scaling laws for topographic
interactions between the mantle and the core.

These studies will provide benchmark data describing rotating magnetoconvection
and core-mantle coupling mechanisms. These results will be especially relevant
to numerical modelers of the Earth's core and other planetary dynamos. They will
also be relevant to geophysicists and geodesists who model Earth's rotational
properties, astrophysical dynamo modelers, and fluid physicists and engineers
studying convection physics and magnetohydrodynamics. These projects will
provide computational and experimental training for undergraduate and graduate
students in the laboratory. Furthermore, this funding will allow the development
of a library of rotating fluid dynamics movies that will be available online for
educators and students alike.
