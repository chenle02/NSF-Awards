Engineering students at the University of Michigan - Dearborn are using new
Computer Integrated Manufacturing facilities that enhance the existing
Manufacturing Systems Laboratory. Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) is a
challenging multidisciplinary concept requiring advanced computer technology,
software engineering skills, and computer networking. This project involves the
integration of manufacturing cells with existing CAD/CAM and simulation
laboratories. To complete the CIM environment experience, use of CAD/CAM
simulation software is also part of the laboratory experiments. The additions
make possible two new courses on Computer Aided Engineering and Systems
Integration, and enhance the laboratory teaching of more than ten other
engineering courses.
