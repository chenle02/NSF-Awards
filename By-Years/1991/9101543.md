This project is concerned with the representation theory of finite groups. The
principal investigator will work on establishing the weight conjecture. He will
also study the general modular representation theory of Hecke algebras for
arbitrary finite groups and will study coefficient systems on some simplicial
complexes related to group structure. This project is in the general area of
representation theory of finite groups. The principal investigator will examine
several problems in this area including the weight conjecture. An affirmative
answer to this conjecture would lead to the solution of several long outstanding
problems in this area.
