9505770 Haggerty The primary objective is to test the Core/Mantle Boundary-plume
origin by studying the geochemistry and mineralogy of kimberlites and entrained
xeonoliths. Theoretical, experimental, and geochemical templates will be applied
to identify the various components that have been sampled along the 2900 km
conduit. One section of the conduit, between 410 and 660 km (the transition
zone, TZ), is of particular interest because the boundaries are marked by dense
mineral phase transitions, deep focus earthquakes, high pressure minerals
capable of water retention, and a layer that may harbor the accumulation of
subducted ocean floor basaltic slabs. A second objective is to place limits on
the extent of chemical heterogeneity, and to describe the geology of the TZ.
This will be done through a mineral and geochemical study of ultradeep
xenoliths, eclogites (high pressure basalt), and xenoliths modified by fluidal
melt processes (metasomites). A third objective is to study an unusual form of
diamond known as carbonado, which is sintered but also porous. Resolving the
origin of carbonado will have geological implications and technological
applications. These studies will be undertaken on rocks from South Africa,
Botswana, and Sierra Leone, and on carbonado from Brazil. Standard techniques
with state-of-the-art instruments, will be applied to the study in laboratories
at the University of Massachusetts, and in collaboration with other institutes.
