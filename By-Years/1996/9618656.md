9618656 Cohen This project addresses dynamical processes of epitaxial growth.
For GaAs, the evolution of surface morphology, island formation, crossover to
step flow, and the role of adatoms in growth kinetics and morphology will be
studied using RHEED and STM. An important goal is to use the knowledge obtained
to develop atomic level understanding and control over film growth. Energy-
filtered RHEED will be used to improve the comparison with dynamical
calculations and to eliminate uncertainties in the measurement of diffuse
intensities. Step edge scattering factors will be considered in the correlation
function analysis of diffraction. The project will also study GaN growth on bulk
GaN platelets(whiskers); this approach is used to remove the role of the
amorphous buffer layer normally present with GaN growth on sapphire. The aim is
to obtain definitive data on epitaxial processes having direct relationships to
microscopic processes of growth. %%% The project addresses forefront research
issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and
integrated circuitry. Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding
gained from the research is expected to contribute in a general way to improving
the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental
understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and
materials combinations. An important feature of the program is the integration
of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
and technologically significant area. ***
