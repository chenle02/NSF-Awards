0224546&lt;br/&gt;Yau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-Hong Kong joint
workshop proposal on Recent Developments in Complex Variables, Cauchy Riemann
Geometry and Complex Algebraic Geometry submitted by Dr. Stephen Yau, University
of Illinois and Dr. Ngaiming Mok, Hong Kong University. The meeting will be held
at Hong Kong University, May 12-16, 2003. The conference covers an important
topic in mathematics, with the attendance of top level of researchers from the
U.S., Hong Kong and China. With the inclusion of junior scientists from the
U.S., this conference could provide an important venue for these U.S. scientists
to meet with their colleagues from East Asia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
