Resources are made available to acquire computers, auxiliary equipment for
computer support, and commercial software for equipping a hypermedia learning
laboratory for use by undergraduate engineering students. This laboratory will
be used for formal teaching of computer techniques to be utilized in freshman
and sophomore courses. In addition, it will be made available for students to
use computer aided instructional (CAI) material prepared as supplemental
learning material for civil engineering courses. This information will be
prepared in a hypermedia format which may include text, sound, animation, video
sequences, photographs, example and practice problems, and assessment
instruments. CAI can supplement and enrich course material initially presented
in the classroom. Data bases listing design criteria, material properties and
specifications, cost, regulatory rules, etc. can be provided with equipment now
available in purchased for wordprocessing, spreadsheets, CAD,graphics
development and programs for solving specific problems in the various topic area
will be available for the students to use in their preparation of both oral and
written class assignments.
