These research projects address problems in the model theory
of&lt;br/&gt;differential fields and the model theory of the field of
real&lt;br/&gt;numbers with exponentiation. The model theory of
differential&lt;br/&gt;fields is a fascinating area requiring a sophisticated
mixture of&lt;br/&gt;ideas from stability theory, differential algebra and
algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. The work of Buium and Hrushovski has shown that
these&lt;br/&gt;ideas have important consequences in Diophantine geometry.
In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the principal investigator will study the
model&lt;br/&gt;theoretic behavior of solution sets of families of
algebraic&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. This line of research on the
model&lt;br/&gt;theory of the field of real numbers with exponentiation
is&lt;br/&gt;expected to concentrate on the relationship between
global&lt;br/&gt;solutions to differential equations at infinity and
formal&lt;br/&gt;solutions in the field of logarithmic-exponential
series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model theory is a branch of logic that explores
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structures such as the real numbers together with
their&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic operations and ordering relation, analyzing the
degree&lt;br/&gt;to which the basic rules or axioms for a collection of
objects&lt;br/&gt;and their operations determine the shape of that collection.
The&lt;br/&gt;methods and results of model theory are cast in terms
of&lt;br/&gt;definable sets and functions, where a construction is
definable&lt;br/&gt;exactly when it can be expressed by first-order logical
formulas&lt;br/&gt;in the language of the structure. Model theoretic methods for
the&lt;br/&gt;field of real numbers with exponentiation have been
remarkably&lt;br/&gt;successful in proving new results on the geometry of
exponential&lt;br/&gt;varieties and sets defined from them. This work has
already found&lt;br/&gt;applications in asymptotic analysis, control theory,
microlocal&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and neural networks. The model theory of
differential&lt;br/&gt;fields has had significant applications in number
theory.&lt;br/&gt;
