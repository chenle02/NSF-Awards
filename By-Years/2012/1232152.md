Objective: While wind power is becoming an important source of alternative
energy, the adverse effect of wind farms on existing radar systems is raising
serious concerns. The objective of this research is to gain an in-depth
understanding of electromagnetic scattering from wind farms. Our approach
entails: (i) developing simulation techniques to predict and analyze dynamic
radar signatures of wind farms, (ii) developing radar facility and measurement
techniques to acquire scaled model and in-situ data from wind farms, and (iii)
exploiting the knowledge for interference mitigation and turbine monitoring
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research
will lead to an in-depth understanding of the dynamic radar signatures of large
wind farms. In the process, efficient simulation and measurement techniques will
be developed to study the scattering from rotating turbine blades. These
techniques will be applicable to a much wider class of problems where the main
radar features of interest lie in how target structural changes are manifested
in the time-varying radar returns. Examples include tracking of human activities
and structural monitoring of large buildings and bridges.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research will result in a
better integration of wind power with existing radar infrastructures. The
research findings will lead to technology advancement in interference mitigation
and structural monitoring techniques. The developed radar measurement facility
will be made available to academic researchers, and should significantly bolster
the research and education infrastructure in radar. A number of outreach
activities are planned to inspire K-12 students to pursue careers in science and
engineering.
