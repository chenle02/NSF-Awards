Participants of space and antarctic missions endure common stresses including
isolation, confinement, and forced socialization, and may suffer biological
alterations. A more precise formulation of the interplay of such stresses on
human well-being is needed. The Polar Research Board's ad hoc Committee on
Antarctic and Space Life Sciences will conduct an assessment of antarctic and
space life sciences, identifying top-priority research needs and highlighting
collaborative projects. The committee will survey existing research by holding a
workshop to bring together antarctic and space life scientists. A slate of
promising research questions will be developed. Participation by space and
antarctic program managers will be sought to help identify infrastructure
requirements and environmental restraints and to further refine the developing
research agenda. A report identifying priorities for antarctic/space life
science research will be written. This report is to include a summary of
existing research priorities addresses in discussion of techniques and
infrastructure requirements needed to meet the proposed objects.
