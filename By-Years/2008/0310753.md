Mathematical Sciences (21) The Curricula for Sophomore Level Transition project
focuses on the development of curricula for sophomore students transitioning to
more advanced mathematics. This project adapts and implements practices of
Project Intermath (DUE#:9555414) with components from Interdisciplinary Lively
Applications Projects (DUE#:9455980) and Laboratory in Mathematical
Experimentation (DUE#:9554646).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project introduces
applications of mathematics early in the undergraduate's college coursework.
This early intervention allows students to explore, in more depth, the
mathematical process, experience using advanced mathematical software, acquire
experience in elementary proof techniques in an applied setting and improve the
students background in preparation for higher level mathematics. The project
engages students in gaining experiences in technology, exploring mathematical
conjecture, applying mathematics to interdisciplinary settings, and in
communicating the implications of mathematical models while introducing
techniques of proof. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project impacts students across
disciplines including mathematics majors and non-majors as well as students in
the secondary mathematics education major.&lt;br/&gt;
