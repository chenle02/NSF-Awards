The Research Initiation Award entitled - High-Performance Green Bridges - has
the goal to formulate a rating system for the design and construction of high-
performance green bridges with particular emphasis on the development of a new
generation of seismic-resistant bridge columns using composite materials as
internal reinforcement. The research objectives are: to define the criteria for
a high-performance green bridge through the creation of a rating system to
develop sustainable design and construction certification levels of new bridges;
to design a structurally admissible and seismically resistant bridge column
comprised of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars as the internal reinforcement
and energy devices to help minimize residual displacements; and to prove through
experimental testing and analytical modeling validation that the structural
behavior of a new class of bridge columns can be carefully engineered and
designed with FRP bars and energy devices to resist moderate-to-strong
earthquake ground motions. The education objectives are: to establish a modern
Green Transportation Infrastructure Center at Morgan State University; to
attract, recruit, train, and mentor undergraduate students in areas of advanced
structural analysis and design topics; and to disseminate the results in
scholarly publications and conference papers.

The results of the project will lead to the development of the next generation
of sustainable, high-performance bridges with options for the implementation of
seismically-resistant bridge columns and their connections that consist of
externally unbonded FRP bars to aid with self-centering during an earthquake,
internally bonded FRP bars to provide sufficient deformability, and energy
devices to absorb energy from the earthquake. The externally unbonded FRP bars
are expected to remain elastic during an earthquake for "controlled rocking,"
which is appropriate for FRP bars that exhibit high tensile strength and non-
ductile behavior with strains in the range of 1-3%.
