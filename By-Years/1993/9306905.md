Abstract - Bauer - 9306905 The method presently used to convert methane to
liquid fuels is based on the Fischer/Tropsch process. This is environmentally
undesirable and relatively inefficient. In general, methanol as a motor fuel is
not attractive because of the energy intensive process used to produce it. An
alternative is a possible homogeneous pyrolysis and oxidative mechanism for
methane conversion which would introduce an inexpensive initiator that generates
copious levels of H, O, or OH radicals at temperatures well below that required
for C-H bond fission, and addition of a component that induces branched chains
for additional initial rapid radical production. The PIs plan to experimentally
test a thermal conversion mechanism under homogeneous conditions, that appears
attractive based on an extensive computer analysis of the chemical kinetics
processes that occur during co-pyrolysis of methane with selected radical
initiators, at relatively modest temperatures. Specifically, they plan to
validate a pyrolysis process in flow-tube reactors operated in the 800 to 900
SYMBOL 176 \f "Symbol" C temperature range and 5 to 30 atmospheres operating
pressures, using free-radical initiators derived from highly branched alkenes or
alkanes, commixed with the methane, at approximately 1% levels, concurrently
with added 1 to 2% oxygen. Two types of experimental tests will be undertaken to
validate the process and to measure product distributions developed in bench-
scale trials: (1) the use of a "wall-less" laser heated reactor, and (2) tests
using "bomb" experiments. Various operating conditions will be explored to
optimize conversions to desirable higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. ! & # $
