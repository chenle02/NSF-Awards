9406187 Tracy This award provides 70 per-cent of the funding required for the
upgrade of the electron microprobe instrument housed and operated in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for this upgrade. The upgrade will provide new computer control of the
instrument as well as a contamination-free vacuum pumping system. The electron
microprobe at VPI is used extensively to obtain images of element distributions
in geological samples with micron scale spatial resolution, requiring modern
computer automation and a pumping system that will not contaminate the sample
surface during long exposure to the electron beam. ***
