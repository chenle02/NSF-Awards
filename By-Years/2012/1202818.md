Regulation of protein phosphatase specificity in response to nutrient
deprivation Although much is known about how protein kinases function to
regulate cell signaling pathways, how protein phosphatases are regulated to de-
phosphorylate proteins and counteract kinase function has not been established.
How serine-threonine protein phosphatases are regulated by extra- or
intracellular signals to achieve specificity towards various substrates is
poorly understood. Phosphatase specificity towards a substrate is largely
controlled by its binding proteins. Protein phosphatase specificity is achieved
through the assembly of a trimeric complex in which the catalytic C subunit
interacts with the scaffolding A subunit. This AC complex can then associate
with over 15 regulatory B subunits through the A subunit. Binding of a specific
B subunit determines substrate specificity. Although protein phosphatase
complexes function in almost all known signaling pathways such as stress
signaling and cell cycle regulation, the central question that remains
unanswered is: How are protein phosphatases actively regulated by different
signals to acquire specificity despite the promiscuous activity of their
catalytic subunit? A specific B subunit has been identified that is
transcriptionally up-regulated in response to glucose deprivation. This B
subunit may play a critical role in regulating cell survival under glucose
limiting conditions. The proposed research will elucidate the mechanisms that
regulate phosphatase substrate specificity in response to glucose deprivation.

Training objectives include learning techniques of mass spectrometry and
phosphatase assays. Broader impacts include increasing the participation of
underrepresented minorities at the postdoctoral level, as well as mentoring high
school and college students from disadvantaged groups who will partake in
research at the host institution.
