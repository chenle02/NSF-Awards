This workshop will plan the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The workshop
will bring together an international group of experienced arctic botanists and
soil ecologists to identify and design a simple experiment which will contribute
to the understanding and prediction of the effects of climate change on arctic
plant populations. This planning effort will contribute to the terrestrial
component NSF's Arctic System Science Program and could serve as a model for
further international experiments involving other critical biological taxa such
as invertebrates, microorganisms and valuable subsistence species. The results
and recommendations will be promptly and widely published.
