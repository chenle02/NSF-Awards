The goals of this research are twofold. First, efforts will be made to isolate
and characterize a number of photoproducts believed to be relevant to achieving
a chemical understanding of UVB-induced DNA damage. Cyclobutane dimers, Dewar
adducts and (6-4) adducts of 5-methylcytosine with thiamine and cytosine will be
sought. Second, it will be determined if the various products isolated in
experiments related to goal one are also formed within the context of DNA and in
the environment of a cell nucleus. Calf thymus DNA and nuclei and wheat DNA and
nuclei will be used for this portion of the work.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research efforts of Dr. Martin D. Shetlar of the Department of
Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of California, San Francisco.
Professor Shetlar will focus his work on finding out what happens to mammalian
and plant DNA after it absorbs ultraviolet light. In particular, the work
focuses on the role of the minor base 5-methylcytosine in mediating damage
induced by the absorption of ultraviolet light. The research could have a
broader impact in helping to understand the role that UV-induced lesions in DNA
might play in the induction of skin cancer and other unwanted biological
effects.
