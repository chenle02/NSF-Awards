The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Prof. David Hoffman at Iowa State University on a new
approach to quantum dynamics calculations. This is a collaborative project with
Professor Donald Kouri of the University of Houston whose effort is also being
supported by the Division. The Feynman path integral method is used to replace
the customary calculation of matrix products, eigenvalues, and inverses which
scale very rapidly with system size. Gaussian importance sampling is used to
produce a manageable variance in the Monte Carlo integral. The goal is to make
possible fully quantum mechanical treatment of scattering systems of a larger
size than previously possible. %%% Numerically exact quantum mechanical methods
for analyzing chemical reactions have in the past been limited to systems
containing no more than three atoms, at least one of which must be hydrogen.
This project is testing a new computational technique which offers promise of
permitting such calculations on larger systems and, more generally, can be used
in studying other quantum mechanical collisional processes.
