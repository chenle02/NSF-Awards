Double Affine Hecke Algebras&lt;br/&gt;Ivan Cherednik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
aim of the project is to study double affine Hecke&lt;br/&gt;algebras (DAHA) and
their representations, especially those&lt;br/&gt;with applications in harmonic
analysis. The focus is the&lt;br/&gt;structure of the polynomial representation
of DAHA, its&lt;br/&gt;decomposition and special quotients for generic q, at
roots&lt;br/&gt;of unity and for unimodular q. The main examples are
finite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional quotients of the polynomial
representation&lt;br/&gt;generalizing the Verlinde algebras from conformal
field&lt;br/&gt;theory; infinite dimensional and non-semisimple
quotients&lt;br/&gt;are a natural next step. Deep connections to the
classical&lt;br/&gt;theory of affine Hecke algebras, the theory of Kac-
Moody&lt;br/&gt;algebras, and modern mathematical physics are
expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lie groups and Lie algebras formalize the concept
of symmetry&lt;br/&gt;in the theory of special functions, physics, geometry,
and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics. In a similar way, DAHA are candidates for
a&lt;br/&gt;formalization of the notion of the Fourier transform. In
the&lt;br/&gt;simplest one-dimensional case, they are directly related
to&lt;br/&gt;the celebrated sl(2). There are indications that they
serve&lt;br/&gt;the multidimensional theory of Fourier transform better
than&lt;br/&gt;Lie and Kac-Moody algebras. DAHA are also a source of new
unitary&lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional theories, that, presumably, will
find&lt;br/&gt;fundamental applications in mathematics and physics,
the&lt;br/&gt;theory of special functions and combinatorics. There are
other&lt;br/&gt;important directions of the DAHA theory, mainly of
algebraic&lt;br/&gt;nature, but unitary representaions and Fourier analysis
remain&lt;br/&gt;of high priority.&lt;br/&gt;
