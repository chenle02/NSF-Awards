This award to the Queens College of City University of New York will allow the
PI, a minority researcher, to conduct an ethnographic and ethnohistorical study
of two middle-income Black communities in Queens, New York City. One community
(East Elmhurst) has been stable for several years and the other (Lefrak City)
has developed more recently. Both are undergoing dramatic social change as new
immigrant populations move into the area. This research is important because it
will add to our knowledge of how Black middle-class communities develop and
relate to the city governments they deal with as well as the other ethnic
populations that they must now coexist with.
