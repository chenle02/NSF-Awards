*** 9761485 Abramovich This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore magnetohydrodynamic feedback and spectrum translation to
create a new class of very broad-band, wide dynamic range seismometers. The new
instruments will be based on molecular electronic technology (MET), with force
balancing feedback provided by the magnetohydrodynamic effect on the
electrolyte, which serves as the inertial mass. Radical noise reduction will be
achieved via the use of signal modulation to produce spectrum translation. Phase
I will develop an instrument equal in performance to the best traditional-
technology seismometers while retaining desirable features of MET seismic
sensors, e.g., low cost, low power, ruggedness, and suitability for volume
production. These seismometers are expected to find commercial applications
wherever top-of-the line traditional seismometers are currently employed. Their
low cost makes them particularly attractive for use in large sensor network and
education applications. ***
