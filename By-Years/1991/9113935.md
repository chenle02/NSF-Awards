The primary goal of this research is to assemble a physical map of the
Arabidopsis genome. Mapping will be achieved by linking the entire genome of
Arabidopsis thaliana which will ultimately consist of a fully overlapping
collection of clones encompassing the 5 linkage groups. The genome linking using
YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) clones to contig hybridization is listed as
the highest priority activity in the long-range plan for the Multinational
Coordinated Arabidopsis Genome Research Project. The physical map will provide
easy access to any region of the genome thereby simplifying the cloning of
important loci which have been identified by mutational analysis. The probes
used in this study will be placed in the national Arabidopsis resource center
and will be made available to the general research community.
