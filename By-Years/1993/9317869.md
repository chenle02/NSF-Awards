9317869 Havel This project investigates the extent and impact of the invasion by
the alien microcrustacean Daphnia lumholtzi on the freshwater biota of the
central and southeastern United States. This species may be more resistant to
predation than native species and may therefore replace native species and
disrupt natural food chains. This disruption could have important consequences
on the productivity of freshwater bodies, including fish populations. The
project will examine the invasion by this species by surveying several hundred
reservoirs in the central U.S. to determine its distribution and its effects on
the biota. %%% This research is important because it examines the pattern and
consequences of the accidental introduction of an alien species into bodies of
fresh water. The results will be of use to fishery managers, conservation
biologists, and those charged with regulating the import of alien species into
the United States. *** G B G F G G ^ Times New Roman Symbol & Arial 1 Courier 5
