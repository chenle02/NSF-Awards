This project tests and facilitates a creative problem solving methodology that
develops and engages multi-disciplinary research teams in order to produce
radically innovative research agendas. This project establishes a natural
experiment to examine a methodology that engages researchers in a novel
collaborative process to develop potentially transformative ideas that will
address the challenge of workforce development in any given STEM discipline,
Biology in this case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project adapts a
participatory action research (PAR) approach to facilitate the development of a
problem solving environment and to study this real world problem solving
situation in order to: (1) iteratively examine the complex social and
intellectual processes involved in collaboration and in creative problem solving
and (2) develop novel interdisciplinary research agendas in undergraduate STEM
education that address workforce needs unique to Biology. Thus, the project's
impact has potential for serving as a demonstration of the complex process of
collaboration in multi-disciplinary research groups, as a test of social and
individual process involved in collaboration and in creative problem solving,
and as a means for documenting the development of radically innovative research
agendas needed to develop the future workforce in Biology.
