A multiagent system can be characterized by a collection of interacting
subsystems each making local decisions in response to local information. There
are numerous examples of multiagent systems spanning both the engineering and
social sciences, e.g., wind farms, surveillance systems, and transportation
networks. Regardless of the specific domain, the primary goal in such systems is
to design admissible mechanisms for coordinating the behavior of the individual
subsystems to ensure that the emergent collective behavior is desirable with
respect to a system-level objective.

Intellectual Merit The overarching goal of this project is to develop game-
theoretic methodologies for multiagent coordination with broad applicability to
both social and engineering systems. In the context of social multiagent
systems, this project will focus on the derivation of optimal mechanisms for
coordinating the collective behavior in situations where the society's
sensitivity to such mechanisms is unknown, e.g., taxation mechanisms on traffic
networks. In the context of engineering multiagent systems, this project will
focus on the derivation of (i) distributed control algorithms that guarantee
that the multiagent systems exhibits the optimal correlated behavior and (ii)
fundamental relationships pertaining to how informational patterns impact
achievable performance guarantees in multiagent systems.

Broader Impacts

A central goal on this project involves promoting the general understanding of
multiagent systems to the engineering community and beyond. Undoubtedly,
engineers will be responsible for the design of a wide array of multiagent
systems with examples spanning all aspects of society. Successfully controlling
such ?complex? systems requires that engineers be multi-disciplinary with a
strong proficiency in both the engineering and social sciences. This project
will seek to achieve this goal through direct interactions with K-12 students,
public lectures, dissemination of course material at the intersection of social
and engineering sciences, and direct interactions with industry to illustrate
the applicability of the developed methodologies.
