With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Daron Janzen from College of St Catherine and colleagues Steven Drew (Carleton
College), Ted Pappenfus (U Minnesota Morris), James Wollack (College of St
Catherine) and Alicia Peterson (College of Saint Benedict) will acquire a
benchtop X-ray diffractometer that will serve a consortium of schools. The award
will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas
such as (a) vapochromic sensor materials, (b) organic materials for use in bulk
heterojunction solar cells, and (c) dechlorination of environmental pollutants.

An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry
and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well
as research at a consortium of institutions that include the College of St.
Catherine, Carleton College, University of Minnesota at Morris and the College
of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University.
