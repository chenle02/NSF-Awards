This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project plans to put design
optimization and product and process simulation into the core of polymer
composites processing research. The focus on the integration of the fundamentals
of materials processing and design via a new, comprehensive framework is
promising for both manufacturing education and product realization in polymer
composites processing. Today's successful engineering organizations continue to
make progress towards incorporating manufacturing demands during a product's
design. It is unfortunate, however, that at a time when computer simulation has
revolutionized the way new products emerge, designers continue to employ ad-hoc
methods to ensure that a product accommodates its manufacturing process and vice
versa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks a new approach that places
product specifications and materials processing requirements on a common basis
where product and process simulation and multidisciplinary design optimization
methods are central. The focus is on short fiber reinforced thermoplastic
products manufactured by the injection molding process where a product's
structural performance is defined by it's fiber orientation, that is itself
determined during production. Optimal designs will be computed based on mold
filling simulation, fiber orientation prediction, and structural evaluation.
Large-scale industrial products common to automotive design are to be
considered. Additionally, this research recognizes the increased design emphasis
in today's undergraduate engineering curriculum and will, therefore, study
decision making through the merging of multidisciplinary design into the
educational pedagogy. Educational activities include undergraduate and graduate
instruction on multidisciplinary design, integration of computational design
into student competitions, and an effort to make K-12 teachers more familiar
with modern design methodologies.
