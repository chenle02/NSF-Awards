This project is concerned with research in theoretical, computational and
applied aspects of a class of partial differential equations, known as
nonhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations. Fast, accurate and parallelizable
algorithms for solving these equations in simple and complicated regions will be
developed. Basic computational modules based on the theory of these algorithms
will developed and implemented on serial and parallel computers. Emphasis will
be placed on the use of vector computers such as CRAY-YMP as well as parallel
machines such as SEQUENT and NCUBE. These algorithms will be used to solve
compressible flow problems and to generate quasiconformal mappings. The theory
of these algorithms makes use of analysis based on complex variables. This makes
these algorithms elegant and the computational procedure semianalytical. Beside,
these algorithms are extremely fast, highly accurate, easy to implement, and
parallelizable. The basic computational tools based on these algorithms will be
made user friendly and portable so that these can be applied with ease in many
pure and applied areas including quasiconformal mappings, fluid flows and
inverse problems.
