The project will develop estimators of limited dependent variable models, also
known as Tobit models, with fixed effects. Individually, fixed effects models
and Tobit models are frequently used in empirical economics. A Tobit model with
fixed- effects is implied by a structural life cycle model of labor supply and
many other models, and is of interest as a reduced form specification. It is
desirable to have asymptotic results for fixed effects estimators as the number
of individuals increases (with the number of observations per individual fixed).
No current estimators for Tobit models with fixed effects are asymptotically
normal, or even consistent, as the number of individuals gets large. The project
will solve this problem and at the same time relax some of the distributional
assumptions. The efficiency of the estimators that are constructed will also be
examined. The research will be supplemented with simulations. Given the
availability of important panel data sets in economics, the development of these
estimators will improve the estimation of many important types of economic
models, especially in the area of labor economics.
