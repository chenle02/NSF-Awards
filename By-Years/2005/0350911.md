The project is centered on the study of mathematical aspects of inverse
problems, from the point of view of functional and complex mathematical
analysis. Statistics, spectral analysis, X-ray crystallography, tomography offer
models and classical examples of such questions. More specifically, most of the
modern inverse problems are related to (power, Fourier, wavelet) moments of mass
distributions. In their turn, moment problems form a well established field of
research with a fascinating history of about two centuries. The project focuses
on specific moment problems arising in shape and volume reconstruction from
distant measurements (for instance of electric or gravitational fields). An
important component of the project is the study of the best approximation and
the error bounds related to reconstruction algorithms.

The success of previous researches of the principal investigator on similar two
dimensional questions guarantee positive results in his attempt to expand his
horizon to three or more dimensions. He will collaborate with several experts in
pure and applied mathematics, as well as with graduate students and young
research assistants. Their combined efforts and results will be significant for
present studies in functional analysis, function theory and numerical
mathematics, as well as for some specific branches of applied mathematics and
engineering.
