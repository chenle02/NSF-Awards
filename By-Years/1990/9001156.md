Extensive evidence suggests that resource quantity and quality can have an
important influence on zooplankton community structure. Hypotheses developed in
this research describe how the resource base of the zooplankton is expected to
vary seasonally among systems with differing trophy and differing nitrogen and
phosphorus supply ratios. Predictions are made regarding the response of the
zooplankton community to these variations in resource base. The preliminary
results of experiments conducted this past summer are discussed as they pertain
to the proposed hypotheses. Further research is proposed that will allow
evaluation virtually all of the components of the resource base and of the
zooplankton community to enrichment at high and low TN:TP ratios.
