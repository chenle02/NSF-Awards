This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its
purpose the de-mystification of the subject of ionizing radiation by producing
small bottles of superheated material suspended in a gel which would allow
students from middle school to medical school to "see" radiation and to "test"
for it using everyday materials with natural radioactivity. These portable
bubble chambers can be put in a student's pocket. When radiation of sufficient
energy (an stopping power) interacts with atoms within the liquid drop, it will
suddenly vaporize, producing a clearly visible bubble and an easily audible
"pop." The rate of bubble formation indicates the radiation flux, and the total
bubble production is a measure of total radiation exposure. These kits can also
be used in educating the lay public on issues concerning nuclear power, nuclear
weapons, and nuclear safety.
