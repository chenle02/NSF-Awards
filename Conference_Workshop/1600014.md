This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Evolution
Equations on Singular Spaces," to be held at the Centre Internationale de
Recontres Mathematiques in Luminy, France from April 25 to 29, 2016.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
field of partial differential equations. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award
gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented
groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
