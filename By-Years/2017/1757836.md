The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site on Accessible Information
and Communication Technology (AICT) provides undergraduate participants with
research experiences on projects that enhance accessibility of information and
communication technologies, such as mobile phones or streaming videos for
consumers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind (DHHDB). The participants
will collaborate with DHHDB peers and mentors on a research project for 10
weeks. The diverse teams provide students with the experience and knowledge to
recognize the range and complexity of accessibility challenges in accessing
information and communication technology and to evaluate the efficacy of
proposed solutions in a unique research environment. DHHDB students are
extremely underrepresented in academics at the graduate level especially in
STEM. The AICT REU site creates a critically needed pipeline of these students
for graduate school and encourages them to participate in undergraduate and
graduate programs in accessible information and communications
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each research project addresses unsolved
accessibility challenges for deaf, hard of hearing or deaf-blind consumers in
using existing information and communication technology that undergraduate
researchers can easily understand, analyze and solve. The inclusion of
undergraduate and faculty researchers who have aural disabilities increases
accessibility and usability of information and communication technologies. The
interactive and personal nature of the research projects provides a link between
research and practice, and a diverse, inclusive and collaborative research
experience for the participants. They will learn to create and disseminate their
research outcomes through seminar training and participation in college and
institutional conferences. The AICT REU Site website
