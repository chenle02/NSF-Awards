This project is a multi-disciplinary workshop addressing the organizational and
emergency medical elements of urban heavy rescue (UHR) in the first 72 hours
following a moderate to major urban earthquake. It is being conducted jointly
between teams of experts from the United States and People's Republic of China
under the U. S./China Protocol. The intent of this workshop is to focus the
attention of experts from both countries on emergency medical and organizational
issues of mutual concern which are related to the effective conduct of UHR
operations. These discussions will take place over a period of five days in
China. The workshop will be followed by the publication of proceedings. xxx //
