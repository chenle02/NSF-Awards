There are many domes in the United States consisting of two layers of separated
cables as the structural system supporting the roof structure. When they were
constructed very little was known of the effect of wind and the vibrations
induced on the structural system. This project will investigate the conditions
for structural instability of the cable system when subjected to wind forces.
