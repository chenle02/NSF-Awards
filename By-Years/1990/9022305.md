The concept of Nash equilibrium has become central in economics. Researchers in
fields such as industrial organization, international economics, economics of
information, labor economics and bargaining theory have adopted it as the main
theoretical tool for the analysis of interactive strategic behavior. Yet the
assumption that agents will play according to Nash equilibrium is questionable
because it relies on strong assumptions regarding common knowledge and full
rationality of all agents. The goal of this research is to determine under what
conditions profit maximizing agents learn to play according to a strategic Nash
equilibrium and what are the possible patterns of the limit behaviors when they
do not converge to a Nash equilibrium. This is an important line of research
because the experimental literature has shown that agents in repeated
interactive situations do learn to play Nash equilibrium, but no theoretical
explanation for this phenomenon has yet been provided. The research in this
project concentrates on rational learning in long term interactions. By rational
learning it is meant that players choose actions that optimize their overall
payoffs, present and future, with learning being included as part of the overall
optimization problem. However, unlike classical game theory, rationality will
include no assumption about common knowledge of parameters of the game or
strategies of the opponents. The project extends a pathbreaking proof by the
investigators that rational learning in two-person games leads to Nash
equilibrium if there is a "grain of truth" in the beliefs of the players about
each other's likely strategies. These results are extended to games with many
players, games with imperfect observability, and to stochastically changing
environments. The results will also be studied when players are not completely
rational but use finite automata.
