This project will investigate stability and equilibria in plasma with
collisions, instabilities and scattering properties of bound states of scalar
wave equations, scattering frequencies of time periodic systems, and regularity
of linear and nonlinear dispersive waves. The fundamental mathematical problems
focus on global existence for certain initial value problems. These studies in
linear and nonlinear waves find applications in fields such as astrophysics and
thermonuclear fusion.
