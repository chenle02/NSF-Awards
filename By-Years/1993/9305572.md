This proposal addresses the problem of determining the hydrochemical response
of a groundwater-fed lake to climate change over Holocene time. We intend to
determine the relative importance of ground water and surface water input to Elk
Lake, Grant Co., Minnesota. We will examine and compare information obtained
from ostracode (Crustacea) species distributions, ostracode shell chemistry, and
models that describe hydrochemical reactions and groundwater flow. The proposed
research will provide an independent means of determining how a lake interacted
with groundwater during specific times of past climate change, as well as
insight into how lake-groundwater systems can react to future climate change.
Our approach will be 1) define the ground water source(s) flowing into Elk Lake
at present; 2) recover a complete Holocene core from the lake; 3) reconstruct
the solute history using ostracode species distributions, trace-elements, and
stable isotope analyses; and 4) test two hypotheses concerning the groundwater
input and resultant lake chemistry through Holocene time. This study will
provide a new way of reconstructing regional changes in surface hydrology as it
responds to climate change and has wide application to the field of hydrology
and climatology. The results should be of practical value to hydrologists
concerned with surface water-groundwater interactions, and to climatologists
interested in climate model validation and forecasting of climate- induced
hydrologic changes.
