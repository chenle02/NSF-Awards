The inaugural Youth Bioinformatics Symposium willbe held in the greater
Washington, D.C. in June 2016. This novel workshop run by the International
Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), is focused on introducing secondary
school (8-11th grade) students to computational biology and bioinformatics.
Questionnaire will be distributed to gauge the level of interest in
bioinformatics and database searches before and after the symposium, and the
experiences of the organizers will be summarized in an SOP that will be provided
to the future organizers and volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
symposium will be opened by keynote speaker, former president of ISCB. There
will be three workshops: on biomedical data mining, on protein 3-D modeling, and
a mini-science fair activity. Sequence database searches using the BLAST suite
of programs are now part of AP Biology curriculum, and students will get a
hands-on introduction into the field.
