ABSTRACT CTS-9703357 This is an investigation of non-agglomerated nanoparticle
productiol in low-pressure flat flames. Production in low-pressure flames of a
target group of materials including yttrium-stabilized zirconia, silicon
oxynitride, alumina, zirconia, titania, and tungsten oxide, is demonstrated.
Parametric studies assess the effects of process conditions on the size,
quantity, and morphology of the synthesized nanopowders. Modeling and diagnostic
work centers on a single nanopowder species with the goal of predicting particle
sized, production rate, and degree of agglomeration given system process inputs.
A gas-phase chemical mechanism is included in the model along with mechanisms
for particles formation and growth. Multispecies laser-induced fluorescence is
applied to the flames to quantify the gas-phase chemical environment, while
laser absorption scattering measurements are probe sampling are used to quantify
the particle size- and number-density fields. Several baseline production
conditions are characterized and modeled and the model is refined to match the
experimental observations, Analogous models are then produced for different
powder species. This work demonstrates a technique for high-rate, inherently
scalable production of a series of industrially significant non-agglomerated
nanopowders. Process models for nanopowder production and developed. Such models
extend present understanding of gas-phase particle synthesis and allow
computational optimization mf the synthesis process. For scale-up operations,
the models help in identifying appropriate process diagnostics for industrial
reactors and enable development of closed-loop control algorithms.
