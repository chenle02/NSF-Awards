This three-year project will continue documentation and description of the
Arawan, Muran, and Chapakuran families, spoken in the states of Amazonas and
Rondonia in Western Brazil. This effort wi11 result in full grammars
(dictionaries, phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax) of Suruwaha (the
only Arawan language yet undescribed; spoken by 100-200 people in the state of
Amazonas, Brazil); 'Oro Win (a dying Chapakuran language spoken by only five
people (all over forty years of age) in Western Rondonia); and Piraha (spoken by
approximately 200 people in Amazonas). This study will also include the first
systematic linguistic survey of Mura, a language closely related to Piraha, to
verify whether or not anyone still speaks this language, previously documented
only by word lists collected by explorers in the 19th and early 20th century.
The project will result in several theoretically and typologically oriented
articles on aspects of the phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax, and semantics of
these languages - all three of these families are known for their unusual
typological characteristics (phonological and morphosyntactic, described in the
project description). The research is significant because it provides a basis
for future theoretical, typological, and historical-comparative studies of these
otherwise nearly unknown families and because it directly tests several
hypotheses relevant to current phonological and syntactic theory.
