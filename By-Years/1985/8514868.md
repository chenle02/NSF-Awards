This action is to upgrade research equipment for investigating water wave
phenomena, in particular, seismic sea waves (tsunamis). The equipment is used by
the PI in his study of the generation, propagation, and coastal effects of
tsunamis. Being a general facility, it is also available for related wave
studies. This upgrade is needed for experiments to advance the understanding of
seismic sea waves.
