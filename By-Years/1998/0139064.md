This project focuses on the spectroscopy and dynamics of size-selected group IV
and III-V semiconductor clusters using several experimental techniques based on
negative ion photodetachment to characterize how the properties of these species
vary with size and stoichiometry. The corresponding bulk compounds play a key
role in the semiconductor and electronics industries so these studies are highly
relevant to nano-device technologies in that they probe how the properties of
the bulk materials evolve from their atomic and molecular constituents. The
project will focus on binary III-V nitride compounds, silicon clusters, and
indium phosphide clusters. Properties of interest include vibrational
frequencies and electronic state splittings in small clusters, the evolution of
valence and conduction bands as the cluster size increases, electronic
relaxation dynamics in excited states of the clusters, and the fragmentation
patterns resulting from photodissociation. In all the experiments, mass-selected
beams of semiconductor cluster anions are generated and photodetached. The
primary experimental method is fixed-frequency anion photoelectron spectroscopy,
which provides a general means to determine the electronic and vibrational
structure of a size-selected neutral cluster. This technique will be
complemented by tunable laser photodetachment, time-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy, and fast beam photofragment translational spectroscopy
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how physical and chemical
properties of matter evolve with size is crucial to many potential applications
designed to meet significant societal needs. Emphasis is placed on select
elemental clusters, for which the corresponding bulk compounds play a major role
in the fabrication of fast devices such as transistors and photodiodes. The
proposed studies are important because they provide training for future
scientists and engineers in key areas of national
interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
