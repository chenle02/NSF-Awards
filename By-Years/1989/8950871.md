A new transmission electron microscope will replace the obsolete one presently
available. A modern T.E.M. with reliability, versatility, and ease of use will
be used to teach students this valuable technique with applications in all
fields of biology. In addition, students will be introduced to methods of
specimen preparation by rapid freezing techniques. Students will be introduced
to the theory and mechanics of modern electron microscopy through a
lecture/demonstration course in microscopic technique, a project-oriented hands-
on course, and independent research projects undertaken in consultation with
faculty members. The school will provide 50% matching funds.
