This award will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the Sixteenth
Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2015).
HotMobile, sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, will be held in February, 2015 in Santa
Fe, New Mexico. HotMobile 2015 is an important workshop targeting mobile
computing and system integration fields and attending this event will benefit
the scientific progress of the student's research. The exposure to the technical
content of HotMobile 2015 will inspire students to address the tough problems in
their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in
these types of networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Priority will be given to
students who will benefit from attending this workshop, but are unlikely to
attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In addition, applications
from female and underrepresented groups in networking research will be strongly
encouraged. Up to fourteen students will receive travel grants from this award
to attend HotMobile 2015.
