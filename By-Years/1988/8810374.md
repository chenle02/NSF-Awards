The PI wishes to study the specific heat of thin films of superconducting and
magnetic materials between 50 and 700K. In particular, he wishes to examine the
new oxide superconductor, YBa2 Cu30x and its related compounds, in this
temperature range for the purpose of studying both the superconducting
transition near 95K and the resistive anomalies frequently observed at higher
temperatures. He wishes to study the amorphous rare earth-transition metal
alloys at temperatures between room temperature and 700K to look for signs of
polymorphism in the amorphous phase as potentially manifested by different paths
to crystallinity as well as to examine their specific heat through the Curie
point. Finally, he wishes to study the formation of the amorphous phase at the
interface between certain crystalline materials.
