In order to teach scientific principles and methods to non-science oriented
majors in an applied area, the project would establish an interdisciplinary
course in Psychology and Legal Issues, using a microcomputer laboratory. There
has been an increasing use of social scientific reasoning and methodology for
understanding legal issues. Many pre-law students receive little if any
instruction in the scientific method or any experience conducting research and
handling research data, experiences which would ultimately enhance their
proficiency as future lawyers. A microcomputer laboratory component containing
20 Apple IIc Micro-systems will be used in a Psychology and Legal Issues course
jointly taught by faculty in the Psychology and Political Science Departments
and the School of Law. It will provide an interactive and experiential
capability for teaching scientific methods and principles to non-science majors.
In addition the microcomputer laboratory will enhance the curricula of both the
Psychology and Political Science Departments by being available for use in
existing experimental and statistical courses.
