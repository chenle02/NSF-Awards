Geometry and measurement are closely related topics that are, in current
elementary school curricula, usually taught in separate chapters. In reality,
however, many measurements involve geometric entities. Similarly, many of the
properties of geometric figures are derived through work with measurement. Thus
it is reasonable that the geometry and measurement strands be considered
together. This project will revise both strands, exploiting the natural
connections between geometry and measurement to their mutual advantage. The
revisions will be based on theory, the results of previous research, and expert
opinion as presented in the literature. The theories of the van Hieles will be a
major basis for the revision of the geometry strand. The theory of Piaget will
likewise form a basis for revision of the measurement strand. Fourteen prototype
units, seven in geometry and seven in measurement, will be developed.
Calculators and computers will be used whenever appropriate: in problem
situations, in demonstrations, in open investigations, in development and
exploration of patterns, and (sometimes) in performing calculations. The goal is
to move mathematics curricula from static and rote presentations toward dynamic
and meaningful investigations.
