A fundamental and central question in mathematics, going back to antiquity,
concerns understanding integer solutions to polynomial equations. This question
has been a source of inspiration in modern mathematics, as the techniques used
to study this question have helped shape the foundation of several areas such as
number theory, algebra, and analysis. This work will bring new perspectives to
the field by studying various families of polynomial equations and by finding
innovative applications in the rich area of number theory. The project will also
enhance the training of graduate students and support mentoring activities and
research opportunities for undergraduate students.

The principal investigator aims to utilize tools from classical Diophantine
analysis and modern applications of analytic number theory and arithmetic
geometry to study basic arithmetic structures. This work will combine ideas from
the geometry of numbers with both algebraic and analytic tools to study problems
such as representation of integers by binary forms and orders in number fields,
as well as various problems about heights in number fields.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
