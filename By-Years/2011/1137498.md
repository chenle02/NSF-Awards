The Fisk University Planning Grant will identify sustainable best-practices to
increase student retention, learning success and career interest in STEM at the
institution. The specific efforts to achieve this includes undertaking a self-
study of it STEM undergraduate programs and research infrastructure using a
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, studying
national models for undergraduate research, utilizing evidence-based results to
develop and institutional plan. A STEM Knowledge Map will be developed to
digital capture the content and objectives of all of the STEM courses and depict
the relationships to each other. This tool will help in determining what
alignments and modifications will be needed in the STEM programs following the
self-study. The planning process will include a synthesis of current knowledge
about virtual mentoring and plans will include creation of a virtual mentoring
community for FISK STEM students. This self evaluation approach can serve as a
model for similar other institutions to utilize in gaining understanding of
their STEM programs strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities and how to
integrate undergraduate research experiences throughout the curriculum..
