This award supports a Doctoral Consortium to be held in conjunction with the
2009 Conference on Communities and Technologies, June 24-27, 2009. The
Communities and Technologies (C&amp;T) conference addresses communities as
social entities comprised of actors who share something in common. Further,
C&amp;T addresses the ways that computing and communication technologies
influence, enable or hinder, communities and the actions that they take. The
Doctoral Consortium focuses on the intellectual contributions of the diverse set
of doctoral students who are competitively selected to attend. The Doctoral
Consortium will help build a future set of community informatics researchers by
providing an intellectually intense pre-conference event that attracts and
energizes a key set of faculty advisors and doctoral candidates. The Doctoral
Consortium will build on the diversity of community informatics researchers and
help establish their connection to the broader computing research community.
Developing this diversity is valuable for the NSF and for the vitality of the
CISE/IIS research community.
