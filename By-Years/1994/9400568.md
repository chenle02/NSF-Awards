Revision Problems: A Tool for Programming Knowledge Base Transformations This is
the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. This research project
is to develop a new logic-based approach to handle the effects of change in
knowledge bases. It is domain independent, so it could be an important tool for
people working in logic-based knowledge representations. It addresses important
questions that any knowledge representation must address analogously. The system
of revision programs significantly extends logic programming with stable model
semantics. Revision programs are treated as input/output devices (drawing from
the experience of DATALOG). As such, revision programs allow relation of
(unknown) causes to (observable) effects. Consequently, they can be used to
study abductive reasoning. The research program is to introduce and study the
formalism of revision programming and to investigate its applications in belief
revision and abduction.
