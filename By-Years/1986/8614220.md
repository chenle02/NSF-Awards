Rapid growth interest in use of high strength concrete (compressive strength to
about 12,000 psi) has caused concern that current design methods and codified
procedures for design may not be appropriate. Many design equations found in the
1983 Building Code of the American Concrete Institute, governing most US
practice, are based on tests of members using concrete strength not greater than
6000 psi. A nine-year program of research on high strength concrete at Cornell
had three objectives: (a) to provide an understanding of the basic differences
in behavior of the material, (b) to establish the engineering properties of the
material, and (c) to study the behavior of reinforced concrete members made
using the material. One of the more significant observations is that the creep
coefficient for high strength concrete. Present Code procedures for design do
not account for this. The point is of particular importance, because short- and
long-term deflections may prove to be a governing aspect of design for slender
members made using the material. This project is for further testing of beams
under sustained loading, to study immediate and time-dependent deflections,
crack growth, and internal force redistributions. Important variables include
time, compressive strength, age at first loading, and the amount of tensile and
compressive reinforcing steel. Results of the proposed research should help
improve the implementation and increased use of high strength concrete in
structures such as buildings and bridges.
