Topology PI: Zomorodian, Afra Institution: Dartmouth College

ABSTRACT Data is often in the form of a set of points, sampled from some
underlying original space. For example, a computer representation of a three-
dimensional object is usually constructed from a set of points sampled from its
surface using a 3D laser scanner. Another example is the set of snapshots from
the simulated trajectory of a folding protein, a four-dimensional point set.
Given any set of points, topological analysis tries to recover how the original
space was connected. As such, topological analysis is a significant first step
in understanding data, discovering its global structure. Due to its fundamental
nature, topological analysis has applications in diverse disciplines, such as
shape description, terrain analysis, sensor networks, and dynamical systems.

This research focuses on the theoretical and algorithmic development of
persistence theories. Intuitively, persistence is the technique of identifying
features by analyzing geometric histories of data. The key notion is that
features persist through history while noise is short-lived. Currently, there
exists a persistence theory only for one class of data: the theory of persistent
homology for static point cloud data. This aim of this research is to develop
persistence theories for other major classes of data that arise in the practice
of computational topology, such as parameterized data, dynamic data, and data in
diagrams.
