w:\awards\awards96\career\0formca.doc 9625111 Radzihovsky This is a CAREER
grant to a young faculty member which combines research and education. The
theoretical project will address two major problems in the phenomenology of high
temperature superconductors: (i) the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties
of the vortex liquid, with the goals of the derivation of the currently assumed
hydrodynamic description, and elucidation of the vortex states, instabilities
and dissipation in the presence of currents parallel to the applied magnetic
field; (ii) the freezing transition of the vortex liquid into a solid phase,
which will consist of the development of a new mean-field description that
explicitly shows the energetic tendency of the vortices to order into a lattice
and which is generalizable to including the effects of fluctuations. These
research efforts will be complemented by the educational component through new
course development, and incorporation of students at all levels into research.
%%% This is a CAREER grant t a young faculty member for a program which combines
research and education. The theoretical research will focus on the properties of
unique states of matter which occur in the high temperature superconductors. The
educational component will focus on course development and integration of
students at all levels into the research program.
