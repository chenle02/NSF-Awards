The purpose of this project is to encourage, stimulate and expand the research
programs of a group of geometric topologists in the Rocky Mountain region. This
group consists of active topologists employed at colleges and universities with
limited research support in terms of funding, library resources, or faculty with
related research interests. For the past four years, this group has held a small
workshop each spring or summer. Last year, John Walsh was brought in with NSF
support to give two lectures on applications of sheaf theory to geometric
topology. There will be a four-day workshop in June of 1987. Bob Edwards of
U.C.L.A. will give two lectures in a setting that will encourage informal
discussion and one-to-one dialogue. In addition, the other participants will
continue work and discussions begun at previous meetings. The Mathematics
Department at Oregon State University has agreed to provide an honorarium for
the principal speaker and to provide for local transportation. The N.S.F. will
cover travel and subsistence costs for the participants.
