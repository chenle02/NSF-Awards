This exploratory research examines economic incentives for alternative racial
identity norms among Hispanic Americans, with a special focus on persons of
Mexican descent. The theoretical model has two pure norms: an acculturationist
norm and a racial identity norm. If an acculturationist norm prevails Hispanics
will acculturate into American society as Non-Hispanic whites and will not face
persistent racial discrimination in the labor market. If a racial identity norm
prevails Hispanic will develop a unique race identity, i.e., neither black nor
white, and face persistent racial discrimination in the labor market. Empirical
evaluation suggests that an acculturationist norm will likely prevail among
Mexican and Cuban Americans. Accordingly, Hispanic Americans, especially persons
of Mexican and Cuban descent but less so Puerto Ricans, are able to increase
income annual income and hourly wages by abandoning a unique Hispanic racial
identity and acculturating into a Non-Hispanic white racial identity. However,
neither the abandonment of Spanish nor the abandonment of a specifically
Hispanic racial self-identity is sufficient to overcome the penalties associated
with having a dark complexion and Non-European phenotype. This is a unique
study. Many economic studies have examined the impact on race on economic
outcomes but no previous study has examined the formation of racial identity as
an economic variable, i.e., to explore the thesis that racial identity is
endogenous.
