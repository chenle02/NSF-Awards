One of the major problems in computer understanding of natural language is the
ever present ambiguity. Words have multiple meanings, sentences can be
grammatically parsed several different ways, noun phrases can refer to several
possible objects in the text, etc. Typically it is not possible to make the
correct choice because the others are logically impossible. Rather the correct
choice is simply more plausible, or probable, than the others. This investigator
will integrate the use of probability theory into language comprehension in
order to better solve these and related problems (like plan recognition deciding
on a story character's plans on the basis of the character's actions). In
particular, the proposed system will use the various clues from the sentence as
well as the context, to build up a Bayes network representation of the
probability distribution. As in current work by this research the probabilities
will be used to guide processing and eventually to completely clip less likely
alternatives.
