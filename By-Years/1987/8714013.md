This doctoral dissertation project will support research on interactive,
microcomputer-based processes for locational decisionmaking. The purpose of the
project is to construct an interactive preference elicitation module for
selecting a location, integrate the module into a decision support system, and
field-test the module in the context of an ongoing study of settlement re-
organization alternatives in pastoral Australia. Efficient settlement
distribution is an essential prerequisite to the effective provision of services
in remote areas. This project will increase our understanding of settlement
distribution by showing how the interactive elicitation and analysis of
preferences can be integrated to generate good alternatives and how locational
analysts can design and use a geographic Decision Support System to provide
better analytical support for combinatorial location selection problems. It will
also contribute to our understanding of how locational decisions are made by
revealing how inconsistencies in decisionmakers' preferences are resolved.
Finally, it will add to our knowledge of the process of settlement
reorganization in sparsely populated areas of developed economies undergoing
marked demographic and economic change.
