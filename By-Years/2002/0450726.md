The University of Colorado at Boulder has been awarded a grant to support
student participation in the 2004 Taxonomic Databases Working Group annual
meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand, Oct 10-17, 2004. There is a potential for
intellectual growth for the individual student participants as well as securing
continued intellectual growth in the field by bringing the next generation of
biodiversity informaticians into the community. Students from a diverse group of
students, both male and female, and from different cultural and ethnic
backgrounds will participate. Because training occurs during all phases of
student development, and professional meetings early in careers can help shape
later choices, there will be a wide range of expertise represented in the
students chosen, including undergraduate, Masters, PhD and post-doctoral
students. A national competition for open slots will provide an opportunity for
deserving students, who couldn't otherwise afford to attend TDWG, a chance to
participate.
