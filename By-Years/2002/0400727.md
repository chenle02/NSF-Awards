Abstract for the award of Kiran Kedlaya
DMS-0400272&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;p-adic
analysis, initiated by Hensel at the turn of the last century,&lt;br/&gt;seeks
to bring the "continuous" techniques of calculus to bear on&lt;br/&gt;"discrete"
problems in number theory. We study applications of p-adic&lt;br/&gt;analysis in
arithmetic algebraic geometry; a typical problem is to count&lt;br/&gt;solutions
of systems of polynomial equations. We work on one hand on&lt;br/&gt;improving
our theoretical understanding of this problem, and on the other&lt;br/&gt;hand
on developing practical algorithms for treating important
special&lt;br/&gt;cases. Some of these cases occur in applications to
cryptography, error&lt;br/&gt;correcting codes, and other areas of computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, we are developing Berthelot's
rigid cohomology in &lt;br/&gt;parallel with the older theory of etale
cohomology, which is better &lt;br/&gt;understood theoretically but ill-equipped
for explicit computations.&lt;br/&gt;One long-term goal is to extend Lafforgue's
work on the function field &lt;br/&gt;Langlands correspondence to p-adic sheaves
(crystals). In another &lt;br/&gt;direction, we are investigating algorithms for
computing in p-adic &lt;br/&gt;cohomology, which may have mathematical
applications on top of &lt;br/&gt;the practical ones mentioned above.&lt;br/&gt;
