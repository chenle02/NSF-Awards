The year 2008 marks the 60th birthday of Professor Alan Plumb of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. To celebrate this occasion his colleagues
are organizing a symposium and will be publishing a symposium "Festschrift"
volume. The symposium will be held at Columbia University in New York City, on
Friday and Saturday, October 24-25, 2008. It will run a day and a half, and
consist of a dozen invited talks; an international roster of speakers has been
invited to give presentations. The symposium will cover the current state of
knowledge on the stratosphere, and will include presentations on dynamics,
transport and chemistry. A book will be published as an American Geophysical
Union Monograph in the fall of 2009 summarizing the review talks given at the
symposium.

This grant will support the travel and participation of graduate students to
attend the symposium. Special efforts have been made to host students from
underrepresented populations, and to encourage women participation at the
symposium. Invitations have been broadcasted to the entire atmospheric science
community via email lists from the American Meteorological Society and American
Geophysical Union.
