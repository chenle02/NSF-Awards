This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
research on metal-catalyzed chemical reactions which involve transient
intermediates known as carbenoids. Prof. Doyle's work is aimed at developing new
reagents and catalysts which can significantly enhance selectivity in such
processes.Since carbenoids are a widely occurring family of reaction
intermediates which can be used for constructing a variety of organic chemical
types, most notably strained three-membered rings, this work has important
applications to chemical synthesis. In this project several approaches are taken
to enhance selectivity in catalyzed carbenoid reactions, including synthesis of
diazocarbonyl reagents with restricted access to the diazo functionality, the
design of new and effective catalysts for selective carbenoid transformations,
and substrate constructions that are formulated to provide control over
competing reaction pathways.
