With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Martin Minelli from Grinnell College and colleagues Charles Cunningham, T.
Andrew Mobley and Stephen Sieck will acquire a benchtop X-ray diffractometer.
The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all
levels, especially structure studies in areas such as (a) molybdenum
coordination complexes, (b) bimetallic organometallic compounds, (c) organic
nitrogen (nitrone) compounds, and (d) intermetallic
compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic
chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research in the chemistry and physics
departments.
