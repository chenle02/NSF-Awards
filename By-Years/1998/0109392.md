This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new type of residual gas analyzer based on a novel ion-trapping concept. The new
instrument will have significant cost and size advantages over current
commercially available residual gas analyzer (RGA) systems. If the concept is
successful, it has the potential to provide performance capabilities exceeding
current RGA technology. The new trap also has potential application as a general
purpose ion source for precision mass spectrometry. Phase I will: (1) design and
construct a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate the novel ion trap as
an ion source for a compact RGA; (2) conduct experiments to characterize the
performance of the new instrument; and (3) evaluate possible extensions of the
instrument and develop the conceptual design for a Phase II laboratory
demonstration instrument.

These new RGA instruments are expected to reduce capital and manufacturing costs
in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, vacuum coating, electro-
optics, chemical processing, and environmental monitoring. It will also make
RGAs more available to new users in industry and university research
laboratories, who presently cannot afford such instruments.
