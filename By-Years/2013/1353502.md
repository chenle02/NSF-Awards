This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at
developing commercial redistricting software products that can be used by non-
experts. Redistricting or rezoning is the process of dividing space into
districts or zones while optimizing a set of criteria under various spatial
constraints. It is an extremely challenging task that is commonly needed in many
real-world problems, such as political and school redistricting, emergency zone
design, package delivery, and business planning. The company's proposed products
will provide flexible and easy-to-use software tools to meet the needs of
several specific niche markets that no existing tools can effectively serve. The
objective is to expand the user group well beyond technical experts to the
average government or business professional, and even to the general public,
thereby democratizing the redistricting process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of this project is its potential to fundamentally change the way
redistricting is performed in practice. With existing commercial tools,
completing a redistricting task usually requires one or more full-time
technicians working for days or months at a time. With the product being created
under this project, even a non-technical user may generate a professional plan
within minutes. Potential clients include governments (cities and counties),
school districts, consulting firms who provide redistricting services, private
businesses that need to optimize service delivery, and even general citizens who
are interested in participating in redistricting decision making. The product
targets the U.S. and international market, including both public and private
sectors.
