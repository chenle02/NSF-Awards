This project is concerned with two interdependent problems in discourse
processing. The first is to develop an explicit dclarative representation of
referring relations to be used in the generation and understanding of discourse
anaphors. The goal is to account for the mutually constraining effects of
linguistic form and the dynamically updated discourse mode. The second is to
determine how to identify the distinct discourseactions that comprise a
discourse, and how to relate these actions in a dynamically constructed
hierarchical model of intentional structure.
