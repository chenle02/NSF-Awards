The Mechanisms for Interior Dissipation of the Oceanic General
Circulation&lt;br/&gt;M. Jeroen Molemaker and James
McWilliams&lt;br/&gt;UCLA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the
fundamental question of how dissipation is accomplished for the large-scale
circulation while in equilibrium. The hypothesis to be addressed is that a
crucial step en route to dissipation is that instabilities of mesoscale
structures arise due to unbalanced motions. Computation models based on
different dynamical approximations will be used to help distinguish and
determine the different mechanisms of forward energy cascades. Several different
mesoscale circulation regimes will be examined to determine where energy
transfer exchange with the sub-mesoscale unbalanced motions is likely to occur;
these regimes will include the following: an inflowing jet, boundary upwelling,
and homogeneous turbulence. The standard for dynamical behavior will be the non-
hydrostatic Boussinesq equations. New methods will be devised to partition the
flow and its dissipation routes into balanced and unbalanced parts in order to
say when the interior dissipation is likely to be enhanced over the expectation
of geostrophic turbulence. The broader goal will be to determine how the
vertical and horizontal eddy viscosities in GCMs should depend upon the large-
and mesoscale properties of the resolved circulation and
stratification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
