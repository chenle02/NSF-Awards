The goal of this proposal is a fundamental redesign of wireless networks to
systematically exploit interference to increase network capacity. Traditionally
interference is considered harmful, hence current designs strive to avoid
interference by scheduling concurrent transmissions in separate frequencies/time
slots. Hence the only way to add more capacity is to add more spectrum. However
spectrum that can be used for building wireless networks has mostly been
allocated and is in use, thus imposing hard limit on the scalability of the
current network design. This proposal makes a fundamental shift: instead of
avoiding interference, it designs techniques that systematically encourage and
exploit interference to increase network capacity. The key insight is that
interference is not random noise, but has structure since it is a synthetic
signal created by another transmitter. If transmitters and receivers are aware
of the interference structure, they can exploit it to actively shape/code
interference and better decode their own transmissions to cancel interference,
and thus greatly increase capacity. The proposed research will produce
techniques that can each have substantial impact of the design of wireless
networks. This project will design single channel full duplex radios, a
technical feat that has hitherto been considered impossible. Second, this
research will produce rateless codes that can decode constituent packets from
collisions, obviating the need for complex scheduling primitives and thus
simplify PHY/MAC design. Finally, it will produce smart radios that can
adaptively operate in dense radio neighborhoods and maximize throughput, and
thus coexist in environments with a variety of interfering radios.
