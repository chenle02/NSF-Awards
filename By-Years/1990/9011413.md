The goal of this research is to study coherent structures in geophysical flow
by determining equilibrium solutions of the quasigeostrophic vorticity equation.
The system of equations is solved numerically using the Newton-Kantorovich
algorithm and the stability properties of the solutions analyzed using both time
integration studies and a dynamical systems approach. The results of this work
will be applied to the phenomenon of atmospheric blocking, that is, the
situation in which the planetary scale waves of the atmosphere maintain a stable
configuration which causes weather patterns to persist for weeks at a time.
Modeling of the blocking process will examine the generation, maintenance, and
decay of the blocks. This research has obvious implications for improving medium
range weather forecasting. The PI is well qualified for this project. She is an
