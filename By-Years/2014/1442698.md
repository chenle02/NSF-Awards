The proposed project will support student participation in the 2014 Graphene
Conference, which will be held at the Centre de Congres Pierre Baudis in
Toulouse, France from May 6-9, 2014. The conference will address graphene and
other 2D materials beyond graphene. There will be sessions covering fundamentals
and applications of these materials and participants will represent both the US
and European, Asian academia and industry. Participation is expected from around
the world, with an anticipated attendance of about 1000. The Conference will
address fundamentals of Graphene, other 2D Materials, worldwide Graphene
initiatives, theory and simulations, Material Genome Initiative (MGI) approaches
to Graphene and 2D materials, manufacturing, workforce development and
education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will address educational aspects
such as curriculum development, web-based learning, exchanges and summer
schools. There will be considerations made for exchange programs in research and
education, women in science, coordination of future summer schools, and
definition of ways to educate the international community on grapheme and 2D
materials. This should contribute to a broader use of Graphene and 2D materials
in various applications, such as communications, sensing and health.
