One of the most significant developments in the last decade in Theoretical
Physics is string theory which is currently the only promising candidate for the
final theory of all fundamental forces in the universe. In history the
interactions of mathematics and theoretical physics have motivated many exciting
developments in both disciplines, the many exciting examples include Einsten's
general relativity and Riemannian geometry, positive mass conjecture and the
understanding of manifolds with positive scalar curvature, Yang-Mills theory,
Seiberg-Witten theory and four dimensional geometry and topology, Chern-Simons
string duality and mirror formula, the Marino-Vafa formula, renormalization
group flow in quantum field theory and Perelman's breakthrough in Ricci flow and
Poincare conjecture. Physicists made many exciting challenging mathematical
conjectures based on physical theories, which stimulate many revolutionary
developments in mathematics, in particular in geometry, topology and algebraic
geometry. On the other hand the mathematical proofs of these conjectures provide
the most convincing evidences for their theories, and the mathematical
techniques and theories developed in geometry and topology have also played
fundamental roles in theoretical physics. These have been the most fruitful
interactions in the history of sciences.

This is a proposal to seek funding from the National Science Foundation to
provide travel support for young mathematicians from the U.S. to attend the
Strings 2006 conference to be held in Beijing, China on June 19th to 24th
2006.The ``Strings'' conferences are the premiere international meetings in the
field of String Theory and are held annually to bring together the world's
leading researchers to present and discuss the latest developments of string
theory. There have been many activities in geometry, topology, number theory,
statistics and applied mathematics in China. The workshops before and after
conferences will feature some of the more mathematical aspects of String Theory.
These workshops will serve as a venue for international experts to interact with
young mathematicians from US and around the world and for their institutes to
foster long-term collaborative strategy. As China is increasingly aware of the
importance of fundamental researches and increases its funding accordingly, the
global science community is going to experience a surge of scientific activities
in the country. We are eagerly looking forward to closer collaboration with the
international community.
