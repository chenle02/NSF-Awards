Growth and development in plants is a complex process wherein environmental and
physical factors interact substantially with the genotype to determine the
actual form of a plant in a particular environment. Apical dominance
(correlative inhibition and control of lateral branching) is a hormonally
regulated process whereby a growing shoot apical meristem controls the
development and growth of axillary buds, and thus has a major impact on the
shape a plant attains. The research proposed herein utilizes modern genetic
methods to identify, characterize and clone genes which are responsible for the
phenotypic expression of decreased apical dominance (increased branching) in
Petunia hybrida. A study of the genes which control apical dominance will
provide insight into the mechanisms underlying correlative inhibition. The
knowledge provided by this research will further the understanding of the
molecular and physiological processes controlled by these genes. In the long
term the intent is to use this knowledge and genetic materials to investigate
the biochemistry and physiology of correlative inhibition.
