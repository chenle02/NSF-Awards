0427577&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides support for the an integrated effort to
investigate environmental factors and behavior important to the life cycle of
beaked whales, especially Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon sp., species that
have shown indications of special sensitivity to anthropogenic sound. Research
techniques will include field efforts to record vocalizations together with
environmental parameters, and thus provide direct information on depth and
manner of feeding, physiological parameters such as heart rate and vocalization,
and behavior when diving and at surface. In the second year, the field effort
will include controlled exposure experiments, using sonars to address
responsiveness of the animals to sound in different frequency ranges and
amplitudes. It is anticipated that these data will lead to a better
understanding of possible causes of mass strandings of beaked whales that have
been associated with anthropogenic sound, especially military sonars, in the
vicinity of oceanic islands.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
