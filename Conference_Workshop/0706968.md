Abstract

Award: DMS-0706968 Principal Investigator: Jeff Cheeger, Shmuel Weinberger

This conference will explore differing approaches to non-smooth spaces that
arise in modern geometry and topology with an eye towards cross-fertilization
among the various groups of researchers. Two of the central thrusts are
topological methods based on the ideas of a stratification, and metric measure
spaces, and their analysis, especially their differential calculus. Others are
based on cohomology with growth conditions, or resolution of singularities,
intersection homology, sheaf theory etc. Moreover the applications of these
studies are diverse, from the Novikov conjecture, knot theory, and
transformation groups to Gromov-Hasudorff convergence techniques in Riemannian
geometry and geometric group theory to problems of interest to theoretical
computer scientists (embedding finite metric spaces in various Banach spaces).
It is anticipated that as a result of this meeting, progress can be expected in
the directions of producing analytic geometric structures on singular spaces,
the quasi-isometric theory of groups, and characteristic classes.

Many of the basic ideas of analysis and geometry are based on the idea of linear
approximation. The first example of this is calculus itself where linear
approximation defines the basic notion of the derivative. A more modern example
is the idea of a manifold in topology, which is a space that is, in small
regions, well approximated by Euclidean space. Countless further developments
have shown the need for more general tools to deal with situations where such
approximations are not feasible or may not exist. By bringing together workers
who have dealt with these issues in varied contexts, this conference will spur
the development of new syntheses and bring to the fore common issues that arise
in completely different settings. The conference web site is
