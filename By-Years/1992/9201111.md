A cooperative, international investigation of the lichens (both micro-and
macrolichens) of the greater Sonoran Desert region (Arizona, southern
California, Baja California, Sonora and Northern Sinaloa) is proposed. The
lichen taxa will be revised with near monographic precision for the purpose of
writing a modern Flora (for systematists and other professional botanists - with
both English and Spanish editions) and popular manual (for naturalists and
conservationists). Because the Sonoran Desert includes a significant number of
Class I areas (Clean Air Act) and because lichens are excellent indicators of
air pollution, it is anticipated that the flora will have considerable utility
to land managers in both the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Services
(both U.S. and Mexican). Liason is established with four institutions within
Mexico and collaboration and with over 40 prominent lichen systematists
worldwide. A second purpose of the proposal is to improve the scientific
infrastructure of Mexico so that lichenological studies dealing with lichen
biodiversity and conservation issues (e.g. preservation of coastal fog zone
communities) can be pursued there.
