The aim of this research program is to understand the runup of a tsunami on to a
shoreline. When a tsunami (a long wavelength sea wave generated by an
earthquake) encounters a coastline, severe damage may result due to flooding, to
the flotation of large objects, and to the impact of the wave or floating
objects with constructed facilities. The parameter that is important in
evaluating the potential damage to a coastline is the wave runup. Very little
useful scientific or engineering information exists on the runup of tsunamis.
The objective of this study is to investigate some aspects of this complex
phenomenon, beginning with the study of the runup of a cnoidal wave, which is
one quintessential model for tsunamis. This investigation involves analytical
modeling combined with laboratory experiments in a new 100 foot long wave tank.
By comparing the results from these two approaches with results from numerical
simulations of the Boussinesq equations, an attempt is made to determine the
relative effects of dispersion, nonlinearity, and possibly dissipation, leading
to more concise information on the validity of different models. This is
followed by a preliminary laboratory investigation to determine the forces
associated with cnoidal wave motion on simple structures, such as cylinders and
plane surfaces, close to the shoreline. Potential applications of these
fundamental studies to tsunami engineering are in the calibration of numerical
models which are frequently used in evaluating the flooding of coastline areas
prone to tsunami damage, and in the operation of tsunami early-warning systems.
