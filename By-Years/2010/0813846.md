The extensive radiations of cichlid fishes in the lakes of East Africa are an
ideal system for studying the ecological and genetic factors that promote
speciation. This project will examine whether the evolution of new sex
chromosomes, in combination with linked color polymorphisms, has been important
in the speciation of Lake Malawi cichlids. Molecular markers will be used to
genetically map the genes controlling sex determination and color polymorphisms
in the highly polymorphic genus Metriaclima. Phylogenetic analysis will
determine whether recently evolved color patterns are linked to the evolution of
new sex chromosomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These data will provide key empirical
data to evaluate whether genetic conflict over sex ratio is important to the
spectacular radiation of these fishes, and by extension to the evolution of many
other animal species. The project will also provide training opportunities for
undergraduates in the form of well-defined research projects for summer
internships and senior theses. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the
research program will provide a fertile training ground for graduate and
postdoctoral research. The results of the research will be communicated to
cichlid aquarists and the general public through an existing www
site.&lt;br/&gt;
