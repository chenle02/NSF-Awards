This is a Research Opportunities for Women Research Initiation Award. The
objective of the investigation is to prepare superconducting alkaline earth-rare
earth copper oxides via sol-gel synthetic techniques, and to study the physical
properties of the materials made by this technique as compared with materials
prepared via high temperature solid state reactions. Sol-gel techniques involve
the polycondensation of solution-phase metal complexes to form inorganic
networks which ultimately form a gel. Gels can be heated to relatively low
temperatures (400 to 800 C) to form metal oxide glasses or crystalline phases.
The program will emphasize study of gel evolution with temperature to form
glasses and crystalline phases using nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared
spectroscopy, electron spin resonance techniques, differential scanning
calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, and x-ray diffraction, as well as
characterization of the properties of the specimens by measuring electrical
conductivity, and ac and dc magnetic susceptibility. Advantages of sol-gel
processing over solid state processing include lower reaction temperatures,
greater homogeneity, purity and compositional control, and the ability to cost
gels into various forms and shapes prior to final heating. In the case of
superconducting oxides, these advantages will yield materials having higher
quality and will allow fabrication into useful shapes.
