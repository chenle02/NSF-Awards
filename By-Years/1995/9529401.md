ABSTRACT 1995 Engineering Education Coalitions Assessment Conference P.I.: Dr.
Gloria M. Rogers Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, a member of the Foundation
Engineering Edu- cation Coalition, proposes to organize and conduct a conference
for assessment team members, campus coordinators, and project directors of the
eight Engineering Educa- tion Coalitions. The conference will feature
presentations by experts in the assessment and evaluation of educational
innovations and their impact on students. These will be followed by small-group
working sessions in which participants develop strategies for applying improved
assessment techniques within their own Coalitions and educational institutions.
Approximately 80 participants are expected. The outcome of the confer- ence will
be a set of improved assessment strategies, which will be documented in a re-
port to be broadly distributed throughout the Coalitions. This proposed activity
has been encouraged by NSF staff and will be of significant benedit to the
Engineering Education Coalitions Program.
