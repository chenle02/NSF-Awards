This is a study of social threat and social control, examining the effects of
threats such as crime and economic problems on the growth or decline of
bureaucracies whose public mission is to deal with them. The investigator will
assemble a data set with city as the unit of analysis, drawing upon official
statistics over the span 1960-1990, to allow him to test theoretical
propositions drawn from conflict theory. Three kinds of threat will be studied
(criminal, racial, economic), along with several measures of the activity of
control bureaucracies (police size, imprisonment rates, mental hospital
admissions, welfare payments). This project will integrate several fields and
contribute to criminology, race relations, economics of social problems, and
policy studies. It will increase our understanding of the processes of social
conflict that shape public institutions and their response to perceived threats.
