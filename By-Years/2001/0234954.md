With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Denver will acquire a
Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass
Spectrometer. This instrument will be used in a wide variety of research
projects, including a) structural and thermodynamic properties responsible for
the proper/improper protein folding; b) the mechanisms by which halogens cause
degradation of polyamide membranes used in municipal water filtration systems;
c) photocleavage of molecular scaffolds; and d) posttranslational processing and
modification of analgesic neuropeptide hormones involved in the management of
pain and stress by the brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is the
technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights on molecules up to
and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique in studies involving
biomolecules. At the University of Denver, this instrument will be used not only
by graduate students in their research but also by undergraduates in laboratory
courses where students work with professors in project-oriented teams that
conduct experiments involve the purification and characterization of proteins
and other macromolecules. &lt;br/&gt;
