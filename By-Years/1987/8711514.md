This proposal will map and measure the rates and timing of conifer invasion of
grasslands at lower timberline elevations along the western slope of the Madison
Range in Montana. Conifer invasion is a recent phenomenon related to
overgrazing, range deterioration, fire suppression, and good conifer seed crops
in years of above-average precipitation. Modelling and understanding the
relationships between human land use and the physical causes of conifer invasion
will increase our understanding of ecosystem dynamics generally, and human
impacts on vegetational succession in alpine regions more specifically. The
changes that will be modelled and explained by the investigators have major
implication for species diversity in the region as well as for rangeland policy
and managment.
