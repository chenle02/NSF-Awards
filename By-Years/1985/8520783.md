The project deals with the mathematical and physical modeling of
electronmagnetic casting of materials that simulate aluminum casting. The
results of this work are expected to have practical value (a new generation of
casters with improved productivity and performance) as well as theoretical value
(increased understanding of turbulent electromagnetically driven flows which are
important in many metal processing operations).
