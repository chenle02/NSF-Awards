This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program concerns the
development of models to describe optical rotation by polysaccharide molecules,
which are important structural components of carbohydrates found in all
biological systems. The optical rotation is sensitive to chemical structure,
configuration, and conformation and therefore provides information about these
properties. In this work the optical rotation is related to vacuum ultraviolet
circular dichroism bands, which in turn are described by geometry dependent
interactions among bond-localized electronic transitions. The model has already
been developed and tested on simple monsaccharides and now will be applied to
disaccharides, including some that are the smallest conformational units of
important polysaccharides. The work will give valuable theoretical information
on molecular conformations to complement NMR and other experimental techniques
currently in use.
