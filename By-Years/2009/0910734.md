While hardware resources for computation and data storage are now abundant,
economic factors prevent specialized hardware security mechanisms from being
integrated into commodity parts. System owners are caught between the need to
exploit cheap, fast, commodity microprocessors and the need to ensure that
critical security properties hold. This research will explore a novel way to
augment commodity hardware after fabrication to enhance secure operation. The
basic approach is to add a separate silicon layer, housing select security
features, onto an existing integrated circuit. This 3-D Integration decouples
the function and economics of security policy enforcement from the underlying
computing hardware. As a result, security enhancements are manufacturing options
applicable only to those systems that require them, which resolves the economic
quandary. We plan to identify a minimal and realizable set of circuit-level
security capabilities enabled by this approach, which can be judiciously
controlled by the software layers. This will significantly assist in reducing
both the software complexity often associated with security mechanisms and
system vulnerabilities. This research introduces a fundamentally new method to
incorporate security mechanisms into hardware and has the potential to
significantly shift the economics of trustworthy systems. A broader impact will
result through collaborative and educational activities. Graduate and
undergraduate student research associates will transfer knowledge to future
teachers, researchers and Information Assurance professionals; and project
publications will provide direct technical transfer to the embedded-systems and
hardware-design communities.
