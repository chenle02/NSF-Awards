This award provides for a graphics workstation that will be used to display the
results of large-scale numerical computations, including research on the
computer simulation of blood flow in capillary networks, a variety of surface
phenomena (fluid adsorption and diffusion in narrow capillary pores, surfactant
behavior, nucleation, etc.), materials processing, and in molecular modeling of
immobilized protein structures. Such simulations produce large quantities of raw
data, and a sophisticated graphics station is needed to interpret and display
the results. Four research groups will use the facility.
