In this project the distribution of large and small particles will be measured
in the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Studies in the Central Equatorial Pacific
(EQPAC) to address two of the five problems being addressed in EQPAC, namely:
Problem I: What is the relationship between physical forcing and upper ocean
biogeochemical cycles? Problem IV: Which processes are responsible for the
transport and regeneration of particulate and dissolved nutrients? The work is
designed to fill that gap in knowledge by making high resolution profiles of
small particles using transmissometer and CTD to obtain simultaneous profiles of
beam attenuation (proportional to small particle concentration), temperature and
salinity to compare particle distributions with water structure.
