This research is to study and develop formal models of bureaucratic
communications. Application is to the development of artificially intelligent
bureaucratic communication networks that can reason and advise about
bureaucratic rules and procedures, monitor and expedite message handling,
utilize heuristics to circumvent procedural breakdowns, accommodate exception
handling, and facilitate adaptation and evolution of bureaucratic rule
structures. The research focuses on structured communications within
bureaucracies; that is, communications having a bounded syntax and vocabulary
(e.g., bureaucratic forms, verifications, requests). The purpose is to
understand the basic nature of these communications, and to reduce them to
symbolic form, amenable to machine reasoning. A logic-based representation of
bureaucratic messages and communication is proposed. The significance of the
research is that it will lead to a deeper understanding of the role and
limitations of bureaucratic rationalization, and the potential application of
artificial intelligence technology in bureaucracies.
