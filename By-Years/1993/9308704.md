In this study supported by a Career Advancement Award from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division models are being
developed to characterize the electronic structure and spectra of nanoscale size
semiconductor crystallites such as cadmium selinide. Special emphasis is being
placed on determining the role of shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics in
influencing the properties of these crystallites. Extensive use is being made of
computer codes developed for these studies. %%% Tiny crystals of semiconducting
materials such as cadmium selenide are very important in the development of new
electronic devices. In this study theoretical and computational methods are
being developed and utilized to characterize the electronic and optical
properties of these crystals.
