Plant meristems are located at the tips of growing roots and shoots. They are
comprised of densely cytoplasmic, undifferentiated, dividing cells. These cells
have properties characteristic of "stem cells" in that their descendants give
rise not only to more undifferentiated, meristematic cells but also to the many
different cell types that make up the plant body. Thus, understanding how shoot
apical meristems work is not only critical to understanding the development of
plants but will also shed light on the more general problem of how
undifferentiated "stem cell" populations of cells generate complex structures
comprised of many different cell types. This new investigator proposes to
identify, isolate and characterize a clone the wild-type DNA encoding the
SHOOTLESS locus of Arabidopsis. Possible practical applications of this research
include the ability to more precisely control shoot regeneration. The data thus
far suggest that the SHOOTLESS locus is necessary for the formation of a shoot
apical meristem. It is possible that in addition to being necessary for shoot
meristem formation, the SHOOTLESS product is also sufficient for shoot meristem
formation. If this is true, an increase in the expression of the SHOOTLESS
product would increase the likelihood that a given tissue would regenerate
shoots. Learning how to control such a gene would result in an increased ability
to regenerate shoots from tissues or species that are otherwise recalcitrant to
shoot regeneration protocols. This would accelerate the creation of new
varieties of commercially important plant species.//
