This award will support participants in the 2021 Midwest Several Complex
Variables conference, to be held April 16-18, 2021 at the University of Notre
Dame (dates to be confirmed or revised in January 2021 based on developments
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic). Complex analysis is an extension of the
Calculus that accommodates imaginary as well as real numbers, and several
complex variables is the part of complex analysis that is applied to higher
dimensional problems featuring imaginary numbers. Despite the terminology
'imaginary' numbers have actually increased the applicability of Calculus and
are ubiquitous in areas such as electrical engineering and signal processing.
Important recent work in several complex variables touches on geometry,
differential equations, and dynamical systems among others. The conference will
afford a valuable opportunity to explore this work and allow for interactions
between senior mathematicians and early career researchers. Particular attention
will be paid to broadening participation among graduate students and early
career mathematicians.

Several complex variables has been a strong suit of mathematics departments at
Midwestern universities for several decades. The Midwest Several Complex
Variables meetings, hosted at various midwestern universities since the 1980's,
reflect this strength and have done much to help sustain and amplify it. The
proposed conference will continue this tradition, which has expanded to include
mathematicians from departments outside the midwestern region, including
international participants. Topics represented at the meeting will include
complex function theory, the Cauchy-Riemann operator and complex Neumann
problem; complex, CR and conformal geometry; complex dynamics; and
pluripotential theory. More details can be found at the conference website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
