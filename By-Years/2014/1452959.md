The objective of this research project is 1) to create a model of program
comprehension for how software development professionals write software
documentation, and 2) to use this model to design algorithms to automate the
process of writing documentation. The process of writing documentation is a
major expense in software development projects, and is often neglected. By
automating key components of the process, this research helps programmers to
avoid this expense and therefore to be more productive.

The project studies the process that programmers follow when reading source code
to write documentation. Then, the project proposes algorithms to mimic that
process. These algorithms are integrated with novel natural language generation
systems to create descriptions of software behavior. These descriptions are then
integrated into documentation of the source code. A key broader impact of this
project is to increase the workforce participation of persons with visual
disabilities. First, the descriptions generated by the research can be used in
accessibility technologies for blind programmers, to help those programmers read
source code. Second, an outreach program to state K-12 schools for the blind and
visually impaired helps prepare students in these schools prepare for a career
in the software development industry.
