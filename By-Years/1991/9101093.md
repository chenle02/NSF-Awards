This project evaluates the long-term social impacts of the Exxon Valdez oil
spill on natural-resource reliant communities in Prince William Sound, Alaska.
The effects of technological disasters on communities are reflected by changes
in perceptions, actions and choices which can lead to long-term social changes.
These effects are termed "secondary disasters" and are rarely studied. This
project, unlike the bulk of previous research relating to the oil spill, will
focus on the Native and non-Native communities in the region. The study is
highly relevant to the well-being of local people and of considerable scientific
interest and importance, both inside and outside of the Arctic. The impact of
industrial disasters is, nevertheless, greatly magnified in Arctic and Subarctic
regions because of the sensitivity of the environment and the vulnerability of
small natural resource-dependent communities.
