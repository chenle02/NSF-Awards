This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project explores an innovative
approach to the analysis of complex biomedical signals, particularly those that
exhibit chaotic dynamics. Recent research has suggested that such chaotic
dynamics may be a useful physiological marker that may provide a new approach to
the diagnosis and/or therapy of certain disease states. The present research
will build on the success of a novel technique of nonlinear dynamics analysis
(patent pending) that has demonstrated effectiveness in distinguishing chaos
from random noise. The research will extend the capability and enhance the
performance of this computational technique by mapping it to a neural network.
The end product through Phase III of the project will be a commercial software
package that enables the reliable detection and reconstruction of chaotic
dynamics from biomedical signals for research and/or clinical use. The SBIR
research will lead to a commercial software product that enables the detection
and extraction of chaotic dynamics from complex biomedical signals.
