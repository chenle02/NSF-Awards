Abstract&lt;br/&gt;It is in the interests of business and public policy to
better understand what factors predict job loss beyond a company's financial
stress. This research will apply big data mining techniques, and social network
and statistical analyses of Twitter data to identify personal factors that
predict job loss, over and above a company's business and economic conditions.
This topic is important for management and organization science disciplines
because most of what we know about job loss is at the society and company level
(such as plant closings). The project will lead to a better understanding of how
the changing nature of work is affecting people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
researchers are taking a hybrid big data theory-based approach, using
information derived from the popular social media Twitter. Two studies are
devised: (1) Identify job loss predictors from micro, meso and macro
perspectives in Twitter data by exploiting linguistic and sentiment analysis;
(2) Analyze the job topic networks of Twitter users to infer network indices as
predictors of job loss. The sets of predictors identified in studies (1) and (2)
will be used independently and together as input to a cascade of inference
models that will gauge the amount of variance in job loss explained by each of
the information domains. This project will extend fundamental methodological
knowledge by demonstrating how big data mining might be used in conjunction with
statistical analysis to identify multiple predictors of job loss from the
content of tweets and social media networks.
