This research addresses problems in machine perception and robotics. The work
is focused in two areas: recognizing curved objects in images, and mobile robot
navigation. Recognizing complex curved 3D objects, whose image features depend
strongly on viewpoint, is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision.
Objects are modelled by collections of algebraic surfaces and their intersection
curves, and the geometric constraints involved in predicting and interpreting
the images of these models are represented by sets of polynomial constraints.
Techniques from algebraic geometry and robust numerical methods can be used to
solve these constraints. Viewpoint dependent features are predicted from an
object model and represented as an aspect graph which enumerates all
topologically distinct views. Elimination theory is used to relate image
measurements to objects, and optimization techniques can be applied to estimate
an object's pose; objects are then recognized from a library of models. Problems
to be addressed include automatic generation of object models, new object
representations, prediction for sensors with limited resolution, computational
efficiency, and indexing large data bases. Mobile robots provide a dynamic test-
bed for robust computer vision algorithms in an unstructured world. In addition
to developing new sensors, research focuses on obtaining the necessary
information to perform a task. While some activities are readily achieved
through visual serving, others require developing a 3D representation of the
environment. Stereo and structure-from-motion provide 3D information from image
measurements which can be incorporated into a relational map. This map forms the
basis for motion planning; paths revisit previously seen places and strategies
for exploring new areas can be determined. Additionally, robot tasks and
cultural constraints are described more naturally when objects are recognized
within this map.
