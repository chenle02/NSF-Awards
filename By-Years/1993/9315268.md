9315268 Herbig Studies of the Diffuse Interstellar Bands. The enigma of the
Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) remains one of the outstanding problems of
astronomical spectroscopy. Clearly their carriers are fairly common constituents
of the interstellar medium yet remain unidentified despite some 60 years of
effort. Dr. Herbig, at the University of Hawaii, will continue his research into
the nature of DIBs. Specifically he will investigate whether polycarbon or
chlorin molecules may be responsible for some DIBs. Efforts will also be made to
determine if sodium atoms trapped in carbon 60 cages produce a DIB near 1.03
micrometers wavelength, whether DIBs can be detected in the ejected envelopes of
carbon stars by spectroscopy of their companions, and whether there is a
detectable enhancement of the DIBs in light scattered off the dust of reflection
nebulae.
