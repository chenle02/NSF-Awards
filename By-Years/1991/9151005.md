The experimental physical chemistry course will incorporate a Low Energy
Electron Diffraction (LEED) experiment on defined single crystal palladium
surfaces under ultra high vacuum conditions. The needed apparatus will be
constructed from components. The experiment shows electron diffraction from a
surface, as first observed by Davisson and Germer in 1925. This first
demonstration of wave-particle duality, a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon,
will be deeply instructive for students. The LEED experiment also exposes
surface structure and molecular adsorption, which are important in heterogenous
catalysis and surface chemistry. The grantee will match the NSF grant from non-
Federal sources.
