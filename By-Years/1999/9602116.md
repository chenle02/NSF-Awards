Daron Acemoglu Massachusetts Institute of Technology SBR-9602116 The first part
of this research will develop a theoretical model examining the links job
mismatch, wage and income inequality and growth. With significant costs of
finding the best job and increases in the dispersion of worker skills, high
skilled employees will have a lower ratio of physical capital (under investment)
to human capital than low skilled workers. With less physical capital than
optimal, wages of high skilled workers will decrease relative to wages of low
skilled workers, wage inequality will be reduced and economic growth will be
lower. The second part of the project looks at the effect of public education
and redistribution of income on growth. An empirical comparison will be made
between the U.S. and Great Britain, considering differences in institutions in
the two countries.
