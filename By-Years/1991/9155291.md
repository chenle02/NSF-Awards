The Exploratorium requests support for four nationally recognized installation
artists to develop scientifically relevant, interactive exhibits that will model
the movements of waves, clouds, and flowing water and their interplay on and
with the Earth's surface. By manipulating or enhancing the behavior of these
simulated elemental forces, changing their scale or the perspective from which
they are observed, or slowing down or speeding up their natural processes, the
artists can bring out characteristics not easily observed, normally. Cross-
referenced to other Exploratorium exhibits, these pieces will form the center of
a subset of exhibits on the physics of fluid motion and the interaction of
elemental forces. They will serve as a starting point for exploring the physical
conditions that can cause and support the natural phenomena modeled by the
artists. We will develop two different kinds of dissemination materials: 1) A
publication for museum professionals, addressing the use of art in presenting
science to the public. 2) Printed guides which will designate environmentally
relevant exhibits at the Exploratorium dealing with aspects fluid movements in
nature. These new "Pathways" will be intended for children and will be made
available to students coming on Field Trips and the general public. They will be
produced in coordination with two other Pathways on Energy and distributed in
packets entitled "Energy and the Environment."
