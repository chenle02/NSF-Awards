This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates statistical
software analysis, which infers&lt;br/&gt;relationships among program components
by using statistical properties&lt;br/&gt;derived from multiple program
executions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To motivate statistical techniques, it is
useful to draw analogies to&lt;br/&gt;static analysis methods. Static analysis
is about inferring&lt;br/&gt;dependencies between program components: If a value
is changed in one&lt;br/&gt;component, how does that affect a value in a
different component?&lt;br/&gt;Static analysis tends to work best for properties
that are local,&lt;br/&gt;meaning the pieces of the program we are trying to
relate are not&lt;br/&gt;separated by a great deal of other computation. The
statistical analog&lt;br/&gt;of dependencies is correlation. Instead of proving
definitively via&lt;br/&gt;static reasoning the presence or absence of
dependencies, we can&lt;br/&gt;observe at run-time that some properties of two
components have high&lt;br/&gt;or low correlation. Importantly, correlation is
not affected by&lt;br/&gt;syntactic or even dynamic locality: if two components
have a&lt;br/&gt;correlation, regardless of how much time or computation passes
between&lt;br/&gt;the execution of one component and the execution of the other,
this&lt;br/&gt;correlation can be detected if the appropriate statistical
question is&lt;br/&gt;asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial focus is on using
cross-correlation, which which computes&lt;br/&gt;the maximum correlation
between two sequences of observations, to&lt;br/&gt;formalize statistical
correlation between software components that&lt;br/&gt;have a direction in time.
This idea gives rise to a natural graph that&lt;br/&gt;captures the strength and
direction of statistical influence one&lt;br/&gt;component has upon another;
these graphs are analogous to traditional&lt;br/&gt;dependency graphs, but have
unique and useful properties.&lt;br/&gt;
