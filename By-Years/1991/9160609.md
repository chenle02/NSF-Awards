Characterization of modern materials requires analytical probes with superior
detection limits and spatial resolution on a submicron scale. In this project we
develop a neutron focusing device which can significantly enhance analytical
techniques used for the nondestructive investigation of surfaces, interfaces and
volumes on such a scale. Existing analytical techniques which will benefit from
this development are neutron depth profiling, prompt gamma activation analysis
and neutron tomography. The research will subsequently lead to the practical
application of neutron microscopy and three dimensional conformational. Since
low energy neutrons have optical properties analogous to light, we will adapt
capillary optics which have already shown potential for focusing X- rays. We
will calculate the transmission efficiency of neutrons through such capillaries,
measure the probability of transmission of cold neutrons, and demonstrate the
feasibility of foucusing neutrons using such a device. Analysis of these results
will enable the design of a prototype lens suitable for spatially distributed
neutron sources provided by cold neutrons available from a research reactor. The
device will then be made available commercially for implementing in analytical
instruments.
