Chemistry (12) The primary goal of this project is to enhance the Forensic
Chemistry curriculum at Buffalo State College by including activities that are
developing student knowledge of crime scene processing, evidence handling, and
scientific analysis of evidentiary material using state-of-the-art methodologies
and equipment. To achieve this objective, the laboratory and field experiences
presented at the 2002 NSF Summer Workshop in Forensic Sciences (Williams College
project) are being adapted and implemented as a project-based laboratory
experience in CHE 414, Forensic Chemistry Laboratory. To fully realize the
stated goal, two vital pieces of equipment, a GC-MS and an FTIR (with
microscope), are being integrated into the course. These instruments are
arguably two of the most important pieces of equipment found in today's crime
laboratories. The anticipated student outcomes of the project include: (1)
graduates who are better prepared for their careers as forensic scientists and
chemists, (2) enhanced student understanding of the fundamental theories,
applications, and operation of GC-MS and FTIR instrumentation, and (3) increased
student interest in ongoing faculty-student research projects. Locally, the
availability of the instruments is improving the infrastructure for education
and research in Chemistry and related fields. The project also is raising
awareness of Forensic Chemistry among faculty at Buffalo State, and regionally
among prospective students and science educators. National dissemination of the
results will aid educators who wish to employ Forensic experiments in science
laboratories. Finally, the project prepares students to serve as well-trained
Forensic Scientists in crime laboratories.
