This award provides partial support for the operation and maintenance of the
ion microprobe facility in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution. The facility is operated mainly to apply the ion
microprobe technique toward the analysis of trace elements and isotopic
compositions in geological samples. Access to the capabilities of the instrument
is provided by the Woods Hole ion microprobe laboratory for a national community
of U.S. researchers in geochemistry.
