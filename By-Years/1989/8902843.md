This experimental and theoretical research project will obtain equilibrium and
rate relationships for the thermal desorption of adsorbed species from molecular
sieves. These relationships are needed to establish a theoretical basis for
predicting the dynamic behavior of a novel separation process, "Variable
Temperature Stepwise Desorption" (VTSD). The method permits separation of two or
more adsorbed components in a sequential fashion through a preferential
adsorption-desorption cycle. Separations processes are the backbone of one of
the most successful major industries of the United States in the international
marketplace. Consequently, separations is one of the largest consumers of energy
and a major contributor to chemical manufacturing costs. Techniques like VTSD
may make major contributions to chemical industry efficiency in the coming
decade. One process very similar to VTSD, Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), is
already making major contributions to development of advanced separations
technology for the next century. VTSD has the potential to make a comparable
contribution, essentially serving to compliment PSA. This project will obtain
experimental data necessary for developing and testing mathematical models
necessary for the further development of VTSD.
