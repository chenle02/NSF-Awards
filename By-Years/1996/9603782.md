9603782 Rundle The work will investigate protein phosphatase 2A isoforms in
Arabidopsis thaliana. This family of phosphatases is involved in a number of
developmental processes in plants and in the sensing and signal transduction of
environmental cues. Not much work has been focused on these proteins in plants -
major emphasis has up to now been given to the corresponding protein kinases.
The work will utilize conserved regions to amplify the phosphatases, will study
the genomic organization of family members, characterize transcripts, examine
their cellular localization, and work towards a protein expression and analysis
system. These are long-range goals for this young investigator. More short term
objectives include the training of undergraduate students and setting up the
experimental system. The PP2A family is receiving more attention at the moment
in plants because of the pivotal role of the proteins in plant environment
interactions, making such work timely and worthy of systematic investigations.
