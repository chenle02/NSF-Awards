This award provides partial funding for computer equipment to be installed and
operated in the Berkeley Seismographic Station and the Department of Geology
&amp; Geophysics at the University of California, Berkeley. Additional support
for acquisition of this equipment is coming from the University and from the
U.S. Geological Survey. The dual goals of this equipment are to modernize the
Berkeley Seismographic Network, a regional network vital to earthquake
monitoring activities in northern California and to earthquake research in
general, and to provide computing capabilities to researchers in geophysics
involved in earthquake research, seismological tomography, geodynamic modeling,
equation of state modeling in mineral physics, and additional computing-
intensive research projects.
