ABSTRACT CTS-9422458 Mark Davis A workshop is organized and conducted to define
standard reference materials and properties for zeolites. A formal proposal to
the National Institute of Standards and Technology for establishment of these
standards is prepared. Zeolites are widely used for several important industrial
processes. They serve as detergents, separation agents, and catalysts. However,
widely accepted standards are lacking, making definition of quality difficult.
