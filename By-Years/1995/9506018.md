This laboratory project will test the conflicting hypotheses suggested by
earlier studies of facial size and shape on the one hand, and DNA on the other,
concerning whether the mangabey monkeys form either one related lineage or two.
The hypotheses will be tested using DNA sequences of variable regions from three
to four unlinked nuclear genes. This research will improve our understanding of
the evolution of molecular and morphological characters in primate groups where
molecular and morphological studies conflict in their interpretations, such as
in the great apes and humans.
