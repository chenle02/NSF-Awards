9509519 Richards This research involves determination of the evolutionary
relationships among a African family of treefrogs using molecular sequence data.
This study will provide baseline data needed for a more comprehensive
investigation of the evolutionary history of all Old World tree frogs. These
frogs are distributed in Africa, Madagascar, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka and
India, land masses with known geological histories. Analysis of the pattern of
evolutionary relationship among these frogs will allow the testing of
biogeogpaphic hypotheses concerning their origin and diversification. %%% This
research will contribute to our understanding of the systematics of Old World
tree frogs. Prior studies based on morphology have been unable to resolve
relationships among this group.
