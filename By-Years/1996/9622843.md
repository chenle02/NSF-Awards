9622843 Aschbacher This grant supports the research of Professor M. Aschbacher
to work on three different areas in finite group theory. The first problem is to
give a unified treatment of the existence and uniqueness of the finite sporadic
simple groups. The next problem is to work on a complete treatment of the
classification of quasithin groups. Finally, he intends to study finite group
actions on certain topological and geometric objects, with special attention to
Hirzebruch's prize question. This is research in the field of group theory.
Group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As
such, this area has direct applications to many areas of physics and chemistry.
Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections to problems in data
transmission have been solved using techniques from group theory. There are also
direct connections to the error correcting codes that are vital for modern
computing such as working with CD-ROM's.
