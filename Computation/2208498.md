In many physical systems of practical interest, phenomena occur in heterogeneous
media with properties varying at multiple scales and having disparate values on
each scale. Examples include multi-physics processes in filters, membranes, and
Earth's subsurface. Standard numerical approaches for simulating these phenomena
to obtain accurate predictions require tremendous computational effort. The goal
of this project is to develop a unified framework for accurately and efficiently
simulating complex multiscale, time dependent physical phenomena that involve
flow, transport, and mechanical deformations that arise in porous media. The
project will support education by training a new generation of computational
mathematicians who work in multidisciplinary research.

This project involves the development and analyses of novel temporal splitting
methods that are designed to overcome challenges that arise when simulating
multiscale, time-dependent physical phenomena. The methods are based on solution
decomposition for non-stationary multiscale models and will consider space and
time heterogeneities that are highly coupled. The goal is to provide a general
framework that combines temporal splitting algorithms and spatial multiscale
decompositions with a rigorous theoretical analysis of the new algorithms. The
specific objectives of the project are: (i) to study temporal splitting
algorithms for simulations of non-stationary multiscale models; (ii) to
understand space and time interaction in multiscale models; (iii) to analyze
temporal splitting approaches to guide the choice for space decomposition; (iv)
to design novel splitting approaches for nonlinear models; and (v) to test and
demonstrate proposed approaches for improving predictions of multiscale, time-
dependent physical phenomena in engineering and geosciences.
