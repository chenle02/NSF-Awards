0409605&lt;br/&gt;Reches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to investigate
seismogenic processes at the focal-depth of earthquakes. This will be conducted
in the deep gold mines of South Africa that offer unique advantages: (1) Mining
operations control the location, magnitude and timing of the earthquakes and the
investigation can be focused at sites where earthquakes are guaranteed; (2) The
mine infrastructure allows access to earthquake-producing faults and permits
monitoring fault activity before, during and after earthquakes at distances of
1-100 m from the hypocenter; (3) The size of mine earthquakes (M = 3-4) bridges
the gap between the small samples used in the laboratory (M&lt;0) and large
earthquakes along crustal faults (M&gt;6); and (4) The effects of catastrophic
earthquakes on subsurface life (microbial ecology) could be monitored. The South
African mines are, in essence, a natural earthquake laboratory with
opportunities to make fundamental contributions to earthquake science by near-
field, three-dimensional monitoring of the earthquake process. There is no other
natural environment where this is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically,
the project will involve: (1) Drilling through three active fault zones at
depths of 1.5 - 3.0 km in mines. The faults will be chosen to optimize the
structure and seismic activity for research; i.e. they will have a high
probability of generating small to moderate earthquakes during the life of the
project; (2) A dense array of instruments will be deployed to monitor the three-
dimensional, nearfield processes of the earthquakes. The instruments will
include seismometers, strainmeters, temperature sensors, displacement-meters,
and devices to monitor strong-ground motion, electromagnetic radiation, acoustic
emission, and time-variations of microbial communities and fault fluid and gas
chemistry; and (3) The physical and chemical conditions of the active faults
will be characterized by in-situ stress measurements and 3D mapping, and by
extensive chemical and rock mechanics&lt;br/&gt;
