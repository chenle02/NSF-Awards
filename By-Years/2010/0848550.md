In this project the PI will apply methods and modeling techniques from
statistical mechanics and soft condensed matter to elucidate the physical
principles underlying protein organization in living cells. The research will
build on recent work by the PI and his collaborators. The main components of the
proposed research include investigating (i) protein-lipid interactions and their
effect on domain morphologies and protein localization, (ii) dynamics of lipid
domains and lipid re-localization in growing and dividing cells, (iii) changes
in lipid and protein localization profiles with changes in cell shape,
temperature and other physical or biological parameters, and (iv) spatial
organization and stochastic nucleation of protein clusters in growing bacteria.
The research lies at the interface of physics, biology, and chemistry and will
involve a combination of theoretical and computational techniques that include
analytical field-theoretic methods as well as Monte Carlo, Langevin, and
Brownian dynamics simulations, and will be carried out in close collaboration
with experimentalists. The results from this research will be incorporated into
an interdisciplinary undergraduate course on the physics of biomolecular
networks that the PI is developing. The PI will be involved in high school
teacher training programs, thus exposing students to the excitement of
scientific activity.

This research is co-sponsored by the Physics of Living Systems program in the
Physics Division and the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biology at NSF.
