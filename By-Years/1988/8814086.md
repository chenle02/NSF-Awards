Over the last year, a consensus has formed that there is a national need for
more and better social science research on Arctic topics. The United States
Arctic Research Plan (1987), for example, states that "it has become evident
that the objectives of U.S. Arctic research policy cannot be met without a
program in the social sciences". Similarly, the report of the National Science
Board Committee on the Role of NSF in Polar Regions, states that "behavioral and
social sciences are obvious examples of fields in which basic research (on
Arctic topics) is not sufficient." There has been little thought devoted to
devising a strategy for implementing this consensus nor does there exist a
Federal agency with a clear-cut mandate to support research in the social and
behavioral sciences on Arctic topics. An ad hoc Committee on Arctic Social
Sciences has been established within the Polar Research Board of the National
Academy of Sciences to address these problems. The Committee proposes to
identify the principal research questions in Arctic social sciences, recommend
priorities to guide the direction of future research in this field, and indicate
the facilities and support required for a meaningful research program. This
Committee brings together prominent representatives of the major social science
disciplines to examine the options available to formulate a strategy to fulfill
the national need for social science research on Arctic topics. The end product
will be a peer-reviewed, action-oriented study that would identify first-order
Arctic social science problems and that would suggest a mechanism for their
solution. The Committee report will also highlight links between Arctic social
science research and new large-scale global systems programs that are currently
focused on the biological and physical sciences. Funding is to be shared by the
principal federal and state agencies involved in the Arctic research and
potentially include DOD, DOI, Smithsonian Institution, Department of Commerce,
State of Alaska and the North Slope Borough.
