The goal of this study is to expand a recently developed numerical model of
elastohydrodynamic lubrication. In this region of lubrication, both the physical
properties of the lubricant (i.e., the effect of pressure on viscosity) and the
mechanical properties of the solid surfaces (i.e., the elastic deformation) must
be considered simultaneously. The previous models in this region are only
applicable to idealized situations and do not consider real effects such as the
surface roughness, the non-Newtonian lubricant behavior, and the temperature. It
is planned to incorporate these effects in the model and to check the model
experimentally. The outcome of this research would be clearly relevant to
analysis of lubrication in real tribological systems where such effects cannot
be ignored.
