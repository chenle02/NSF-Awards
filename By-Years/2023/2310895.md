Non-technical description: This project will answer fundamental questions about
the properties of a new class of topological systems. The focus is on FeTeSe,
where the novel state is believed to emerge from the combination of topology and
superconductivity. This new direction in quantum materials promises an
exploration of quantum properties. Nonetheless, it also raises an ongoing
challenge in condensed matter, directly addressed by this proposal, how to
uniquely identify the topological nature of emergent states. Proposed
experiments will address this challenge directly by looking at the role of spin-
orbit coupling, bandwidth, contact properties, symmetry, superconducting and
topological order. The proposal includes informing K-12 about 2D materials and
topology via the Lynch School of Education's Science Educators for Urban Schools
program; talking directly to K-12 via the Skype a Scientist program; increasing
participation of women, first-generation and underrepresented minorities by
partnering with BC's McNair, and the Women in Science and Technology programs.

Technical description: Topological phases of matter, defined by an invariant in
Hilbert space, are challenging to identify and probe. These are typically
demonstrated via the bulk-boundary correspondence wherein the nontrivial
topology produces new modes. For topological phases emerging in superconductors,
the non-trivial nature of the boundary modes is challenging to reveal
experimentally. These modes also hold the potential for future protected quantum
bits in topological quantum computation. There is mounting evidence for such
modes in the superconducting state of FeTeSe. This project builds on the
principle investigatorâ€™s recent results suggesting a topological boundary mode
in FeTeSe. To understand the relationship to the bulk order, systematic
experiments will explore the device configurations and material parameters over
which this occurs. In addition, the proposed experiments lend themselves to
involving a diverse group of participants at the high school and undergraduate
level in cutting-edge topics and techniques crucial to improving their
representation in STEM.
