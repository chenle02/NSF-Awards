This award enables Indiana State University to connect to NSFNET through a
56,000 bit per second link to the University of Indiana. The link to Indiana
connects Indiana State to the mid- level network CICnet, which then connects to
NSFNET. Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and students with access to
supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network gateways, automated library
catalogs, and a wide range of software. Primary applications include file
transfers, electronic mail communication between local and remote researchers,
and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other research facilities.
