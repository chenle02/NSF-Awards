0107120 Goldfinger&lt;br/&gt;0107093 Nelson&lt;br/&gt;Great earthquakes
represent large releases of energy and the ability to predict them is of obvious
importance. A number of models of earthquake temporal and spatial
characteristics have been developed, but have not been adequately tested and
validated, mostly because the historical record is very short in comparison to
the typical time between earthquakes. This project will attempt to provide a
record of large earthquakes along the Cascadia margin that spans at least 10,000
years by use of turbidites as proxies for large earthquakes. The results will be
invaluable in testing earthquake recurrence models.&lt;br/&gt;
