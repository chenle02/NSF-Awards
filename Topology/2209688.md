This award provides support for participants, especially students and early-
career researchers, attending the 51st John and Lida Barrett Memorial Lectures
which will be held on June 9-12, 2022, at University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
This four-day conference brings together researchers from four areas of
mathematics in which ?exotic? continua naturally appear: (1) analysis on metric
spaces, (2) geometry of singular spaces, (3) topological dynamical systems, and
(4) geometric group theory. The conference will provide an opportunity for
researchers in each area to obtain a broad introduction to all other areas,
followed by more specialized talks. The goal of the conference is to bring out
commonalities in methods and produce cross-fertilization between these areas.
The plenary lecturers, Judy Kennedy (general continua theory), Nageswari
Shanmugalingam (analysis on metric spaces), Guofang Wei (geometry of singular
spaces), Olga Lukina (topological dynamical systems), and Kim Ruane (geometric
group theory) are all prominent women in their respective areas. The plenary
speakers will be involved in inviting additional speakers on more specialized
topics. The conference encourages the inclusion and participation of junior
scientists and members of groups under-represented in STEM.

Continua theory has a very long history in mathematics, going back to the
earliest days in which topology became a distinct field. Continua, which are
defined as connected, compact, metrizable spaces, include ?nice? spaces such as
compact manifolds. Metrizable continua that do not (or are not known to) have a
traditional universal covering space are referred as ?exotic?. Exotic continua
emerged in the quest for interesting examples long before they began to appear
in the natural settings in which we now encounter them. Fractals appear as the
underlying spaces that arise in important questions in analysis with
applications, for example in design of cell phone antennae. Fractals are
examples of Peano continua which in turn include all compact limits of geodesic
spaces in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Exotic continua, also, arise as boundaries
of groups and spaces in geometric group theory, and as solenoidal spaces,
generalizing original examples that are defined as inverse limits via covering
maps of much nicer spaces, including manifolds, but which themselves need not be
path connected. The conference website is https://math.utk.edu/barrett/51st-

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
