9355544 Dale Restructuring Mathematics This 5-year project by Edmonds School
District #19 builds on district-financed project that began a fundamental,
systemic, district-wide reform of K-12 mathematics 3 years ago. The pilot
project has already trained 40 teacher-leaders and impacted over 500 teachers at
all grade levels, and the present project builds on this base. It involves
teachers, principals, administrators, and parents to create a district-wide
culture to support sound mathematics education for 20,000 students at 24
elementary, 4 middle, and 5 high schools. During its 5-year life, the project
will have directly impacted 436 elementary, 24 middle school, and 34 high school
teachers, including training 36 elementary, 8 middle school, and 10 high school
teacher-leaders. The program for the teachers consists of 5 sequential 1-week
summer institutes plus 8 full days of follow-up during the school year, focusing
on such matters as: restructuring the teacher's own conception of mathematics;
creating collaborative learning environments in the classroom; alternative
assessment; a study of modern curricula; etc. There are also programs for
parents (6 evening sessions) and administrators, including 33 building
principals. Cost-sharing is 104% of the NSF contribution.
