9451430 Levin This is a joint project by the Departments of Political Science
and Sociology at the institution. Together, the departments teach about 2500
students per semester of whom 60 percent are from populations underrepresented
in science. Networked microcomputers and current technology and software are
used. The project is directed at expanding the use of the computational
laboratories beyond statistics and methods courses to include the entire
curriculum. Also, undergraduates are strongly encouraged to engage in original,
empirical research. Determined efforts are also being made to convince
populations underrepresented in science of the utility of these materials and
technology for understanding and developing in the social sciences.
