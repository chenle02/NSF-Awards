This award is made jointly by the Office of Special Projects in Chemistry and
the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research in
support of the continuing research of Dr. Kathy Rowlen at the University of
Colorado-Boulder. The research relates the atomic level structure of thin metal
films to their morphology, optical, and electrical properties. Specifically, the
morphology of copper, silver and gold films supported on silica, silicon, mica,
and alumina will be characterized using atomic force microscopy and surface
enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Issues that will be addressed are: (1) influence of
substrate on film morphology; (2) film thermal stability as a function of
substrate; (3) in situ measurement of optical properties under film growth
conditions; (4) spatial distribution of of metal deposition by photoinduced
reduction as a probe for hot electrons in semiconductors; and, (5) application
of enhanced electromagnetic fields near metal particles for improved solar
conversion efficiency in Schottky barrier solar cells. Adhesion of film to
substrate, and the kinetics of particle coalesence will also be investigated. A
fundamental understanding of the nature of thin metal films deposited on non-
metal surfaces will benefit a variety of technologies including printed
circuitry, interconnects, integrated circuits and photovoltaic devices.
