ABSTRACT

Proposal #: 308237 Title: Motion Planning with Constraints: from Applications
to General Solution Frameworks PI: Kavraki, Lydia William Marsh Rice Univ

The research focus of this project is the study of two sets of problems at the
frontiers of modern motion planning. These are planning with kinodynamic
constraints and planning with high dimensional reparameterizable robots with
complex constraints imposed by the energetics of an underlying physical system.
Both sets of problems define high dimensional state spaces. At its core, the
project will develop general solution frameworks based on randomized sampling
algorithms for the exploration of these high dimensional state spaces together
with performance measures and guidelines on how to choose relevant parameters.
To obtain a healthy balance between studying fundamental issues and specialized
applications, representative probems have been identified. For kinodynamic
planning, the orbital rendezvous problem will be studied, where a robot space
vehicle in some orbit docks with a space station in a different orbit. For
planning with physical constraints, knot tying will be investigated. The
proposed project is rooted in motion planning but incorporates concepts from
control theory, radomized algorithms, computational geometry, geometric modeling
and graphics, and complexity theory.

The broader impact part of the project is implemented through (a) plans for
technology transfer to industrial, government and biomedical research
laboratories, (b) curriculum development at Rice University involving
undergraduate robotics and theory courses, (c) training, mentoring and
involvement in research activities of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral
students, (d) mentoring of women undergraduate students in computer science, and
(e) participation in an NSF funded program of Rice University and the Houston
Independent School District whose goal is to attract high school girls to
engineering fields.
