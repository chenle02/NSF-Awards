The manner and rate of deformation of the Earth's major ice sheets depend on a
complex interplay of their geographical and climatic setting, as well as their
internal dynamics. In the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, it is known that rapidly
moving ice streams alternate with large areas of stagnant ice, and that the
transition between streaming and non-streaming flow can be be quite narrow. In
these lateral shear margins it is thought that the physical controls on ice
stream dynamics must show significant differences. This study will examine the
geophysical differences between an ice stream and a stagnant ridge along the
Siple Coast in West Antarctica. The ice will be probed with electromagnetic and
seismic waves to infer the internal temperature and the crystalline structure of
the ice, as well as the proportion of old (Wisconsin Ice Age) ice, since it is
known that ice flow laws depend exponentially on temperature, that ice crystals
are much less resistant to deformation in the plane of their hexagonal faces
than in other directions, and that old ice may deform much more readily than ice
of more recent geological age. Measurement of radar diffraction patterns and the
analysis of the records of micro- earthquakes can be used to show whether the
base of the ice sheet is frozen to the underlying bedrock.
