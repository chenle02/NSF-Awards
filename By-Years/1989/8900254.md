This project facilitates the attendance of undergraduate students at the
national conferences in electric power engineering. The intent is to encourage
student interest in this field by exposing them to the latest research
activities. Although electric power engineering is a traditional field, it is a
vital one for the economy, and the continuing availability of trained manpower
to stay internationally competitive is important.
