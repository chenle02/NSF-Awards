The objectives of this research are to build a instrumented chair to study
seated posture stability and to use the measurements obtained from the chair to
formulate and validate a model of seated posture control. This research is
important since all previous studies have concentrated on the control and
modelling of standing posture and gait. In some situations, such as for children
with neuromuscular disorders, the control of seated posture is very important.
These studies could suggest strategies for surgical, therapeutic and other
interventions to help stabilize patients in the seated position.
