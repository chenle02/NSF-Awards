This research is concerned with the design of computer graphics that produces
realistic images of environments that are complex with respect to geometry,
reflection behavior, and light transport. This design will be pursued with the
additional goals of real-time performance on general purpose hardware that will
exist within one to two decades, and compatibility with display algorithms based
on human perception.
