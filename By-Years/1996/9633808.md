9633808 Reid This grant provides $100,000 as two years partial support of a
technician's salary support who would be responsible for operations, maintenance
and oversight of the UCLA thermal ionization mass spectrometry facility and
associated clean rooms. This award is a Phase II technician support proposal
under the IF program and follows three years of Phase I technician support which
expires on 7/31/96. The lab manager will operate and maintain two TIMS housed at
UCLA, a VG Sector 54- 30 with multiple collectors and an upgraded VG54E. The
Sector 54 instrument is dedicated to analyses of Pb, Sr and Nd isotopes while
the 54E is reserved for isotope dilution measurements and technique development.
Specific research to be undertaken during the duration of this award will
include Th isotope studies of continental basalts as indicators of their mantle
source, exposure age dating of geologic samples using cosmogenic radionuclides
(i.e. 14-C, 36-Cl, 26-Al and 10-Be) and Sr isotope zonation studies of
individual phenocrysts from arc volcanics to investigate the time scales of
magmatic differentiation. ***
