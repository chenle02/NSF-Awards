Abstract Two-phase flow and phase separation is an essentially ubiquitous
feature of high temperature hydrothermal circulation at ocean ridges. This
project will continue efforts toward developing a finite difference based
numerical code for a NaCl-H2O solution and applying it to a number of first
order seafloor hydrothermal problems. Tasks to be addressed include further
modeling of 1-D heat pipe systems, modeling of 1-D systems including mass flux
from below, modeling of 2-D circulation near a dike, and general 2-D circulation
in a single-pass model.
