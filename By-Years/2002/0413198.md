The goal of this project is to develop robust algorithms for reconstructing the
3D shape and reflectance properties of real world scenes. The distinguishing
feature of the proposed approach is the modeling of global light transport,
taking into account both realistic reflection and global interreflection of
light with surfaces in the unknown scene. Modeling realistic light transport is
a open problem with major importance in computer vision, due to the fact that
everyday materials reflect light in complex ways (e.g., wood, hair, velvet), and
because the appearance of geometrically complex scenes is strongly affected by
interreflection. This project seeks to model reflection in a very general
setting, where the shape and the reflectance properties of the scene are both
unknown and unconstrained. Modeling of interreflection will focus on diffuse
scattering, and fully account for global light propagation through the scene.
Toward this objective, a new computational framework is introduced that uses
data-driven models of light transport that can be captured directly from
photographs, and recovers scene structure without the need for complex
simulations or optimizations of the underlying physical process. A key advantage
of such data-driven models is that they work robustly in very general
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work opens up new avenues in 3D
shape sensing technology, a problem with widespread applications in robotics,
visualization, mapping, aerial imaging, and virtual reality. The ability to
capture material models on real objects will improve realism in computer
graphics, and impacts applications such as entertainment, visualization, and the
communication of visual media. The project will involve undergraduate and
graduate research projects and the outcome will be a set of results and tools
that will be broadly disseminated and incorporated into research projects and
educational initiatives at the University of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;
