The use of automated microscopy is increasing rapidly in academic biological
research (as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries). Image
analysis software can extract information-rich cellular image data from
microscopy images and eliminate tedious visual inspection. However, a
significant challenge has been the lack of metrics and user-friendly software
tools to explore the data and identify low-quality images that limit an
experiment's value. This project will create tools to address these challenges
and test them in the context of two biological experiments. This project will
develop and characterize metrics of image quality and the final software will be
distributed via the CellProfiler project as a validated, versatile, open-source
toolbox of algorithms and metrics readily usable by biologists.

The research will improve data quality in a wide variety of biological
experiments addressing important questions in basic science. Furthermore, the
education and outreach efforts will increase the number of scientists trained in
image analysis at the interface of biology and computer science, will increase
the number of students interested in science, and will broaden the participation
of people from under-represented minority groups in science, especially at the
highest levels of achievement.
