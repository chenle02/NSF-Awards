The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center is a national partnership
of community colleges, high schools, universities, informal educational
organizations, research institutions, marine industries, professional societies,
and working professionals. MATE's mission is to improve marine technical
education and increase the number of highly-skilled technical professionals who
enter ocean-related occupations. The Center characterizes and researches trends
in the ocean workforce, identifies the knowledge and skills this workforce
needs, places this information in the hands of educational institutions at all
levels, and works to ensure that curricula and programs are appropriately
preparing students to meet workforce needs. MATE's programs represent unique
approaches to engaging students in STEM learning experiences and developing the
capacity for increasing the nation's technological workforce. The geographic
distribution of MATE partners makes products of this Center available to a broad
audience; the strategies developed as a result of MATE's research into barriers
of participation help to engage and involve traditionally underrepresented
groups. These efforts prepare a diverse workforce that ensures U.S.
competitiveness in a global economy that is currently, and increasingly,
dependent on ocean activities.
