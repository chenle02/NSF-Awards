9527544 Morton Current trends in the computational sciences lean toward
distributed and parallel computing as a tool for flexible and efficient problem
solving across a broad spectrum of disciplines. Businesses increasingly depend
on client/server computing platforms for achieving flexible network capabilities
with outside entities, such as the emerging "Information Superhighway."
Meanwhile, parallel processing methods are increasing utilized to solve large-
scale problems in shorter periods of time. While the issues of client/server
programming and parallel processing of large-scale problems are considered
mainstream" in major research centers and organizations, institutions such as
Cameron University lack local access to such technology and are unable to
benefit from the advantages of these approaches. With the introduction of large
amounts of free, reliable software, along with low-cost hardware, much of this
technology is now accessible to those with appropriate computing skills. The PI
intends to make use of these resources, demonstrating the enormous benefits that
such use provides to small undergraduate institutions, while providing an
infrastructure for education and research activities in parallel and distributed
computing at Cameron University.
