The ever increasing need for a robust and reliable infrastructure for the
curation, storage and sharing of research data has been identified across
multiple disciplines. While the needs of different research communities will
vary, there are many issues which the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing
Innovation communities will have in common for data infrastructure. This award
supports a workshop which brings these communities together to identify these
needs, learn from the success of communities whose data infrastructures are
further advanced, and plan for paths forward in establishing the tools,
resources, and culture shifts needed to bring open sharing of research data to
the broad engineering community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop supported by
this award will highlight the key issues that must be addressed to realize the
full impact and use of big data on the research areas represented in the
Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) at the
National Science Foundation. The community will convene to (1) develop an
overall strategy and short term research agenda for capturing and sharing large
volumes of data (2) recommend methods and techniques for making large data sets
available and usable by the CMMI research communities (3) forge
interdisciplinary research teams that can develop prototype platforms for CMMI
research communities and (4) suggest best practices for NSF data management
plans. Approximately 60 members of the community, including both junior and
senior researchers, data scientists, library scientists, and members of the
scientific publishing community will convene in Arlington, VA at NSF
Headquarters.
