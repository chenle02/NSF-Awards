The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation â€“
Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to improve energy efficiency for
convection-related applications, ranging from automotive to aerospace, power
conversion, refrigeration, and others. The project will develop advanced
computational techniques to improve the performance of heat exchangers,
advancing design and manufacturing techniques in the energy industry. This
project will also foster the training of technology commercialization for
graduate students, and research training for under-represented students in STEM
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project integrates topology
optimization and additive manufacturing for heat exchangers. Density-based
topology optimization of conjugate heat transfer systems will be conducted in a
high-performance computing environment. An adjoint approach will be used to
obtain the sensitivity. We will use density gradient-based formulations to
address overhang angle and support structure control. The resulting heat
exchangers will be manufactured via a metallic additive process. Thermal-
hydraulic and durability tests will be conducted to validate
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
