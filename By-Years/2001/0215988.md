This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop novel DNA
polymerase reagents for use in current and developing DNA diagnostic procedures.
The approach is to develop thermophilic phage DNA replicases in place of the
currently used DNA repair enzymes. The feasibility of this approach was
demonstrated during Phase I research. This follow on Phase II project will
extend the methods used in Phase I to isolate additional activities,
characterize them and develop them as reagents for various amplification
platforms. The commercial applications of this project will be in a number of
markets that use molecular analysis of DNA. They include the areas of biomedical
research, medical testing, genetic identity testing, public health and
agriculture.
