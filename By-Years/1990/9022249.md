This investigation is a continuation of earlier work concerning the structure
and evolution of the large-scale solar magnetic fields and motions. The proposed
efforts will concentrate on understanding these structures and their effects on
the solar wind and terrestrial environment. Much of this research relies on
observations made at the Wilcox Solar Observatory, which this group has operated
for more than fifteen years. Several areas of focus include the interior
structure and dynamics of the sun via observations of surface motions and
helioseismic techniques; study of the relation between the development and
effects of solar activity and the large-scale solar magnetic field organization;
study of the three dimensional form of the heliospheric magnetic field and its
relation to the solar wind and the terrestrial environment. The goal of this
research is to understand the evolution of the solar activity cycle by
observations and analyses of interior and surface motions and magnetic fields.
