Nerve cells communicate with one another via chemical messengers
(neurotransmitters) which bind to specific receptor proteins on the cell
surface. Since many of these transmitters do not penetrate the cell their
message is carried by "second messenger" molecules generated in the interior of
the cell on signal from the outer surface receptor-neurotransmitter complex.
These second messengers are often G-proteins of which there have been a variety
identified. The primary aim of this research is to determine which specific
G-protein binds to which specific membrane receptor (on its interior aspect) to
form the physiologically functional unit. These studies will employ a detergent
to permeabilize the membrane to allow the entrance of purified G- proteins and
synthetic polypeptides that represent specific regions of the native G-protein.
The synthetic segments bind and inhibit inative G-protein binding to the
receptor structure. GTP associated with a photo-activated component that binds
to the G-protein and irreversibly activates the receptor complex in the presence
of the appropriate neurotransmitter will also be used to quantitate
neurotransmitter activation. The long-term goal of the research is to identify
the specificity of the neurotransmitter processes for specific cell and organ
behaviors that lead to our understanding of the molecular processes associated
with transmission and storage of information (learning and memory) in the whole
organisms.
