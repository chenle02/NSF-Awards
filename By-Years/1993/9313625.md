9313625 Silver This renewal award will complete processing of seismic, sidescan,
and other geophysical data collected on a cruise off New Guinea in 1992. In
addition to processing and analyzing the existing data set, the PI will do a
gravity survey on nearby parts of the island in order to determine if the
interpretations derived from the marine work are confirmed by the land data.
Students from Papua New Guinea and Australia will be included in the work. ***
