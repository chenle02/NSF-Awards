Consumers around the globe are becoming more aware of the risks of contamination
in water, whether it be freestanding or plumbed. As a result, there is growing
consumer demand for systems to treat water nearer the point-of-use. This push
for point-of-use water filtration is yielding a growing demand for systems that
are small, economical, and capable of supporting real-time demand at fairly low
volumes. Small scale point of use systems are marketed today to
backpackers/hikers, emergency response personnel, and humanitarian workers, and
to the general public as countertop filtration units. Increased filter
performance and the resultant reductions in size and cost would be significant
for many of these markets. Perhaps even more significant would be resistance to
clogging (filter fouling) or self-cleaning point-of-use systems which would
significantly lower the maintenance barrier to use. To improve on flow and
filter lifetime in water filtration, the team proposes a precision fabricated
membrane for backwash pre-filters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed carbon
nanotube template microfabricated (CNT-M) membranes will have a much higher pore
density and increased self-cleaning performance than commercially available
membrane filters allowing for reduced system size and cost and reduced
maintenance requirements. The CNT-M process results in a membrane with a planar
top surface and vertical uniform pore profiles. These pores facilitate high flow
rates and should have significantly improved backwash efficiency. Industrial
implementation of the carbon nanotube templated microfabrication (CNT-M) process
will pave the way for its implementation in other promising applications areas
including: high performance inertial microsensors, x-ray beam technology,
medical microdevices, and chromatographic separations media.
