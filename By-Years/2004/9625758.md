Learning occurs through many different mechanisms, each of which is better
suited to different students' learning styles. Optimal learning occurs when
teaching methods match learners' styles, and when multiple learning mechanisms
are employed. Experience is one of the most powerful learning mechanisms, and
has a higher memory retention rate than other forms of learning. Unfortunately,
not all students have equal opportunities to acquire that experience, and
certain experiences are not available to any students at any cost, due to
physical or safety limitations. For example, students are not allowed inside of
electronics manufacturing clean rooms or operating chemical reactors. At-risk
students in particular do not have equal opportunities for experiential
learning, and often have learning styles which do not match traditional teaching
methods. Virtual reality has the potential to deliver experiences which are not
accessible to students in the real world. Recent and continuing technological
advances are bringing VR within the reach of educational and student budgets.
However the knowledge base of how to effectively apply VR to technical education
must first be established. This project proposes to improve undergraduate
engineering education nationwide by producing: 1. A series of VR based
educational simulators for use in chemical engineering, and 2. A knowledge base
concerning the technical, representational, interfacial, implementational and
hardware issues surrounding the application of VR to technical education. A
major focus of this work will be to produce student affordable computer modules,
which will run on student affordable equipment, and to also support more
advanced equipment if the user has it available. A prototype module has already
been developed using Pentium based personal computers. Module distribution will
be conducted through the non-profit corporation CACHE, to chemical engineering
departments nationwide at minimal cost.
