This project initiates the first year of a five-year continuing award to
Florida Atlantic University to join with the University of Arkansas and the
University of Cincinnati in merging with Georgia Institute of Technology's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling. The
university has developed the company support to be added to the Center's
industry base. The research projects approved by the new consolidated Industry
Advisory Board are "Carton Design Intelligent Systems", "Container Inventory
Reduction in Distribution Systems", and "Modeling and Analysis of Printed
Circuit Board Manufacturing." The researchers are experts in their fields and
have the capability and facilities to participate in the new merged Center. The
Program Manager recommends Florida Atlantic University be awarded $50,000 for
the first year of a five-year continuing award. Near the end of each 12 month
period the Program Manager and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers
Division will review the progress of the center on a number of criteria,
including the following: (1) the extent to which the university-industry
interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to which the support
base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a robust research program is
developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend
support of the next period of this continuing grant.
