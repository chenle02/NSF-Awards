It is possible to analyze fossil shelled cephalopods in terms of external shell
morphology and hydromechanical characteristics, using microcomputer simulations
and principal components analysis. This approach will be combined with indexing
of internal sutural form, in order to (a) document the morphological history of
Upper Carboniferous ammonoids in terms of whole-shell and hydromechanical
characteristics; (b) determine whether there is a functional basis to existing
phylogenetic-based systematic schemes for Carboniferous ammonoids; (c) attempt
to determine the extent to which sutural form influences ammonoid hydrostatics,
and to track changes in sutural complexity against shell form and hydrostatics
through time, in an effort to evaluate the functional role of the suture and (d)
relate the evolutionary history and diversity of morphological and
hydromechanical characteristics of Upper Carboniferous ammonoids to existing
models of paleoecology and sea- level curves for this interval.
