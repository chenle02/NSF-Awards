Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;A common criticism of the teaching of
undergraduate engineering statistics is that it is too academic in focus,
excessively theoretical, and divorced from real problems that appear in
industry. The purpose of this project is to teach statistics using activity-
based learning. A one-semester lecture-based engineering statistics course is
being re-engineered through the adaptation of an activity-based engineering
statistics course currently offered at the Pennsylvania State University. The
proposed course is being structured to include laboratories and workshops
intermingled with activity-based lectures. The laboratory sessions are intended
to provide the student with an opportunity to become proficient in designing
experiments, collecting data, and analyzing problems using PC-based statistical
software. Workshops are designed to involve short lecture segments mixed with
team-based problem-solving activities and software tutorials. The development of
the laboratory and workshop activities includes materials based upon the
research and consulting activities of the investigators. Different engineering
laboratories are being utilized for these activities. Working through a diverse
set of engineering problems, the student are expected gain the confidence to
apply statistical techniques to new and different situations and realize the
role of statistics in engineering design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantitative and
qualitative tools are being employed to assess and evaluate this project and its
components at different times throughout the two-year project duration.
Dissemination plan involves conference presentations, journal articles, course
workbooks, and a project web site.&lt;br/&gt;
