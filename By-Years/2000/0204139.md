Safety analysis is essential for high-assurance software systems.
&lt;br/&gt;Safety analysis identifies the hazards, derives the software
safety&lt;br/&gt;requirements to eliminate or control these hazards, and ensures
that the design&lt;br/&gt;and implementation incorporate those safeguards. A
product line is a&lt;br/&gt;set of products that share a common set of features
and a related market or&lt;br/&gt;mission.Currently, high-assurance product
lines are being built without the&lt;br/&gt;tools or conceptual framework
necessary to perform effective safety analyses. &lt;br/&gt;This research
addresses the question of how safety analysis can&lt;br/&gt;become a reusable
asset of a product line by developing a framework and asuite of techniques for
the safety analysis of critical product lines. Anticipated benefits of the
research include extending safety analyses toproduct lines, providing a
framework for reuse of safety analyses within a product line, deriving formally
specified limits on reuse of product-line safety analysis, and enabling safer
product-line systems at lower cost and reduced schedules. The results will be
empirically evaluated by application in&lt;br/&gt;industrial case studies. This
project will expand the opportunities available to&lt;br/&gt;student researchers
to participate in development of safety-analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques for
product lines.&lt;br/&gt;
