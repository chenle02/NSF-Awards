This project is directed at understanding the mechanisms of postnatal
development of neural processing of visual information from the retina through
the thalamus and the structural development of retinal ganglion cells. The
specific objectives are i) to evaluate the neurophysiological transfer function
of visual signals from the retina to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGNd) in kitten in vivo and, ii) to describe and model the rules that control
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) shape, morphological class and spatial distribution
in vitro. In the first series of experiments, electrophysiological recordings of
manifestation of the dominant RGC drive to an LGNd neuron (the S- potential)
will be extracellularly recorded concomitantly with the LGNd neurons' action
potentials in response to visual stimulit which objectively evaluate the
neuronal pairs' contrast sensitivity function. This experiment will directly
evaluate the hypothesis of increased functional convergence in the neonatal X-
cell pathway (and functioal degradation of spatial processing). In the second
series of experiments, identified postnatal kitten RGCs are grown in cell
culture for several weeks. Individual neurons and ensembles are monitored in
real-time with digitization of time-lapsed images. Development of cellular
morphology and establishment of neuronal territories are analyzed with the
mathematical measure of fractal sets - the Hausdorff measure.
