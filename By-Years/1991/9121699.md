In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor James Reilly of Indiana University will use high resolution overtone
spectroscopy to study highly vibrationally excited polyatomic molecules seeded
in supersonic expansions. He will search for high resolution structure
indicative of weak vibrational mode couplings in selected compounds as well as
look at molecules with broad, structureless room temperature spectra. The goal
is to begin to understand vibrational mode mixing and dynamics in highly excited
molecules. %%% When excess energy is deposited into vibrational modes of
polyatomic molecules, that is, those molecules composed of several atoms, that
energy can dissipate internally by redistributing among the other vibrations in
the molecule, or it may be given up to other atoms or molecules with which the
excited molecule collides. This project aims at studying the ways in which such
excess vibrational energy flows out of the initially excited parts of a
molecule. Such information is important to scientists interested in
understanding how the excess energy released in chemical reactions can affect
the course of these reactions.
