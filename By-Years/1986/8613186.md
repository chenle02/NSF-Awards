In this project the investigators will take reproductive histories from men and
women of an Indian society in Paraguay, in order to compare their demography
with that of other hunter- gatherer (foraging) groups. The PI's hope to get data
on the births and deaths in the past few years and access local records on
births and deaths since 1971. They will also observe work patterns and social
relationships among tribal members. The PI's will analyze the age-sex structure
of the population, the causes and rates of mortality, women's fertility, men's
fertility, and population growth rates. They will test hypotheses about
reproductive tradeoffs among the tribesmen, including the role of food sharing,
the age at first marriage for both sexes, the interbirth interval, the sex ratio
of offspring, step-parenting, promiscuity and spouse-sharing. They will also
analyse the causes and consequences of infanticide and homicide in the
population. This research will contribute to the growing body of data on modern
foraging peoples and is urgent because of the rapid disappearance of the
foraging way of life. Only by collecting such data while it is still available
can scientists construct and test models about the demographic parameters that
characterized our ancestors until very recently.
