ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0327601&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current estimates
of the magnitude of the exchange of ozone between the atmosphere and surface
ocean are highly equivocal. To improve upon this uncertainty, scientists from
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will make eddy correlation flux measurements
of ozone at the air-sea interaction tower (ASIT) located near the Martha's
Vineyard Coastal Observatory. These measurements should produce significantly
improved estimates of ozone fluxes and deposition velocities. Results from this
project are expected to improve our ability to model ozone deposition and
transport in coastal and open-ocean regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
