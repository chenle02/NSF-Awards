Through programs (including small group conversations, citizen conferences, and
public forums) an interactive exhibition, and two research studies that address
issues that are fundamental to establishing museums as places of public dialogue
and deliberation, this project will engage the general public, policymakers, and
caregivers in deliberations around the latest early childhood development (ECD)
research. It will also build on an increased understanding of the importance of
ECD to expand civic engagement around this urgent social issue. The overall goal
of the project is to help its audiences understand child development, how
environment and experiences impact development, and what we as a society can do
to support our youngest citizens. Specifically, audiences will explore: How the
brain develops from birth until kindergarten (or age five); how a childs
environment and experiences sculpt the brain, with some experiences enhancing
the child's self-control and learning, and other experiences that actually
impede development; and what the project audiences can do to ensure that all
children have a strong foundation to learn and thrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
