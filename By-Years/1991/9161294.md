The purpose of this research is a study on the needs of disabled people and
their ability to use a computer to learn math, science, and engineering in
schools. The Human Performance Model will be used to study the degree to which
disabled and able- bodied students benefit from using alternative, membrane
computer keyboards with custom overlays. The goal is to determine whether one
can isolate the factors that help disabled people use computers with less error,
greater speed, and greater ease.
