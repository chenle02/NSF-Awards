This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Canisius College for the repair and
renovation of the Health Science Building which houses the research and research
training activities of the Biology Department. This building was constructed in
1924 and last renovated in 1969. The ARFMP grant of $664,513 and $664,513
provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research
and research training facilities. This project will address the need to improve
the current research infrastructure by upgrading all existing laboratories with
basic bench services, emergency power, and fume hoods; by modifying the animal
unit to insure compliance with appropriate state and federal regulations; and by
renovating the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. This
award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of biological research and for the training of
quality undergraduate students. The renovation is expected to enhance the
continuing trend of the last decade at Canisius College of increasing
undergraduate participation in research as part of their educational process.
The emphasis on time spent doing research at Canisius which has had a major
impact in directing students' interests toward careers in science.
