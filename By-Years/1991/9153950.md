The Mathematicians and Education Reform Network (MER), established under a
previous NSF grant, will provide a program to encourage and promote deeper
involvement of mathematicians in education reform in grades K-14. Network
activities include national workshops, newsletters, a journal, programs and
presentations at national mathematics meetings, maintaining a resource
collection of exemplary materials, and pilot investigative studies. Close
cooperation and coordination with professional mathematical societies is to be
maintained and a long range plan developed to integrate MER activities within
the structure of the professional organizations. Cost sharing is 62.5% of the
amount contributed by NSF.
