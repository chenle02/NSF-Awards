In interpreting metamorphic rocks, porosity is one of the textural elements
which petrologists have largely ignored, even though mineral aggregate porosity
textures can reveal important clues concerning the identity and
interconnectivity of the metamorphic pore fluids. The geometry of the mineral
grain boundaries in natural rocks will be observed. A series of experiments will
also be run that will metamorphose rocks. These experimentally-metamorphosed
rocks will be analyzed for total porosity, porosity distribution, and dihedral
angle geometry using TEM, SEM and BSEM. Measured dehedral angles will be
correlated for differnet fluid chemistries and run durations and compared to
those for the naturally-metamorphosed samples. In samples treated at low
temperatures with H2O-NaCl, H2O-CaCl2 or H2O-FeCl3, the electron microprobe will
be used to measure the Na, Ca, Fe and Cl distributions across the samples to
document ionic, and hence, fluid, transport rates into the samples. These
measurements will reveal whether fluids of different chemical composition will
infiltrate rocks and form interconnected networks of fluid-permeated channels at
metamorphic conditions. Such experiments will have significant implications for
the interpretation of metamorphosing crustal regions and the potential for fine
scale fluid percolation through metamorphic terrains.
