Abstract

Award: DMS-1007168 Principal Investigator: Kevin J. Costello

The proposed research is concerned with a new approach to perturbative quantum
field theory, based on the concept of a actorization algebra. Factorization
algebras are rich algebraic objects which simultaneously generalize the notion
of E-n algebra and that of chiral algebra. The aim of this proposal is to show
that the techniques of perturbative renormalization allow one to construct
factorization algebras starting from a Lagrangian defining a physical system.
Several applications of this approach to quantum field theory are also being
proposed, including one related to elliptic cohomology and the Witten genus.

Quantum field theory is a fundamental tool in theoretical hysics, and underpins
physicists current understanding of the behaviour of elementary particles.
Quantum field theory has additionally had a great influence on the development
of mathematics. The aim of this research proposal is to provide mathematical
foundations for quantum field theory, and to apply these foundations to problems
in geometry related to physics.
