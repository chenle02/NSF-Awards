Compilation technology has contributed to the success of computational science
by allowing users to achieve high program performance without worrying
excessively about details of the underlying hardware architecture. Most compiler
optimizations focus on improving computation efficiency, but the growing
disparity between processor and memory speeds has made exploiting reuse of
registers and cache important as well. This project will explore techniques for
improving program performance by modifying the data layout in a program to
improving spatial locality and avoid adverse memory effects such as conflict
misses and false sharing. Target optimizations include modifying the base
addresses of variables, changing fields offsets within structures, group-and-
transpose of related data, padding, transposing, and reindexing array
dimensions. The main goal of this project is to develop heuristics for guiding
data layout optimizations, both individually and as part of an overall
optimization strategy which includes computation transformations. To evaluate
the impact on scientific applications, optimizations will be implemented as
passes in the Stanford SUIF compiler and tested on benchmark suites such as
Perfect, NAS, and SPEC for both scalar and parallel architectures.
