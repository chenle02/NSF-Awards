The objectives of the proposed work are to (i) study frequency selective,
fading communications channels and develop appropriate models to describe the
channel's time variations, (ii) derive novel blind and decision feedback
algorithms which explicitly take into account the time varying nature of the
channel and (iii) develop the analytical tools to assess the applicability of
different models under different conditions. Each time-varying tap coefficient
of a frequency selective, fading channel is typically modeled as a random
processes with low-pass power spectra. However, traditional adaptive techniques
typically do not exploit this information. In the proposed work, Kalman
filtering methods are derived to track the channel by employing a multichannel
autoregressive description of the time-varying taps in a decision-feedback
equalization framework. Fitting a model to the variations of the channel's taps
is a challenging task because the tap coefficients are not observed directly. A
linear method is proposed to estimate the channel's spectral characteristics
from input/output data, and consistency is shown. A different emerging framework
will also be studied, where each time-varying tap coefficient is described (with
respect to time) as a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions.
Examples of such channels include periodically varying ones, where each
multipath component exhibits a different Doppler shift or channels locally
modeled by a truncated Taylor Series. It is shown that the estimation of the
expansion parameters is equivalent to estimating the parameters of an FIR
Single-Input-Many-Output (SIMO) system. By exploiting this equivalence, a number
of different blind subspace methods are applicable, which h ave been originally
developed in the context of time-invariant SIMO systems. Identifiability and
performance issues will be investigated, as well as the effects of diversity
combining, when multiple receiving antennas are available.
