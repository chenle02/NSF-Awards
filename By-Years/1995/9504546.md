9504546 Wheat Cold sea water circulates deep into the ocean crust, is heated,
exchanges chemical constituents with the crust, and then emerges as heated
hydrothermal water. This process has a profound effect on the composition of the
ocean crust and sea water. Presently much attention is focused on the
hydrothermal water exiting from hot vents at ridge crests, but a large
proportion of the water exits through sediments on the ridge flanks. The
proponents argue that the physical, chemical, and mineralogical characteristics
of the ridge flank environment has been characterized much better than the ridge
crest environment because the flanks are much more accessible by drilling than
ridge crests. The research plan is to understand the fluid flow up from basalt
basement through the sediment by porous flow and diffusion, and to determine
what are the chemical changes in the fluid and the chemical and mineralogical
changes in the sediments. This will be done as a pilot study with existing
computer models that will generate chemical profiles based on boundary
conditions of temperature, fluid flow, and initial physical conditions of the
sediment. Results will be compared to chemical profiles found in four sedimented
areas. ***
