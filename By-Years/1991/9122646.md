Embryology and developmental biology are increasingly prominent in modern
evolutionary biology. Many advocates of the importance of development argue that
the processes of organic growth produce constraints on adaptive evolution. This
approach contrasts with "adaptationism," a feature of mainstream neo-Darwinian
evolutionary biology that emphasizes natural selection and the particular
adaptations-to-environment it produces. Adaptationism is said by its critics to
ignore the structural processes of development which are common to large groups
of organisms and which produce non-adaptational similarities. Dr. Amundson is
examining the methodological basis of the adaptation- versus-constraint debates
from an historical perspective. A remarkably similar debate occurred among pre-
Darwinian British biologists, between natural theologians and continental style
morphologists and comparative anatomists. Comparisons between the two debates
suggest that the contrast between adaptational and structural biological
explanation is not a special feature of evolutionary biology at all. The
methodological similarities will contribute to a better understanding of the
current debates and a better understanding of the diverse explanatory strategies
used in biological science.
