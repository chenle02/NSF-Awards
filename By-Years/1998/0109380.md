TRANSFORMATION FIELD ANALYSIS

Abstract

The Transformation Field Analysis (TFA) is a new method for hierarchical
modeling of many interacting physical processes in heterogeneous material
systems. The research, will provide the following new theoretical results and
applications of the TFA: (a) A rate form of the influence functions and
governing equations, for applications involving changes in thermoelastic moduli
of the phases. (b) Formulation of new shape functions for refinement of local
inelastic deformation fields; and (c): Use of unit cell models in the context of
the TFA, for refined analysis of local deformation and damage processes.
