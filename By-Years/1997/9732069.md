This REU program in the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (MCS)
at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) is modeled after the department's
successful Field Session program. The REU summer program will involve 6 students
including 2 CSM students and 4 students from other universities. The students
will work on projects of interest in the department and the university. The
projects involve not only technical mathematical and/or computer science skills,
but also communication and management skills.

The projects serve as an introduction to some of the research that is being
conducted in the department. We hope that some of the student participants will
be sufficiently intrigued so that they will seriously consider at least a
Master's degree in our department. The projects are in the areas of numerical
analysis, applied mathematics, software development, wavelets, fuzzy methods,
pattern recognition, visual perception, inverse problems, stochastic methods,
approximation theory, linear algebra, noise reduction, data compression, and
dynamical systems. Some local companies have expressed interest in the proposed
research projects. We will solicit the opinions of the companies in defining the
projects more precisely.
