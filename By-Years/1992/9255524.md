Three week-long workshops on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) will focus on the
hands-on use of a 300 MHz instrument and the interpretation of the data
obtained. Each workshop will represent a different level of sophistication in
its exposure to NMR spectroscopy. The first workshop, "Introduction to NMR", is
designed for participants coming from institutions lacking NMR instrumentation
or having no previous training in this level of NMR. The second workshop,
"Fourier Transform and Multinuclear NMR", and the third workshop, "Advanced
Pulse Sequences and Two-Dimensional NMR", are designed for participants with
some background in NMR. The teaching strategy will include lecture, computer
simulation, instrument use, and data analysis, and the instructors for the
course will be Scott Hill and Richard Cornelius. Follow-up sessions for
participants will be held in the Fall of 1993 and May of 1994.
