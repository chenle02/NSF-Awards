The PI will acquire an automated digital storage system to improve the
functionality and maintenance of the University of Texas Seismic Data Manage
System and the underlying archive. The project will also address significant
inefficiencies in seismic reflection by using the ame storage system to manage
large input data sets and intermediate outputs.
