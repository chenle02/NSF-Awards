This is a proposal for a multiparameter laser scanning confocal microscope
system. The microscope system consists of a detachable confocal laser scanning
unit with multi-line argon laser, dichroic beam splitter, and dual photon-
counting detectors; upright and inverted microscopes with interchangeable
optics; intensified CCD video camera for selecting and focusing fields with
minimal photobleaching and photodamage; and on-stage environmental controllers.
The microscope system will be used to examine tissues of living animals, single
living cells, fixed cells, and tissue sections which have been labeled with
multiple fluorescent probes. Primary uses will be determination of the 3-
dimensional distribution of specific antigens in cells, visualization of complex
neural networks, determination of lipid order and topography of cell membranes,
and quantitation in 3- dimensions of ions (e.g., Ca and H+) and organelles
(e.g., mitochondria, lysosomes, nuclear chronmatin) within living cells. The
equipment will be utilized by 17 investigators on independent projects. Housed
in the productive environment of the Video Microscopy Facility of the
Laboratories for Cell Biology, the confocal microscope system will complement
existing state-of-the- art instrumentation and will substantially extend our
ongoing efforts applying digitized optical microscopy to problems of biology.
