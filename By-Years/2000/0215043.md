Keshab K. Parhi&lt;br/&gt;Institue of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineers,
Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE 2002 Workshop on Signal Processing Systems
(SIPS02) will be held at the Catamaran Resort Hotel from October 16-18, 2002.
SIPS02 focuses on topics at the convergence of signal processing theory, VLSI
architectures, and integrated circuit implementation of multimedia
communications. The conference theme this year reflects the critical role played
by signal processing microsystems in the deployment of next&lt;br/&gt;generation
communications infrastructure including wireless, optical and wireline systems.
SIPS02 is requesting the National Science Foundation to provide a travel grant
to provide travel funds to U.S. students who would otherwise not be able to
attend this workshop.
