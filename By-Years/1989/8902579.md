Under a previous NSF Grant (NO. 8702066), it was demonstrated that the discrete
self-trapping (DST) equation is remarkably sinple to quantize, and this property
has been used to characterize the quantum structure of local modes and of chaos.
In this project Professor Scott will (i) use the DST equation to study the
quantum behavior of a damped driven system, and (ii) use a slighlty modified DST
equation to study the quantum structure of self-focusing ("blow-up"). This work
has applications to optical spectroscopy and quantum chemistry.
