Research focuses on developing Brownian approximations of mathematically
intractable dynamic scheduling (or resource allocation) problems in order to
develop effective scheduling policies for a variety of production systems. These
systems include multiclass, multistation closed queueing networks (which are
perhaps the most prominent mathematical models of manufacturing, computer, and
communication systems), make-to-stock queueing systems (that is,
production/inventory systems, where the production system is modeled as a
queueing system) with random yields and substitutable demands (motivated by
semiconductor manufacturing), and multiechelon repairable inventory systems.//
