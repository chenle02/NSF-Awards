This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Barry K. Carpenter at Cornell University who will assess the circumstances under
which dynamics play a role in the outcome of a reaction. Specifically designed
molecules will be synthesized for the study of the fundamentals of
intramolecular energy transfer, which will test the `statistical' TST and RRKM
models. Dynamically controlled reactions in supercritical fluids will be studied
in order to analyze the components of solvent effects on molecular dynamics. A
vector model for intramolecular dynamics will be evaluated and a new molecular
dynamics-based model will be development. %%% In this project Professor Barry K.
Carpenter will assess the circumstances under which dynamics play a role in the
outcome of a reaction, which is highly significant subject to a large area of
chemistry. Classical theories that are half a century old will be tested with
carefully designed experiments. The results may impinge upon vast areas of
chemical dynamics theory and may change the way we think about reaction dynamics
in the future.
