abstract ESI 9554186 Patricia Campbell Institution: University of Maryland at
College Park with subcontract to Baltimore City Schools Mathematics: Application
and Reasoning Skills (MARS) is a 4-year Local Systemic Change project at
$5,999,000 to enhance all of the approximately 2300 K-5 teachers of mathematics
in the Baltimore City Schools. The enhancement is aligned with national
standards and the Maryland State Outcomes in Mathematics. It is focused on
adult-level mathematics content, instructional methods to promote student
understanding and problem solving, research on children's learning of critical
mathematics constructs, mathematics curriculum standards, performance
assessment, strategies to increase math achievement and preparation of urban
students, and community resources for continuing mathematics education. Cohorts
of schools will participate in two-year enhancement cycles. All teachers in a
building will receive at least 100 hours of enhancement starting with a 14-day
summer institute which includes work with students in a summer program. Teachers
will be required to complete 15 hours of professional development during the
first year of implementation and an additional 13 hours in the second year of
implementation. Three lead teachers, selected from within the building, will
receive 60 hours of advanced leadership training and support during the year
prior to that building faculty's first summer. A cadre of exemplary teachers
will be released from the classroom for up to six years to be prepared and to
serve as project resource teachers. There will be one resource teacher for every
three schools to act as peer coach, program monitor, teacher consultant and give
day-to-day support in that school. Principals will participate in quarterly
meetings during this period. MARS establishes faculty partnerships across higher
education facilities in the City of Baltimore to support the co-development of
continuing mathematics education courses addressing mathematics content,
mathematics pedagogy, and the integration of mathematics and science. There is
collaboration with the Baltimore USI project. Cost-sharing is reported at
$1,587,819 or 26% of the NSF support.
