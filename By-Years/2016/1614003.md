This award provides partial support to offset registration fees for students and
post-docs to attend the 16th International Conference on Strangeness in Quark
Matter (SQM2016) to be held on June 27-July 1, 2016 at Berkeley, California. The
scientific program of the conference will focus on strangeness and heavy quark
production in nuclear collisions; Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure;
strangeness in astrophysics; and open questions and new development.
Participation of students and post-docs at this meeting will provide them with
opportunities for interaction across the scientific community.
