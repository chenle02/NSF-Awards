1. Applications of Intersection Homology: A study will be made of the torsion-
linking pairing which exists on the intersection homology peripheral group of a
complex analytic variety, and, in particular, its relationship with the
multiplicity of the characteristic variety will be studied. Piecewise linear
differential forms with singularities will be constructed for which the L2 forms
compute the intersection homology, on any simplicial complex which can be (P.L)
stratified with even-codimension strata. Hecke correspondences which induce
homomorphisms on intersection homology will be studied, and their Lefschetz
numbers will be calculated using geometric techniques. 2. Applications of
Stratified Morse Theory: N. Spaltenstein's conjecture relating the intersection
homology of nilpotent varieties and the Poincare polynomial of the complement of
certain arrangements of hyperplanes will be investigated using the geometric
techniques of stratified Morse theory.
