The purpose of this project is to provide support for noted scholars in the
basic social science disciplines to participate in a series of conferences and
workshops aimed at developing a research agenda for addressing problems related
to agriculture and rural life. Major support for the overall project, known as
the Social Science Agricultural Agenda Project, is from a variety of other
funding sources. The motivation for this larger effort is a variety of complex
issues and pressing needs confronting U.S. agriculture and rural America. In
many cases, farming is not a viable economic enterprise, and the tax payers and
a variety of competing interests have extensive financial stakes in an elaborate
and expensive price support and production control system that has evolved over
the years. At the same time, there is a growing concern about the quality of
food and the impact of food production on the environment. Other issues of
importance include: (1) the impact of international trade and monetary policy on
the agricultural sector, (2) the effect of third world development on American
agriculture, and (3) domestic and international nutrition and world hunger.
