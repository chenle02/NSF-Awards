9412971 Poeppelmeier The primary focus of this research is to develop the
concept of salt imbibition for the purpose of generating new synthetic methods
and chemical reactions that lead to novel precursors for high surface area mixed
metal oxides that are catalytically active. An emphasis will be on transforming
the precursors at low temperatures to mixed metal oxides, characterizing the
solid-state products, and studying the nature of acidic and basic sites at the
surface and their role on surface reactivity. %%% The synthesis and
characterization of new materials is one of the major forces in science that
causes change and leads to advances in technology. Solid-state chemical
approaches to generating novel catalytic materials such as the high surface area
metal oxides that are the subject of this research are offering new applications
in emerging areas of heterogeneous catalysis.
