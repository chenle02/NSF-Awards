This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor John I. Brauman at Stanford University. The goal of the research is to
understand the relationship between structure and reactivity of ions and highly
reactive intermediates derived from moderate-sized organic and inorganic
molecules in the gas phase. Thermodynamics, reaction dynamics, electron
photodetachment spectroscopy, infrared multiple photon induced reactions, and
optical photochemistry will be involved in this study. Reaction types to be
studied include bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions, acyl transfer
reactions, and proton transfer reactions. Acidities of hydrocarbons, electron
affinities, and energetics of complex ions such as alkoxide/HF adducts will be
determined. This research will further develop an understanding of the intrinsic
chemistry, and its relation to structure, of highly reactive ions and reactive
intermediates when they are removed from stabilizing environments such as
solution or crystals.
