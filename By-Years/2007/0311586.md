Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in
computer technology opened new horizons in teaching Computer Aided Design (CAD)
and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) technologies. The objective of the
project is to provide advanced instruction and laboratory practices in the areas
of CAD/CAM through challenging laboratory assignments and industrial projects
that are integrated into the curriculum. This project adapts and implements
rapid prototyping experiences and educational practices following successful
similar models at various engineering schools to enhance pedagogy in
Manufacturing and Industrial Technology core design and manufacturing
curriculum. Enhanced rapid prototyping capabilities enable the students to build
physical models directly from CAD data, where the prototype communicates
important information about parts, including engineering data such as fit and
limited functional testing, labeling, highlighting, and appearance simulation.
The rapid prototyping equipment is used in junior and senior level courses in
manufacturing engineering technology, including the senior capstone course, and
complements the existing CNC and CAD equipment and software.&lt;br/&gt;
