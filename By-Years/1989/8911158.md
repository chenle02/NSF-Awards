This proposal will promote the collaboration of research and enhance the
research opportunities of faculty, particularly minorities and women, at the two
major research universities and the other universities in the state of North
Carolina, which hold NSF grants. This project may be used as a model for
university systems in other states, and has the potential for long-term pay-offs
to the Nation's research efforts.
