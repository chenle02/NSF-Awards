9320339 Al-Sheikhly This is an award to support research, the objectives of
which are to investigate the mechanisms for destruction of potentially toxic and
hazardous organic materials in aqueous solution using ionizing radiation
produced by short pulses of energized electrons. The research includes a
consideration of using selected additives for enhancing the effectiveness of
radiation. Target organic compounds to be studied include representative
halogenated and non-halogenated olefin and aromatic compounds. Dose rates to be
studied range from those characteristic of industrial gamma radiation sources to
those obtained with electron accelerators used in industrial radiation
processing. Radiation processing of contaminated water, solids and slurries
represents a potentially important practical way to address environmental
problems associated with the presence of toxic or hazardous substances in water
and soil. Results of this project are expected to provide additional insights
into the potential uses of ionizing radiation for remediation of environmental
resources contaminated with hazardous organic substances and are likely to be
utilized in the engineering design of processes and systems for remediation of
contaminated environmental resources of soil and water resources.
