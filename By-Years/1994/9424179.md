Summer undergraduate research opportunities in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Wellesley College, an undergraduate college for women, will be
offered for three summers. Participants will be selected from Biology,
Biological Chemistry or Psychobiology majors who have serious purpose and
definite interest in independent work, have sufficient course preparation and
have shown ability to think imaginatively and independently. Participants will
be selected by the project director and faculty committee after evaluation of
application forms designed to recruit the most qualified student. The student
will participate in all aspects of the investigation, from pursuing a literature
review to carrying out experimental procedures and observations, continuing to
analysis of data and determination of conclusions. The student will formally and
informally discuss the work with her advisor, and also will prepare discussions
with all participants, both student and faculty, for weekly group seminars. This
will encourage both experience with oral presentations and exposure to
suggestions and criticism of other researchers. A poster session will end the
summer's work. Throughout the summer, seminars and workshops will be presented
by women scientists in graduate school and in research careers; field trips to
biotechnology and chemical companies will be taken. An ethics component will be
shared with REU students from Boston University, and joint seminars and field
trips have been planned with this regional institution and with the University
of Massachusetts Boston campus.
