This award furnishes travel support for participants in the regional workshop on
Semiclassical Approximation and Vacuum Energy, held in January 2005 at Texas
A&amp;M University as part of a special year in Mathematical Physics. Topics of
the workshop include modeling of vacuum energy in nanodevices and application of
quantum graph theory to microstructures and optical materials. This meeting
provides an opportunity to increase interdisciplinary collaboration of U.S.
researchers in fundamental questions of mathematical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research collaboration between mathematicians and
physicists is increasingly important in view of recent advances in the
development of nanoscale devices, novel optical materials, and Bose-Einstein
condensates. This workshop provides an opportunity for informal interaction
between leading experts and junior researchers in important related areas of
mathematical physics. The workshop, in conjunction with Special Year
introductory programs, will provide a particularly valuable opportunity for
graduate students to broaden their understanding of these topics and to learn
about open problems in the field.&lt;br/&gt;
