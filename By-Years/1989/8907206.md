The collections in the Museum of Geology of the South Dakota School of Mines
(roughly 20,000 specimens, mostly fossil vertebrates) is one of the best
representations of the richly fossiliferous terrains nearby. New building space
has been allocated to the collection, providing for many years of expansion. Dr.
James Martin, curator of the collections, proposes a program of reorganization
and improvement, including purchase of steel storage cabinets, leading to
eventual computerization of the collection catalog. The collection is actively
used for research, public exhibit, and education. The proposed collection
improvement program will greatly improve the long-term use of these important
fossils. Visiting researchers will have greater access to specimens, and new
research collections will be made available more rapidly than was previously
possible. The Museum's collections have the potential to become the nucleus for
regional research in vertebrate paleontology, and the proposed facility
improvement will promote this potential.
