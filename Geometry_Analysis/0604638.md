Abstract

Award: DMS-0604638 Principal Investigator: Wenxiong Chen

The principal investigator will work on a series of nonlinear partial
differential equations, integral equations and systems, as well as other
nonlinear problems. Most of the problems arise from differential or convex
geometry, such as the semi-linear elliptic equations from prescribing Gaussian
and scalar curvature and the Monge-Ampere equations from the well-known Lp-
Minkowski problem.

According to Einstein, the Universe we lived in is a curved space, in which
gravity is realized as a distortion or bending of space-time in the neighborhood
of a massive object and this change of shape is measured by curvature. One of
these projects is focused on understanding when a given function can become a
curvature. This is a challenging problem in global analysis and has interesting
consequences in Riemannian Geometry. The other of the PI's major projects, the
Lp Minkowski problem, is the central question of the Brunn-Minkowski Theory,
which is the very core of Convex Geometric Analysis. Results in this area have
been applied to numerous disciplines, including stereology, stochastic geometry,
integral geometry, number theory, combinatorics, probability, statistics, and
information theory. The nonlinear partial differential equations and integral
equations and systems studied in this project also have various applications in
physics, chemistry, and biology. One example is a modeling of chemical reaction
in rivers or in blood streams, which would provide useful information in
controlling pollution in rivers.
