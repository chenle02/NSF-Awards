9730133 Leahy This project continues research begun under an earlier NSF grant
on the macroeconomic implications of microeconomic frictions. The dynamics of
variables such as prices, employment, investment, and consumption represent the
core of business cycle analysis. In each case the smoothness of the aggregates
masks the lumpy nature of the individual decisions that underlie them. Much
progress has been made in the past decade in understanding the relationship
between individual and aggregate dynamics in these markets. The main weakness is
the lack of appreciation for equilibrium interactions in these settings. This
project addresses this omission. The project consists of theoretical and
empirical components. The theoretical contribution consists of a method of
constructing equilibria in a model with lumpy adjustment. Equilibrium in these
settings is complicated by the fact that the evolution of aggregates usually
depends on the entire distribution of individual states. The approach in this
project is to make natural approximations to the distributional dynamics that
retain the essential economic interactions while making the construction of
equilibria tractable. The empirical component is twofold. The first task is to
test the validity of the approximation. The second task is to match the
responses predicted by the model with those evident in the data. ??
