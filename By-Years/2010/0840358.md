This workshop brings together topics of robotics and creativity in the context
of the premier artificial intelligence conference in the United States. The
annual AAAI Conference is a venue that brings together American roboticists and
AI experts. For over a decade-and-a-half, the AAAI has held the Robotics
Workshop and Exhibition as part of the overall Conference. This established
venue provides a unique opportunity for the community to formulate roadmaps that
leverage and apply America?s strengths in artificial intelligence to robotics.
The 2008 AAAI Robotics Exhibition and Workshop (Chicago July 13-17, 2008)
emphasizes multi-disciplinary research in the area of ?Robotics and Creativity?,
which will provide novel opportunities to establish new paradigms merging AI and
robotics. The workshop will emphasize research in which robots display
creativity as well as cases where creativity is combined with design and
engineering to stimulate robotics research at a variety of educational levels. A
focus on creativity can lead to new paradigms for robotics research. A tangible
output of the workshop is a White Paper describing a research roadmap for the
community.
