9353084 HANCOCK The project proposes to build on the success of the Tabletop, a
computer-based data tool which provides dynamic visual representations for
organizing, exploring and analyzing data. A Tabletop Jr. version, for grades 4
through 8, will be used as the basis for training teacher leaders who will use
the software in their own classrooms. The study of the pilot group will assist
in improving the draft version of the software and in disseminating information
and skills about its use among a second tier of teachers. A network (given the
name, "Multilog") will facilitate communication and provide support among all
participants in the process. The anticipated outcomes include a marketable
product (Tabletop Jr.), a core group of 235 trained teacher leaders who will, in
turn, influence many more teachers in a continuing dissemination process. ***
