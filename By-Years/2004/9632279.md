9632279 Wu This research project addresses film growth mechanisms in fast
temperature ramping Hg-vapor annealing(FTRA) of Hg-based cuprate(HgBaCaCuO)
superconductor films. The film growth mechanism in the FTRA process will be
studied by correlating processing parameters to the sample physical properties
including phase purity, film/substrate interface structure and surface
morphology, Tc, Jc, and other superconducting characteristics. Expectations are
that the FTRA technique can minimize problems caused by the high volatility of
the Hg-compounds involved, formation of CaHgO2, and chemical reactions at the
film/substrate interface. Chemical-doping-assisted growth of Hg-based cuprate
films using Na, Tl, or Re as the dopant will also be investigated to achieve
high-purity epitaxial Hg-1223 thin films. Rare-earth garnets and LaAlO3 will be
used as substrates in the fabrication of large-area Hg-based cuprate wafers. %%%
The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials
chemistry/physics and materials processing studies with advanced
characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a
topical area of high scientific value and potential technological benefits. The
research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
level to several aspects of advanced microwave and microelectronic devices. The
knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to
contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices by
providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
improved materials, and materials processing routes. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
