With the high performance liquid chromatograph and gas chromatograph procured
through this project, undergraduates in this Department are integrating theory
and practical experience through applying the techniques of separation
technology across a wide range of biologically important classes of chemicals.
Naturally occurring or synthetic substances in the environment are discussed and
are being identified or quantitated by laboratory procedures that are presented
in a broad spectrum of courses. Providing hands-on laboratory experience brings
a depth of understanding of modern Cellular/Molecular Biology and Biochemistry
that cannot be conveyed through lectures alone.
