This Presidential Young Investigator grant involves the study of complex fluids
and mesoscopic systems. In particular research will be conducted in three
general areas. First, on equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of
crystalline liquids, studies will be made on the role of fluctuations in the
vicinity of flow-induced non-equilibrium critical points; on the spectrum and
properties of interfacial excitations; and on the effects of fluctuations in
thin films of pre-nematic fluids. Second, in the area of novel quantum effects
in mesoscopic systems, studies will be made on geometrically-induced persistent
currents in metallic rings and extensions to quantized fields including photon
and phonon currents. Finally, Josephson effects in discs and other topologies
will be studied. %%% This Presidential Young Investigator award will involve
research on topics of current interest in condensed matter physics. Studies will
be made of the properties of liquid crystals - a state of matter intermediate
between a solid and a liquid. In particular, the effects of fluctuations on the
properties of the liquid crystal as it changes from one phase to another will be
studied. Research will also be conducted in the area of mesoscopic physics which
is a region intermediate between those in which quantum mechanics applies and in
which classical physics applies. This is a region which is becoming accessible
as devices become smaller.
