Electrical Engineering (55)- In the past decade the field of wireless
communications has come into its own and is posed to become a ubiquitous
technology with the recent developments of 3G cellular, wireless network and
wireless sensor systems. As such, today's graduating electrical engineers need
marketable skills that are typically not developed in undergraduate curricula.
This project addresses this stated need through a significant enhancement of the
signals and communications curriculum in the Electrical and Computer Engineering
Department (ECE) at the University of Vermont (UVM). The emphasis of this
curriculum enhancement lies in the inclusion of hands-on experience in four
theory-based, undergraduate courses in the interdisciplinary area of wireless
sensor systems. These curriculum changes are supported by significant laboratory
infrastructure enhancements and adaptation of exemplary pedagogy. Laboratory
equipment improvements include modern oscilloscopes, a RF signal generator, a
spectrum analyzer and a vector network analyzer. The intellectual merit of this
project is that these instruments are supporting complementary communication
course exercises and curriculum, and thus, providing new opportunities for
students to learn how to design modern wireless communications systems. The PI
is adapting and implementing curriculum prototype and laboratory exercises that
were developed at the University of South Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
program is affecting every ECE student at UVM. The broader impacts of the
program include increased interaction of students and faculty with high school
students through existing UVM outreach programs, new involvement of faculty in
recruiting efforts, and collaboration with local industry.&lt;br/&gt;
