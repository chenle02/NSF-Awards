A project to improve the undergraduate Fluid Mechanics Laboratory is being
implemented. The objectives of the project are to be achieved in two stages. The
first is to bridge the gap between the materials taught in fluid mechanics
course and the laboratory instruction as a prerequisite for the second stage
where the laboratory takes an enlarged role in the context of several other
fluid mechanics- hydraulics related courses. These objectives are part of a
major program committed to individual involvement and student participation in
the laboratory experience emphasizing fundamentals. The use of multipurpose and
compact units of equipment is expected to fulfill the objective of the first
stage substantially and the second stage partially. It is planned to complete
the overall objectives of the project in five years.
