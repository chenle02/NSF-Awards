This award will support an international workshop entitled "10th International
Conference on Luminescence and Electron-Spin-Resonance Dating." The conference
will examine the utility of trapped-electron dating (TED) for establishing the
age of geologic and archaeological materials.

The purpose of the conference is to bring together international experts,
practitioners, and students to share the latest developments in this dating
technique. NSF support for this conference will enable the University of Nevada
Desert Research Institute to serve as the first host of this conference in the
Western Hemisphere. This is important because TED is gaining use among American
scientists as a dating technique. Having experts from Europe gather in the
United States is a cost-effective way for American researchers to gain first-
hand knowledge of the technique.
