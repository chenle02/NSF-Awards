*** 9760231 Krishnan This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will explore how the change in polarization state for light reflected by a
surface might be employed as a tool for quantitative surface roughness, crack,
and defect detection. The approach is enabled by recent advances in four-
detector polarimetry that provide high measurement rates, non-invasive
measurement, and sensitivity to roughness, crack, and defect dimensions of 0.1(m
or less. The use of physical optics effects facilitates operation in production
facilities with minimal mechanical and thermal control requirements. The
approach offers (i) simultaneous measurement of intrinsic (e.g., chemical
composition) and extrinsic properties (roughness, crack and defect
concentrations, presence of overlayers), via Mueller matrix ellipsometry (MME),
and (ii) fast single point scanning of surfaces to map defects. The Phase I
effort will (i) expand the scientific database for MME on rough surfaces and
correlation of measurements with surface properties, (ii) evaluate detection of
defects less than 0.1 (m to several microns, (iii) determine viability of
polarization measurements for surface inspection of jet engine turbine blades,
and (iv) develop design and software/modeling approaches for automated on-line
process monitoring and NDE. Successful completion of the Phase I research would
lead, in Phase II, to the demonstration of a prototype instrument for advanced
non-invasive measurements in surface science, tribology, for quality control in
manufacturing operations, and in the NDE of materials and structures. ***
