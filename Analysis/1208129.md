The proposal will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs and young faculty in the "Ergodic Theory and Dynamical
Systems Workshop" that will be held at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill from March 22 to March 25, 2012.

This conference focuses on a fundamental theme in ergodic theory: connections
between ergodic theory and number theory. Several of the topics covered are
central in extremely active areas of current research in ergodic theory; ergodic
properties of interval exchange transformations and of Teichmuller flows, the
pointwise or norm convergence of nonconventional ergodic averages, rigidity of
group actions. Young researchers are given ample opportunities to speak, to talk
and to participate in the conference activities.
