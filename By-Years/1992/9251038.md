The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier transform IR spectrometer to
introduce the principles of spectroscopy to first-year students and incorporate
its use throughout the curriculum. New experiments demonstrating
spectrophotometric applications in analytical, physical, inorganic, and quantum
chemistry are being developed. The instrument is also being used extensively by
undergraduates conducting independent research projects.
