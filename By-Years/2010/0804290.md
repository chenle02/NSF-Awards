ABSTRACT SGER: Social perspectives on the Industrial Archaeology of the Arctic

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support an investigator to
examine three collections from the Arctic Coal Company (ACC)records stored in
separate archives located in Michigan. ACC was one of the early 20th century
companies that set up mining operations on Svalbard Island, Norway. As one of
the early efforts of industrialization of Svalbard, the ACC participated in
technology transfers and international social organizational efforts that have
left a legacy on natural resource development in northern environments. The
researcher is looking for materials that will give new insights into the ACC's
technological and organizational adaptation and innovation in the Arctic
environment. In addition, the records may give new insights into the
internationalism of the Svalbard experience and how that affected ACC personnel
and organization. This project is part of a much larger IPY project, LASHIPA
(LArge Scale HIstoric exploitation of Polar Areas), that includes a number of
international interdisciplinary teams exploring approached to understand
industrial-scale human activities in Polar Regions.
