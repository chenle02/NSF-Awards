Biological visual systems perform many demanding tasks which are far beyond the
present capabilities of electronic hardware. The success of many biological
systems can often be attributed to a large degree of preprocessing at the
peripheral sensory levels. Mathematical statements of relevant preprocessing
include multiplicative nonlinear lateral inhibition, center-surround receptive
fields and Gabor function receptive fields. The objectives of this project are
to design and implement in digital simulations such biologically motivated
receptive fields, for automated visual preprocessing. The design will be
suitable for future implementation in analog parallel integrated circuitry. The
capability of priming the visual preprocessor to concentrate on certain features
via Adaptive Resonance Theory will be investigated. These preprocessing schemes
will be tested on an industrially relevant task: in process inspection of
laminated composites.//
