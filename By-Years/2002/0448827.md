Of the large number of species that are introduced into new habitats, few are
successful as invaders. The evolutionary processes that allow some species to
invade while others do not are poorly understood. The evolutionary potential
(evolvability) of populations might affect the ability to invade novel habitats.
Evolvability depends on existing genetic variation in a population on which
natural selection could act. This study will compare differences in evolvability
between invasive and noninvasive populations within a crustacean species. The
small crustacean, Eurytemora affinis, repeatedly has invaded fresh water
habitats from saltwater habitats. These invasions were accompanied by
evolutionary shifts in osmotic tolerance. The source populations would have
required sufficient genetic variance for osmotic tolerance to survive the
transition into fresh water. This study tests the importance of two main forces
that could generate and maintain genetic variance: the tendency of traits to
vary due to new mutations, and the effect of fluctuating selection on the
maintenance of genetic variation (such as seasonal fluctuations in salinity).
This study also examines patterns of genetic dominance for saltwater and
freshwater tolerance, and how dominance varies across habitats.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive species pose major threats to ecosystem integrity
and public health. By better understanding the mechanisms that allow a species
to invade, we can improve our ability to control such invasions.&lt;br/&gt;
