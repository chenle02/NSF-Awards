Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. Researchers at the University of California,
San Diego will build an instrument that will measure the vertical and horizontal
flux of heat and momentum under the sea ice at the location of the proposed ice
camp in 1997. The proposed sonar system will provide accurate measurements of
mixing processes that will improve the ability of models to predict the
component of the heat budget of the Arctic that is produced within the ocean. ??
