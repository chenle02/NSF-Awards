With support from the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of
Chemistry, Christopher Gorski and Peter Heaney and their graduate students at
Pennsylvania State University will study chemical reactions that occur at the
interface between minerals and water. These reactions are important because they
play a significant role in determining how environmental contaminants, such as
toxic metals and hazardous organic compounds, behave in the environment and in
water treatment systems. The project focuses on birnessite, which is a highly
reactive manganese oxide commonly found in the environment. The rate at which
birnessite transforms environmental contaminants present in water can depend on
the properties of the birnessite and the water chemistry, but there is currently
no quantitative method for determining why. To address this gap, the project
will characterize the elemental composition, oxidation state, crystal structure,
aggregation state, and surface charge of birnessite in various types of water
and determine how quickly different environmental contaminants react with
birnessite under the same conditions. To broaden the societal and scientific
impact of the project, the researchers will also develop a workshop to teach
other scientists and engineers how to use electrochemical methods to study
minerals, and organize a demonstration called “Mysterious Manganese Minerals” at
an outreach event for grade 6-12 young women interested in STEM (science,
technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.

This project will use a combination of mediated electrochemical techniques,
spectroscopic analyses, and contaminant fate studies to thoroughly characterize
birnessite and its reactivity. The project has three objectives with
sequentially increasing complexities: (1) to determine how and why the oxidation
state of Mn in sodium birnessite influences its thermodynamic properties and
reactivity at pH 5.0; (2) to determine how and why the type and concentration of
cations in solution and the pH influence birnessite’s thermodynamic properties
and reactivity and (3) to determine if the relationships developed in first two
objectives can predict contaminant oxidation rates in complex waters containing
multiple cations and/or natural organic matter. If successful, this work will
provide the environmental chemistry and geochemistry communities with a method
for estimating the thermodynamic properties of birnessite under a range of
solution chemistries. The work will also create a framework for characterizing
the thermodynamic properties of other complex environmentally relevant minerals
in the future.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
