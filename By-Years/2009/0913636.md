2009 EAPSI Fellowship - SINGAPORE

This award supports a U.S. graduate student to conduct an individual research
project at one of seven locations in East Asia and the Pacific region. The
research project will provide the student with a first-hand mentored research
experience, an introduction to science and science policy infrastructure, and an
orientation to the culture and language of the location. The primary goals of
the East Asia Summer Institute program are to expose students to science and
engineering in the context of a research laboratory, and to initiate early-
career professional relationships that will foster research collaborations with
foreign counterparts in the future.
