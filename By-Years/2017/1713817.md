This award will provide funds to partially support the 20th annual Conference
Experience for Undergraduates (CEU), which is held as part of the Fall Meeting
of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. This year's meeting will be held October
25 - 28, 2017, in Pittsburgh, PA. The CEU is a natural venue for students who
have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their
work and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers.
The CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps
students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear
physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior
future leaders. Partial support will be provided for approximately 32
undergraduate students, out of a planned total of 150.
