Genetic relationships in natural populations of animals and plants are a basic
issue in evolutionary biology. Traditional techniques used to study natural
populations have often been found inadequate for describing the true genetic
variability of populations and the genetic relationships between populations. In
the proposed research, the recently developed technique of DNA fingerprinting
will be used to investigate the genetic relationships between natural
populations of Poecilia latipinna, a small fish occurring along the coastline of
the Southeastern U.S. This fish has been partially genetically characterized
using other techniques. Data suggest that populations of this species may be
more genetically distinct than heretofore determined. DNA fingerprinting should
reveal a greater level of differentiation between populations of this fish than
has yet been demonstrated. If so, DNA fingerprinting could be a potential tool
for other population genetic studies of both a basic and applied nature. If DNA
fingerprinting can be shown to be a useful tool for describing natural
populations, evolutionary biologists and managers of natural populations will
have available to them a relatively simple technique with greater power for
detecting genetic relationships than any method previously used.
