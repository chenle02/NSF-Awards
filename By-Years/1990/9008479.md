With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program Dr. Donald F. Gaines will investigate the mechanisms of reactions of
boron-containing cluster molecules and also synthesize new molecules of this
type. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of this important area of
chemistry, the results have potential applications in energy storage and solid
state materials. This project combines exploratory synthetic investigations of
boron hydride cluster molecules and their derivatives with investigations of the
mechanisms of their formation, rearrangement and reactions. The mechanisms of
reactions and rearrangements of selected derivatives of borane and carborane
clusters will be investigated using stereospecific boron isotopic labeling as
the diagnostic probe and B-10 and B-11 NMR spectroscopic analysis. New routes
and mechanistic pathways for the mono- and polyalkylation of boranes will be
developed using a variety of approaches based on recent new catalysts and
alkylating agents. The long-lived intermediate formed during the hydridic
reduction of boron-halogen bonds by trialkyltin hydrides will be characterized.
Novel classes of group-V- containing heteroatom boron clusters will be prepared
using alternative strategies such as simultaneous insertion of boron and
nitrogen, extensions of the strategies used recently to prepare new types of
nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing borane clusters.
