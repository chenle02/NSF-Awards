The project provides partial support to students, new principal investigators
(New Faces) and underrepresented minority (URM) researchers to participate in
the conference Compound Semiconductor Week (CSW), being held from June 1 to June
3, 2022 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Compound Semiconductor Week brings together
the international community of researchers. It is one of the first international
conferences to prioritize the in-person experience of the participants while
providing a hybrid option during the pandemic. Promotion of research in compound
semiconductors, an important genre of semiconductors, is poised to make a
significant impact on basic collaborative research and workforce development in
the field of semiconductors. The CSW 2022 is expected to host 250 participants
with about half of them being students. The technical program with 12 subtopics
is designed to achieve a purposeful balance and inclusiveness considering
researcherâ€™s gender, origin, ethnicity, seniority and research topics. In
addition, to debuting new independent principal investigators to the research
community, the CSW 2022 curated a program for the New Faces in Compound
Semiconductors, providing a critical experience for the research community to
transition through the pandemic period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
