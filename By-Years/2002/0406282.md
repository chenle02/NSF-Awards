0406282&lt;br/&gt;Mitra&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will study the mechanism of
laser therapy using fiberoptic nanobiosensors. Low intensity ultraviolet,
visible and near and mid-infrared radiation will be carefully aimed and injected
onto and through the cell membrane with tiny evanescent fiber and micropipette-
like nanoprobes constructed for efficient delivery of the radiation onto sub-
cellular organelles. Microprobes will be used to sense light by photon counting
and the emission of chemicals will be sensed by mid-infrared absorption using
evanescent tips. Responses could occur in the form of light emission such as
luminescence from singlet oxygen or a chemical emission. A major goal is to
determine the photochemical mechanism responsible for cell stimulation in the
case of laser therapy and cell death in the case of photodynamic therapy.
