In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor James Farrar of the University
of Rochester and his research group will explore the collisions of free radicals
and atomic or molecular ions, employing the velocity map imaging (VMI) method
for product detection, using the instrument developed during the initial grant
period. By employing a pulsed supersonic source of free radicals such as CH3 and
C3H5, and an electron impact or discharge source of low energy cations such as
N2+, N+, C+, O2+, and O+, and anions such as H-, O-, O2-, and OH-, the VMI
detection method will produce differential cross sections in kinetic energy and
angle. Of particular interest are the bond formation reactions that yield C-C,
C-O, C-N, N-O, and H-H bonds. For anionic reactions, free electrons produced by
associative detachment will be detected. The experiments will produce
information on the dynamics of reactions of low energy ions with free radicals,
an area of ion chemistry with few extant examples in the literature. The work
will address the serious deficiencies of models for electrical discharges and
the chemistry of planetary atmospheres that do not include ion-radical
reactions. A study of the H- + H associative detachment reaction will have
important implications for astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition to
characterizing the dynamics of these chemical systems, this research will
provide a deeper understanding of reactivity patterns and a molecular
understanding of the chemistry that takes place in reactive ion etching, and in
atmospheric and extraterrestrial chemistry. The instrumental technique
development may have impacts in various subdisciplines of chemistry, including
mass spectrometry and ion imaging. The students and post-doctoral associates
involved in this research will contribute to the national scientific and
economic infrastructure through the development of new measurement technologies,
new high value-added products, and the further training of scientific personnel.
