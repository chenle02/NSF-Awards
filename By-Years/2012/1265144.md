Wastewater treatment accounts for about 3% of electrical energy consumed in U.S
and other developed countries. Decentralized wastewater treatment is at the
forefront of the wastewater industry discussion and is starting to be
implemented by small municipalities and cities across the U.S. due to the need
to cost effectively relieve pressure on the current wastewater treatment
infrastructure. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology has emerged as a potential
clean technology for renewable energy production and decentralized wastewater
treatment. Relatively low power density has been the greatest challenge for
practical application of MFC technology in wastewater treatment. Recently,
researchers have advanced this technology by developing a reactor design (CEA-
MFC) that significantly increases the power density. In this project, the team
will fabricate a demonstration CEA-MFC. Successful completion of the project
will result in better understanding of key factors surrounding widespread use of
this technology.

The performance of CEA-MFCs demonstrates the great potential of MFC technology
in converting wastewater treatment from an energy consumer to a net energy
producer, as well as reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse emission
related to waste treatment. Within the U.S. this could have benefits to the U.S.
municipal infrastructure, industry and agriculture. This technology could also
be beneficial to developing countries as they work to build infrastructure and
improve sanitation and availability of power.
