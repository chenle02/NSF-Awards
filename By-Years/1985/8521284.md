This research is directed to computer software for assisting physicians in the
diagnosis of skin malignancies, including malignant melanoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, and basal cell epithelioma. The purpose is to combine a computer
program with a computer vision front end and a video disk tumor image reference
file to create a useful diagnostic tool for skin cancer. This research project
involves algorithms found in Phase I research to detect types of tumors with
high accuracy. Early results show the feasibility of detecting tumor borders,
ulcers, telangiectases, and semitranslucencies. This proposal addresses the
important area of the application of artificial intelligence techniques to
computer vision. Such techniques have potentially enormous commercial
applications in such fields as robotics and industrial automation as well as
medical imaging. An automatic tumor recognition device could serve the nation's
interest in continuing the lead in medical diagnostic devices. It is hoped that
the recognition of biologic images, so far eluding computer vision researchers
except in limited domains, will be advanced by the development of an expert
tumor diagnosis system
