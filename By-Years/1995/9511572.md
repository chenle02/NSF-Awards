This study examines the causes and consequences of gender segregation in the
workplace. It draws on theories in cognitive social psychology, institutional
organizational theory, and labor economics to construct hypotheses about the
conditions affecting individuals, jobs, organizations, and their environments.
Multiple data sources will be examined, including a unique data set made up of
class action suits relating to gender discrimination. Statistical models are
used to assess the following questions: 1) why the gender composition of jobs
varies within and across organizations, 2) the mechanisms through which the
gender composition of jobs influence earnings and career advancement, and 3) the
relationship among gender, job segregation, and work effort. %%% This research
explores the ways organizational structures and processes shape labor market
outcomes for men and women. It will search new empirical sources for evidence to
contribute to the continuing debate on gender segregation in the workplace. It
will also clarify the impact of Equal Opportunity legislation on labor market
dynamics.
