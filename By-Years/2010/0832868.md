The project applies a balance of observational diagnosis and model
experimentation to try to improve our understanding of fundamental features of
tropical intra-seasonal variability (ISV) to improve the simulations of these
features in global atmospheric models. This is to be accomplished by examining
the coupling mechanism between ISV-associated precipitation, wind speed and
latent heat flux anomalies, and the modulation of tropical synoptic-scale
variability by the ISV. Observation-based studies focus on examination of the
coupling between ISV-related precipitation, wind speed, and surface heat flux
anomalies and their relation to shorter synoptic-scale variations using
satellite data. Model sensitivity studies will focus on mechanisms of moisture-
convection feedback, moisture-radiation feedback, wind-evaporation feedback, and
the role of ocean-atmosphere coupling using ocean models of varying complexity.
Broader impacts include graduate student training and curriculum enhancement.
