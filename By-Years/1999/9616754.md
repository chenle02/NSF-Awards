In recent years research in networking, distributed systems, and high
performance computing has been hampered by the research community's limited
access to high performance networking equipment, and more importantly, the
detailed technical information needed to use it effectively in experimental
systems research programs. This project provides gigabit network technology to
U.S. universities for use in research and education. This technology is
distributed in the form of Gigabit Network Kits, each kit consisting of a high
performance ATM switch (supporting link speeds of up to 2.4 Gb/s), six network
interface cards for workstations or PCs, software (including source), extensive
documentation, including hardware design information. The kits are designed to
permit flexible use in a variety of different systems research contexts
(networking, operating systems, multimedia and high performance computing), and
can be modified at both the software and hardware levels. In addition to the
hardware and software, the program provides initial user training in the form of
a two week intensive course and ongoing support through a users' group, an
electronic mailing list and a WWW site providing access to software,
documentation, announcements of contributed research products, bug reports and a
FAQ page. Hardware support is also provided. The program also provides for a
series of user workshops, (one every six months), allowing users to share
experiences and demonstrate results from their work.
