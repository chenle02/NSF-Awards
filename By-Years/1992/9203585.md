This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to Dr. James
Hutchison. Dr. Hutchison received his Ph. D. for work with Dr. James Collman at
Stanford and will be working with Dr. Royce Murray at North Carolina. In this
laboratory he will learn a wide variety of analytical techniques and will learn
how to measure small changes in electronic flux in biological systems. This will
help him to pursue his career interests in studying synthetic ion channels based
on peptide supported poly-crown ethers. %%% This is the first year of a
postdoctoral fellowship award to Dr. James Hutchison. He will be studying the
basic processes by which small electrically charged chemical species pass
through biological systems. Such research can have a major impact on drug
design.
