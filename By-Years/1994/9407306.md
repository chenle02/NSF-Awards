This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, concerns the combination of capillary electrophoresis in narrow-bore
capillaries with sensitive and selective detection methods to address several
unique experiments in cellular neuroscience. The three fundamental goals of this
project are to develop ultra-low volume separation methods to dynamically and
selectively follow chemical release from single nerve cells, growth cones, and
synapses; to develop capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry to quantify
phospholipids in membranes of whole cells, regional sections of the plasma
membrane, and axonal growth cones in culture; and to develop methods to identify
and quantify chemical messengers in single developing growth cones. These
techniques will be brought to bear on two important areas of neurobiology,
namely neural development through the study of growth cones and cell-to-cell
communication through events at the membrane. The analytical methodology
development to be pursued in this project, which builds upon results obtained by
Professor Ewing and his students during the tenure of NSF grant CHE-9106832, is
important to the achievement of dimensionally and molecularly selective
neurochemical measurements at the single cell level. These general methodologies
are also important in biotechnology and can be expected to contribute to the
development of essential instrumentation for environmental studies
