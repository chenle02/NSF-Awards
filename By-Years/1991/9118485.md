This award supports a project designed to confirm that the East Antarctic ice
sheet in the David Glacier area has become thinner in the past 100,000 years and
to use rocks deposited by the ice to study the geology of the ice-covered area
of East Antarctica. As a secondary objective the project will also collect
samples of Jurassic basalt and dolerite in the nunataks exposed in the David
Glacier area for a geochemical and isotopic study designed to test the
hypothesis that renewed volcanism of hydrothermal alteration of these rocks
occurred in post-Jurassic time. The detection of a climate change in the study
area will be a significant contribution to current efforts to use climate
records from the recent past to predict future climate trends.
