Stanton 9726663 There has long been an interest in ecology in understanding the
mechanisms that allow competing species to coexist. Numerous questions remain in
this area. This research would take advantage of a widespread occurrence of ant-
acacia symbioses in a region of Kenya to observe, experiment with, and model
interactions between competing species. In arid upland regions, Acacias dominate
the limited numbers of trees present. These species, as in other dry tropical
habitats exhibit a mutualistic relationship with ants. The presence of ants
substantially decrease tree mortality and derive substantial benefits from the
ants themselves. There are four symbiotic ant species occurring throughout this
region where they exhibit a distinct hierarchy in competitive interactions.
Individual trees are colonized by a single ant species and there are aggressive
interactions among the ant species for the occupation of each tree with one
species being the usual dominant. At the same time, however, the four ant
species have persisted in the region for an extended time and this project will
test the factors that foster this continued coexistence. It will remove ants
experimentally from some trees, examine recolonization of such tree as well as
of potted trees that had been allowed to grow without ants, and combine this
information in a matrix model that predicts the transitions that occur in the
occurrence of each ant species within the region. This work will have
substantial effects for conservation planning and educational development in
Kenya.
