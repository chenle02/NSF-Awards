The primary goal of this project is to determine the characteristics of the
response of the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) to geomagnetic storms.
The study will utilize the extensive ground-based, dual-frequency, Global
Positioning System (GPS) measurements of TEC. A recent study has shown that by
sorting F-region ionosonde data (NmF2) as a function of a new index of storm
magnitude, a consistent repeatable picture begins to emerge in each season and
latitude. The PIs will perform a similar analysis of total electron content, and
compare and contrast the geophysical response with NmF2. This study will
contribute to the understanding of the ionospheric response to geomagnetic
storms. In the context of the National Space Weather Program, the work will
provide the information to hopefully lead to an operational product for the
benefit of a range of single frequency GPS users.
