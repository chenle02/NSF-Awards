This project examines the use of multilevel codes for the fading channel. It is
observed that, since the performance metric on this is not Euclidean distance
but error event length, multilevel codes provide a simple yet effective means of
designing codes to achieve a desired level of diversity. In addition, multistage
and parallel decoding techniques can simply decoder design and minimize decoding
delay when multilevel codes are used. This project undertakes code design for
the fading channel and various decoder structures in order to achieve high
performance at minimum cost. Unification of multilevel coding theory with
multidimensional coding theory, and application of distance and performance
theorems available for multilevel codes to multidimensional codes is another
goal.
