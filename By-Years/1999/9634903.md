9634903 Hoger The objective of the proposed research is to develop constitutive
equations for residually stressed biological tissues and to use them to predict
the mechanical response of the residually stressed body to applied loads. The
balance of experimental work with modeling and relevance to a specific material
applications is excellent. The theory will be applied to cardiac tissue, which
supports a substantial residual residual stress field and which has been the
subject of extensive experimental investigation. Collaboration with engineers in
biomechanics will facilitate the transition between details of theoretical
concern and issues of practical applicability. The theoretical approaches and
computational tools that will be developed in the context of biological tissues
should also be relevant to many engineering materials applications where
residual stresses also play an important role. ***
