This awards supports the research of Professor V. Shokurov to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on problems involved in minimal model theory in
dimensions greater than or equal to 3. He hopes to show that flips exist in
dimension n whenever the Log Minimal Model program holds in dimension n-1. He
will also study log canonical singularities in dimension 3. The research is in
the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved
problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined
in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field
uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and
conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself
useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science,
cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
