Controll of an Autonomous Flying Vehicle Intelligent Control of an Autonomous
Flying Vehicle This award funds a one-year research planning grant. The goal of
this research project is to explore research problems in intelligent contrml and
robotics. For this purpose, a completely autonomous flying robot will ultimately
be built which can carry out simple tasks within its environment. The issues
under investigation include developing a theoretical framework for the interface
between the two levels of controllers, incorporating a learning algorithm within
the task planner to improve its performance as it becomes more experienced in
its environment, and integrating the sensor data with the different controllers
to achieve automatic obstacle avoidance while insuring that the goal is reached.
The extra degrees of freedom of a flying robot both increase its maneuverability
and make it more difficult to control. In contrast to a terrestrial-based robot,
a helicopter must always be under automatic control. It can never stop in place,
evaluate its current surroundings, compute a new path, and then continue its
mission. It is not statically stable, and the dynamic stabilization problem is
known to be hard. If these difficulties can be overcome through intelligent
control, the result will be a highly-flexible, extremely maneuverable autonomous
system.
