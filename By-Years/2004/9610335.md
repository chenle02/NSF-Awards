9610335 Dye This project is focused on the synthesis and characterization of
crystalline salts that contain the products of reaction between alkali metals
such as lithium, sodium and potassium and various organic complexants to form
two novel types of compounds: alkalides, containing alkali metal anions in crown
ether and cryptand salts, and electrides, in which the positive charge of
complex cations is balanced by cavity- delocalized electrons rather than by
anions. Of particular interest here are compounds in which electrons have nearly
the same chemical potential as trapped electrons in cavities or as aromatic
radical anions. Solid compounds in which the electron density is distributed
between the two sites should have interesting electronic, magnetic and optical
properties, together with the possibility of room temperature stability. %%%
These investigations may lead to the use of electrides and alkalides as solid-
state electronic devices, and as novel reagents for synthesis and catalysis.
They will also provide an opportunity to study in a new class of materials
current problems in photophysics including Rydberg-type ground states, inter-
electron magnetic interactions and spinwaves, electronic conductivity in 1,2 and
3 dimensions, and non- metal to metal transitions. ***
