With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Xuefei
Huang of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University to establish a
chemoenzymatic method to synthesize heparan sulfate peptidoglycans (HSPG's)
containing homogeneous heparan sulfate glycans. The project involves a
collaboration on the enzymatic side with Professor Jian Liu at the University of
North Carolina. HSPG's are implicated in biological processes as diverse as
wound healing, cancer metastasis, cell adhesion, viral infection and cell
proliferation. Yet biological studies have been hampered by limited access to
homogeneous HSPGs, particularly with regard to the extent and position of
sulfation. The glycopeptides will be assembled through chemical synthesis. The
glycan chains will then be extended and the sulfations performed enzymatically
to create specific heparan sulfate structures in a divergent manner. The
interfacing of chemical and enzymatic synthesis creates a potentially powerful
approach to access these complex glycoconjugates which will lay the foundation
for the eventual synthesis of homogeneous heparan sulfate
proteoglycans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this project involve
the advancement of glycoconjugate chemistry by establishing new methods to
access heparan sulfate (HS) peptidoglycans. The availability of HS
peptidoglycans with both a well-defined degree and position of sulfation should
have a scientific broader impact on the field of chemical biology, by providing
opportunities to unravel structure-function relationships for distinct HS-
peptidoglycans. The research activities will be incorporated into education,
training and community outreach. This research project is expected to help build
the talent pool of next generation glycoscientists, who are in high demand
especially in the difficult and specialized field of complex oligosaccharide and
glycoconjugate synthesis.
