This proposal is for funds to partially defray expenses for graduate students,
post docs, and some foreign visitors, so that they can attend the Gordon
Research Conference on Photonuclear Reactions. This conference is one in a
continuous, biennial series spanning nearly 30 years. It is the most important
conference in electromagnetic nuclear physics, a top priority sub-discipline
within nuclear science. This years conference deals with many forefront issues
that will be attacked by the new facilities under construction in the US and
abroad including among other subjects new few-body system results, spin physics,
coincidence studies, and quark effects in nuclei.
