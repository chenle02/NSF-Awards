This award provides limited funding for a six-month pilot project that will
allow Finger Lakes Production International (FLPI) to produce approximately
twenty-two radio broadcasts based on oceanographic science funded by the NSF.
These broadcasts will be aired on a variety of stations across the U.S. and
internationally. The pilot project will allow FLPI to build a firmer
relationship with the Centers for Ocean Science Education (COSEE) network,
broaden their access to scientists, and develop more background material.
Producing a radio broadcast that focuses public attention on ocean issues is
important and comes at a critical time in our history. With the recent release
of the report by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, lawmakers will be
considering major changes in our policies affecting the oceans. The features
produced by FLPI will help focus public attention on the oceans and remind a
broad audience that oceans are an important U.S. asset that we do not fully
understand.
