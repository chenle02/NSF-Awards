PI: C. Robin Buell (Institute for Genomic Research)&lt;br/&gt;CO-PIs: Shelley H.
Jansky (USDA-ARS), Bernd M. Lange (Washington State
University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on generating genomic
resources for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Through participation in the
international Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC), it will generate
Genome Survey Sequences and a draft sequence of chromosome VI. This sequence,
along with other potato genome sequence generated by the PGSC, will be annotated
for genes and other features, and made available through a web-based portal for
scientists to enable scientists to further their work on potato biology and
production. Under-represented undergraduates will be trained through a project
specific internship program. The general public will be educated in genomics
through an educational exhibit in collaboration with the US Botanical Garden
that demonstrates challenges in potato and agricultural production and how
science, including genomics, can meet these challenges.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to project outcomes&lt;br/&gt;Sequence data from
this project will be made available to the public through Genbank
(http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html) and the project website (accessible
through http://www.tigr.org/plantProjects.shtml) and annotation data will be
made available through the project website.
