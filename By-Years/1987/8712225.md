The University of Alabama is being supported to establish a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under supervision of experienced research chemists. The
program will support 9 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will come from other institutions. The Research activities will include: o X-ray
Crystallography and Organometallic Synthesis o Separation and Classification of
Pheromones o EPR Studies of Photo-Excited Cartenoids = Nature's Photoprotect
system o FTIR Measurements for Langmuir - Blodgett Films
