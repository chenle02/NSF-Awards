The escalating costs of medical care are having a significant impact on the
economy of the United State. An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
on Health Management could research how effective management would better
control and minimize costs. A planning meeting will study if industry will
support an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Health Management
to be headquartered at Arizona State University. While the initial research
interests of industry have been found to be focused on "New Ways of Delivering
Patient Care", "Physician - Organization Integration" and "Implementing New Ways
of Managing Quality", the meeting will assess industry interest and determine if
the Center has sufficient support and merit to meet the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria. The Principal Investigator and
Director as well as the proposed consortium of researchers from universities
across the United States are recognized as eminent researchers and have the
resources for this planning meeting. This project has been coordinated with Dr.
Lynn Pollnow in the Division of Social and Economic Science at the National
Science Foundation. The Program Manager recommends Arizona State University be
awarded $9,840 for one year for this planning meeting.
