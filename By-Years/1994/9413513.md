A high end computing and scientific visualization facility will be acquired with
Academic Research Infrastructure Program funds to support a broad spectrum of
research and research training initiatives in science and engineering. The
facility will contain an eight-processor Silicon Graphics Power Challenge XL
server with 1 GB of memory, a 20 GB internal disk, a tape /CD-ROM jukebox and 4
high end Silicon Graphics workstations. The satellite visualization clusters
will be located in the College of Engineering and College of Arts and Sciences.
The Power Challenge XL will be the principal cycle server for large scale
simulations and parallel algorithm development and can be upgraded to 16
processors in the future. The three main areas of research include: 1) the
modeling of advanced materials including the growth, structure, and dynamics of
polymer blends, metal surfaces, intermetallics, alloys and disordered magnets;
2) the reaction dynamics of atomic and molecular systems including electonic
processes in the collisions of atoms with electrons and ions, photoprocesses in
atoms, and gas-phase reaction dynamics and molecular spectroscopy; 3)
computational fluid dynamics involving turbulent reactive flows typical of those
involved in the manufacturing of various materials. A state-of-the-art eight-
processor computer with four workstations will be acquired for a new computing
facility, which will feature three satellite visualization clusters. The
facility will be used primarily by faculty in the Departments of Physics and
Chemistry and by faculty in the College of Engineering. The research will focus
on modeling of advanced materials, reaction dynamics of atomic and molecular
systems and computational fluid dynamics.
