This award will allow the Connecticut Logic Seminar to invite one outside
speaker per month during the three nine-month academic years 1988-1991. The
seminar has a distinguished history going back to 1974 and has materially
advanced research in mathematical logic at the member institutions: Bard
College, University of Connecticut, Vassar College, Wesleyan University, and
Yale University, as well as for other individual logicians who have been
associated with it from time to time.
