9355669 Friedman The New York Hall of Science will develop and institutionalize
the Science Discovery Lab System, providing training and ongoing support in
astronomy education for New York City public and private 6th and 8th grade
science teachers. This new system provides a model for addressing all mandated
science curriculum areas. The project trains and supports 120 teachers via: a
three week, graduate level institute in content and pedagogy provided by
college, university and science center staff; peer training in schools and the
science center; and tangible ongoing support, including annual Update
Conferences, consultation, and provision of high equipment. The program goals
are to: increase teachers' knowledge of astronomy concepts; change teaching
methodology from rote to hands-on; develop a city-wide teacher support network
establish ongoing peer training; and institutionalize these improvements on a
self-supporting, long-term basis. During the grant 120 teachers will be trained.
They in turn will instruct their 4200 students and train a minimum of 120
additional teachers. ***
