The ultracentrifuge is one of the few instruments that provide direct and
reliable information about molecular weights and interactions of macromolecules
in solution. Sedimentation equilibrium techniques are especially valuable
because of their foundation on equilibrium thermodynamics. They provide the most
reliable and foolproof estimates of solution parameters with an excellent degree
of precision using interferometric observations of concentration distributions.
Sedimentation velocity experiments can yield detailed information about
size/shape distributions. Recent advances have made automated on-line
interferometric data acquisition a routine and simple procedure. Commercial
instrumentation currently provides high-quality absorbance measurements in a new
ultracentrifuge. This proposed research will develop procedures and data
analysis techniques for characterizing difficult macromolecular interacting
system. Equilibrium experiments will be analyzed primarily by various least
squares fitting programs that will make possible extensive global fits to
physicochemical parameters of the solute (s) with assured confidence limits.
Programs will be devised for precisely and automatically monitoring attainment
of equilibrium. Novel approaches to equilibrium sedimentation experiments will
be explored. Instrumentation will be developed for significant improvement of
precision on-line interferometry in both equilibrium and velocity experiments.
These various approaches will be applied to problems of topical interest,
largely, but not completely, from biotechnology enterprises.
