Abstract EEC-9527480 This award provides funding to Boston University for
support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development Program entitled, "PRIDE:
Photonics Research in Interdisciplinary Education." The CRCD program emphasizes
the need to incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas
into the upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and
stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality
education and curriculum development. This three year program will create three
levels of photonics modules to enrich standard core, specialized elective, and
design courses of the upper division undergraduate and early graduate curricula.
The interdisciplinary faculty team along with industry collaborators, will
develop integrative learning experiences using modern research in holistic
problems, requiring analysis, innovation, synthesis, and integration. Modules
will be based on and demonstrated by recent photonics research, including
photonic materials and devices, optical data storage, optical communications,
displays and photonics systems. *** ??
