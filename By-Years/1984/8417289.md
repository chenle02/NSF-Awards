A novel wide, horizontal bore, high field NMR spectrometer will be acquired. The
new NMR will support research in the spatial details of metabolic locations and
distribution, the molecular biology of plants, the organization of muscle
tissue, the structure and function of nucleoproteins, and the molecular dynamics
of proteins. New software will be written to allow 2D NMR techniques to be
employed with a VAX as host for the NMR data.
