In the big data era, observations are collected on ever larger numbers of
variables and cases. Even after preliminary reductions of the data, subsets of
interest may have high dimensionality and appreciable sample size. The
interesting structure in such data is often low dimensional, indeed such models
occur in many scientific domains from econometrics to genomics and signal
processing and well beyond. This project will investigate the estimation and
testing of a particular class of low dimensional structures, namely low rank
perturbations of scaled identity or diagonal matrices. It will consider high
dimensional versions of multivariate statistical methods that have found wide
use for traditional data: principal components, multiple response regression,
canonical correlations etc., as well as newer applications such as matrix
denoising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study the proportional limit
setting in which the number of variables and the sample size are of the same
order of magnitude. It will explore the phase transition phenomenon for a wide
class of multivariate methods, using in part the systematic framework developed
by A. T. James. Contiguity properties below the phase transition will be
investigated as will Gaussian behavior above the critical point. A separate low
noise approximation will be used to derive long sought power approximations for
largest root tests. In estimation, the project will study optimal shrinkage
procedures for the empirical eigenvalues that correspond to the low rank
structure, making explicit how the results depend strongly on the particular
loss function chosen. Both scalar non-linearities as well as thresholding
techniques will be considered. The project will build upon preliminary work for
covariance estimation and matrix denoising, and also develop results for other
multivariate settings such as low rank factor models, canonical correlations and
discriminant analysis.
