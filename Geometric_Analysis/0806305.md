The PI is interested primarily in classical problems involving curves and
surfaces in Euclidean space, and more generally Riemannian submanifolds.
Although PI's research in this area, which includes joint work with more than a
dozen collaborators, spans a wide range of topics, there are a number of
recurring themes such as various notions of convexity or optmization, and the
interaction between geometry and topology, which permeate throughout his work.
More specifically, a typical problem is how restrictions on curvature, or
various boundary conditions, influence the global shape of a curve or a
hypersurface. These investigations comprise the following interelated
categories: (i) Structure of locally convex hypersurfaces with boundary,
including connections with Monge-Ampere equations, Alexandrov spaces with
curvature bounded below, and a question of Yau; (ii) Applications of the
h-principle, in the sense of Gromov, to embeddings with prescribed curvature,
including knots with constant curvature or torsion; (iii) Riemannian four vertex
theorems for surfaces with boundary and space curves; (iv) Capillary surfaces
and generalizations of the classical isoperimetric inequality, via sharp
estimates for total curvature of hypersurfaces with convex boundary; (v) Shadows
on illuminated hypersurfaces and their application to geometric variational
problems; (vi) Local and global isometric embedding problems; (vii) The relation
between the intrinsic diameter and area of convex surfaces.



Curves and surfaces are to geometry what numbers are to algebra. They form the
basic ingredients of our visual perception and inspire the development of far
reaching mathematical tools. Yet despite centuries of pure study, and an
abundance of potential applications, there are still many fundamental open
problems in this area which are strikingly intuitive and elementary to state.
Moreover, technological shortcomings, such as the inability of present day
computers to reliably recognize a human face, further illustrate the
deficiencies in our understanding of the concept of shape. The PI believes that
focusing on classical problems in submanifold geometry and topology is likely to
stimulate useful developments in pure mathematics, or lead to wider applications
in science and technology. For instance, those aspects of the PI's work dealing
with shadows on illuminated surfaces are motivated in part by a study of soap
films, and have connections to computer vision (the ``shape from shading"
problems); The investigations on knots may be of interest in studying DNA;
Calculating the intrinsic diameter of convex bodies is of interest in motion
planing and robotics; While studying isoperimetric problems and capillary
surfaces have been a significant source of enrichment in the calculus of
variations. Still, the greatest impact of the proposed activity could be
discovery of unexpected phenomena, or new connections between various fields.
