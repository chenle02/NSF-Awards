This award will support collaborative research between Professor Sow-Hsin Chen
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr. Jose Teixeira of the
Laboratoire Leon-Brillouin of the Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires, Saclay, France.
The objective of this work is to study the microscopic structural and dynamic
properties of bulk supercooled water, which differ from those of normal water,
using techniques of thermal neutron and X-ray diffraction, and quasi-elastic and
inelastic neutron spectroscopy. In addition, the dynamics of water in confined
geometries, as in the interior of reverse micelles and in certain types of
molecules at low temperatures, will be studied. In these systems, the
interaction of the water with the proximate surfaces is important in
understanding the folding and enzymatic activity of water and similar
macromolecules. The study will also be extended to include other super-cooled
liquids near their freezing or transition-to-glass temperatures. The instruments
for the high resolution neutron spectroscopy measurements are available only in
France. This research may have important applications in the fields of chemical
reactions and cooling-system behavior.
