This proposal is for a grant to establish a Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Wireless Information Networks at Rutgers University.
Wireless information services such as cordless telephone and cellular radio are
technologically in their infancy. The aim of the research program at the Center
is to overcome bottlenecks that restrict the growth and enhancement of wireless
networking. The proposed systems research projects include; a) multiple access
performance evaluation, b) object oriented systems integration in wireless
networks, c) Dynamic spectrum reuse, d) optimization of the physical layer, and
e) a wireless network testbed. The Program Manager recommends a continuing award
of $50,000 each year for the next five years to Rutgers University for
establishing a Center for Wireless Information Networks. Near the end of each 12
month period the Program Manager and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers
Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,
including the following: (1) the extent to which the university-industry
interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to which the support
base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a robust research program is
developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend
support of the next period of this continuing grant.
