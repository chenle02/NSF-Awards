9709237 Casella Studies show that not only Overseas Chinese but also many other
ethnic groups living outside their countries of origin create formal or informal
"societies" to which coethnic business people from both the host countries and
the mother country have access. The main purpose of these societies is to
provide information about business opportunities and business contracts. The
operation and economic importance of coethnic societies has been especially well
documented for the special case of trade between countries hosting recent
immigrants and these immigrants' countries of origin. The purpose of this
research project is to build a general equilibrium model of trade where
anonymous markets and networks of personal contacts interact, and to test the
empirical implications that can be drawn from the model. The project adds to the
growing research on integrating network and market models of the economy.
Although economists and other social scientists believe that both forms of
organizations play an important role in allocating economic resources, very few
analyses treat explicitly how they interact. ??
