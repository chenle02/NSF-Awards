EAGER: PAN-VARIANT COVID-19 DIFFERENTIATED BIOSENSING USING GRAPHENE FIELD-
EFFECT
SENSORS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;The
pandemic due to COVID-19 has triggered an increasing demand for scientific
research into portable fast biosensors capable of rapid infectious disease
detection. With the rise of variants beyond the original COVID-19 strain, there
is a need for the scientific understanding and development of biosensors that
can be rapidly adapted to sense existing, emerging and new variants of the
virus. This award will investigate facile, precise, multiplexed biosensors for
detection of the virus from the different evolving variants based on advanced
nanomaterials, namely, functionalized graphene field-effect transistors that has
the potential for unprecedented sensitivity and a fast response time in a low-
cost platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This
research aims to pioneer a single platform for rapid multi-variant detection
based on functionalized graphene-antibody selective interaction that affords a
high intrinsic limit of detection. Different variants of Covid-19 will be
evaluated with the antibody-functionalized graphene field-effect sensing
platform. The outcomes of this research will generate new knowledge on multi-
variant biosensing, limits of detection, and cross-reactivity through structural
and conceptual engineering. The sensor platform is sufficiently versatile to be
adapted to detect both existing, emerging, and future
variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
