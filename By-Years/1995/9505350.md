9505350 Sundheimer The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral
Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to
twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide
opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This award will
support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Michael L. Sundheimer
to work with Professor Daniel B. Ostrowsky at the Universite de Nice Sophia
Antipolis in France. This award will support the second year of a project
started under a Bourse Chateaubriand provided by the French government. This
project involves the implementation of a CW quasi-phasematched optical
parametric oscillator (OPO) in lithium niobate channel waveguides, beginning
with measurements of parametric fluorescence and gain. A resonant cavity will
then be made to realize the OPO, which will be done by affixing mirrors to the
waveguide or, with coatings applied directly to the waveguide ends. Initial
experiments will be done with a CW Ti:Sapphire laser to demonstrate the
principle. The driving force to-date for such research has been the search for
compact, efficient diode-pumped blue-light sources. Diode-pumping of an OPO
device would create a compact, tunable, all solid-state laser source covering
the important 1.3 and 1.55 um telecommunications windows as well as providing
wavelengths useful for spectroscopy, atmospheric pollution monitoring, and
biological and medical applications. ***
