Among the diversity of reproductive types in plants and animals, one
permutation - androdioecy (mixtures of males and hermaphrodites) - is
distinguished by its rarity, being found in only 18 cases. Two of these 18
species are found in the primitive crustacean class Branchiopoda, but another 20
branchiopod species (in the genus Eulimnadia) have sex ratios suggestive of
androdioecy. If these 20+ closely-related species are truly androdioecious, then
this rare mating system would likely have been present in the ancestor to this
lineage, placing the origin of androdioecy at ~280 million years ago. This
inferred age is orders of magnitude older than expected by theory. We propose to
combine three parallel projects (laboratory rearing experiments, morphological
comparisons, and DNA sequencing) to assess whether androdioecy is an ancestral
or derived trait in these crustaceans. The rearing experiments will be used to
determine the extent of androdioecy in these species. The morphological and DNA
projects will produce data used to estimate the relationships among species
within these crustaceans. We will measure 30 morphological characters per
species as well as sequence four DNA regions, which should enable a robust
estimate of evolutionary relationships among these animals. We will then use
these estimates to determine whether androdioecy is an ancestral condition for
these crustaceans, which if true, suggests that this reproductive mode may have
persisted for hundreds of millions of years, casting doubt on the notion that
androdioecy is a transitory reproductive system. &lt;br/&gt; This research
project will accomplish two scientific and three educational goals. First, these
data will allow us to better understand the factors that maintain males with
hermaphrodites in androdioecious species, which can shed light on the importance
of mating between individuals relative to self-fertilization. Such an
understanding can help us to formulate better management practices for both
domesticated plants and animals as well better preservation plans for endangered
species. Second, delineating the true relationship among the species within this
crustacean group will be helpful for determining the true number of species in
North America, which can be used to shed light on which of these species may be
threatened or endangered in the United States. For the educational components of
this research, this project will integrate teaching and primary research on
three levels. First, funding will directly support two graduate students and one
undergraduate student for three years. Second, all three PI's will encourage
undergraduate students to participate in research via independent research
projects and honors thesis research. Third, part of this research program will
be incorporated into two on-going educational programs at The University of
Akron: (a) an NSF-funded program that brings basic research into the
laboratories of the Introductory Biology course at U of A, and (b) a 5-year,
privately funded program that involves minority high school students in basic
research at U of A via a mentoring program, involving both undergraduate and
graduate students in a "research team." In all research mentoring programs,
priority will be given to qualified minority and women candidates at all levels
of participation.&lt;br/&gt;
