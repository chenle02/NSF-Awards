This project incorporates a programmable robot into this institution's flexible
manufacturing laboratory. The robot, a GMF S100, permits curriculum enhancements
in both the lower an upper divisions. In the lower division, courses on
contemporary manufacturing operations include topics requiring entry level
programming of the robot. Upper division courses in computer aided manufacturing
and the senior design course expose student to advance device programming and
operation. The upper division students utilize the programmable robot to produce
products. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
