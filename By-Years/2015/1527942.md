Regulated markets for health insurance are increasingly important in the United
States. The goal of this project is to investigate how efficiently these markets
can operate, and how well competition between private insurers can work. We
focus on the U.S. Medicare program. Almost a third of Medicare beneficiaries now
enroll in private insurance plans through Medicare Advantage, and there is
detailed administrative data available from Medicare, and recently from private
insurers. The fact Medicare private plans operate in parallel to, and in
competition with public fee-for-service Medicare, allows for a comparison
between private and publicly administered health insurance. The large size of
the Medicare program --- the federal government spends over $130 billion
annually on Medicare private plans --- also makes it
consequential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project will address three specific
questions: (1) How efficient is the current Medicare managed competition system?
(2) Are there program changes that would reduce taxpayer costs without making
beneficiaries worse off? (3) Do private plans achieve cost savings relative to
public insurance, and if so, how do they do it? To answer these questions, the
PIs will use medical claims data to compare the services provided and costs
associated with private and public insurance plans. They will also estimate
models of health plan choice and competition between insurers, and use these
models to analyze the welfare effects of private plans for enrollees, insurers
and taxpayers. Findings on the operational and cost differences between private
insurance plans and public insurance, and on how well market competition is
functioning, will be of interest both to economists and a wider audience.
