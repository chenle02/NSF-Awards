This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Research Phase I project seeks to develop advanced heat transfer fluids using
nano-structured carbons. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with a thermal conductivity of
~2000 W/m-K, are proposed at loadings which do not sacrifice fluid flow and
viscosity. Nanofluids will be fabricated by tailoring the CNFs structure and
surface functionalities to meet the above specifications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully commercialized, Nanofluids will make
significant energy efficiency and cost reduction gains for air conditioning, and
will be useful for cooling of under-the-hood electronics of hybrid electric and
electric vehicles and high power microelectronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
