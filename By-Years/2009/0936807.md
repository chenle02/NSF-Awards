In 2008, researchers from Sam Houston State University (SHSU) collected 230
mammals, 38 reptiles, over 80 owl pellets, and hundreds of vertebrate fossils
from the Koanaka Hills of northwestern Botswana. Just two months later, vast
expanses of Botswana including the study area were razed by wildfire. The
occurrence of these fires immediately after a comprehensive sampling effort
allows this project to immediately address unanticipated research questions
through a second expedition in July 2009. The replication of previous collection
efforts will help explain changes in species composition, abundance, and genetic
diversity within animal communities following catastrophic fire. Conceptual
studies of biodiversity on both a regional and temporal scale will follow. The
research will test hypotheses concerning the effects of fire on animal
composition of modern and fossil-rich Plio-Pleistocene cave deposits in the
Koanaka Hills and will be invaluable to the reconstruction of past climates
throughout southern Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include
introducing U.S. and Botswanan students to field work, specimen preservation,
and taxonomic studies. Educational opportunities will be provided for at least
10 undergraduate and six graduate students from at least two U.S. institutions,
and public outreach is assured through an established relationship between SHSU
and the Botswana National Museum (BNM). Personnel from the BNM will join in
field activities, enabling them to conduct biodiversity investigations on their
own and to subsequently process and curate specimens properly for their national
collections. This multidisciplinary project fosters long-term multinational and
multi-institutional research and intellectual interaction among scientists and
students from the U.S. and Botswana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
