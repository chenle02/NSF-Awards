Previous research on threshold methods and extreme values is in the process of
being extended from the case of univariate time series, to multivariate or
spatial data. This is particularly relevant in climatological research because
of the need to combine data from many measuring stations. The climatological
objective is to come up with measures of trend among the crossings by a
temperature series of a very high or very low threshold. A second objective is
to look at alternatives to the standard models for time series. In particular
the concept of long-range dependence appears to be important in climatology, and
the research will explore methods of measuring this from the low- frequency
behavior of the periodogram. An important theme of current climate research is
the need for reliable statistical measures of greenhouse-gas-induced climate
change. Global warming would cause an increase in extreme temperatures. This
research will study the statistical aspects of these extreme values, paying
particular attention to the problem of efficiently combining information from a
number of measuring stations.
