This study is an experimental and theoretical investigation of cation and anion
distributions in minerals. Experimental study of cation distributions will
primarily use the method of electron-channeling (ALCHEMI) with supporting
studies using x-ray and neutron diffraction. There are two main objectives of
the cation studies. The first is to make a detailed assessment of the errors in
ALCHEMI by comparing results of channeling experiments on a number of phases
with occupancies determined on the same samples by other well-established
methods. The second objective is to exploit some of the unique advantages of the
method in conducting qualitative and semi-quantitative determinations of site
occupancies and site preferences in a number of geologically and geophysically
significant minerals.
