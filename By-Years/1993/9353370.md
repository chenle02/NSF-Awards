9353370 Geer This project, sponsored by the American Meteorological Society in
partnership with the United States Naval Academy and assisted by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the State University of New York at
Brockport, will conduct a three and one- half year national teacher enhancement
program to train 72 master precollege teachers in the physical science
foundations of selected topics in oceanographic science. The teachers will be
mainly middle-school teachers (Grades 6-8), joined by some high school teachers
(Grades 9-12). All will be selected through a highly competitive process and
will attend a two week summer program with a follow-up during the academic year
and the following summer. All participants are expected to carry out in-service
activities. Based upon the experience of earlier projects it is anticipated that
more than 1500 teachers will be impacted by the project. In addition to the
teacher enhancement component the project develops modules in oceanographic
science utilizing the most up-to-date information prepared by experts in the
field. Based upon these teaching materials an instructional resource manual,
including classroom ready activities will be produced and distributed directly
to teachers.
