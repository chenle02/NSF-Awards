Funding from the NSF's Academic Research Infrastructure Program will enable
Grinnell College to renovate research laboratories in the Bowen Hall of Science.
Constructed in 1952, space dedicated to the Department of Physics has never been
renovated. During the time when the floor plan for Physics was designed,
research was very limited. However, since the 1980's the level of research and
research training activities have increased at a higher rate. To accommodate
this growth, the physics research and research training program began to utilize
spaces originally designed for instruction that now cannot adequately support
these functions. The renovation plan targets specific areas in physics where
investigations in atomic, laser and optical physics, astronomy, and cryogenics
research take place. Funds will be used to reorganize laboratory space, update
electrical, HVAC, plumbing systems, purchase new lab casework, and bring labs
into compliance with ADA and safety standards. Not only will the completion of
the project enable Grinnell faculty and students to perform research that is not
feasible in the current facility, but it will help the Department integrate
research experience with education, stimulating students to pursue advance
studies in physics.
