Illinois Institute of Technology as the lead institution is collaborating with
Michigan Technological University, Purdue University and Lehigh University to:
1) develop a database of reliable and valid measures for assessing attainment of
teamwork skills and ethical awareness in undergraduate students enrolled in
multidisciplinary design projects and 2) identify and describe best practices
from across these institutions that improve the achievement of team Learning
Objectives and thereby increase program quality. The goals are consistent with
the objectives of: 1) assessing student achievement, 2) creating new learning
materials and teaching strategies, 3) developing innovative approaches and 4)
inclusion of a large diverse student population. Included in the project
outcomes are: 1) a Guide for Assessing Multidisciplinary Teamwork and Ethical
Awareness. This Guide contains self-assessments, peer assessments, and direct
evaluations of work products and learning artifacts including descriptions of
each measure, data on reliability and validity, and observations about the
strengths and limitations of each measurable outcome; 2) a set of online
learning materials and examples of best practices for developing competencies in
interdisciplinary teamwork and ethical awareness within multidisciplinary
undergraduate design project teams.
