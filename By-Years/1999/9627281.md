9627281 Dickey The University of California- Santa Barbara will continue a
project initiated earlier to facilitate development, testing, and calibration of
new and existing sensors and systems for ocean science research on a testbed
mooring near Bermuda. The goal of this project is to test various sensors for
long-term deployments as part of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series (BATS), JGOFS,
and GLOBEC global change research projects. The project will make use of an
existing mooring, Altomoor II, that is sponsored by the Office of Naval
Research. The testbed mooring will serve two important functions: 1) to provide
a platform for developing and testing emerging interdisciplinary sensors and
systems and 2) to provide high frequency, long-term interdisciplinary data to
sample variables relevant to upper ocean physics, optics, biology,
biogeochemistry, and carbon fluxes at a site regularly sampled using ships and
sediment traps.
