ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.:
CTS-0347381&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS: V. GANESAN&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: A MULTISCALE APPROACH
FOR THE FLOW BEHAVIOR OF INHOMOGENEOUS MULTICOMPONENT POLYMERIC
MATERIALS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multiscale approach, involving the
synergistic application of Brownian Dynamics-based simulation along with
nonequilibrium thermodynamics and kinetic theories to develop macroscale models
that can be used to predict the rheology and response of inhomogeneous and self-
assembled polymers. The long-term goal of this project envisions the application
of the macroscale dynamical models to develop a framework for the design of
advanced polymeric materials. Technological advances in the context of
electronic storage devices, and the development of composite polymeric materials
with novel properties, depend critically on the design and production of
inhomogeneous multicomponent polymers. The educational plan is well integrated
with research and focuses on course development and outreach. A broader impact
goal is to enhance diversity by involving undergraduate researchers recruited
through the Texas Research Experience Program, which targets students from
under-represented and minority groups. Broad impacts of the work include an on-
going collaboration with the office of Equal Opportunity in Engineering program
(one of the most comprehensive outreach programs at UT Austin aimed at
diversifying the student body) will target students from under-represented and
minority groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
