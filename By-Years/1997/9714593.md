The Millstone Hill Observatory, an incoherent scatter radar facility, continues
its radar and optical research activities of the earth's upper atmosphere.
Extensive ionospheric observations capabilities encompass mid-latitude, sub-
auroral, and auroral features and processes. The Observatory's radar operations
support programs like World Day, CEDAR and GEM in community-directed research.
In addition, it supports optical experiments and Fabry-Perot interferometer and
photometer observations, in conjunction with radar experiments addressing
neutral atmospheric dynamics and temperatures. Resulting radar and optical data
is deposited in the CEDAR database at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research, where it can be accessed by students and external investigators.
