The present proposal centers on the dynamics of Rydberg atoms in strong electric
and magnetic fields. The research will extend and apply a recently developed,
mathematically precise, transition state theory to the chaotic scattering of
Rydberg atoms. Other projects include a study of ultracold Rydberg plasmas in
strong magnetic fields and the ionization of Rydberg atoms in microwave fields.
