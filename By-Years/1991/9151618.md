The project goal is to provide a strong emphasis on the design process itself,
on the interconnection between manufacturing and design, and on design for
specified reliability, quality, maintainability, and/or cost. The laboratory
emphasizes the interrelation between design and manufacturing, with extensive
usage of CAD/CAM. Experiments to test strength under static and dynamic loading
(fatigue), reliability, and surface topography of product are included.
Experiments to control the stability of manufacturing processes are also
provided.
