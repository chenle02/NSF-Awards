The area of automatic indexing is to be explored via automatic content
abstraction from a semantic perspective. Robust language processing techniques
are used to generate multipurpose data structures called lexical webs. These
are, in turn, used in an automated semantic indexing program designed to parse,
index, and hyperlink on-line texts. The research involves three major areas:
data structure design for implementation of lexical webs; design of lexical web
acquisition tools that utilize linguistic and statistical heuristics for
developing robust finite-state grammars for chunking of significant phrase-level
and discourse-level constituents; and design of document annotation tools that
annotate a text with lexical webs by creating appropriate hyperlinks. The
creation of lexical webs can accelerate the availability of information in a
highly indexed and cross- indexed format, facilitating navigation and rapid
information access.
