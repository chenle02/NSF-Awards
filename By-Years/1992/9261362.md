The ability to measure body composition, as reflected in body fat percentage, is
essential for diagnosis, treatment, and research investigation related to
obesity, malnutrition, eating disorders, diabetes, heart disease, athletic
training, and physical fitness. A method for body composition measurement which
brings Archimedes' principle "on dry land" will be developed. Rather than
determining the volume of subjects by immersion in water, the differential
buoyancy acting on subjects in safely breathable atmospheres which differ in
density will be determined. This method will not require the cooperation of the
patient and does not require the measurement of residual lung volume.
Furthermore, it is independent of the distribution pattern of fat and does not
require calibration against another method. This Phase I project is aimed at
optimizing the precision, speed, and reliability of the method through
automation of the measurement process.
