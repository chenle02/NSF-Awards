This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, is focussed on electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes at
semiconductors. During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor
Bard and his students at the University of Texas at Austin will pursue a broad
experimental program having four primary thrusts: (1) investigations od
semiconductor/liquid interfaces using scanning probe microscopies; (2) studies
of semiconductor nanoparticles, known as "Q-particles," and thin films of
Q-particles on conducting substrates; (3) the identification and evaluation of
new materials and the modification of titanium dioxide as more efficient
photocatalysts; and (4) fundamental investigations of mechanisms of electrode
processes at insulators modeled by conducting electrodes covered with insulating
thin films. This research, which builds upon results obtained under the aegis of
NSF grant CHE-9119851, seeks to provide a better understanding of the
semiconductor/liquid interface and to improve the efficiency of technologically
important semiconductor photoprocesses. Photoelectrochemistry at semiconductor
surfaces is vital to the effective utilization of solar energy in applications
such as the production of useful chemicals or the destruction of chemical
wastes. This research is aimed at improving our understanding of both dark and
photoprocesses at semiconductor/liquid interfaces and the utilization of that
knowledge in the improved design of technoloeically important
photoelectrochemical systems and devices.
