MRI: Acquisition of a Multiphoton Microscope for Biomaterials
Studies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical explanation of the project's broader
significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outstanding feature of multiphoton
microscopy is its ability to simultaneously map chemical and structural
information on the submicron length scale. The Brandeis multiphoton microscope
is being used to elucidate the mechanisms of protein crystallization, to control
protein aggregation for pharmaceutical applications and to develop novel
condensed phases of proteins for drug delivery, all problems of significant
scientific and industrial importance. Students rotate through the microscopy
facility where they are trained on this state-of-the-art equipment. More
broadly, this instrument has become part of the NSF Materials Research
Facilities Network and therefore is available to materials science researchers
nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;This multiphoton microscope provides high resolution optical
images using multiple contrast methods; second harmonic generation, 2- and
3-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging,
FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The
high power laser is also being used to affect the sample, for example, to induce
protein crystal nucleation, to perform laser ablation of microtubules and
muscles and to perform 3D printing. Studies underway at Brandeis include (1)
protein crystal nucleation, (2) active matter structure, (3) membrane
organization, (4) spliceosome assembly and (5) filament assembly in vivo. No
other single instrument has the capability to perform this ensemble of
measurements, combined with the ability to probe and measure the response on
submicron length-scales.
