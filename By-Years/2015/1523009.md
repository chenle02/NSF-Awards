TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial support for travel assistance of US participants to an international
bilateral conference entitled "9th US-Japan Workshop on Advances in
Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Materials," which will be held in Himeji, Japan on May
18th - 22nd, 2015. The co-organizers of this workshop are the PI (University of
Arizona), Prof. Christine Luscombe (University of Washington), Prof. Ikuyoshi
Tomita (Tokyo Institute of Technology), and Prof. Kensuke Naka (Kyoto Institute
of Technology). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of this symposium
are to showcase new research and application directions in the area of
organic/inorganic hybrids, inorganic polymers, and nanocomposite materials.
These materials are important as they exhibit unique and useful properties that
enable applications central to sustainability, energy, homeland security, and
other uses. The workshop will provide an interdisciplinary forum for the
presentation of new and unpublished results in this area and provide a special
opportunity to exchange ideas and information between leading US and Japanese
researchers in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will enable an
interdisciplinary and international venue to showcase new and previously
unpublished results in the field of hybrid materials. It will highlight the
importance and significance of NSF-funded research in this area while helping to
promote new international collaborations. The talks, posters, and abstracts
associated with this symposium will be used to educate new researchers in the
field. This workshop will also serve as an in-depth educational and high-
visibility forum for beginning investigators, graduate students, and
postdoctoral fellows.
