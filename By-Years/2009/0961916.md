This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will investigate recovery
progress and process in communities affected by the L'Aquila earthquake, with
the goal of identifying and collecting the transient data necessary to analyze
and characterize decision-making and progress in recovery and reconstruction.
The city of L'Aquila, Italy and surrounding towns were devastated by a magnitude
6.3 earthquake in April, 2009 and recovery and reconstruction are beginning to
get underway. To study these processes, we will conduct research activities
consisting of observations from community meetings, collection of minutes and
documents from these meetings, face-to-face interviews with community leaders,
public officials and industry experts, and the collection of longitudinal
building-specific data on recovery progress. These activities will be carried
out over the next 9 months to document the major rebuilding and recovery
decisions, including the critical months in which plans are made and
implemented. Analysis of these observations, interviews and document analysis
will contribute to knowledge on recovery processes following disaster, including
the establishment of priorities, the role of community groups, building industry
and local politicians in shaping the agenda, and the incorporation of available
information about seismic risk, building standards and mitigation strategies in
this process.

This research seeks to improve understanding of the multidisciplinary socio-
technological aspects of decision-making related to risk mitigation and recovery
in the built environment. Lessons learned about the engineering, cultural and
political factors affecting recovery and rebuilding decision-making will be used
to make recommendations for improved risk mitigation and recovery plans in the
U.S., as well as Italy. The project will engage an interdisciplinary cross-
cultural collaboration, linking engineering and sociology researchers with their
Italian counterparts.
