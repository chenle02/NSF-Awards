The University of California - San Diego will hold the 2017 University of
California Chemical Symposium for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.
The objectives are to provide the opportunity for early career scientists to
present research, engage in social networking, improve communication and
presentation skills for a general audience, explore future career path options,
and develop mentorship and leadership skills. Participants will learn about the
current state of chemical sciences within a range of disciplines and how to
prepare for academic and nonacademic jobs. The symposium is expected to advance
the array of chemical sciences and, at the same time, initiate collaborations
and encourage discussions about future direction of these STEM fields.
