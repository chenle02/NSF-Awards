The project is addressing three significant national problems facing
undergraduate physics, chemistry, and calculus: low student retention rates;
limited ability of students to transfer their knowledge of calculus, chemistry,
and physics among the three disciplines; lack of motivation and excitement for
science and mathematics. To impact these problems, a coordinated program for
introductory physics, chemistry, and calculus is being developed around a common
set of conceptual themes, instructional formats, and cognitive and psychomotor
skills. Extensive use is being made of computers as tools for data acquisition,
analysis, and description; Computer-aided writing tasks are an integral part of
all student activities.
