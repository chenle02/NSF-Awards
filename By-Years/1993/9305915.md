This grant provides partial support for the 1993 Nuclear Chemistry Gordon
Research Conference, to be held at New London, New Hampshire, 5-9 July. This
year the conference will deal with topics in Nuclear Structure where new large
detector arrays and recent advances in radioactive beam techniques have provided
new interesting data and corresponding increases in theoretical activity.
