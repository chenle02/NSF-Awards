This project is in the field of representation theory, with connections to
theoretical physics. Representation theory is the branch of mathematics
concerned with the study of symmetry using techniques from linear algebra.
Classical examples of symmetry in geometry include reflections of a square and
rotations of a sphere. Modern research in mathematics naturally encounters more
abstract notions of symmetry and so requires the development of more advanced
techniques for their study. This project will identify and study concrete
instances of these abstract symmetries and apply the results to advance the
mathematical understanding of quantum field theory in dimensions two (via
Landau-Ginzburg models) and three (via Rozansky-Witten models). Two novel
features of these quantum field theories are that they are defined on non-
orientable geometries or involve non-semisimple categories of line operators;
both features make them particularly challenging to study. This project provides
research and career training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and
graduate students.

More specifically, the PI will engage in three related research projects, all of
which involve students. Through the first project the PI will develop a theory
of real equivariant matrix factorizations, using techniques from categorical
representation theory, and apply the results to formulate a mathematical theory
of Landau-Ginzburg orientifolds. In the second project the PI will extend prior
work on the representation theory of cohomological Hall algebras and its
applications to orientifold Donaldson-Thomas theory. In the third project the PI
will use the representation theory of quantum supergroups to construct the
equivariant Rozansky-Witten theory of a holomorphic symplectic manifold. The
first two projects involve physical theories which are unoriented; all three are
non-semisimple. The physical origins of the representation theories considered
suggest many non-trivial interrelations.
