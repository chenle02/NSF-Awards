Schweizer AST-9529263 Collisions and mergers of galaxies in the past seem to
have played a major role in determining the shapes and dynamics of present day
galaxies. A few galactic mergers are still occurring and offer us valuable clues
to past evolutionary processes. Dr. Schweizer will pursue a two pronged program
of astronomical observations aimed at dating ancient and recent merger events in
nearby galaxies and at studying the dynamics of ongoing mergers.
