This award provides funding to Clarkson University for the support of a three-
year REU in Environmental Sciences and Engineering under the direction of Dr.
Stefan J. Grimberg. This 10-week summer program will provide seven undergraduate
students with the opportunity to conduct independent research within the area of
sustainable management of environmental systems with the assistance of a faculty
mentor. In addition, the students will participate in research group meetings,
write a report, present their work at a University-wide undergraduate research
symposium and will be encouraged to publish their work in peer reviewed
publications.
