This research program will use the multiwavelength data on the COSMOS field to
select Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) with a wide range of optical and IR
properties. Multi-object spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS will be used to
spectroscopically confirm ~3000 AGNs, reaching the classical Seyfert/quasar
boundary at a redshift of 3 and including about 300 quasars with redshift &gt;
3. The deep multiwavelength observations will allow studies of the total AGN
energy density in the universe, including a bolometric luminosity function for
obscured AGN to redshift ~1 and Type 1 AGN to redshfit ~4. Time domain data will
be used to measure reverberation between the continuum and the lines.
