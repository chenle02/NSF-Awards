9403683 Felder This Phase II SBIR project is for the efficient collection and
separation of ultra-fine particles from carrier gas streams. The proposed
process should classify and separate these ultra-fine particles by their size.
It uses a supersonic jet to carry the particles to a gas counterflow region
where the particles separate into a collection region by virtue of their
momentum. The proposed method would permit the separation and collection of pure
solid particles resulting from combustion or other synthesis methods, including
those resulting in high gas temperatures. The commercial applications of this
process, if successful, would range from particle collection from combustion
synthesis to the replacement of filters, cyclones, or precipitators.
