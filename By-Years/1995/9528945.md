95-28945 Tayal, Swaraj Dr. Tayal will carry out accurate and comprehensive
calculations of oscillator strengths, photoionization and electron collisional
excitation cross sections of S, Fe, Ni and Cu atoms and ions. These atomic data
are required for a quantitative analysis of stellar spectra, especially those
observed in the ultraviolet. These studies also will provide further physical
insight into the basic aspects of atomic structure and collisional processes.
