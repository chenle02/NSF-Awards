Novel hardware technologies and application requirements have recently triggered
a flurry of research and development into new data management systems. These
systems challenge the hegemony of ossified, legacy database systems which lack
the agility to adapt to these new constraints. But features pioneered by legacy
systems (e.g., declarative query processing) are still desirable, and therefore,
much work is being devoted to designing components that provide these features
in new systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to support
research and development of (query) optimizers in data management systems.
Optimizers, which translate declarative descriptions of data (queries) into
executable plans, are inherently complex but nonetheless, there are no software
engineering tools dedicated to their development. Therefore this project aims to
design and build DEVEL-OP: a dedicated DEVELopment Environment for OPtimizers
consisting of the following suites of tools:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Component
Generators, which use declarative specifications of components to produce
executable code. Developers can use generators to rapidly prototype alternative
versions of components encompassing different optimization
approaches,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 2) Profiling Tools, which help developers
identify bugs or performance bottlenecks in generated components,
and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 3) Component Benchmarks, which enable the evaluation
of optimization approaches (as manifested in generated components) in terms of
their effectiveness and robustness in contributing to optimization as a
whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEVEL-OP provides a sandbox where optimizers can be
quickly prototyped, refined and compared with minimal effort. Therefore, its
impact will be in applying software engineering methodologies to the inherently
difficult and complex development process for this key component of data
management systems.
