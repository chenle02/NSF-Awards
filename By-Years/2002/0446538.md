Humans, chimps, and dogs alike notice and make sense of similarities in their
experience of the world. Some things can be eaten, others can be sat upon, still
others afford walking upon, past, or through, or even talking to. Apparently
only humans give names to these noticeable similarities. One might think that
the things named are those most important to human thought. Yet languages differ
from one to the other in this respect, they do not carve up the world in the
same way. In English we call some colors blue and other colors purple, but other
languages have a single name to cover both. The extents to which languages are
alike or different tell us much about human thought and how people come to
understand their language. With NSF support, Dr. Barbara Malt and Dr. Phillip
Wolff will bring together psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists to share
data about these similarities and differences across languages. These scientists
will explore how words capture human experience and discuss together the
implications for understanding thought and language. The broader impacts of this
workshop include the inherent multi-cultural and multi-linguistic dimensions of
the problem. The participants come from different disciplines and diverse parts
of the world. Consequently the workshop will foster new international and inter-
disciplinary collaborations, highlight the importance of cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural research, and recruit graduate students from diverse linguistic
and cultural backgrounds. The knowledge gained will improve understanding of how
people from different cultures talk and think. Practical spin-offs of this work
include improved understanding of obstacles in the path of second language
learning, automated translation software, and natural language interfaces for
computers.
