This project will apply Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), a technique for
analyzing time series recently developed by Huang et alia (1998), to the 45-year
long NCEP reanalysis assimilation in order to study the spatial and temporal
structure present in low frequency atmospheric variability. Such variability
includes the global Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, a possible El Nino-Southern
Oscillation mode, a possible 11-year solar cycle signal, a 22-year cycle (so far
unidentified) and a warming trend in the troposphere believed to arise from
cooling of the stratosphere. The principal objective of this work is to
understand the nature of low frequency variability in the atmosphere, perhaps
offering a facility to differentiate between the naturally-occurring and
anthropogenically-induced components of this
variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of a new method (EMD) will broaden the
scope of analysis techniques to probe long-term variability in the atmosphere.
The results are expected to benefit the scientific community, and will be
disseminated via international scientific journals and major conferences. One
female post-doctoral student will receive support and training.
