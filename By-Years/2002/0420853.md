The objective of this research is to develop an ultra high vacuum materials
deposition and characterization system. The system will provide combined
deposition and analysis capabilities not currently available at TTU,
significantly enhancing our materials research and educational efforts.
Development of these capabilities will have an immediate impact on numerous
projects funded by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The system will be used to
conduct basic and applied research in thin film deposition and surface analysis.
In large bandgap materials, our recent work has demonstrated ultraviolet LEDs
operating at wavelength 262 nm. New questions regard the influence of surface
chemistry and metallization on contact formation. The development of
microelectronic materials with high dielectric constant leads to questions on
the importance of silicon gate-dielectric interface. Our nano-engineered
energetic materials rely on interdiffusion reactions. To optimize structures for
energy storage and release, improvements are needed in control over deposition
and in situ characterization to study the reactions. MOEMS research involves
micromirror development and basic studies of wear. Surface characterization will
advance our efforts in stiction and friction remediation and extend our MOEMS
research into of fatigue and failure. Broader Impact: This instrumentation
impacts numerous ongoing research projects and enhances our interactions with
industry and national laboratories. The scope of our studies is broad, and spans
numerous areas in science and engineering. The TTU Nano Tech Center provides an
interdisciplinary setting with excellent technical, team, and leadership
building opportunities for postdoctoral researchers and students at all levels
through research and courses conducted within Center facilities.&lt;br/&gt;
