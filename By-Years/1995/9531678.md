*** 9531678 Stark This action is to support a Workshop on the Post-Liquefaction
Behavior of Soils, to be held in April, 1997 on the campus of the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Approximately 20 experts in the fields of soil
liquefaction, granular fluid flow, seismic slope stability, and the seismically-
induced permanent deformations of soils will be invited to participate,
representing industry, government, and academia, and providing a broad range of
background and perspective on the problems to be discussed. The workshop will
evaluate the state-of-the-art and the state-of-practice of the post-liquefaction
behavior of soils; provide recommendations for use of the post-liquefaction
shear strength in stability and deformation analyses; and identify and
prioritize research needs for the future. A report presenting the Executive
Summary, Findings, Recommendations and Conclusions of the Workshop will be
available for electronic transmission in the ASCII file format, and will also be
posted on the World Wide Web.***
