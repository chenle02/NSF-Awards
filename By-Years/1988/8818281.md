This grant supports research using the newly upgraded MP tandem Van de Graaff
accelerator, a variety of experimental equipment, and a unique recoil mass
spectrometer, at the University of Rochester's Nuclear Structure Research
Laboratory. Experiments will include studies of nuclear shapes by Coulomb
excitation, of heavy-ion induced transfer reactions, of nuclear isomers on a
microsecond timescale, the spectroscopy of neutron deficient nuclei particularly
the light krypton isotypes, of hyperine interactions, of correlated two photon
decay in heavy-ion reactions, of breakup processes in 7Li- induced reactions, of
sub-barrier transfer, and of heavy ion reaction mechanisms. In addition,
accelerator mass spectrometry will be investigated in a wide variety of fields
including geology, hydrology, cosmochemistry, Ca-41 dating of old bones,
materials research and nuclear reaction cross sections. Some of the work
involves extensive collaborations with outside users.
