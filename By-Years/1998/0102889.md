Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0102889&lt;br/&gt;Richard Zare, Stanford
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental processes of biology occur on
the nanoscale. Proteins are on the order of few nanometers; the organelles
essential to cellular function are tens or hundreds of nanometers. Direct
investigation of these structures has been limited by the difficulty of making
tools of compatible size. A novel tool is proposed that may enable the
manipulation and investigation of individual nanoscale biological objects with
control and flexibility impossible with existing tools. A nanoengineering
process that produces pipettes especially has been designed for the robust
manipulation of small biological objects, such as vesicles. Unlike the
conventional pipettes routinely used in electrophysiology, the proposed pipettes
have a concave seating surface at their tips. This seating surface provides a
large contact area between the pipette and the object being held, resulting in
excellent stability and control. In addition, the size of the seating surface
can be tailored to hold objects of varying sizes, from tens of microns to
hundreds of nanometers. The lower size limit is compatible with a wide range of
subcellular organelles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A further extension of our pipettes
is as delivery devices. It is proposed to combine electrophysiological and
chemical composition analyses by coupling patch clamp and capillary
electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence. This novel coupling of analysis
techniques will enable the further elucidation of vesicle-to-vesicle differences
by combining information about morphology, electrophysiology, and chemical
composition. The significance of biological heterogeneity is only beginning to
be explored. The tools we propose may afford new insights on this intriguing
biological problem. &lt;br/&gt;
