The everyday definition of the word ?map? is ?a diagrammatic representation of
an area of land or sea showing physical features, cities, roads, etc.?
Cartographers construct maps to reveal interesting spacial information about a
geographical region. In a similar way, mathematicians construct maps between
geometric spaces to discover interesting features of those spaces. Here, by a
geometric space, we mean a space equipped with notions of angles, distances,
areas, etc. They include Euclidean spaces which are often used to model our
everyday physical world or non-Euclidean or Riemannian spaces which can be used
as a large scale model of our universe. This award provides funding to study
special maps between geometric spaces called harmonic maps that minimize a
certain notion of energy. By analyzing harmonic maps, the PI aims to uncover
properties of important geometric spaces that would lead to a greater
understanding of the natural world. The mathematical theory of harmonic maps has
been applied in diverse fields such as medicine (for example, in medical
imaging) and computer science (for example, in computer vision), and has further
potential applications aiding in the scientific progress and welfare of our
society. The project also has an educational component and supports diversity by
teaching and advising graduate students, post-doc and early career
mathematicians especially those who are underrepresented in the STEM fields.

The project focuses on harmonic maps in spaces with an upper curvature bound. A
harmonic map between Riemannian manifolds is a solution to a certain system of
elliptic partial differential equations (harmonic map equations) and is also a
solution to a variational problem involving the Dirichlet energy. Since the
emergence of modern geometric analysis as a core mathematical discipline, the
harmonic map theory has been at the forefront of the field and important
applications continue to be found. A more recent development is the study of
harmonic maps into complete metric spaces satisfying an upper curvature bound.
The goal of this project is to develop this theory in order to apply it to solve
rigidity problems, to understand the structure of surface fibration over Kahler
manifolds and projective varieties, and to study quasiconformal maps.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
