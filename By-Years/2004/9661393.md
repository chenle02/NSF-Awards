*** 9661393 McGraw This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is to
do Dynamic test data generation to reduce test generation problems to a simpler
problem of function minimization and explore a promising approach to the problem
of finding test inputs that satisfy complex constraints. Genetic algorithms to
perform this function minimization will be used in place of the simple gradient-
descent method that is currently used. Also, the application of dynamic software
analysis to the problem of deciding which program execution path will allow the
constraints to be satisfied most easily will be investigated. In software
testing, it is often desirable to find test inputs that exercise specific
program features. To find these inputs by hand is extremely time-consuming,
especially when the software is complex. Therefore, numerous attempts have been
made to automate the process. Random test data generation consists of generating
test inputs at random. But when the desired inputs must satisfy complex
constraints, a random approach is unlikely to succeed. Symbolic test data
generation executes parts of the software symbolically, constructing an
algebraic description of the constraints that an input must satisfy in order to
exercise the desired feature. But this method falters when certain programming
constructs are encountered. The potential benefactors of the research include
the following industries: aviation, defense, nuclear, telecommunications,
medical, pharmaceutical, transportation, and personal computer software. ***
