Measurement at radio wavelengths is one of the only ways of studying the solar
atmosphere from the ground. This research will observe limb brightening, the
chromosphere and corona at the eclipse of July 1991 with the Caltech
Submillimeter Observatory. These measurements will determine the size of the Sun
as observed at a wavelength of 1 millimeter, the sources of thermal emission in
the submillimeter range, and there will be a search for a variety of spectral
features in both the chromosphere and the corona. These measurements will allow
one to determine the temperature structure of the low solar atmosphere and will
show temperature differences between different regions on the Sun such as
filaments and sunspots. Spectral features such as recombination lines, if found,
should give information on the velocity of matter in the corona and the
chromosphere. Some information on chemical abundances in these regions should
also be obtained. The Principal Investigator is an expert in observational solar
physics and instrumentation.
