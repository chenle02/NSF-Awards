9730584 Ridge This research project focuses upon factors that influence the
adoption of seismic adjustments. Two field experiments will be carried out to
identify three strategies: (1) engaging reciprocity norms through a process of
reciprocal concessions, (2) engaging commitment and consistency motivations
through a process of sequential requests, and (3) engaging normative pressures
through a process of comparative feedback. The research will demonstrate the
power of social influence principles for inducing compliance with seismic safety
adjustment behaviors. It will be the first experimental research in the hazards
domain that systematically manipulates social influence strategies to
investigate their effects on behavioral compliance, thus allowing for casual
inferences to be drawn. Moreover, the research will be conducted in an
understudied seismic zone (Utah) and may increase the level of earthquake
preparedness in a population of vulnerable citizens. ***
