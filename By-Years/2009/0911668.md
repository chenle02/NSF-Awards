Branka Ladanyi of Colorado State University is funded by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to study, using theory and
computer simulation, interfacial and nanoconfined fluids. These topics are
closely related, given that interfaces play an important role in influencing the
properties of confined fluids. Ladanyi and her research group study are gaining
a better understanding of the molecular-scale properties of water near extended
hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. They are also exploring the mesoscopic
properties of liquid/liquid interfaces in order to characterize capillary waves
and their effects on the interfacial structure as well as to model and analyze
experimental data obtained in X-ray reflectivity experiments. Additionally, they
study fluids confined in nanoscale dimensions. Such fluids possess properties
that differ considerably from the corresponding bulk phases due to reduced
dimensionality and interfacial effects. Understanding the properties of liquid
interfaces and nanoconfined fluids impacts many areas. Hydrophobic liquids and
surfactants occur in biological systems such as proteins and membranes.
Understanding how the properties of confined liquids differ from the bulk is
important for numerous technological applications, including catalysis,
nanoparticle synthesis, lubrication, chromatography, oil recovery, cellular
dynamics and microfluidics.
