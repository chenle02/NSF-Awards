The overall objective of this conference is to bring together researchers from
throughout the world working in various aspects of visualization in order to
present and discuss approaches, tools, and techniques associated with
visualization science in general, and in particular visualization in biomedical
computing. Visualization in scientific and engineering research is rapidly
emerging and increasingly important discipline aimed at developing tools and
approaches to facilitate the interpretation of, and interaction with, large
amounts of data, thereby allowing researchers to "see" and comprehend, in a new
and deeper manner, the systems they are studying. With this in mind, the
conference will help to further the field of visualization by exploring
fundamental problems and issues in two conference tracks: one track will be
applications-oriented, and the other track will focus on theoretical
considerations. These tracks will be designed to contribute to a better
understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of visualization and of the
current tools and techniques associated with this discipline. //
