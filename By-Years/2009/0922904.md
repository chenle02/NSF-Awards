With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Patrick M. Hare and his colleagues Stefan Paula and Keith A. Walters will
upgrade a fluorometer to a picosecond time-resolved, variable excitation
wavelength instrument that will enhance both the research and education programs
at Northern Kentucky University. Three areas of research will be benefit from
the new capability: 1) Organometallic Supramolecular Chemistry of Fullerene-
Transition Metal Systems; 2) Spectroscopic Characterization of Novel Inhibitors
of the Sarco/endoplasmic Reticulum ATPase (SERCA); and 3) Photophysics of
Endocrine Disrupting Compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emission lifetime
fluorescence spectrophotometers measure the time decay of the light emitted from
a sample that has been promoted to an excited state by a light source. This
provides insight on the mechanisms of energy transfer and loss in chemical and
biological systems. It can reveal information on how substrates interact with
enzymes or new materials can be used in solar cells, among other possible
applications. The instrument will be used in research and laboratory classes by
undergraduate students.
