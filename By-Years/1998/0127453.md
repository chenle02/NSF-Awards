0127453 Klieger This exploratory research studies an ancient trade route between
northern Myanmar (Burma), Tibet and Yunnan Province of China. The principal
investigator, an anthropologist, and a photojournalist will travel where few
outsiders have ever received permission to travel, the Hkakabo Razi region of
Myanmar. The project will examine trade relationships between highland people of
Myanmar and Tibetan traders, exchanging salt for forest products. They will
gather information on the history of trade relations and kinship ties in the
region, with an eye towards documenting the traditional pattern of behavior
before rapid change begins. The research is important as it will provide a
baseline of information about the Taron people living in this little-known
region. This sort of research also provides valuable data about the persistence
of cultural groups in isolated regions.
