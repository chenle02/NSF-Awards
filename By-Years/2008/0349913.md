This award supports the dissertation research of an anthropologist examining
how an individual's reputation, social prestige, social support network, and
perceived financial stability influence decisions of whether or not to make
charitable contributions and how much to donate. Charitable donations are one of
the most important sources of funding for public assistance and service
institutions; yet we do not know how well theories for why people contribute to
public goods explain variation in who donates to charities and in what
circumstances. This research collects data on New Mexicans' voluntary donations
of time and resources to charities to evaluate recently proposed theories that
argue a donor gains social benefits and favorable attention by earning a
reputation for generosity. The research employs private face-to-face interviews
to collect retrospective cross-sectional quantitative and qualitative data on
the charitable donation behaviors and life histories of individuals and
households. The results of this research will be of wide scholarly interest
across several disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, and
psychology. Broader impacts: By increasing our understanding of human
generosity, this research also serves an important social goal in counteracting
the pessimism of social science theories that paint individuals as solely self-
interested and selfish actors. The new knowledge from this study will be useful
to decision makers and planners to help them develop policies to promote
desirable pro-social behaviors. Finally, the research contributes to the
training of a young social scientist.
