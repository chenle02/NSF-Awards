This project continues previous research in network time- synchronization
technology and proposes new algorithms adapted for use in high speed, wide area
networks including supercomputers and superscalar workstations. The technology
makes use of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) widely used now in the Internet,
together with engineered modifications designed to improve accuracy in high
speed networks, including SONET and ATM. The project also involves the design
and construction of precision timekeeping devices that provide improved
timekeeping accuracy which it is expected to improve to some tens of
microseconds in modern RISC-based workstations. Finally, the project involves
the conduct of experiments designed to evaluate the success of the research and
assist technology transfer to computer manufacturers and network providers. The
requested support will permit the assignment of professional management and
staff resources to implement these programs so that the efforts of the regional
and other midlevel network participants can be coordinated.
