The nervous system is composed of two main cell types, neurons and glia. The
long term objective of this research is to elucidate the molecular mechanism
responsible for development of the glial versus neuronal cell identity in the
nervous system. The regulation of two genes, S100B and Glial Fibrillary Acidic
Protein, will be studied. Both of these genes are expressed in glial cells but
not in neuronal cells. These genes will be studies in a cell line developed by
this laboratory from a tumor of neuronal origin. The primary focus of the
current study is to identify and characterize the control elements in these
genes that are responsible for turning on and/or off the production of these
proteins in this cell line. These studies are fundamental to our understanding
of the development of the nervous system.***
