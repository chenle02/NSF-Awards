This research is an extensive program to characterize nonlinear organic
materials to develop theoretical models to better understand the basic physics,
and to construct and characterize prototype devices made from these materials.
Complimentary techniques for measuring the linear and nonlinear properties of
organics will be used. Both resonant and nonresonant nonlinearities will be
investigated. Waveguide and -etalon devices for high speed applications will be
built and tested. Several laser sources including picosecond and femtosecond
systems will be employed.
