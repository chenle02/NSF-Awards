Recent years have seen a dramatic evolution in the area of research and
education networking, enabling faster data rates and novel services to user
communities. The ANSE project integrates these new services, in particular
dynamic bandwidth allocation (DYNES) and real-time network performance
monitoring (perfSONAR), with the higher level workload management software
deployed for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), like PanDA and PhEDEx in the ATLAS
and CMS experiments, respectively. A software defined networking approach, and
in particular the use of dynamic bandwidth allocation capability, already
available in ESnet and Internet2 networks, makes the network a truly manageable
resource, on par with computing (CPU) and storage (disk and tape) resources.
This approach enables smart optimization of resource utilization through co-
scheduling and deadline scheduling algorithms within data and workload
management systems. The ANSE system reacts to real-time conditions such as
network events or node failure, as well as usage specific parameters like
changes in data distribution priorities. Importance is given to the multi-domain
aspects of networking, as required for a globally distributed
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the primary target for ANSE is the LHC
experiments, the ANSE project is clearly applicable to other data intensive
science fields as well. Through the use of recognized standards such as the OGF
NSI, ANSE is applicable beyond the use case of the LHC, and in particular to all
distributed computing and data intensive applications of global scale.
