The National Research Council's Committee on Natural Disasters was established
to maintain readiness for conducting post disaster reconnaissance studies and
documenting perishable information valuable to researchers, planners, designers
and building officials as well as to emergency preparedness officials. Recent
events investigated by the Committee include the September 19, 1985 Mexico
Earthquake and the November 13, 1985 Volcanic Eruption in Colombia. The purpose
of the Committee's studies are to (a) document highly perishable information
immediately following disasters, (b) develop guidance on how engineering and
social science can best be used to improve public safety, and (c) recommend
research needed to improve state-of-the-art in these fields.
