This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is expected to produce a
remote and in situ ultrasonic dew point sensor that has several advantages over
existing optical technology. The advantages include: improved sensitivity and
accuracy, compensation for mirror contamination, elimination of frost point
transition ambiguities, and lower cost. Cost and performance improvements in dew
point instrumentation are particularly important for the study of microscale and
mesoscale weather phenomena where a sensitivity of 0.1 K or less is desired. The
proposed instrument utilizes a dual surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line
design to measure condensation and temperature simultaneously on a monolithic
substrate. This configuration should provide extremely high precision and
reliability since SAW sensors can detect mass changes of less than one monolayer
of dew and measure temperature to an accuracy of 104 K. The design eliminates
the need to indirectly measure dew optically and to attach a temperature sensor
to the chilled surface as is done in most commercial dew point sensors. It is
also expected that the ability to detect dew formation at levels below those
that can be detected optically will result in a compensation method for mirror
contamination. In addition, the ability to determine the phase of the dew will
allow the elimination of frost point ambiguities.
