9725192 Sonder Deformation within lithospheric plates in less well-understood
than the deformations accompanying interaction between plates. Externally
derived forces due to plate interactions can not be wholly responsible for the
within-plate deformation, and include a contribution from lithospheric buoyancy
forces. This project is aimed at assessing the contribution of lithospheric
buoyancy forces to past and present deformation in the western United States,
where an abundance of data may allow the various forces to quantified. The work
involves a combination of extensive mathematical models coupled with various
observational parameters that allow the gravitational potential energy to be
estimated. Results should allow the determinations of the sensitivity of
deformation to different factors such as variation of rheology and boundary
forces related to plate interaction. Validation and refinement of this
relationship between gravitational potential energy and deformation within a
plate will improve understanding of driving forces and deformation in other
parts of the world.
