This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on
quantum fluids. Accurate numerical simulations, based on quantum Monte Carlo
methods, will be performed to study the adsorption of Helium on a variety of
substrates with the aim of investigating novel physical phenomena involving
superfluidity and Bose condensation in confined systems. The PI will study
physisorption of quantum fluids inside carbon nanotubes, in zeolites, and on
alkali metal substrates to include helium mixtures and molecular hydrogen. His
earlier exploration of helium confined in bundles of nanotubes suggested the
possibility of a low temperature transition to a novel anisotropic superfluid
phase and a possible commensurate to incommensurate transition. In this award, a
theoretical investigation of the phase diagram of helium and molecular hydrogen
inside carbon nanotubes will be carried out. It is thought that the confinement
of molecular hydrogen will prevent crystallization at low temperatures enabling
the observation of a superfluid state. Simulations will be performed using
realistic interactions of helium atoms and hydrogen molecules with the confining
system. %%% This award supports theoretical and computational research and
education on quantum fluids. The PI will use quantum Monte Carlo methods to
study helium trapped inside of bundles of carbon nanotubes. The confinement of
the helium atoms inside the carbon nanotube structures alters the properties of
the helium quantum liquid leading to possible novel physical properties. The
system is at sufficiently low temperature that quantum mechanical effects become
important. The PI will also study molecular hydrogen in carbon nanotubes and the
interaction of both liquids with zeolites and alkali metal surfaces that confine
or reduce the dimensionality of the liquid. This research contributes to the
fundamental knowledge of nanostructures and the study of materials on the
nanoscale. ***
