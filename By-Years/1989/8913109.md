This award will support publication costs and manuscripts preparation for the
7th symposium summer school of the U.S. Particle Accelerator School to be held
at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, July 24-Aug 4, 1989. The symposium school
consists of two weeks of intensive short lecture courses on a broad range of
subjects on the Physics and Technology of Particle Accelerators. This year the
subjects will include a discussion on a variety of accelerators, including
pulsed high current accelerators, synchrotron radiation sources, high brightness
beams and free electron lasers, linear colliders and SSC.
