It is planned to investigate techniques for testing object-oriented programs.
Object-oriented programming is a relatively new programming methodology which
has many attractive software engineering features. While traditional programs
are based on the paradigm of active procedures operating on passive data,
object-oriented programming employs the the paradigm of active data objects
which perform operations on themselves. To date, most research on software
testing has focussed on traditional programming languages. The features of
object-oriented programming suggest several additional testing techniques, which
may allow for more effective testing. This research will define several families
of testing techniques for object-oriented programs, build tools based on some of
these techniques, and investigate the cost and effectiveness of the new
techniques.
