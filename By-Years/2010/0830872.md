Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project involves
the development and refinement of Information Assuarance (IA) laboratory systems
with the goal of understanding the roadblocks to implementation, the pedagogical
issues involved, and how to better involve developing IA programs in advanced
teaching technology. The goals for this project are to: (1) Find the issues,
roadblocks, and benefits of using large scale virtual machine laboratories in
both developing and existing IA programs; (2) Address these issues by extending
existing virtual machine laboratory systems and developing new exercises for
them; and (3) Disseminate this work to other faculty through hands-on workshops,
open source software and exercised disseminated via
websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting aspects of this project include the
the integration of virtual machine laboratory systems into cyber-defense
programs for high school and college students. The high school efforts serve as
outreach and recruitment to get high school students involved in IT-related
careers -- an area of national need. Additionally, this effort is tied into a
capstone course for distance education for M.S. students in information
assurance.
