INT 9600473 Yarmoff This U.S.-Czech materials research project between Jory
Yarmoff of the University of California, Riverside, and Zeenek Sroubek of the
Czech Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics, Prague, will feature
investigations of the physics of electronic excitation processes induced in
solids by particle bombardment. Efforts will involve measurements of the
scattered ion energy spectra, neutral fractions, and angular distributions,
along with measurements of the associated electron emissions during low energy
particle scattering and sputtering. The researchers will consider these
excitations in metals, semiconductors and insulators and draw upon theoretical
analyses including molecular dynamics with the use of clusters and
pseudopotentials, as well as complete quantum mechanical models. Results have
potential bearing in modern particle-beam technologies. The project in material
research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ??
