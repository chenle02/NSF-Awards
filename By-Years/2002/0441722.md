This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further
develop a new Flow Path Management System (FPMS) representing an innovation in
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) that is
more effective than existing supply chain management (SCM) software at improving
manufacturing performance, because it incorporates "lean manufacturing"
principles into a set of innovative simulation-based optimization algorithms.
The company will research an innovative application of simulation-based
optimization known as meta modeling to the manufacturing performance problems
common at its customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The company will develop software
that will deliver these algorithms via the Internet and integrate the software
with common back-end legacy systems. If successful, the result of this research
project will provide millions of dollars in inventory savings to manufacturing
customers. Virtual enterprises and smaller manufacturing companies will benefit
from the systems that can be delivered via the World Wide Web.
