9451645 McDaniel This project involves electronic multi-media classrooms and
laboratories designed to incorporate technology into undergraduate instruction
in the social sciences. Faculty members as well are being trained in multi-media
course work development to enable them to provide innovative instruction to
students at the institution. The facilities are curriculum integrated, multi-
faceted, and central to the institution where a variety of learning experiences
take place in an inviting environment. Laboratory instructors also play pivotal
roles by providing services and integrated learning experiences for
undergraduate students. The electronic classroom facilities consist of multi-
media work-stations connected in a PC local area network. Each multi-media work-
station, with the required hardware, has graphics, sound, animation, and
hypertext capabilities to enhance applications and are developed to accommodate
student learning needs.
