Existence of Solutions to Hyperbolic Differential Equations in Mathematical
Physics Project Abstract

Hans Lindblad

This project will concentrate on studying the well-posedness of certain
nonlinear systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). One class
of problems is the free boundary problem for the motion of the surface of a
fluid in a vacuum. Another project is to study global solutions of equations
related to Einstein's equations of general relativity. The basic questions for
these equations include: (i) Do we have local existence and uniqueness of
solutions in a certain class? (ii) Do we have blow-up of solutions? (e.g. black
holes in general relativity) (iii) What is the long time behavior of solutions?

The answers to these questions may provide further understanding of
gravitational waves in the universe. Understanding the properties of, and
controlling the interface between, two fluids may have industrial applications.
