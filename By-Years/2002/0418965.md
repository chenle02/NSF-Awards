The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is John J. Stezowski, assisted by co-PI, T. Adrian
George. The planning activities will develop an Undergraduate Research Center
with participants from regional colleges and universities. Students, along with
faculty mentors from their home institutions, will be matched with University of
Nebraska -Lincoln (UNL) faculty mentors to undertake research projects of mutual
interest. The URC opportunities will be presented to participating faculty
during a 2-day workshop held at UNL. Projects will be focused on topics relevant
to society with emphasis on materials and biochemical systems. Improving the
possibilities for meaningful research for students and faculty at home
institutions will be accomplished through the collaborations and by improving
their on site facilities with equipment procurement support. In the planning
phase, the PI will develop the interactions with faculty at participating
schools, facilitate the development of collaborative projects, and work with the
faculty from regional institutions to determine appropriate equipment requests.
The workshop will be a key activity in developing interest and
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
