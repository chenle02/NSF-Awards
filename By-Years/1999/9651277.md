This project fills a void in an otherwise well-supported Biology program. In
particular, it makes it possible to make sophisticated environmental
measurements, provides equipment to make detailed measurements of plant
responses to environmental variables, and increases computer availability in the
undergraduate Biology courses. Until now, the Biology Department has had no
dedicated computers for undergraduate instruction. The goal of this project is
to improve the quality of the educational experience and techniques learned by
undergraduate students in Ecology, Plant Physiology, Physiological Ecology, and
Independent Research courses offered in Biology. In order to expose students to
environmental measurements, sophisticated biological instrumentation, and to
enhance computer literacy, this project provides funds to purchase a Li-Cor
LI-1200 environmental data recording system, a Li-Cor LI-6400 Portable
Photosynthesis System, and a Dell notebook computer. The environmental sensors
and data-logger teach students how to accurately measure variables that
influence the establishment, survival, productivity, and reproduction of all
organisms. The photosynthesis system allows students to examine carbon dioxide
uptake, water loss, and stomatal responses during photosynthesis in both field
and indoor laboratory settings. The sensors are connected to the portable
computer, so students also learn how to interface equipment to computers and
program the computer for data acquisition. The computer is also used to download
weather data files and climate change datasets from the Internet. The project
can result in a Laboratory Manual for Physiological Ecology. The effectiveness
of the exercises developed around the equipment can be determined by student
evaluations.
