9307092 Johnson The biosynthesis of inositol is temporally and spatially
controlled in Arabidopsis thaliana . Because Arabidopsis is an excellent
organism for experiments in classical and molecular genetics, aspects of the
genetic control of inositol metabolism can be defined using molecular genetics
to study the pivotal biosynthetic enzyme, myoinositol 1 phosphate synthase (MI 1
Psynthase) EC5.5.1.4, which converts glucose 6 phosphate to inositol 1 phosphate
and the pivotal catabolic enzyme, myo inositol oxygenase EC1.13.99.1, which
catalyzes the first step in the inositol oxidation pathway. Studies of these
enzymes and the genes that encode them will contribute to the basic
understanding of the genetic regulation of metabolic processes in plants. The
long term objective of the research is to define, mechanistically, the genetic
control of inositol metabolism in higher plants. Specifically, the work outlined
in this proposal will 1)study (using the cloned Arabidopsis MI 1 Psynthase gene)
mechanism(s) involved in the regulated expression of MI 1 P synthase, 2) locate
MI 1 Psynthase subcelluarly and 3) isolate the inositol oxygenase and its
structural gene from Arabidopsis . %%% Elucidation of mechanisms involved in the
genetic regulation of inositol metabolism is important for understanding plant
growth and development. Inositol, a ubiquitous component of eukaryotic cells,
plays a vital role in the biochemistry and physiology of plants. ***
