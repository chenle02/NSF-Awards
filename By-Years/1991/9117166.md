This award provides partial support for the acquisition, maintenance, and
authentication of plant virus collection at the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). The ATCC plant virus collection maintains and distributes well-
characterized plant viruses, viroids, antisera and molecularly cloned viruses.
With this award, the ATCC will augment the various collection holdings according
to the interests and needs of the scientific community, authenticate its
holdings, upgrade documentation for all cultures and enhance the plant virus
collection database, and provide advice and information on the proper usage of
the cultures. The ATCC Plant Virus Collection is recognized as an official
repository for plant viral germplasm by the American Phytopathological Society
and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses of the International
Union of Microbiological Societies.
