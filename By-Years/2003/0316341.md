Joseph Bruno, Department of Chemistry, Wesleyan University, is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on new
electrocatalysis systems. Bruno is exploring the use of sol-gel electrode
coatings to support and isolate reactive transition metal hydrides. Metal
hydrides are believed to be critical to water-splitting and other processes
involving the transfer of hydrides. Initial catalysts to be explored include
niobium and tantalum porphyrin complexes that readily form inactive species in
solution. If these catalysts can be successfully isolated in the sol-gel
electrode coating, the unproductive side reactions can be minimized or
eliminated.

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports high risk/high impact
research in electrocatalysis. The goal is to develop new catalysts and to test a
system that can efficiently convert protons from water to dihydrogen. This
conversion is an essential component of a hydrogen-based energy economy.
