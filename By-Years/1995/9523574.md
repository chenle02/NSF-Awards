ABSTRACT EEC 9523574 Cheng This is a "TIE" project between the Air Conditioning
and Refrigeration Center (ACRC) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign and the Center for Engineering Tribology at Northwestern University.
The objective of this research is to examine both analytically and
experimentally the seizure process of an aluminum/steel tribocontact. The
experimental portion of this research study will be conducted at the University
of Illinois while the analytical portion of the study will be conducted
Northwestern University. This "TIE" project between the ACRC at Illinois and the
Tribology Center at Northwestern combines the strengths of these two centers to
research a very relevant problem important to a number of industries: air
conditioning and refrigeration, automotive, and aerospace. Additionally, this
research may provide additional insight on the qualitative nature of the wear
and material transfer process in the Aluminum/Steel contact.
