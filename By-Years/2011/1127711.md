Processing of Chromatic Information in the Peripheral Retina There are two types
of light detectors in the human retina, rods and cones. Cones perform best in
daylight conditions, whereas rods are specialized for night vision. In the
daylight, humans are able to perceive color. This is because there are three
different types of cones, each picking up on different spectrums of color (blue,
green, and red). At night, human color perception is relatively impaired.

This study focuses on how the cones and rods operate under less than ideal
conditions; conditions where both rods and cones are detecting light at the same
time but neither detector is operating at its best. Such lighting conditions
would be comparable to those experienced at dawn or dusk. The reason for this
study is that for many years it has been assumed that rods do not contribute to
our ability to perceive color, even under conditions where both rods and cones
are detecting the presence of light. It is now known that rods alter color
perception, so the color of an object seen under daylight conditions may not be
the same as the color seen at dawn or dusk. When color is used to convey
information, but lighting conditions under which the color is viewed are
changing, the information provided by color may not be accurate. The goal of
this study is determine under what conditions failures in color perception arise
and how the visual system may compensate for these failures. The results from
this project may be applied to the design of color monitors, the efficacy of
color information dissemination, and the design of cockpit and/or video
displays.
