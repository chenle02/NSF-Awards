This study will test several hypotheses about organic transformations through
independent thermodynamic models of reversible and irreversible processes in
comples water/mineral/organic systems. The hypotheses to be tested include: (1)
The transformation of solid and liquid organic compounds in heated sediments
near ridge hydrothermal systems can be interpreted in terms of aqueous
alteration, hydrolytic disporportionation, and the approach towar metastable
equilibria using models based on irreversible thermodynamics. (2) Marine
dissolved organic matter is altered into characteristic suites of simple organic
solutes when heated in submarine hydrothermal systems. These compounds are
driven toward metastable states at high temperature, but provide support for
heterotrophic hyperthermophiles when vent fluids mix with seawater. (3) Owing to
coupled electron-transfer processes, there are reaction pathways involving
inorganic and organic sulfur compounds that expedite the transformations
documented in hydrothermal organic compounes.&lt;br/&gt;
