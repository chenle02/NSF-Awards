This is a collaborative proposal with Dr. James Davis of the University of
Illinois (SBR 95107955). The PIs propose to test a new model (the social
judgment scheme model) of group decision making. This model pertains to
decisions concerning continuous variables such as money or other quantities. In
the experiments to be performed by the PIs, the issues to be decided will
include decisions about public hazards that inspire the feeling of dread. The
PIs will manipulate a number of procedural aspects of mock panels or committees
in order to ascertain the influence of these factors. Such factors will include
the group decision rule (e.g., unanimity or majority), group size,
accountability of the group to other constituencies, and framing.
