This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Evan Williams'
postdoctoral research fellowship. A combination of capillary zone
electrophoresis and Fourier transform mass spectrometry will be used to develop
methods for the analysis of complex biological mixtures at the attomole level.
The research involves the construction of instrumentation to do the work, the
development of experimental methodology to enhance sensitivity and minimize
sample size, as well as the development of Hadamard transform methods which
could lead to methods for rapid, simultaneous analyses. %%% This research will
develop methods for analysis of very complex mixtures of biochemicals. Such
techniques could have major impact on the early detection of disease and in
forensic chemistry. The work is also important to basic research scientists who
are studying metabolism and toxicity problems.
