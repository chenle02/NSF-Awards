Innovation in science, technology, economics, health, and other areas of human
activity fundamentally hinges on discovering and leveraging invariances - those
aspects of a system that remain stable across different contexts. In this
research project, the PIs will identify the invariance properties reflected in
individual decision making -- invariances across individuals, across choice
contexts, and across choice tasks. Understanding of invariants of decision
making behavior (and their boundaries) has broad implications in industry,
national security, consumer financial decision making, health decision making
and others, particularly in designing decision support systems, in understanding
consumer behavior, and in enhancing citizen protection against financial and
cyber-predators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three components: 1) to
specify mathematically precise formulations of scientific questions about
invariants of decision making, 2) to conduct laboratory studies of such
invariants, 3) to develop advanced statistical and computational techniques for
the analysis of the obtained data. The team will study a range of customized
mathematical models that may open up new avenues to understanding invariance in
decision making. Building on a long research tradition in multiple disciplines,
the team will study in the laboratory how decision makers trade-off between
rewards and risk, rewards and time delays, and examine the principles that guide
decision making. The novelty of the research resides in its mathematical tools
and in its focus on invariance: across individuals (individual differences),
across choice contexts (different choice options), and across choice tasks (say,
risky choice vs. inter-temporal choice). An additional novel emphasis of the
project is to discover biological markers of invariants in decision making,
examined with respect to MRI measures of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and
brain function, and by investigating nutrient biomarkers of health and
nutrition.
