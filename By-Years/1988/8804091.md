This project will continue research on the dissolution kinetics of minerals in
hydrothermal solutions for the following systems to temperatures of up to 350oC:
calcite and aragonite (near completion); fluorite (near completion); magnetic
and hematite (in progress); albite (recently begun); and the sulfate minerals
barite, celestite and anglesite (new studies). We are also studying the effect
dissolved salts and organic compounds have on dissolution rates of quartz,
fluorite, aragonite, calcite and albite. The effect of strain and mineral defect
densities on dissolution rate is being measured for calcite currently, and will
be expanded to include quartz, fluorite and albite. This work applies to the
genesis of hydrothermal ores and mineral deposits, to late diagenesis, and
mineral alteration processes.
