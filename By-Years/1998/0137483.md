0137483&lt;br/&gt;Hargus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This linguistics project involves
field research on the Yukon dialect of Deg Xinag (also known as Ingalik, Dig
Hit'an), an endangered Athabascan language spoken in several villages along the
lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers and tributaries thereof. Primary results of the
research will be a grammar and a dictionary. A special topic of investigation
for the grammar is a sequence of tense. The proposed project will use standard
linguistic interview techniques to elicit words and sentences, and
grammaticality judgments. Some digital recordings will be made for analysis of
phonetic structures of interest. The value of preserving endangered languages
such as Deg Xinag is twofold. First, the information preserved is a valuable
record of the culture, of interest to future members of the communities. Second,
such information is needed to construct valid theories of human linguistic
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;
