The genetic basis of behavioral incompatibilities between species is pivotal to
understanding the process of how new species originate. This project involves
the Hawaiian cricket in the genus Laupala, a group in which new species have
arisen extremely rapidly. Differences of male mating song, a classic motor
pattern and model in neurobiological research, contributes to reproductive
barriers among species and, in this group, song differences evolved
independently many times. These species hybridize in the laboratory, which
enables replicated studies of the genetic basis of motor behaviors that are
likely involved in the speciation process. Hybrid offspring will be produced
from three independent species pairs. Molecular markers will be used to produce
a genome map of the location of genes and the amount they contribute to the
underlying song differences in the three species pairs. The results of these
studies will reveal whether selection has contributed to the evolution of these
independent species pairs and whether changes have occurred in small or large
steps. This results will enable the eventual cloning of the genes underlying
song differences between species. This research integrates research and
education by involving undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.
Children from Kamehameha Schools on the Big Island of Hawaii will be involved
through a web-based science laboratory on the genetics of song inheritance.
Genome resources will also be developed to bridge non-model genomes in model
species.
