This award provides continuing support for a Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site in the Department of Biological Sciences at Wellesley
College, an undergraduate college for women. Participants will be selected from
junior biology, biological chemistry of psychobiology majors who have serious
purpose and definite interest in independent work, have sufficient course
preparation and have shown ability to think imaginatively and independently.
Participants will be selected by the project director and faculty committee
after evaluation of applications forms designed to recruit the best qualified
students for particular projects. The student will participate in all aspects of
the investigation, from pursuing a literature review to carrying out
experimental procedures and observations, continuing to analysis of data and
determination of conclusions. The student will formally and informally discuss
the work with the advisor, and also will prepare several discussions with all
fellow participants, both student and faculty, for weekly group seminars. This
will encourage both experience with oral presentations and exposure to
suggestions and criticism of others involved in research. Research reports at
the end of the program will involve the writing of a paper, preparation of a
poster for the poster session and also colloquia presentations to students and
faculty during the next academic year. Throughout the summer program seminars
will be presented by women scientists in research careers in academia, industry
and medicine; at least one field trip to a biotechnology company will be taken.
