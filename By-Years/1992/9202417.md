9202417 Maul This proposal requests the funds for a confocal microscope to be
used by a multi-user group. The major users will utilize the instrument in
projects over the long term. Projects include the 3D reconstruction of changing
chromosomal domains during differentiation and of specific and newly found
nuclear domains, the changing inter- relationships of cells during development
or induced differentiation by retinoic acids or by coculture in skin
reconstruction, the different distribution of mRNA in whole developing embryos,
and the relative localization of specific genes in the intact nucleus (mapping).
Aside from these larger projects minor projects have been identified and
initiated by different laboratories at The Wistar Institute in particular in the
developing structural biology program. These will be supervised by the principal
investigator. Projects are diverse and need an efficient way to study cell or
tissue architecture in the 0.1 to 1 m range in specimens that have a thickness
of 0.1-1-mm. Confocal microscopy in its advanced state provides us with the
means to achieve our goals.
