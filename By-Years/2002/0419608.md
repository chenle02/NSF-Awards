This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project evaluates the
advantages of a Flexible Fuel Reformer (FFR) for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC)
that employs unique mechanical construction and operation to enable extended
catalyst life in the presence of coke and sulfur. Phase I research activities
will measure and model basic functional parameters such as pressure drop, flow
distribution, heat transfer, temperature distribution, reaction kinetics, and
catalyst deactivation and regeneration rates as they relate to hydrogen
production. This simple reaction model will be extended to a transient behavior
model that will predict the commercial feasibility of the reformer concept.

The FFR will be able to operate with a variety of liquid fuels such as gasoline
and diesel fuel. Because it will be made in modular form it will be easily sized
to produce hydrogen for fuel cells which generate anywhere from 5kW-50kW of
power. The FFR will be the first compact, lightweight, economical reformer able
to provide a steady supply of hydrogen using distillate fuel. This capability
will result in widespread commercial application.
