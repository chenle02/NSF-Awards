This project is developing new simulation frameworks for the ns-3 discrete-event
network simulator, a free and open-source research tool designed for use by
computer communications network researchers. Simulation remains in heavy use for
network research and education, because of its ease of use, reproducibility,
availability, scalability, and ease of software development. However, the
workflow of a typical simulation study requires the user's careful attention to
a number of best practices in methodology to ensure that the results are
credible and reproducible by third parties and that errors are not introduced.
This project is building an automation framework for the ns-3 simulator that
provides an environment that is more conducive to the creation of rigorous
studies. The automation framework guides the user to produce valid network
simulation models by composition and consistency checking, and definition of
experimental settings. The framework exercises control over large-scale
simulation studies, and applies statistical methods for output data analysis and
execution control. The framework also collect details required to reproduce the
experiment and report results. The framework also allows users to specify wide
ranges of simulation network topologies, application traffic, and other
parameters, allowing experiments to be conducted on a wide range of scenarios
with minimal effort. Finally, maintaining the ns-3 software, documentation, and
dissemination activities continue. The additions to ns-3, disseminated as open
source software, are improving the methodology and credibility for future
simulation-based network research.
