The South Turkana Ecosystem Project (STEP) is a long-term, interdisciplinary
ecosystem-oriented study of Ngisonyoka Turkana pastoral nomads and their
interactions with a dry savanna/woodland ecosystem in Northern Kenya. The
initial objective of STEP in the early 1980s was to determine how Ngisonyoka
pastoralists, with only their traditional technology, managed to survive and
persist in a dry and drought-stressed ecosystem, in the midst of rampant
banditry and inter-tribal warfare. Over the last ten years the project has
conducted a number of studies on landscapes, vegetation, livestock, and people.
The project team will now perform research-synthesis phase of two years duration
for the purpose of pulling together and synthesizing the results of the diverse
disciplinary studies around ecosystem level concepts or particular issues that
have arisen during the course of the work. By integrating the results of field
and modeling work around important issues and concepts it is expected that the
group will (1) demonstrate that studies of human ecology, biology and society
can be integrated into ecosystem science; (2) show that it is feasible to
incorporate climate studies, ecosystem analyses, and social science within a
single investigatory and modeling framework; (3) provide several new insights
into the structure and dynamics of dry tropical ecosystems and, most
importantly; (4) present a holistic portrait of the ecology of pastoral nomads,
their biological, social, and resource exploitation strategies, and their
interactions with their ecosystem.
