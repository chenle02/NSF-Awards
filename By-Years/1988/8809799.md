Steroid hormones produced by the testes or ovaries act on vertebrate brains to
influence a host of processes ranging from sexual behavior to non-reproductive
functions such as feeding, drinking, learning and memory. Progress in unraveling
the neural mechanisms that mediate these steroid influences has been made in
only a few animal models. It is difficult to identify cellular mechanisms by
which sex steroids influence functions such as male sexual and aggressive
behaviors, which respond slowly to changes in gonadal hormone levels. Dr. Geert
DeVries is studying dramatic changes in vasopressin pathways in the brain which
have a similar time course to that found in the male sex behavior. Studying the
nature of these changes and their relationship to hormonally dependent functions
such as male sexual behavior will help to understand the neural basis of slow
changes in behavior.
