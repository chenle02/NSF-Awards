9307685 Gowda An affine complementarity system is defined by a finite number of
linear equalities, linear inequalities, and complementarity conditions. This
project will investigate the theory and computation of affine complementarity
systems based on their equivalent formulation as a system of nonsmooth equations
and on degree theory. On the theoretical side, the goal is to develop a
comprehensive theory covering uniqueness, existence, and sensitivity/stability
aspects of these systems. The aim is to present a unified theory for linear,
mixed linear, vertical, and horizontal complementarity problems, and affine
variational inequalities. On the computational side, the goal is to discover and
analyze feasible/infeasible interior point algorithms for solving affine
complementarity systems. The research will build on work in recent years which
has demonstrated the fruitfulness of nonsmooth-equations and degree theory
approach to variational inequalities, complementarity problems, and nonlinear
programs. ***
