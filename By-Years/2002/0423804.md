This project extends previous work to understand the detailed surface chemistry
of sea salt aerosols. In particular the role of magnesium chloride in
influencing the nature of the surface will be studied as a function of relative
humidity. The goal will be to develop quantitative understanding of the
mechanisms and kinetics of reactions involving sea salt particles under
conditions relevant to the atmosphere in order that such processes can be
accurately incorporated into numerical models of atmospheric chemical processes.
A number of analytical tools will be used including the combination of diffuse
reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and mass
spectrometry, which will allow measurement of gas and condensed phase products
simultaneously. In addition, aerosols will be generated in a reaction chamber
with observations made using long path Fourier transform spectroscopy (LP-FTIR),
differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) in the ultraviolet spectral
region, and atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry (API-
MS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of these activities include improved
quantification of processes to be incorporated into numerical models of
atmospheric chemistry in the marine boundary layer; education and training
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students (including those from
underrepresented groups) and early career scientists; as well as outreach
activities to K-12 students and to the public. This project is supported jointly
by the Atmospheric Chemistry and Analytical and Surface Chemistry Programs.
