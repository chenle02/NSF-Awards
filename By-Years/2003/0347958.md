ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.: CTS-0348149&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL
INVESTIGATORS: K. SHARP&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: PENNSYLVANIA STATE
UNIVERSITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: PARTICLE EFFECTS IN
MICROFLUIDICS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program consists primarily of an
experimental study of the consequences and science underlying a particular
subset of particle effects and particle transport in pressure-driven and
electrokinetic micro fluidic systems. The specific flows of interest are those
in which the particle diameter is of the same order of magnitude as the
characteristic dimension of the characteristic micro fluidic device dimension.
This regime traditionally has not been encountered in macroscale particle-laden
flows, but is expected to gain importance for particle-based assay or
micro/nano-fabrication applications given the continued efforts at device
miniaturization. Over the longer term, the proposed research program will lay
the groundwork for an expansion of scope, namely to include the study of
nanoparticle transport in nanoscale systems. Broad impacts of the work include
significant educational and outreach components. The proposed educational
program aims to increase the participation of traditionally under-represented
groups in science and engineering and, ultimately, related professions, by
providing a unique environment for active discussion of the broader context of
science and research. This program, entitled Expanding View will initially be
designed around the broader issues of Micro and Nanoscale Science and
Engineering and will be offered as an annual Seminar Course with administrative
assistance from the Women in Engineering Program Office at Penn State. Through
Expanding View, undergraduate students will have the opportunity to engage in
team-oriented problem-solving coupled with effective mentoring and peer
interactions, and participate in both on- and off-campus discussions of 'big-
picture' topics such as the societal impact of research, the effects of public
policy decisions on research directions, diversity in the workforce, and
international competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*co-funded
jointly by the Fluid Dynamics &amp; Hydraulics, and Particulate and Multiphase
Processes programs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
