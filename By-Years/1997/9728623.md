CMS 97-28623 Dobry This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is
funded to support research on the development of a new constitutive relation for
sands and other granular media, based on some recent particulate mechanics
findings by the PI. These findings reveal some simple and very powerful
connections between behavior at the article contact level and the desired
constitutive relation. The new relation is based on the force-deformation model
at the contact between two spheres developed by the PI, and it will be
implemented through a computer program. A preliminary assessment indicates that
the new relation will naturally predict the stress-induced anisotropy,
volumetric contraction upon unloading, and densification during cyclic loading
observed experimentally. Parametric studies will be performed with the computer
program, and the predications will be compared with available experimental
results. Finally, ways will be explored to incorporate, also on the basis of
fundamental particulate mechanics consideration, other effects currently not
included in the relation, like dilation and anelastic behavior during
consolidation. The new constitutive relation should have significant impact on
the analytical modeling of static and cyclic loading of granular media, given
its fundamental particulate mechanics grounding as well as its power and
simplicity. ***
