This grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry supports the research of Dr. Tomas
Baer in the area of ion fragmentation mechanisms. This work studies the
structure and dissociation dynamics of energy selected ions and ion-dipole
complexes. It provides basic information on the properties and energy states of
ions. Such information is necessary in a broad range of fields from upper
atmosphere physics to solid state chemistry. This investigation will use
photoelectron photoion coincidence, photodissociation, and IR photodissociation
techniques to study cold ions such as nitrobenzene, propanol, and butadiene and
ion-dipole complexes such as cyclopropane ion-water and ethylchloride ion-HCl.
Differences between neutral and ionic dissociations, as revealed in terms of
their mechanisms, rates of dissociation, and the role of excited states in the
fragmentation step will be compared. Gross changes in the structures of the ions
will be studied as a function of their internal energy. Special emphasis will be
given to eludicating the effect the interaction potential between the departing
fragments has on the dissociation rate and mechanism.
