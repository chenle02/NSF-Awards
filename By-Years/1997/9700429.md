This research focuses on the distance of electron and `positive hole` migration
in DNA. The working paradigm is is that photogenerated electrons and holes
migrate from the site of initial generation to removed sites at which strand
cleavage or oxidative damage occurs. Photoactive benzo(a)pyrene derivatives are
covalently bound, site-specifically, to commercially available DNA fragments
with a defined base sequence. Strand cleavage patterns within these defined
systems will be established by high resolution gel electrophoresis, and
correlated with the efficiencies of DNA strand cleavage and oxidative damage to
assess electron-hole migration distances, and the sites within the biopolymer at
which hole-initiated oxidative damage, and electron-initiated strand cleavage
occur. Phototherapeutic and photosterilization applications have focused
attention on the mechanism by which photoactive reagents oxidatively damage
and/or cleave DNA duplexes. With this award, Professor Geacintov will elucidate
the distances of charge migration in DNA fragments having a defined base
sequence thereby identifying the sites at which strand cleavage and oxidative
damage occur.
