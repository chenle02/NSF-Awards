An award is made to the University of Minnesota to acquire an Enhanced Climate
Change Simulator, a unique instrument that simultaneously creates and measures
future conditions outdoors in central Minnesota grassland, without chambers or
enclosures, with the specific objective of simulating the atmospheric chemistry
(CO2 concentration, atmospheric N deposition) and climate (temperature and
rainfall) of the future, and monitoring a set of ecosystem responses. The
Simulator includes equipment that modifies CO2, temperature and rainfall; and
ancillary equipment to monitor and control those environmental variables, and to
monitor abiotic and biotic (vegetation and soil organisms) responses of the
ecosystem to the climate simulation. The Simulator will contribute to
comprehensive research training for University of Minnesota students and
postdocs, serve as a research platform for a wide array of collaborative and
cooperative researchers at University of Minnesota and at other institutions,
provide STEM education and training to primary, secondary and post-secondary
students and educators, and provide public outreach through multiple media.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Simulator will contribute to important societally
relevant scientific research. Only a handful of climate change simulators with
similar capabilities exist around the world, and none controls as many aspects
of future climate, nor has as long a continuous record of ecosystem response.
Notably, the simulator will uniquely enable hypothesis testing about interactive
effects of multiple global change factors on grassland ecosystems. Such
interactive effects remain one of the biggest gaps in understanding that hinder
predictions of whether terrestrial ecosystems will be resilient in the face of
multiple global changes and whether their responses to global change will slow
or accelerate the pace of climate change.
