We propose to develop a new photoacoustic instrument that has microscopic
spatial resolution and enhanced sensitivity, thus allowing first-time
measurements of oxygen evolution, energy utilization, and energy dissipation
within individual mesophyll layers of leaves. Such an instrument will make it
possible to discern how photosynthesis in integrated across the tissues of the
leaf, thus providing a more mechanistic understanding of photosynthetic
performance at the level of the whole-leaf. No current instrumentation has the
sensitivity, capability or spatial resolution for these types of measurements.
