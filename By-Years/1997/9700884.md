ABSTRACT, WEYMAN This proposal consists of several parts. They are all connected
to the study of varieties related to algebraic groups and representation theory.
The first part is to study equivariant modules supported in varieties related to
algebraic groups, like determinantal varieties and the closures of nilpotent
conjugacy classes in simple Lie algebras. The investigator proposes to
investigate the Grothendieck groups of categories of such modules and to apply
these results to study the coordinate rings of orbit closures by means of
degeneration sequences. The second part is the study of singularities of
generalized discriminants and resultants. The investigator proposes to extend
his classification ( with Zelevinsky ) of irreducible components of
hyperdeterminantal varieties to arbitrary homogeneous spaces for the reductive
group. The third part is concerned with representations of Z_2 graded Lie
algebras gl(m,n). The investigator proposes to study the connection of such
representations with syzygies of equivariant ideals in the polynomial ring of
generic $m\times n$ matrices. The subject of this proposal is the study of the
varieties related to classical groups. In general terms they can be described as
the varieties with a lot of symmetries. These varieties play an important role
in Commutative Algebra, serving as basic examples and also providing links to
other fields, like Combinatorics, Representation Theory and Singularities.
Historically many important general theorems were proved first for these kinds
of varieties. The investigator proposes to study the algebraic invariants
associated to these varieties, in particular the structure of equivariant
modules supported in them.
