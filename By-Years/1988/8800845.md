The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports basic
research which involves synthesis, structure, dynamics and reactivity of early
transition metal compounds. This area of research has significance to synthetic
fuels made from carbon dioxide. This project requests funds to support synthetic
organometallic research to prepare thermally stable and highly reactive early-
transition metal complexes possessing both methylated allyl ligands and halide
ligands. These new compounds will allow replacement of the ubiquitous
cyclopentadienyl ligand with allyl ligands in heterometallic early-late-
transition metal complexes. Such heterometallics have not yet demonstrated the
kind of cooperative bimetallic reactivity that has been hoped, such as CO2
complexation. By replacing Cp ligands with allyl ligands in these complexes,
reactivity at the early-transition metal center and the first instance of true
early-late-transition metal cooperativity should be achieved. The main efforts
of this research project, the preparation, manipulation, and characterization of
new air-sensitive early-transition metal allyl complexes, are being performed
entirely at Hope College by undergraduate researchers involved in semester and
summer research.
