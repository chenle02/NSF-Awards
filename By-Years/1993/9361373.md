9361373 Hazelton Plasma processing has moved to the forefront of integrated
circuit (IC) fabrication technology. Contaminants continue to plague the
industry being responsible for more than 50% of the yield losses. These
particles will also act to limit the feature density on the IC wafers. Advances
in cleanroom technology have resulted in the plasma processor being the main
source of microcontaminants. Particles in the discharge have been observed to
congregate in electrostatic traps near the wafer. The precipitation of particles
from these traps is a major source of contamination. We propose to actively
clean the particle traps. The energy of an electron beam incident on the
particles can be tuned to either increase or decrease the particles' charge
state. This disrupts the electrostatic trap confinement allowing the particles
to be removed.
