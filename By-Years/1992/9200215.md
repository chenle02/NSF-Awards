This REU Site is established at the Fluid Dynamics Research Center (FDRC) of the
Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago. The program is directed at
qualified undergraduate students enrolled at IIT as well as at other
universities and colleges in the State of Illinois. It is designed to provide
the students with hands-on experience in fluid mechanics research in an
environment where they will be exposed to new and exciting research problems. A
REU participant is a member of a research team, interacting with the faculty as
well as with other students. He/she will be given specific assignments tailored
to obtain the right mix of knowledge, the acquisition of new skills, and a sense
of accomplishment and belonging.
