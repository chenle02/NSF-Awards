This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the Northwestern University in the
purchase of a distributed memory parallel computer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: parallelized local-
density and density functional electronic structure calculations, parallel
scattering calculations, dynamical mean-field studies and molecular dynamics
calculations. A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a
new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a
"computer network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical
codes and algorithms, and provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization
facilities.
