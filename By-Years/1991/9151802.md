The goal of this project is (1) to develop a new, hands-on, experimental-
technique laboratory course in biotechnology; (2) to integrate advanced computer
analysis and simulation with the wet-bench exercises of the biotechnology
course; (3) to add advanced biotechnology capability to our strong undergraduate
research program; and (4) to add molecular biology equipment and technology to
existing course laboratories. The request includes laboratory equipment to
conduct exercises demonstrating electroporation, the polymerase chain reaction,
electrophoresis, micropipetting, bacterial and tissue culture, centrifugation,
DNA hybridization, and DNA sequencing. The computer software and hardware will
be used for the analysis of protein and nucleic acid sequences, and for
simulation of molecular biology manipulations.
