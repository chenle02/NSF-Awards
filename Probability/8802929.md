There is a long list of mathematical functions (Bessel, hypergeometric, and the
like) called special because of their omnipresence in applications, where they
are often encountered as solutions to differential equations. The research in
this project centers on analogues of the hypergeometric functions in which the
argument is a matrix, rather than a real or complex number. The representation
theory of the general linear group plays a major role in this investigation,
because the generalized hypergeometric functions can be thought of as having for
their domain of definition a certain quotient of that group. There is a high
degree of contact with multivariate statistics, Professor Richards' original
research area, and with combinatorial problems of great current interest to
algebraists.
