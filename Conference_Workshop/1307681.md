The eleventh annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be
held April 6-April 7, 2013, at the University of Notre Dame. The conference
includes a geographically diverse group of over 100 graduate students at various
stages of their careers. There is a broad range of talks in the schedule: 24
graduate student 30 minute talks on expository and original research topics in
geometry/topology; two plenary speakers, Dan Freed (UT Austin) and Burkhard
Wilking (Münster); and six invited young faculty speakers, David Ayala
(Harvard), Clark Barwick (MIT), Alessio Figalli (UT Austin), Fernando Galaz-
García (Münster), Ana Rita Pires (Cornell) and Gábor Székelyhidi (Notre Dame).
This conference will include a wide range of topics in topology and geometry:
hyperbolic geometry, geometry of positive curvature, global analysis,
3-manifolds, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, dynamics, knot theory,
cobordism theory, category theory, Teichm#uller theory, 4-manifolds, dfferential
topology, geometric group theory, algebraic K-theory, and more.

This conference provides a venue for communication among young mathematicians
from different geographic regions. Participants include graduate students at all
stages of their careers. This is one of the few conferences in topology and
geometry that is dedicated to graduate students. Student participants at this
conference have the opportunity to learn about cutting edge research and to hone
their communication and networking skills. Geometry and topology are fundamental
mathematical fields with deep connections to many other areas of research, such
as dynamical systems, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology. This
conference serves to foster research and communication about research in these
areas, and to enable and encourage graduate students in these fields.
