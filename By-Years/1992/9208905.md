The insect cell-baculovirus system has received rapid and wide acceptance as a
laboratory or small-scale system for production of proteins from recombinant
DNA, and an "AIDS vaccine" produced by insect cell systems is in clinical
trials. This system offers advantages of safety, high productivity, generally
reliable production of active proteins, and a high degree of post-translational
processing. Since the post-translational processing machinery of insect cells is
not identical to that of mammalian cells, there may be some limitation on the
types of proteins that are best produced in insect cell systems. However,
products from insect cells typically elicit a strong immunogenic response, and
this system appears particularly well-suited for use in vaccine production and
possibly for antibodies. In addition, the virus itself may be genetically-
engineered to improve its properties as a safe, specific, and effective
insecticide against major crop pests and forest insect pests. One of the
Principal Investigators (PIs) has conducted the first tests in this country of a
field released genetically-engineered virus. The overall objective of this
project is the development of a basis for predictable large-scale production of
proteins and insecticides using insect cell lines. For either production of
proteins or viral pesticides, more efficient production systems will be
required. Because these products may be required in large volumes, and are
likely to be cost-sensitive (e.g. animal vaccines and bioinsecticides), the
success of the system will be strongly dependent on improved and novel
engineering design.
