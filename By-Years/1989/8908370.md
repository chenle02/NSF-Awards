Michael Kellman is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to investigate the dynamics of highly excited vibrational
states of small molecules. These studies are important in furthering our
understanding of laser excitation of gas phase molecular species. Kellman has
also developed new analytical methods which will help to assign the complex
spectra of molecules in highly excited vibrational states. Kellman's research is
divided into three major efforts: 1) The development of new visualization
techniques which are useful in the semiclassical interpretation of experimental
spectra; 2) The analysis of spectral patterns and signatures of phase stuctures
which are present in complex spectra; and 3) An extended study of
multidimensional phase space dynamics which will be used to search for the
existence of pathways for controlled excitation of enhanced reactivity.
