9352037 Ensor The presence of alpha emitting isotopes in the environment,
whether from natural sources or as the result of man-made activities, is of
increasing concern to scientists and the population as a whole. A photon
electron rejecting alpha liquid scintillation (PERALS) spectrometer provides a
fast, accurate, and efficient method to quantify alpha activity free from the
interferences caused by beta and gamma emissions generally present in
environmental samples. Students are using this spectrometer in a number of new
experiments in Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry and in projects in an
undergraduate research course. Students enrolled in these courses include not
only chemistry majors, but students from civil and chemical engineering,
geology, biology, and secondary education science. The PERALS system is giving
these students hands-on experience with the most modern counting equipment, and
is allowing them to gain insight into the procedures for and the difficulties in
the assay of alpha emitters in the environment. ***
