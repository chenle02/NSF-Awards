The dramatic increase in tourism as an important dimension of the global
economy has been manifest in many regions of the world. Much of the research on
tourism in geography and other social sciences has focused on the tourists and
on their impact on local areas. The analyses often have depicted local residents
as seemingly helpless victims of much wealthier visitors from other parts of the
world. Relatively little attention has been given to the attitudes of the local
residents, however, especially in those locales where the residents have
actively promoted tourism to boost the local economy. This doctoral dissertation
project will explore the role of local initiatives to advance tourism in the
Guizhou region of southern China. Ethnographic methods, including archival
research, interviews with local leaders, and participant observation will be
used to gather information at a number of tourist sites in and near the city of
Kaili in southeastern Guizhou. Special emphasis will be placed on the processes
through which local leaders are attempting to maintain the region's distinctive
ethnic character and identity while facilitating economic development through
more active tourism. This project will provide valuable new information and
insights about the actions and attitudes of an ethnic minority group as it
attempts to use tourism to boost its economy without harming its culture.
Although specific information will focus on a single region in southern China,
the results of this project should provide more general understandings useful in
the analysis of other places. As a doctoral dissertation improvement award, this
award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a
strong independent research career.
