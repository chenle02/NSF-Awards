This award supports a joint U.S.-Italian symposium, `Glucose-6-phosphate
Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Diet, and Adaptation to Malaria,` to be held in
Cortona, Italy, July 3 - 5, 1995, under the auspices of the Congress of the
International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. The organizers
of the symposium are Lawrence S. Greene of the University of Massachusetts,
Boston, and Maria Danubio, University of L'Aquila, in Italy. The proposal will
fund the attendance of six U.S. investigators at the symposium. The symposium
will focus on : molecular variability at the G6PD locus; the biochemistry of
favism; antimalarial action of the favic compounds and other oxidant substances
of plant origin; the interaction of G6PD deficiency and dietary oxidants in
providing antimalarial protection; distribution of alleles for G6PD deficiency
in Sardinia and its relationship to altitude and past malarial history. The
Italian side will be represented by 15 Italian investigators and several other
international scholars. The Italians are world leaders in the study of G6PD
deficiency in adaptation to falciparum malaria. The Americans will contribute
their unique perspective on how biocultural adaptation has operated at the G6PD
locus.
