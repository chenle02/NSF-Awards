9322303 Lee This award is to provide funds for studying the lifetime of the
Computer Division of the General Electric Corporation from its establishment in
1956 to its sale to Honeywell Information Systems in 1968. It is the intent of
this work to create a case study reviewing the interaction between the
technological and management activities of these twelve years and to evaluate
the reasons for the demise of this division. The research involves interviewing
some key pioneers, top executives, technical and administrative personnel of the
corporation. A full report of this case study will provide some insights to the
factors relating to the success and failure of the Computer Division. ***
