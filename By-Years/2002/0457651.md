The PI will study interactions between operator algebras and conformal field
theories which have proved to be very fruitful lately. The main emphasis of this
research is placed on the study of &lt;br/&gt;certain representation theory
questions such as Kac-Wakimoto conjecture, orbifolds and boundary states in
conformal field theories using operator algebraic techniques. The applications
of these operator algebraic techniques will lead to proofs of representation
theory questions and shed lights on exotic subfactors such as those coming from
conformal inclusions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of operator algebras was
introduced by John von Neumann in order to provide a proper mathematical
framework for Quantum Mechanics. Conformal field theory was a theory
&lt;br/&gt;describing critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, and it
also plays an important role in &lt;br/&gt;string theory. The remarkable
interactions between operator algebras and conformal field theory has led to
many interesting mathematical issues. The aim of this research is to find
solutions to some of the important mathematical issues that surface in this
context which have a wide range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
