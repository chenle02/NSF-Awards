This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is co-funded by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award
provides support for an REU Site at Lehigh University. Ten rising sophomores
(i.e. students that have completed the freshman year but have not started the
sophomore year) will spend 12 weeks in the summer engaged in research in
neuroscience and robotics. This unique interdisciplinary program will expose
students majoring in mechanical engineering and students majoring in the
biological sciences to fundamental concepts in both academic disciplines. It is
anticipated that this program will impact the nations' need to increase the
number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents prepared for research-related
careers, in addition to impacting the need to increase the number of U.S.
citizens from population groups underrepresented in science and engineering that
are engaged in research-related careers.
