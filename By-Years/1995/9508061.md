SBR-9508061 This dissertation-improvement award supports travel, field
assistants, and laboratory analyses for a study of relationships between
cultural traditions and land-use practices in highland Guatemala. The purpose of
the study is to understand how traditional farming practices reflect the local
cultural and environmental contexts, and how these practices in turn affect the
physical environment. The overall theoretical approach is that of cultural
ecology. The empirical research involves both ethnographic and physical-process
methodologies: participant observation of farmers' perceptions of erosion and
their actual erosion-control practices; formal interviews with selected farmers;
field measurements of erosion over the year-long field study; and analysis of
collected soil samples using measurements of radiation emitted by atmospheric-
fallout Cesium-137, in an attempt to determine eroded versus non-eroded and
depositional horizons within the soil samples. The results of the research
should increase our understanding of traditional and changing farming systems in
a highland setting, and contribute to a greater awareness, among development
specialists and international aid institutions, of the need to examine local
needs and priorities before initiating particular conservation programs.
