There is an urgent need to collect data from the Lahaina Fire on Maui that is
critical for on-going wildland and urban fire modeling efforts. Being an
isolated location with limited wind and environmental observations, other data
sources must be tapped to advance modeling and simulation research before these
sources are lost. The data capture from multiple sources including social media
and time-stamped photos, organized with AI-enhanced methods for data gathering,
processing, and infusion will be led by Maui-based researchers working with Maui
students. The work will show the importance of data in the understanding of fire
propagation inside the community and interaction with urban structures with an
additional goal of educating the public and enabling the Hawaii government and
emergency response personnel to make decisions to counteract the disaster. This
will aid in the development of policies to reduce the likelihood of major loss
of life and property damage in the future.

Advanced AI techniques deployed on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources at
the University of Hawai’i, the NSF’s Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination
Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS) program and other national infrastructure
will be used to process the large volumes of data to obtain required information
needed to tune and validate fire propagation and atmospheric simulations. The
collected data will be archived and made publicly available in the Data Depot
repository supported by NSF’s Natural Hazards Engineering Research
Infrastructure (NHERI) program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
