This study proposes to elucidate the dynamics of particle aggregation in the
arctic ocean, particularly in the context of the rich conceptual background of
polymer physics of marine biopolymers and colloidal polymer gels. A major
component of the global carbon pool is in the form of colloidal carbon, and the
study of the processes that increase or decrease the reactivity of marine
polymer gels is important in understanding the role of carbon transport and
marine productivity. The PIs plan to use dynamic laser scattering conditions
that mimic those found in the ocean as a means to show whether biopolymers
originating from the DOC (dissolved organic carbon) pool can spontaneously
assemble into micrometer-size gels that can condense by phase transition and
mineralization. Results will be compared with the activity of cultures of
Phaeocystis algae, an important natural contributor of biopolymers and polymer
gels.
