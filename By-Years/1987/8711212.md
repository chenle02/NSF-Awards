Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a key technique for the study of
molecules that contain an unpaired electron. ESR measurements on inorganic,
organometallic and organic materials under photochemical, electrochemical and
thermal stimulation lead to an understanding of chemical structure that is
unattainable by any other technique. The acquisition of ESR instrumentation
enhances the ability of chemists to carry out frontier research. The Department
of Chemistry of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Francis Bitter
National Magnet Laboratory will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to aid in the purchase of an ESR spectrometer. Studies
in various areas of chemistry will be enhanced and include the following: 1)
Polyiron centers in chemistry and biology 2) Cytochrome P450 and nitrogen
fixation biochemistry 3) Nickel methanogenisis 4) High oxidation stat molybdenum
and tungsten dinitrogen complexes 5) Technetium radiopharmaceuticals and related
technetium chemistry 6) ESR studies of organometallic molecules and
multicomponent redox reagents 7) Electronics and magnetic properties of iron-
sulfur protein site analogues
