The study of large-scale systems and methods of computing their optimizations
is an important area with many applications. Stochastic Programming is an
important area in such studies. This activity will focus on development of
stochastic programming problems. Large scale here means the number of
constraints as well as the number of decision and random variables in the
problem can be large. Both probabilistic (reliability type) constraints and
penalties for deviations are incorporated into the models. The random variables
are discrete in some of the models and continuous in others but stochastic
dependence is allowed in all cases. In the case of continuously distributed
random variables a multivariate numerical integral approximation technique, will
be used. Possible applications include optimization of earthquake resistant
structures, water level regulation in lake systems, planning in interconnected
power systems, solutions of economic, finance, production problems.
