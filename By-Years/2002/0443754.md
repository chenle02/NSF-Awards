This award is for a postdoctoral fellowship. The investigator will use molecular
tools study the reasons why antarctic fish are unable to tolerate water warmer
than about 6oC. These fish are extreme stenotherms, having evolved in sub-zero
degree waters for somewhere between 5-15 million years. It is not known at this
time whether the inability of these fish to tolerate increases in temperature is
reflected in an inability to shift gene expression in response to heat stress.
The proposed experiments will create the first cDNA (complementary DNA)
microarray from Trematomus bernacchii, a common species in McMurdo Sound. The
tissues of fish acclimatized over varying time periods to 4oC will be used to
construct a complex, multi-tissue cDNA library of genes expressed during heat
exposure. This library will be used to fabricate a cDNA microarray that will
allow us to monitor the simultaneous expression of thousands of genes. RNA from
control and heat shocked individuals will be used to create fluorescently tagged
cDNA probes to be hybridized to the microarray, thereby generating gene
expression profiles for thermally responsive genes. The primary hypothesis is
that the ability to shift gene expression in response to elevated temperature
will be absent in T. bernacchii and two related Antarctic species. The gene
expression patterns from the Antarctic species will be compared to their
temperate relatives from New Zealand. This project will increase our
understanding of the genomic mechanisms related to cold-adaptation,
stenothermality, and the response of polar fauna to environmental change.
