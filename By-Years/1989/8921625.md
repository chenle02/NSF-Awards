The aim of this project is to develop and empirically test strategic bargaining
models applied to union contract negotiations. This work follows the recent
developments in the understanding of bargaining inefficiencies and processes in
noncooperative bargaining theory. Inefficiencies such as strikes and other
costly delays are usually explained by incomplete information about some aspect
critical to reaching agreement. It is important to test the validity of such
models, and labor negotiations provide a natural and important area for such
tests. For the most part, empirical work has ignored the delay option, focusing
solely on strikes. This work will fill that gap -- preliminary analyses show
that in fact, the signaling role of delay may be just as important as the role
of strikes, regardless of the duration of the contract or the magnitude of the
bargaining costs. The noncooperative bargaining models that will be developed in
this research include several institutional features: strike or delay and finite
duration contracts. Testing the predictions of the models will involve a data
set on negotiations with 6,000 contracts.
