9310511 Hall The nervous system is composed of two major cell types, neurons and
glia. Glial cells have many important roles that allow the neurons to function.
Different types of glial cells have different functions and are needed in
different parts of the nervous system. Little is known about how the different
glial cell types arise during development of the nervous system. This study will
define how neurons alter glial cells during the development, and will establish
the similarities and differences between two types of glial cells, those of
nerves and those of ganglia. The hypothesis to be tested is that glial cell
precursors divide and mature into either of these two types of glia in response
to factors from the neurons. A cell culture system has been developed that will
allow this hypothesis to be tested. Information from these studies will lead to
a greater understanding of how cell-cell interactions influence development in
the normal nervous system. *** 9310511 Hall The nervous system is composed of
