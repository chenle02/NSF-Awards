Project Summary Farley/ATM-9408441 This project is a continuation of a
cooperative agreement to support the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, a facility
located near Lima, Peru. Activities slated for the next five years include storm
time equatorial and low latitude dynamics, the validation of modern equatorial
ionosphere models, lower thermosphere dynamics and the effects of upward
propagating tides and planetary wave leakage, and many other studies. Funding
will also be directed towards upgrades in this facility.
