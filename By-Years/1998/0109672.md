This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop a low
cost, disposable microfluidic manifold that includes a micropump for lab-on-a-
chip (LOC) applications. The microfluidic devices will be engineered for
integration with disposable chemical and biological LOC detector systems. The
key objectives in this Phase I project are : (1) to construct and to test a
proof of principle system, (2) to assess the compatability of the technology for
an array of LOC applications, (3) to design an integrated microfluidic system,
and (4) to determine specifications of the Phase II prototype.

The commercial applications of this project are expected to be in a broad range
of markets, extending from specialty medical industries to general consumer
products. Examples of commercial devices that may potentially incorporate this
technology include chemical analysis systems, drug delivery systems, MEMS
actuator systems and embedded health monitoring systems.
