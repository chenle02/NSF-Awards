0416066 Pancake This planning grant will develop plans for the two types of
infrastructure that will transform CLEANER from a grant program to a
collaboratory: an IT infrastructure and a coordination infrastructure. The
approach is founded on the following objectives: (1) Leverage the "lessons
learned" by other, related efforts to reduce ramp-up time and effort. Over the
last decade, a number of discipline-specific collaboratories have emerged. The
project will exploit their experiences so that CLEANER can benefit from current
"best practices" and develop risk management strategies to avoid known pitfalls.
(2) Maximize the flexibility of CLEANER's underlying infrastructures to allow
for growth and evolution as experience is gained. CLEANER facilities must be
developed in a way that will lead to compatibility, interoperability, expansion,
and future maintainability. This approach specifically addresses these issues,
not just in terms of a scalable and extensible IT architecture, but also the
establishing of coordination procedures that will adjust to changing needs as
CLEANER facilities grow and users gain experience with them. (3) Ensure that all
components of the Collaboratory are actually usable by the target audiences.
Construction of facilities, however advanced or desirable, is pointless unless
their potential will be exercised fully by users. Based on many years of
experience in usability engineering, the project will identify and document user
requirements and priorities among CLEANER's diverse constituencies and define
how usability procedures should be incorporated into facility development.
