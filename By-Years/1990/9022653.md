This award will provide supplementary support for a long-term research stay by
Dr. Roy Sidle of the USDA Forest Service to conduct collaborative research with
Dr. Makoto Tani of the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in
Tsukuba, Japan. They will investigate how soil pipes in forest hillsides
influence the subsurface water flow regime, and thus affect initiation of
landslides. Soil pipes and macropores are recognized to be important conducts
for subsurface water during intense rainstorms. The rapid transport of large
quantities of water into unstable soil mantles during storms can create zones of
water pressure buildup, resulting in landslide initiation. Existing models of
subsurface flow and groundwater response do not adequately address the influence
of pipeflow. The research work of Dr. Tani's lab on the effects of soil physical
properties on groundwater accretion will complement Dr. Sidle's research
background on subsurface flow processes and landslide modelling.
