&lt;br/&gt; Everybody thinks probabilistically, whether knowingly or not.
Inability to reason well probabilistically makes one prone to a variety of
irrational fears and vulnerable to scams designed to exploit probabilistic
naivete, precludes intelligent assessment of risks, ensures the operation of
several common biases, impairs decision making under uncertainty, facilitates
the misinterpretation of statistical information, precludes critical evaluation
of likelihood claims, and generally undercuts rational thinking in numerous
ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A large literature appears to support the view that
people's intuitions about matters of probability are largely wrong. This view
may be correct, but many of the results that have been interpreted as supportive
of it can be challenged on methodological grounds. In particular, instructions
to participants in studies of probabilistic reasoning have often been ambiguous
or incompletely stated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this study, we plan to
manipulate the degree of ambiguity and incompleteness of problem statements in a
controlled fashion with the objective of determining the extent to which
previous results suggesting incorrect intuitions about probability will be
obtained with problem statements that are unambiguous and complete.&lt;br/&gt;
