The PI plans to address the fundamental physical processes that affect the
behavior of semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCS) in the troposphere. Methods
will be developed to collect particle samples suitable for surface area
analysis. Specific surface areas of urban and, for the first time, rural
aerosols will be determined. The results will be used to assess whether 10 urban
and rural particles differ significantly in specific surface area; 2) published
estimates of specific surface area are reasonable; and 3) the current use of
estimated surface areas in deposition modeling is appropriate. Concentrations of
n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will also be measured to
investigate, in a preliminary fashion, the effect of particle surface area on
the phase distribution of SOC's
