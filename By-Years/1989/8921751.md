The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor Stwalley and Dr.
Lyyra in a collaborative spectroscopic investigation of diatomic molecules at
very long range. These studies are well suited for studying such fundamental
processes as photodissociation (bond-breaking) and associative ionization (bond-
forming through electron loss). Information is being obtained on the effects of
long range interactions on collision dynamics. Lasers are being used to prepare
alkali diatomic molecules at long range and to probe the subsequent dissociation
or ionization processes. Stimulated radiative dissociation, a new technique
combining optical-optical double resonance spectroscopy with stimulated emission
pumping, is being developed to precisely control the parameters of long range
excited states of sodium dimers for studies of nonadiabatic state mixing at
large internuclear distances.
