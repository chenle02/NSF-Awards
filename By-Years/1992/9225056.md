Among the damage and destruction caused by earthquakes is that to historic
architecture which, unlike other kinds of losses, often represent a permanent
loss of the historic record and cultural identity of communities. The series of
earthquakes on April 25 and 26, 1992, in Humboldt County, California, that
measured 7.1, 6.6, and 6.7 on the Richter scale damaged or destroyed
approximately 1,000 buildings, a number of which were of significant
architectural and historic interest dating from the period between 1870 and
1900. The proposed project would describe the event, briefly review the history
of the area, indicate the damage and destruction to historic buildings, point
out mitigation measures which could have prevented much of the damage at minimal
cost, describe the disaster response process, and suggest methods to improve the
treatment of historic buildings in relief and reconstruction efforts by
government agencies. Requested support would cover costs for a graduate student
to visit the impacted area, physically survey damage, interview informed
respondents in public agencies, preservation organizations, and consulting and
construction firms, and cover other supplementary costs of the project.
