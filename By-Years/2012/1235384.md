The PIs request funding to propose to design and test a new type of seafloor
strainmeter that will have sensitivity much higher than has been available
previously for seafloor use. The PIs will install the sensor on the seafloor and
establish its noise floor, response, and sensitivity by observing the solid
Earth strain tides, which have an amplitude of approximately 50 nanostrain. Many
scientific targets, including slow earthquakes (episodic tremor and slip),
volcanic inflation and deflation, mid-plate strain signals, spreading center
events, and possible seafloor slide precursors, can be addressed by successfully
developing this instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed device has the potential of becoming a
standard instrument for a high-quality undersea observatory, allowing real time
geodetic measurements and to assess hazards from undersea slides, faults, and
volcanoes. Monitoring small tectonic strains in marine areas will provide new
data with a precision so far unavailable.
