9315240 Parsons This project investigates large-scale civil infrastructures
using composite materials. The focus of the research is on development of
innovative designs utilizing filament winding manufacturing techniques for cost-
effective, seismic resistant pipe joints and bridge decks. The research will
produce effective conceptual design and determine specifications for new
material systems. The project will be conducted on the cooperative basis between
US and Korea and included design and testing. The structures produced will be
light weight, and corrosion resistant, thus reducing the inertia forces and
aiding in the replacement of damaged components. ***
