9521278 Irani This faculty internship project builds on an existing relationship
between the principal investigator and the Minnesota Valley Engineering, Inc.
Under the existing relationship, Minnesota Valley Engineering funded the
investigator to undertake a preliminary study to design fabrication and
machining cells to feed a jumbo pressure vessel assembly shop. In the course of
the study, it was found that the two most employed algorithms used for cell
formation, namely, matrix clustering and operation sequence clustering proved
inadequate for the problem. The study also pointed to the need to develop a
library of algorithms for use in manufacturing flow analysis. Thus, the
objective of this internship is to undertake the development of an enhanced
algorithm for use in cell formation. This algorithm will incorporate the
strengths of the matrix clustering and operation sequence clustering algorithms.
To meet its objective, the project will (1) explore the clustering effectiveness
and computational benefits of different enhancements, (2) develop a core
algorithm for material flow analysis that incorporates operation sequences,
batch quantities, and intercell and intracell flows, (3) develop layout design
lectures, (4) undertake the development of a technology transfer program with
local companies interested in cellular manufacturing, and (5) create an enhanced
version of STORM for teaching students in industrial engineering and operations
research. Material flow analysis and improvement is at the core of competitive
and economic manufacturing. It will reduce the cost of material handling within
and between cells or machine stations. Additional benefits include reduction in
machine setup times, production cycle, and work-in-process inventory. Thus, this
project is addressing a problem that is widespread and one in which many
companies stand to gain in several ways if an effective solution methodology is
found.
