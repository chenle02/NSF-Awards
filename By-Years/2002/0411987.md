The proposal requests funding for partial support for U.S. scientists to attend
either of two sequential high energy physics conferences in La Thuile, Aosta
Valley, Italy.

The first conference (March 21-28, 2004) addresses Electroweak Interactions and
Unified Theories. The subjects are CP violation in the B and K systems, particle
astrophysics, neutrino physics, tests of the Standard Model, and searches for
new particles and for theories beyond the Standard Model.

The second conference (March 28 - April 4, 2004) concerns Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD) and High Energy Hadronic Interactions. The topics to be covered include
heavy flavor physics, low-x physics and saturation, progress in perturbative
QCD, heavy ion collisions, the search for new phenomena and physics at future
accelerators.
