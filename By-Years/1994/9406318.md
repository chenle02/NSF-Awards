9406318 Hill The objectives of this research are 1) the development of better
and more efficient computational methods in atomic and molecular physics and 2)
highly accurate calculations on small atomic systems which can be compared to
experiment. Convergence rates are studied and errors in variational calculations
carefully estimated. Specific problems include the construction of He
wavefunctions incorporating all known singularities, estimates of non-linear
parameters in various basis set expansion techniques, studies of the Dirac
equation and Bethe logarithm computations. ***
