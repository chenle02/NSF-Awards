The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of an instrument-free colorimetric point-of-care diagnostic capable
of detecting antibiotic resistance in patients with urinary tract infections
(UTIs) at time of care. Currently, there are no diagnostic options that can
provide doctors with resistance information at time of care. Traditional
microbiology techniques take three days to deliver results, so doctors must
prescribe antibiotic treatments empirically. By rapidly detecting antibiotic
resistance, the correct class of antibiotic can be prescribed at time of care.
In the short-term, this enables better patient care where the patient can
receive the lowest generation and narrowest spectrum antibiotic that is
appropriate, meaning fewer potential side effects. Further, for those patients
who exhibit higher-order resistance, last-resort antibiotics can be employed to
ensure that the infection is cleared during the first course of antibiotics.

This I-Corps project is based on patented core technology that enables rapid
detection of b-lactam resistant bacteria in urine samples without the need of
sample processing or bacterial culturing steps that are currently required in
the clinical workflow. This biochemical assay directly detects the enzyme
responsible for resistance by using a unique amplification strategy. The
amplification technology is based on an innovative enzyme-dependent
amplification cascade that is paired to traditional molecular diagnostic probes
to create an increase in signal, allowing for detection of low abundant
biomarkers without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. Ultimately, a
color change indicates the presence of bacteria resistant to b-lactam
antibiotics. This technology reduces time-to-results to just 30 minutes,
compared to 3 days with traditional microbiology analysis.
