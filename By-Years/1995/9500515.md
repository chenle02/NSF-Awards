AST 95-00515 PI: J. Patrick Henry The study of rich clusters of galaxies
provides much information of cosmological importance. They were the first places
where dark matter was found. Their brightest member galaxies have been used as
standard candles from the inception of modern investigations into the age and
fate of the Universe. Despite their extreme importance, there has never been a
catalog of clusters at high redshifts that could be used for objective
statistical studies because most clusters are found from visual inspection of
optical plates. Clusters of galaxies are also very luminous X-ray emitters,
hence they are found in X-ray surveys of the sky. Further, finding clusters by
their X-ray emission properties greatly reduces biases inherent in selecting
them in the visible band while simultaneously providing a catalog with
quantifiable characteristics suitable for statistical analysis. The most
sensitive X-ray survey of an appreciable region of the sky is that performed by
the German satellite ROSAT around the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). Work already
performed under an existing NSF grant shows that the number of clusters at high
redshifts in the X-ray data is as expected, and will in fact provide a sample of
about the same size as that accumulated after decades of effort using optical
techniques. This investigation will optically follow-up studies of the ROSAT NEP
X-ray cluster sample with particular emphasis on the initial identifications of
the clusters and later investigations of evolution of X-ray and optical
properties, large scale structure, and the infrared magnitude-redshift diagram.
The depth and completeness properties of the ROSAT sample will enable
significant improvements to be made in these areas compared to previous studies.
