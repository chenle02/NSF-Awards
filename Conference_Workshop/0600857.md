This project will support a 3-year sequence of regional mini-conferences in
Discrete Mathematics. The goals of the conferences are to encourage and
stimulate research efforts of regional PhD students in mathematics and computer
science, and to foster collaborative efforts among senior researchers and
students. A tentative list of topics, and plenary speakers, is: First year
Topic: Ramsey Theory and Extremal Graph Theory Speaker: Maria Axenovich (Iowa
State University) Second year Topic: Designs, Codes and Applications Speakers:
Vera Pless (University of Illinois-Chicago) Qing Xiang (University of Delaware)
Third year Topic: Combinatorial Matrix Theory Speakers: Richard Brualdi
(University of Wisconsin-Madison) Pauline van den Driessche (University of
Victoria)

Graduate student involvement will be a high priority. Graduate students will be
encouraged to present their research, and the schedule will be designed with
break-outs and problem sessions so that faculty can offer suggestions and
direction to the students. Priority for travel funds will go to minority
applicants and graduate students. The proposed activity will (a) provide an
encouraging environment for young researchers and graduate students, (b)inform
researchers of some of the latest developments in discrete mathematics, and (c)
strengthen collaborative, and interdisciplinary research ties among discrete
mathematicians in the Rocky Mountain region.
