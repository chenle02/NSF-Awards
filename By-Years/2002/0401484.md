Dr. Hunt is awarded an MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship to conduct a research program abroad at the University of Wales,
Cardiff, the United Kingdom. Dr. Hunt's research aims to revolutionize sub-
millimeter astronomy with the development of large-format detector arrays that
utilize superconducting technology, better known as transition-edge
superconducting (TES) bolometers. Dr. Hunt plans to develop a line of research
that will simplify and isolate the components of a TES in an attempt to address
the excess noise issues that are seemingly ubiquitous in these devices. Dr. Hunt
will also take advantage of the detector-testing and fabrication facilities at
Cardiff, and collaborate with groups at NIST in the U.S. and SRON in The
Netherlands to study different TES materials.

In addition, Dr. Hunt plans to participate in specific educational activities
that contribute to the broader impacts of her research program. Dr. Hunt will
develop a public lecture about radiation detectors, give talks to young
students, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and encourage women in
science.
