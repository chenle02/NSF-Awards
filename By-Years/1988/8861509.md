Low loss infrared fibers for the 2-11 micron region have numerous applications
in medical and industrial sensor and laser power delivery systems. However,
current fibers for use beyond 5 microns have high loss. This research project is
intended to result in improved fibers made from chalcogenide glass, by
developing novel preform and fiber processing techniques. In particular,
optimized cladding will be developed, scattering defects minimized, and
purification improved to achieve lower loss. The Phase I research will prove the
feasibility of the technology, which will be further optimized during Phase II.
This research will draw upon previous work done at Infrared Fiber Systems in the
area of fluoride and chalcogenide fibers.
