Hara&lt;br/&gt;0940398&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our current understanding of air-sea
interaction processes under tropical cyclones (hurricanes) is far from
satisfactory and is one of the factors that are limiting our ability to improve
tropical cyclone prediction (intensity prediction, in particular). Further
improvement of air-sea flux parameterizations and near surface turbulence
modeling, however, is a formidable scientific challenge because: (1) the need to
improve understanding of all relevant processes, including near surface
atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, surface waves, surface breaking waves, sea
spray and bubble generations, interactions between sprays and atmospheric
turbulence, interactions between bubbles and oceanic turbulence; (2) these
processes occur over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from the storm
scale to microphysical scales of bubbles and sprays; and (3) since many of these
processes are strongly dependent on the surface wave conditions, it may be
necessary to fully couple the atmospheric, wave, and ocean models in order to
properly predict the air-sea interaction processes and their impact on tropical
cyclone dynamics. It is evident that we need a coordinated interdisciplinary
effort to significantly improve predictions of air-sea interaction processes
under tropical cyclones. The PI team are thus organizing a workshop aimed on:
identifying immediate and long term scientific issues to be focused upon;
enhancing communication among scientists/engineers in different disciplines; and
building a framework in which novel interdisciplinary research initiatives are
promoted and nurtured. The workshop will be organized by 3 co-organizers, Tetsu
Hara (air-sea interaction), Stephan Grilli (ocean engineering, wave breaking),
and Isaac Ginis (ocean and atmospheric modeling), and will be held at the Alton
Jones campus of the University of Rhode Island in 2010. The PIs will target an
international and multi-disciplinary, but small enough group to allow for easy
communication during general discussions. We will maintain a balance of
seniority and diversity and reach out to the international community, paying
special attention to early career investigators. The workshop promotes
international cooperation since about half of the participants will be invited
from other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded by the
ENG and GEO directorates.
