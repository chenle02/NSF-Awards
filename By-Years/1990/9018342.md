Workshops in molecular evolution will be offered at the Marine Biological
Laboratory at Woods Hole in 1991, 1992 and 1993. The goal is to provide an
opportunity for organismal, evolutionary and population biologists to learn
about the powerful tools of molecular biology while providing molecular/cell
biologists with an enriched understanding of evolutionary theory. Lectures
exploring multiple approaches to molecular evolution will be supplemented by a
computer workshop for the analysis of protein and genetic sequences. The
workshop is designed for established investigators, college and university
professors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from diverse biological
fields. The theoretical basis of comparative sequence analysis and phylogenetic
tree construction will be presented as well as lectures about the application of
molecular techniques to problems in ecology and population packages for analysis
of molecular data on different computer systems including workstations, personal
computers and large mainframes. Guided by authors for phylogenetic software
packages, the students will have the opportunity to compare different data
analysis techniques for molecular data.
