This award provides one-half the funds for the acquisition of an X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer system to be installed and operated in the
Department of Geology at Syracuse University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for this acquisition. The XRF system
will provide a capability for rapid and accurate chemical analysis of rocks and
mineral samples required for the research projects of the principal
investigator, colleagues and graduate students at Syracuse. The instrument will
also serve the teaching needs of the Department of Geology, as well as the
research and teaching needs of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Mechanical
Engineering departments at Syracuse. The new XRF laboratory is to be made
available also to other university and college groups on a regional basis.
