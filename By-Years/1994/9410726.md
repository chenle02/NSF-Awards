9410726 Stahl, Anne With National Science Foundation support Dr. Ann Stahl and
her colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological and ethnographic
research in the Banda region in west central Ghana. The history and prehistory
of the Banda peoples can be clearly traced back to the 17th Century AD. Oral
tradition and written documents indicate four distinct forms of political
organization over that period. From an essentially independent base, they were
first conquered and incorporated into the Ashante Kingdom. In the 19th century
they became part of the British empire and subject to indirect British rule.
Finally they were incorporated into independent Ghana. Dr. Stahl wishes to
examine how the social, political and economic organization changed across these
periods and will employ ethnographic and archaeological, as well as archival
data in her research. She will focus on the timing and impact of New World crops
on subsistence ecology; the changing uses over time of wild and domestic fauna;
changes in ceramic production to address the impact of external exchange
networks on craft specialization; and document the role of exchange in the local
economy. To achieve these goals she will conduct extensive interview with Banda
people and observe present day manufacturing and subsistence practices. She will
also excavate a series of known sites with span this time period and are direct
historical antecedents of the present day Banda village in which she will work.
This research is important for several reasons. First, it will provide data of
interest to many Africanist archaeologists. Secondly, it will constitute a basic
contribution to world systems theory. Social scientists have come to realize
that small scale, third world societies have long and complex histories. Through
examination of specific cases it is possible to gain insight into processes of
adaptation and change and to elucidate the mechanisms which societies employ to
survive in a changing world. The project includes several students and will
contribute directly to their scientific training.
