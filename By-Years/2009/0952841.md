The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)
will be held in Bangalore, India, on January 9-14, 2010. HPCA is sponsored by
IEEE Computer Society. HPCA is one of the top 3 computer architecture flagship
conferences, and provides a high-quality forum for scientists and engineers to
present their latest research findings in the rapidly-changing field of computer
architecture. The conference offers graduate students pursuing doctoral studies
in computer architecture the opportunity to participate in a week-long intensive
program focusing on the core as well as new and emerging areas in computer
architecture. This award is to make travel scholarships available to students
and universities not typically represented at HPCA in order to improve the
conference?s impact and outreach.
