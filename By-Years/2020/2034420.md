This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). The acquisition of the requested instrumentation will
support research that advances knowledge in diverse fields from Earth,
environmental, and marine sciences to ecology, physiology, and biochemistry. The
instrumentation will also foster collaborative and trans-disciplinary research
on critical environmental issues as well as intellectual property development by
providing affordable and reliable access to innovative technology for
researchers at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the University of
Massachusetts system, and collaborators worldwide. The instruments will support
biogeochemical and toxicological research of potentially toxic trace elements,
including how these elements occur and are cycled in natural aquatic systems
including the coastal ocean as well as novel investigations of metal
nanoparticles as potential environmental contaminants and in medical
applications. The instruments will support undergraduate and graduate student
training in cutting edge environmental and biogeochemical analyses and will
serve as an important resource for the educational and research missions of the
School for the Environment at UMass Boston, the College of Science and
Mathematics at UMass Boston, the University of Massachusetts system, and the
system-wide Intercampus Marine Science Graduate Program. The research
opportunities provided by the acquisition of these instruments will advance
trans-disciplinary research and teaching at the University and increase
essential research and training instrumentation on
campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instruments will make possible several lines of
research, most notably, the investigation of trace element speciation in natural
waters, including various potentially toxic metals and metalloids like arsenic
(As), vanadium (V), tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), and europium (Eu), which are
difficult to quantify. The instruments will also support: laboratory
experimental studies to measure equilibrium constants describing the formation
of aqueous thioarsenate complexes, which may be more mobile in the environment,
studies of the 14 naturally occurring lanthanide series elements (commonly
referred to as the rare earth elements or REEs), which are considered critical
metals necessary for the Nationâ€™s security and economic prosperity, nanoparticle
toxicology, metal transport in the hemolymph of marine bivalves, and
biogeochemical particles fluxes in the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
