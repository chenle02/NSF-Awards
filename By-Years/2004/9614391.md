9614391 Gurnis Subduction of oceanic lithosphere is , and well known around the
world. However, al subduction that is now current is relatively nature, and
initiation of subduction is one of the first order problems remaining in
tectonics. This project will address through 3-D heterogeneous finite element
methods two competing hypotheses for subduction initiation: on stated by a very
dense oceanic lithosphere sinking of its own weigh, and one caused by longer
distance plate convergence. The results will be compared to geological
observations in New Zealand, and will be important in understanding subduction
processes in general.
