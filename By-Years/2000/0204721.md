DMS-0204721&lt;br/&gt;R. Schoen, H. Bray, J. Isenberg, N.
Kapouleas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for active
research mathematicians &lt;br/&gt;to attend a program in general relativity to
be held at Stanford&lt;br/&gt;University and the American Institute of
Mathematics in the spring quarter&lt;br/&gt;(April 1-June 7) of 2002. The main
topic of the conference concerns&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the Cauchy problem for the
Einstein equations, and it will&lt;br/&gt;include researchers with expertise in
differential geometry, nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic PDE, and relativity
theory. There will be approximately 50&lt;br/&gt;total visitors averaging two
weeks each during the period of the workshop &lt;br/&gt;together with a few
people for longer periods. Focus periods on&lt;br/&gt;specific subtopics will be
arranged. The program will include regular&lt;br/&gt;talks, lecture series on
particular papers and topics, and open&lt;br/&gt;problem sessions. In addition,
we will create a web site for the program&lt;br/&gt;which will give a detailed
look at open problems, relevant literature,&lt;br/&gt;background references, and
links to preprints and reprints. Further&lt;br/&gt;information will be linked
from http://math.stanford.edu and&lt;br/&gt;http://www.aimath.org&lt;br/&gt;
