The PI has recovered detailed paleomagnetic secular variation records and
associated rock magnetic data from high accumulation- rate deep-sea sediments of
the Blake Outer Ridge and Bermuda Rise. He has used these results to develop a
relative paleointensity record. Results correlate well with three other recent
relative paleointensity estimates for the last 100,000 years. However, relative
paleointensity record is strongly influenced by environmental effects (magnetic-
fraction grain-size variations). The PI will develop new relative paleointensity
normalization methods that will better remove subtle environmental effects in
our records, and test these methods by sediment redeposition experiments which
vary field intensity and magnetic-fraction grain size in both artificial and
natural sediments. Results of this study will have broad application to relative
paleointensity studies of both deep-sea and lacustrine sediments.
