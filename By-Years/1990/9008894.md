The principal investigator will conduct planning activities during the period of
this grant. She will attend a summer program at the Institute of Mathematics and
Its Applications on New Directions in Time Series. This will allow her to make
several contacts in the community and be aware of the current directions of
research. She will also conduct research on bootstrap for time series. The
bootstrap is a procedure which allows for resampling of the collected data in
order to obtain information about the variability of the sample. She will
investigate this procedure in the time series setting. In particular she will
use the bootstrap to learn more about the behavior of the estimates of order
determination of models.
