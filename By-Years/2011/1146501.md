Animal behaviors are composed of movements that are coordinated across broad
time scales. For example, human speech involves very rapid movements that
control articulation of phonemes coordinated with slower movements of the
respiratory musculature. The goal of this project is to understand how the
temporal complexity of behaviors is generated by the nervous system. To this
end, neuronal mechanisms underlying complex vocal behaviors of male African
clawed frogs will be investigated. The central vocal circuit of Xenopus is an
ideal model to achieve this goal because it remains functional in vitro (the
brain can 'sing' in a dish), such that intensive physiological experimentation
can be conducted during behavior, a feature that is not available in most other
vertebrate species. The results of the study are expected to reveal cellular
mechanisms by which the nervous system organizes and coordinates a functional
sequence of motor programs. In addition, the project will provide opportunities
for a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow to be trained in the inter-
disciplinary field of neuroscience, and outreach efforts will be made to recruit
students from underrepresented groups and educators in local secondary
institutions to participate in the research program.
