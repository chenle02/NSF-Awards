The purpose of this database is to update the existing Supreme Court Judicial
Database by the addition of conference vote and supportive data drawn from the
papers of Justice Blackmun that extend through the first eight terms of the
Rehnquist Court. Blackmun's data, which begin with the second term of the Burger
Court (1970), will also serve as a valuable supplement to the papers of Justices
Brennan, Powell, and Douglas. Because Blackmun served on both the Burger and
Rehnquist Courts, we will create a new database encompassing both Courts that
will be based on and patterned after the codes and protocols of the existing
NSF-sponsored Burger Court database. Those data will contain the identification,
background, chronological, substantive, outcome, and voting and opinion
variables of the current version. The richness of the resulting data -- which
has already become the cynosure for virtually all behavioral research, in
addition to that of legalistically analytical and descriptive work -- will
continue to enhance the formulation of theory and the testing of hypotheses, not
only with respect to the Supreme Court, but to other groups of decision makers
as well. In addition, the data and other materials will be made available to the
research community via the worldwide web.
