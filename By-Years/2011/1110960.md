This proposal requests a continuation of one of the most fruitful products of
the SLC program, the annual meeting of students and post-doctoral fellows being
trained within the various Science of Learning centers. In the past this
conference has led to cross-center research collaborations, and to the creation
of a national,and even international, interdisciplinary community of young
scholars who are likely to continue to be in touch, cooperate and collaborate
throughout their future careers.
