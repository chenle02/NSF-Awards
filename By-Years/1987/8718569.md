This investigation will study several different volatile metal chelates that are
likely to form thin films of high transition temperature superconducting
material when deposited by metal - organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
These studies will include the synthesis and characterization of beta-
diketonates of barium, copper, and several rare-earth metals. These compounds as
well as related known compounds that are on-hand will be used to determine the
conditions necessary for thin film deposition and oxidation to yield
superconducting layers on substrates such as copper and flexible fused-silica.
Characterization of the resulting material will be made by powder x-ray
diffraction and by measurement.
