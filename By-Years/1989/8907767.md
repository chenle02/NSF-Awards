This project is for the support and assistance of academic and government
personnel (particularly younger researchers) who are engaged in sensor and
actuator research, by providing either wholly or partially for travel,
subsistence and registration fees at TRANSDUCERS '89, the 1989 International
Sensor and Actuator Conference which is being held June 25-30, 1989 in Montreux,
Switzerland. This conference is the premier meeting for review and discussions
of new developments in the field of sensors and actuators. Those attending from
the U. S. will be able to add greatly to the sensor/actuator engineering and
scientific community in the United States.
