The research centers on d6 polypyridyl assemblies, capable of serving as
catalysts in photoinduced energy conversion schemes. The assemblies are modeled
after the photosynthetic reaction center, wherein spatial separation of the
opposite charged holds and electrons is used to avoid the "short circuiting"
recombination reaction. Kinetic study of the photoinduced electron transfer in
simple systems, requiring time resolved laser spectroscopy, will underpin the
goal of transferring the holes and electrons across the assemblies containing
novel relay molecules. The photochemistry of assemblies containing centers
capable of catalyzing chemical energy conversions will be explored. Interactive
activities focus largely on undergraduates. A primary goal is to provide
students with maximal personal interaction with role models. Interactions
include research mentoring and academic advising, and teaching an enriched
section of a general chemistry course integrated under the theme of "energy and
the environment". A variety of prominent women in the sciences will be invited
to serve as additional role models. A peer womentoring program will be initiated
among the graduate and undergraduate students. The latter represent an extensive
group of potential role models and mentors for younger students.
