9521479 Pepperberg With this "Small Grant for Exploratory Research ," a group
headed by Dr. Irene Pepperberg will conduct new studies on how the brain
controls vocalization. The work will involve a unique model system -- parrots
that have been taught English utterances. Most of the existing knowledge on the
neural control of bird song comes from passerine songbirds such as canaries and
finches. In order to study how other types of birds control vocalization, the
Pepperberg group has turned to parrots. When parrots are taught English phrases,
they form them into song-like utterances and this offers the unique opportunity
to study vocal behaviors that are similar to those of the well-known songbirds.
In order to understand how the brain controls this behavior, the activity of
various regions of the brain will be changed in a reversible manner while song
is being attempted. This should provide information on whether or not different
groups of birds use different brain mechanisms to produce song. These studies
will influence our understanding of brain evolution, the neural control of motor
behavior, and the emergence of cognitive capacities within animals. ***
