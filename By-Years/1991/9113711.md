The focus of this research is the development of carbon-carbon bond making
processes that use organophosphorus moieties to control stereochemistry. Design
of the auxiliaries strives to maximize chirality transfer while allowing
recycling of the chiral auxiliaries. Activation of cyclic dioxaphosphoranes by
site-selective complexation with silyl cations will afford substituted 1,2-diols
with high regio- and stereospecificity. Control of acyclic stereochemistry using
a phosphoryl group in concert with the Mukaiyama-Michael reaction is planned and
the unique metallation/alkylation chemistry of spirooxyphosphoranes will be
probed for both theoretical as well as synthetic gain. %%% With this renewal
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Slayton
A. Evans of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina,
Chapel hill. Professor Evans will focus his work on projects that center on the
design of new and versatile stereoselective carbon-carbon bond making strategies
all of which use organophosphorus moieties to control the stereochemical course
of the reactions.
