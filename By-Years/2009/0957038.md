With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Prof. Stephen Weber and his group at the University of Pittsburgh
are studying the selective transport and/or capture of molecules using a
selective molecular receptor in a matrix that is a very poor solvent.
Specifically, the program devises and tests fluorous media (perfluorocarbons and
other solutes and solvents that dissolve in them) as the basis for selective
extractions. Improved selectivity can open up tremendous possibilities for
?managing molecules? in processes critical to analysis, purification,
separations, sensors, smart materials, human health, drug delivery, and
synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work provides better understanding of
Teflon-like polymers, enabling scientists and engineers to make improved films
and coatings useful for measuring chemicals in the environment, in foods, in
biological systems, and in industrial processes. Potential impact on new types
of materials and gas separations is also significant. Specific targets include
chemical ?sponges? with high selectivity for perfluorooctane sulfonate and
perfluorooctanoate, environmental pollutants encountered in rivers and streams.
Graduate and undergraduate students (including freshmen) involved in this work
are exposed to a wide range of chemistry, providing early definition of career
goals.
