Professor Zhu will continue his research on the structure of Toeplitz, Hankel,
and composition operators in various function spaces. This part of the project
will concentrate on deriving information and estimates in terms of the symbol of
the operator. A related project concerns the investigation of the nodal sets of
analytic functions in Bergman and Fock spaces. Here Zhu will collaborate with
Hedenmalm who has just made an important breakthrough in this area. Operators
are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. They have applications in
every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of
research is an attempt to classify certain important families of such objects
and to make contact with the theory of analytic functions.
