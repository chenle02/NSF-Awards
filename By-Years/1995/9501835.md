ABSTRACT 9501835 Kay, Laura This award is made under the auspices of the NSF
Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program. As a CAREER awardee the
investigator is expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to her
scientific research project. Optical spectropolarimetry is a powerful technique
for studying the wavelength dependence of the polarization of continuum and
spectral line radiation in astronomical objects. Dr. Kay uses this technique to
investigate the nature of active galactic nuclei (AGN). She will observe a class
of broad-line radio galaxies with double-peaked emission lines that are
suggestive of the presence of accretion disks. High quality spectropolarimetric
data of such objects could add support to accretion disk models of AGN. Within
her education effort, Dr. Kay will place special emphasis on involving women
undergraduates at her institution in research. *** ??
