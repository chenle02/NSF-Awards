Abstract- Davis - 9729812 Prof. Robert J. Davis of the University of Virginia
will investigate the mechanism of promotion of supported Ru metal catalysts for
the ammonia synthesis reaction, by alkaline-earth elements and rare-earth
oxides. This proposal is of relevance to the science of catalysis and of wider
relevance to the chemical industry, in particular that concerned with
agrochemical and commodity chemical production. Ammonia synthesis over base-
promoted Ru catalysts may lead to reduced consumption of process energy and
consequently less environmental impact. Basic promoters for Ru metal will
include alkali and alkaline-earth as well as rare-earth oxides: K, Ba, Ca, and
oxides of Ce and Pr, for example. Supports will include zeolites, other oxides,
and carbon. The proposal objectives are to determine the atomic structure of Ru
clusters by EXAFS and their electronic structure by XANES and IR spectroscopy of
adsorbed N2. The promoter distribution in the vicinity of, and on Ru clusters
over non-zeolitic supports, will be examined by analytical HRTEM, and correlated
with ethane hydrogenolysis activity. The density of active sites will be
determined with TPD of N2 and H2 chemisorption, and their intrinsic activity by
N2 activation and by NH3 synthesis at atmospheric and at 20-bar pressure. The
surface coverage by various reactive intermediates will be investigated by means
of steady state isotopic transient kinetics.
