9304388 Sammis The PI will develop a micromechanical model for the friction of
granular layers which incorporates comminution and rate and state-friction
between the particles. This modeling will be guided by numerical simulations
using a modified state-of-the-art soil mechanics program, and by recent
laboratory studies on the effects of layer thickness and particle size
distribution, adding complimentary experiments on the effect of normal stress.
This work is motivated by seismological evidence relating fault zone width to
fault stability, by recent advances in using seismic tomography and trapped
modes to investigate the internal structure of fault zones, and by recent
evidence for slow precursors to earthquakes on mature transform faults on the
ocean floor which imply a significant scaling change of friction parameters
between the laboratory and the field. ***
