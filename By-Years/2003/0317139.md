Terrestrial ecosystems play a central role in the cycling of carbon (C) and
water (H2O) on Earth, yet the quantification of the biological and physical
controls over the rates and magnitudes of C and H2O movement into and out of the
plants and the soils within any particular ecosystem are largely unknown. The
proposed research will, for the first time, combine a set of proven methods that
will afford a better understanding of the biophysical controls on whole-
ecosystem C and H2O exchange. These methods will permit the partitioning of the
various fluxes amongst those related to plant photosynthesis, respiration, and
transpiration versus soil-related fluxes from microbial and root respiration and
evaporation. This information is needed for the development and validation of
models aimed at extrapolating fluxes in both space and time and for predicting
how ecosystems will respond to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and
more water limitation in the future.
