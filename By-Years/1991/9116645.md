The orifice pulse tube refrigerator is a cryogenic refrigerator capable of
achieving useful refrigeration at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K). The high
mass flow rates in this refrigerator reduces performance due to ineffective heat
exchange in the refrigerator. An apparatus has been constructed to study the
ineffectiveness of a regenerative heat exchanger in a working pulse tube
refrigerator. The apparatus will allow evaluation of different refrigerator
materials and configurations. A model will be developed which will include the
pressure and mass flow oscillations of this system. Measurements taken with the
test apparatus will allow for model verification and identification of important
operation parameters.
