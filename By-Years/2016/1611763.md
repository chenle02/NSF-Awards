Through this project, a new set of instructional tools for engineering graphics
courses is being developed. Spatial visualization (SV) skill has been shown to
be necessary to succeed in engineering; however, it is a difficult skill to
master. This project will (1) develop a set of physical models and integrate
them with SV learning in the classroom, and (2) develop and implement an online
assistant environment that can be used at any time on mobile devices and
computers. The investigators are developing a game-based classroom approach that
combines the theories of game and puzzle-based learning and reasoning, active
learning, and the use of tangible models for instruction.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating and testing the effectiveness of a
promising way to teach spatial visualization using a game-based active learning
approach. Students' SV skills are hypothesized to improve through hands-on
examination of objects that they construct. The online assistant will allow
students to independently develop SV skills through immediate feedback. The
gaming component of the project addresses student motivation. This work has
potential for widespread reapplication in K-12 and other engineering schools.
Outreach efforts will include classroom implementations in local area K-12
schools, and through two early engineering programs offered at Tuskegee
University. In addition, workshops and webinars designed to train educators at
these schools will enhance the classroom implementations.
