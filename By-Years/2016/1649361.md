Utah Valley University (UVU) with partners Weber State University (WSU) and
American Indian Services (AIS) are implementing UTAH PREP (PREParation for STEM
Careers) to address the need for early preparation in mathematics to strengthen
and invigorate the secondary-to-postsecondary-to-career STEM pipeline. As the
preliminary groundwork for UTAH PREP, each partner currently hosts a PREP
program (UVU PREP, WSU PREP, and AIS PREP) that identifies low-income, under-
represented minority, first-generation, and female students entering seventh
grade who have interest and aptitude in math and science, and involves them in a
seven-week, three-year summer intensive program integrating STEM courses and
activities. The course content blends skill-building academics with engaging
experiences that promote a clear understanding of how mathematical concepts and
procedures are applied in various fields of science and engineering. Courses are
enhanced through special projects, field trips, college campus visits, and the
annual Sci-Tech EXPO. The purpose of the program is to motivate and prepare
participants from diverse backgrounds to complete a rigorous program of
mathematics in high school so that they can successfully pursue STEM studies and
careers, which are vital to advancing the regional and national
welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UTAH PREP is based on the TexPREP program that
originated at the University of Texas at San Antonio and which was named as one
of the Bright Spots in Hispanic Education by the White House Initiative on
Educational Excellence for Hispanics in 2015. TexPREP was adapted by UVU for use
in Utah for non-minority serving institutions and in regions with lower minority
populations, but with great academic and college participation disparity. With
NSF funding for a two-year pilot program, the project partners are building UTAH
PREP through a networked improvement community, collective impact approach that,
if demonstrably successful, has the ability to scale to a national level. This
pilot program's objectives include: 1) creating a UTAH PREP collaboration with
commitments to a common set of objectives and common set of plans to achieve
them; 2) strengthening existing PREP programs and initiating UTAH PREP at two or
three other institutions of higher education in Utah, each building a
sustainable local support network; 3) developing a shared measurement system to
assess the impact of UTAH PREP programs, adaptations, and mutually reinforcing
activities on students, including those from groups that are underrepresented in
STEM disciplines; and 4) initiating a backbone organization that will support
future scaling of the program's impact.
