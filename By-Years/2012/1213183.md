This award funds the research activities of Professors Murat Gunaydin and Radu
Roiban at Penn State University.

The research of Professors Gunaydin and Roiban focuses on investigations which
are envisioned to help uncover the underlying principles of M/Superstring theory
as well as their connection to traditional high-energy particle physics. As
such, this project focuses on a number of topics at the interface of string
theory, M theory, and supergravity, including studies of conformal field theory,
AdS/CFT dualities, and new supergravity theories in six dimensions. The ultimate
goal of this research is to uncover a non-perturbative formulation of
M/Superstring theory that can explain the observable universe.

This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Because
symmetry principles play a fundamental role in all of modern physics, the
methods developed and the results obtained through this research will have
applications in other areas of theoretical physics as well as in mathematics.
This project will also involve the education and training of graduate students
and postdocs who participate in this research.
