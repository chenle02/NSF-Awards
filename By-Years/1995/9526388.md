This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support to work by Dr. Robert G. Bergman of the Chemistry
Department, University of California at Berkeley, on reactions of organic
molecules with transition metal complexes. One area of investigation is the
synthesis of new complexes containing two metals located in close proximity to
one another. Specifically targeted are systems that are unsymmetrical, due to
either the presence of two metals with very different electronic properties or
to the presence of different reactive ligands at each metal center. Research on
these materials will focus on reactions that are applicable to the chemical
utilization of small organic molecules, such as alkenes, alkynes and carbon
dioxide, and to the type of transformations important in organic synthesis, such
as carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond formation. A second area of
investigation is the generation of organometallic species that are highly
reactive due to the presence of an unpaired electron at the metal center, that
is, organometallic free radicals, and capable of forming a relatively strong
covalent bond to the metal. Also, methods for the abstraction of protons from
relatively unacidic metal hydrides will be developed in order to generate very
nucleophilic, low valent anionic metal complexes. Much is known about
organometallic reactions that take place in even-electron complexes that contain
a single metal center with easily accessible charges and oxidation states. This
project moves beyond these areas of investigation to obtain understanding of
reaction details in cases involving an odd-number of electrons, uncommon metal
oxidation states, or more than one metal center. The results will increase
understanding of reactions which are relevant to chemical manufacturing
