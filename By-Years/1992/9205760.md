The ability to translate advanced technology efficiently into manufacturing
capacity is crucial under the new paradigm of industrialization and competition
in the world economy. The competitive advantage of countries and regions depends
on strategies of innovation and organization of production that allow for rapid
adaptation to changes in the competitive environment. A key question in this
process is whether regionally focused production systems can be used by
developing countries in acquiring advanced technologies. This project will test
the hypothesis that the creation of new industries and industrial sectors is
influenced not only by technological change and organizational innovation, but
principally by place based politics and institutional strategies. The research
will focus on three emerging high-technology agglomerations in Sao Paulo State
in Brazil. It will attempt to establish the relationship between high-technology
specialization and government sponsored scientific efforts to generate efficient
technology search procedures for industrial application. Data will come from
censuses, industrial surveys, and interviews with individual firms. Data will be
analyzed with statistical and cartographic techniques to determine whether the
hypothesized relationship between regional specialization and institutional
factors is valid. This research should provide a framework for addressing the
specific conditions of semi-industrialized countries regarding their
innovativeness and competitiveness, the role of geographically specific factors
in this process, and whether regionally focused production systems promote
advanced technological capacity for developing countries. These questions are
important in determining whether the advent of a global economy based on
technological competition poses obstacles or opportunities for industrial
development in less developed countries.
