This research is designed to investigate syntactic ambiguity resolution in
normal, adult language comprehension. The study of ambiguity resolution can
illuminate the architecture of the language comprehension system and can
evaluate the psycholinguistic and linguistic theories concerning the nature of
linguistic mental representations. The theoretical framework of the
investigation is a lexical, "constraint-based" framework in which syntactic
ambiguity is seen as a type of lexical ambiguity, such that syntactic ambiguity
resolution has the same properties as the resolution of lexical semantic
ambiguities. This approach has been applied profitably to the analysis of
several "classic" syntactic ambiguities in English that had previously been
taken as evidence for a radically different processing architecture. The
experiments use self-paced reading methods and eye fixation monitoring to study
ambiguity resolution and constraint use. A large amount of normative data is
also collected concerning the strength of the constraints, and regression
methods are used to determine the extent to which difference constraints affect
comprehenders' interpretations at different points in time. The research is
significant in that it advances a unified account of language comprehension in
which representation at all levels (phonological, lexical, syntactic, discourse,
etc.) are governed by the same basic properties, including frequency sensitivity
and activation of representations via constraint satisfaction. A unified account
of language representation affects not only theories of human language use, but
also work in artificial intelligence, which to date has generally reflected the
more traditional theories of human language comprehension. Our understanding in
the unified approach of human ambiguity resolution could therefore have
substantial impact on computer natural language comprehension research,
particularly the very difficult problem of ambiguity resolut ion in these
systems.
