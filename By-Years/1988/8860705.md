Contaminated ground water treatment is most economically accomplished by air
stripping followed by complete catalytic combustion. For hydrocarbon sources
from underground gasoline storage, the catalytic combustors are now being
deactivated by contaminants such as lead. Poison tolerant catalyst designs are
needed to prevent inactivation of the converter. The proposed research focuses
on the development of a poison tolerant system to handle leaded gasoline
contaminated ground water. The program exploits the use of a special guard bed
combined with design and control strategies to reduce the impact of
deactivation. Mathematical modeling of the process together with measurements
taken during the deactivation process of a commercial catalyst will lead to a
guard bed feasibility demonstration. Successful completion of this research
project could have a significant impact on the technology used to eliminate
contaminants from ground water and industrial waste streams. Catalytic
conversion of the unwanted hydrocarbons could become the preferred technique for
ground water cleanup if catalyst poisoning is controlled.
