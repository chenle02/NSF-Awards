The objective of this research is to develop concurrency control algorithms for
transactions in distributed database systems which achieve high throughput and
low response time. Data replication is a mechanism that has been proposed for
this purpose. Unfortunately, the requirement that transactions behave
serializably forces considerable synchronization among replica sites and hence
adversely impacts throughput and response time. This work will consider the
tradeoff between serializability and throughput/response time by allowing
bounded violations of the database's integrity constraints. Such violations
occur when conflicting transactions are not synchronized. Under these
circumstances a transaction is ignorant of the effects of some prior
transactions, and so the results it returns and the modifications it makes to
the database are based on incomplete information. Both the deviation from
serializable behavior and the throughput/response time are directly related to
the extent of ignorance. Concurrency control algorithms which bound the extent
to which a transaction can be ignorant of conflicting transaction will bound the
deviation from serializable behavior. Since violations of integrity constraints
are not permissible in all applications, the research involves study of the
characteristics of applications in which violations can be tolerated.
