Abstract

Proposal Number: ECCS-0830335 Proposal Title: Computational Imaging and
Superresolution Workshop PI Name: Fiddy, Michael A. PI Institution: University
of North Carolina at Charlotte

Scope:

This grant will provide part of the primary support for a workshop on
computational imaging. Primary support, for $25,000, is being provided by the
Charlotte Research Institute.

Intellectual Merit:

Recent advances in technologies for optical wavefront manipulation, optical
detection and digital post-processing have stimulated new possibilities for
imagining systems in the visible and IR regimes. This opens up the possibility
of developing imaging systems which differ in form factor and capabilities from
traditional imaging systems and camera designs.

This workshop will bring together both hardware and software experts as well as
mathematicians and physicists who are actively working on the fundamental issues
of information theory and light-matter interactions, to bring new ideas to this
emerging area.

Broader impacts:

These different communities working together will identify new challenges for
the optimal use of optical and electronic hardware that will impact applications
that range from cell-phone cameras to noninvasive cancer screening.
