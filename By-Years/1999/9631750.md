Abstract ATM-9631750 Jacoby, Gordon C. Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory Title; Climate Change in Mongolia and its Role in Global
Environmental Change This awards supports a paleoclimatic study in Mongolia.
This is a remote nation which has only recently become accessible to western
scientists, and from which there is paleoclimate information to date. Forests,
particularly in montane regions, are largely undisturbed. Tree-ring analysis of
samples from living trees and subfossil material is likely to produce time
series of millennial length with annual and seasonal resolution. With samples
from high -elevations and lower-elevation dry sites; tree-ring analysis will
yield time series to reconstruct both temperature and precipitation
respectively. These reconstructions will be important long-term climatic
information from near the central portion of the world's largest continental
region. The resulting climatic reconstructions and evaluations will make strong
contribution to climate history of this important region to evaluations of
climate change in Mongolia.
