This project aims to study the way in which infinite-dimensional space can be
transformed. The various transformations involved are collectively known as
operators. There are some well-behaved subcollections of such operators that
first came to prominence as a tool introduced by John von Neumann to further his
work in quantum mechanics and that are now known as operator algebras. The
principal investigator seeks to collect detailed information about these
algebras. Within the class of operator algebras are those that can be obtained
by simply moving a geometric shape around, such as rotating a circle. These are
known as the algebras associated with dynamical systems. The project will
concentrate on this class of algebras.

The project aims to study the question of whether the seemingly weak technical
condition of strict comparison entails the seemingly stronger condition of
Jiang-Su absorption for the operator algebras associated with topological
dynamical systems. This would complete a conjecture of Winter and the principal
investigator for algebras of this type, a conjecture that has been largely
confirmed otherwise. In the absence of Jiang-Su absorption the goal is to show
that these algebras do at least possess a less stringent property, namely, that
the set of invertible elements of such an algebra constitutes a dense subset of
the algebra.
