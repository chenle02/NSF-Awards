9602921 Boerner This Americas Program award will fund travel and related
expenses for a dissertation research project by Kelly L. Decker, Ohio State
University, under the direction of Dr. Ralph Boerner, and in collaboration with
Dr. Maria F. Hevia Hott, University of Concepcion, Chillan, Chile. They will
investigate various traits associated with contrasting leaf habits (deciduous
vs. evergreen) in temperate southern hemisphere forests. Specifically, the study
will address the adaptive advantage of an increased life span by focusing on
ecophysiological traits and relative competitive ability of evergreen and
deciduous species of Nothofagus (southern beech). Leaf lifespan is an important
ecological issue at present. The Nothofagus mixed deciduous forest system of
central Chile provides an excellent opportunity to study the relative adaptive
advantage of differing leaf lifespans because of the presence of pure Nothofagus
canopies containing both deciduous and evergreen species. Thus, this forest
system offers an interesting model for understanding the evolution and potential
adaptive significance of contrasting leaf traits. ***
