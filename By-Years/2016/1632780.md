This work aims to exploit recent advances in technology to shrink the cost and
size of accelerator-based synchrotron radiation facilities to a level
appropriate for typical university and industry labs, as well as hospitals.
Since their discovery in 1895, x-rays have been the single most powerful
technique for determining the structure of all forms of materials. Through
increasingly powerful techniques scientists and medical doctors, as well as
quality-control inspectors, airline passenger screeners, and forensic
investigators have resolved the length scales from the size of an atom to the
size of the human body. Every day, that knowledge underpins our modern
technologies, our health, and our safety. Today, however, the benchmark for
x-ray performance is set by large accelerator-based synchrotron radiation
facilities which, due to their size and cost, have to be located in national
labs or major university facilities. The goal of this project is to bring the
same cutting-edge capability to a smaller and cheaper
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to test a disruptive hypothesis
that modestly relativistic electron beams can generate and sustain density
modulations at x-ray scale. It aims to: (1) develop foundational understanding
of diffraction of relativistic beams through experiments with thin slab Si
crystals and to create a dynamical beam stop that extinguishes the forward beam;
(2) determine the dependence of diffraction parameters on electron beam
properties using experiment and simulation derived from first principles; (3)
demonstrate that diffraction can result in a nanopatterned beam where Si grating
structures and imaging optics are used to establish the density modulation in
the patterned beam; (4) demonstrate that the nanopatterned beam retains its
density modulation through acceleration with tunable period using a new state-
of-the-art Arizona State University (ASU) accelerator facility. This project
will facilitate mentorship and training of the next generation of x-ray and
accelerator scientists and engineers in the new world class accelerator R&amp;D
and x-ray science facility. Dissemination with global reach will be achieved
through the Nanopatterned Electron Beams Discovery Mission website, which will
host training modules that fortify hands-on instructional classroom outreach
programs to middle and high-school students and through K-12 'Science is Fun'
program at ASU.
