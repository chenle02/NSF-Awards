In the next 10 yrs, the Serengeti lion project will conduct comprehensive
research to construct and test detailed models of population and community
ecology. First, the project will investigate lion population dynamics in
stochastic environments, constructing generalized additive and generalized
linear models with population-level variables (overall food availability,
climate and population density), pride-level variables (local food availability,
pride size and structure) and individual variables (age and sex). Second, the
project will investigate the role of spatial heterogeneity in stabilizing the
coexistence of competing carnivore species. Cheetahs, lions and hyenas may show
divergent niche strategies that create a reticulated pattern of occupancy within
an overall pattern of coexistence. Third, the project will likely measure the
impact of a large-scale loss in prey availability on lion population dynamics
and sociality, owing to the impending collapse of the wildebeest migration.
While group living is predicted to be common across a wide range of resource
distributions at high population densities, grouping should be restricted to a
few localized areas at low densities. Fourth, the project will measure cycle
length of four viral diseases to test predictions of well parameterized multi-
host models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Data from this study will be
used by wildlife managers throughout the world, providing important insights for
predicting the consequences of habitat change and fragmentation, identifying the
landscape features necessary for species co-existence and measuring the
effectiveness of disease control programs. Based on the investigator's past
experience, continuation of this long-term program will result in numerous
publications, training of American and Tanzanian graduate students in ecology
and epidemiology, and widespread reporting in the popular press.
