Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main technical goal of this
research is to solve the problem of index coding from an interference alignment
perspective. The index coding problem lies at the intersection of several
challenging problems in network information theory such as broadcast channels,
source coding and network coding. This project explores the index coding problem
and its generalizations as they relate to the problem of optimal interference
management in wireless and wired communication networks, when only a coarse
knowledge of network topology is available to the transmitters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding
the capacity limits of wireless and wired networks under practical assumptions
is critical for industry, academia, government agencies and society in general,
to have realistic expectations from communication networks of the future.
Interference between concurrent information flows is a key bottleneck in both
wired and wireless networks. The unified perspective of interference management
taken in this research allows existing insights to be translated from wireless
networks to wired networks and vice versa, as well as the discovery of new
insights that cut across applications. The research brings together areas like
wireless communications, network coding, classical information theory, graph-
theory, as well as optimization and algorithms, providing cutting-edge training
to the participating student researchers in these critical technical areas.
