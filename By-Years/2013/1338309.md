This project will provide ground-based optical imaging measurements during the
DEEPWAVE field project which will take place in New Zealand in June-July 2014.
The DEEPWAVE campaign seeks to understand the generation and propagation of
atmospheric gravity waves from orographic and other sources from ground-level up
to 100 km altitude, and will use airborne and ground-based instrumentation. This
project will utilize a multi-spectral all-sky imager located at Mt John
Observatory, New Zealand. It will be underneath several of the planned DEEPWAVE
flight-paths. The measurements will characterize the gravity wave field in the
mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) and its temporal evolution, and will also
yield intrinsic gravity wave parameters such as horizontal and vertical scale-
sizes, momentum and energy fluxes prior to, during, and after DEEPWAVE flights.
Data will be disseminated via a website at Boston University and the CEDAR and
MADRIGAL databases, as well as to the general public via press releases and
informal outreach. The project will be carried out in collaboration with
scientists from New Zealand.
