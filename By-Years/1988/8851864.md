The ultracentrifuge obtained through this project is enabling the Division of
Natural Sciences to develop complete subcellular fractionation capabilities in
order to upgrade the curriculum in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, as well
as to add important new options to the undergraduate research program.
Experiments have been designed for the isolation of plasma membranes, tonoplast
membranes and other subcellular fractions, of such proteins as the ATPase and of
viruses, plasmids and nucleic acids that require the use of an ultracentrifuge.
These new experiments are being incorporated into the curriculum in order to
take advantage of faculty expertise in this field; to enable students to perform
advanced experiments involving the isolation of subcellular fractions, proteins
and nucleic acids; to extend and integrate use of other equipment such as the
HPLC, liquid scintillation counter and gas chromatograph, and to provide
students with practical experience in the growing number of areas in
Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology that require advanced subcellular
fractionation. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal
sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
