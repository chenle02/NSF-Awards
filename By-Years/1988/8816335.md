The Pyrenees are an Alpine-age collisional orogen located along the border of
the Iberian and European plates. Associated thrusting strongly affected
sedimentation and the presence of salt beds produced an unusually well-developed
set of structure that depend on a very weak layer. This project is designed to
address problems related to the interaction of thrusting, halo- tectonic and
sedimentary events. Results will be applicable to many collisional orogens in
which salt beds are present.
