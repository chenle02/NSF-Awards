0320639&lt;br/&gt;Selleck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a JEOL Model
JSM-6360 LV Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with CL and BSE detectors for
imaging and analysis of a variety of geological materials in the Department of
Geology at Colgate University. This equipment will replace an antiquated SEM
purchased in 1986. The new equipment will be interfaced with a new PGT Spirit
Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis System (EDS) purchased in spring 2002 with
university funds. A number of geological research projects are critically
dependent on the new SEM system including studies of paleoclimate in Alaska,
Antarctica and New York; mineral-plant interactions in acidified soil systems;
burial diagenesis and cementation in ancient sandstones; petrologic and tectonic
studies of the Grenville Orogen (including hydrothermal systems); and burial
taphonomy of dinosaur eggs. Undergraduate student research in Geology at Colgate
is used as a component of coursework and for upper-level independent projects
and theses; the new SEM will provide students with hands-on experience using
state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation for high resolution microscopy and
microchemical analysis of natural materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
