Claude Shannon's point-to-point information theory is a basis for the design of
all modern day communication systems, ranging from cellular communications,
cable and DSL modems, statellite communications, compact disks, etc. Extending
the theory from point-to-point communication to an entire network of
communicating nodes is a holy grail of the communication field. It is expected
that such an information theory of networks would have a significant impact for
applications such as wireless and sensor networks. Yet, despite significant
effort in the past 40 years, only isolated cases have been solved and there is
still limited understanding of central issues such as interference, cooperation,
broadcast and distributed compression of correlated information.

This research advocates a new general approach to attack network information
theory problems. The new approach involves three steps: 1) approximate the noisy
network with an appropriately chosen deterministic model which focuses on the
interaction between the various signals rather than the noise; 2) analyze the
analytically simpler deterministic model; 3) translate the insight into finding
approximately optimal strategy for the original noisy network with guaranteed
performance bound. Significant progress on several canonical long-standing open
problems shows the power of the approach: 1) capacity region of the two-user
Gaussian interference channel to within 1 bit/s/Hz per user; 2) capacity of the
Gaussian (single-node) relay channel to within 1 bit/s/Hz; 3) capacity of the
Gaussian relay network with arbitrary number of relays to within constant gap
independent of the SNR's of the links; 4) rate region of the Gaussian multiple
description problem to within a constant gap independent of the target
distortions of the users.
