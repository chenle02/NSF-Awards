This award provides support for US researchers who will attend the "Workshop on
Algebraic Design Theory and Hadamard Matrices," to be held at University of
Lethbridge, Canada, during July 8-11, 2014. The purpose of the workshop is to
bring together researchers and students interested in the theory of Hadamard
matrices and their applications, as well as related areas such as combinatorial
design theory, coding theory, quantum information theory and computer security.
The participants will learn about the latest developments in these areas, and
explore different visions for setting directions for future work.

Hadamard matrices are indispensable in engineering applications related to
mobile communications, data transmission, and error-control codes. In 1893, the
great French mathematician Jacques Hadamard posed a problem, which later became
known as the Hadamard matrix conjecture, namely, that every positive integer
divisible by 4 is the order of a square matrix with entries plus or minus one,
and having pairwise orthogonal rows. Although many infinite classes of such
matrices are known and a rich theory has evolved, this problem remains
unresolved and has risen in the field of combinatorics to a status comparable to
that held until recently by Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory.
