Geochemical evidence from high-sulfur impact glass spherules at the
Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary indicates that a bolide impact occurred on
evaporite sediment terrane, resulting in major emission to the atmosphere. PIs
will study the consequences of bolide impact on such terrane, the resulting
degassing of sulfurous gases to the atmosphere, formation of sulfuric acid
aerosol, and effects on the atmosphere and land. Sulfuric acid aerosol and
possibly acid rain may have been key factors in the global extinction at the K/T
boundary. The severity of the extinctions may thus be largely a function of the
unusual geology of the target terrane. During the first year PIs will determine
experimentally the processes of degassing of anhydrite and gypsum sediments and
the speciation of sulfur gases emitted. In the second year PIs will model the
environmental effects of an impact-induced sulfuric acid aerosol. These effects
may include: (a) alkalinity crisis due to the fallout of CaO derived from
dissociation of anhydrite, (b) global cooling due to stratospheric sulfate
aerosol, and (c) acid rain from fallout of sulfate aerosol.
