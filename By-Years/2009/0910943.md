Bruce Berne of Columbia University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program to pursue theoretical and computational
research with a focus on (a) large scale hydrophobicity and its mediation by
cosolutes; (b) the role of force in protein unfolding and refolding and in
mediating enzymatic reactions ; (c) the development of new efficient methods for
sampling rough energy landscapes and new molecular dynamics (MD) methods that
build on the multiple time scale methodologies developed in the PI's research
group. This research addresses some problems that have long resisted explanation
such as an explanation of the Hofmeister series and the mechanism by which urea
acts as a denaturant. Topic (b) focuses on molecular mechanisms of protein
folding and enzyme reactions under applied force as experimentally studied in
force microscopy (AFM). The research has broad applicability in many scientific
areas including chemistry, biology, nanoscience and engineering
