This material synthesis and processing project is focused on next generation
magnetic materials. Of primary importance is the preparation and
characterization of high anisotropy CoPt and FePt nanoparticles. The particles
will be prepared by a "cluster gun" assembly equipped with a special heat-
treating stage, required to transform their structure from the fcc phase to the
high anisotropy fct phase. Specially prepared substrates will also be used to
assemble these nanoscale particles into ordered arrays. The properties of the
particles and their arrays will be investigated as candidate media for high-
density magnetic recording. The project will provide one post-doctoral associate
with cutting edge training and education in magnetism and materials science. The
project is co-funded between the Metals Program and the Condensed Matter Physics
Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This material synthesis and processing
project is focused on next generation magnetic materials. As a magnetic particle
is continually reduced in size to the nanometer regime, it becomes susceptible
to temperature effects that can cause its magnetization to fluctuate in
different directions. It is no longer possible to "store" information in the
particle's magnetization orientation. These issues are among the most important
limits to how dense information can be stored on hard disk drives. The objective
of this research is to develop recording media that will function at room
temperature while using particles of sizes below one millionth of an inch. The
materials are alloys or compounds of cobalt, platinum and iron. The project will
provide one post-doctoral associate with cutting edge training and education in
magnetism and materials science. The project is co-funded between the Metals
Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program.&lt;br/&gt;
