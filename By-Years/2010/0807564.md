Dr. Huterer will study statistical isotropy of the universe on its largest
scales, following on other recent studies that indicate that the underlying sky
in the cosmic microwave background observations is not statistically isotropic.
Traditional approaches for extracting cosmological parameters would be invalid
if the universe is not isotropic, requiring new techniques for estimation. The
funded research will study the distribution of galaxies and other sources in
surveys covering wavelengths from radio to gamma-ray, and will complement the
traditional studies based on previous satellite observations. An alternative
representation of cosmological perturbations on the sky using multipole vectors
will be used for tests of alignments and isotropy in the large-scale structure
and cosmic microwave background data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of
this work will include an education/outreach program aimed at tutoring teachers,
and involvement with the Exhibit Museum (and planetarium) of National History in
Ann Arbor to introduce cosmology exhibits and increase visibility of this
institution in the wider Detroit metro area.
