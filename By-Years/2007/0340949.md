This work investigates some theoretical aspects of clockless digital VLSI design
with emphasis on methods for assessing and optimizing the confidence level, the
so-called yield, of the design. The particular system model under investigation
is wave pipeline without any clock-controlled operations, the so-called,
clockless asynchronous wave pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will
specifically address and resolve the following problems: theoretical
characterization of clockless-specific delay faults and the fault rate; modeling
and analysis of yield; testing algorithms and fault-coverage analysis; and
finally fault-tolerance algorithms. This work will ultimately establish a sound
and adequate theoretical foundation for development of exploratory, yet
practical test/diagnosis/fault-tolerance methods in early design stage of
clockless wave pipeline, thereby enabling further research towards development
of computer-aided design tools for clockless electronic VLSI
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
