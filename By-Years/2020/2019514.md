This travel grant provides support for 15 US-based students to attend the 30th
Conference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) to be held in Los Angeles,
California on July 19-24 2020. CAV, one of the premier conferences in formal
verification, is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of
computer-aided formal analysis and synthesis methods for hardware and software
systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete
applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the
algorithms and techniques that are needed for their
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will enable career
development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US-citizen graduate
students. Attending conferences like CAV is an important component of graduate
school education for future computer-science researchers. Students have the
opportunity to discuss leading-edge research with world-class researchers in
formal methods, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships
that will serve them well during their research careers. This project aims at
increasing the participation of students from underrepresented groups and those
from smaller institutions of education, to provide them with equal
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
