Receptors are proteins that are involved in the communication between nerve
cells, playing an important role in cellular activity. The goal of this research
project is to study the muscarinic receptor, a receptor activated by the
chemical release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which causes different
effects in cells. Initial studies will be performed to determine which of the
five subtypes of the muscarinic receptor alters cellular activity. In order to
accomplish this, Dr. Jones will develop probes, antibodies that are raised
against each of the muscarinic receptor subtypes. These probes will attach only
to the receptor subtype against which the antibody was raised. It is postulated
that these antibodies will prevent the activation of the receptors. By
monitoring the activity induced by the receptors individually, the antibody can
be added, and if the activity of the receptor is terminated the antibodies are
thus considered useful probes. Understanding the mechanisms by which these
receptors control cellular activity in nerve cells will aid in the understanding
of how the brain works.
