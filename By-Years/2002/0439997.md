Paleomagnetic and paleointensity data of late Archean/early
Proterozoic&lt;br/&gt;age (approximately 2.7 to 2.5 million years old) show many
of the&lt;br/&gt;hallmarks of the geomagnetic field of the last 200 million
years. Our&lt;br/&gt;picture of the field prior to this time, however, is
unclear because&lt;br/&gt;even the best-preserved rocks have likely seen
prolonged low-grade&lt;br/&gt;metamorphic conditions. A new CO2
laser/superconducting quantum interference&lt;br/&gt;device (SQUID) magnetometer
approach affords the opportunity to analyze&lt;br/&gt;for the first time
paleomagnetic and paleointensity signatures of single,&lt;br/&gt;oriented
silicate grains. These grains contain minute magnetic inclusions&lt;br/&gt;that
should preserve original magnetizations. A joint laboratory and
field&lt;br/&gt;plan will be pursued, focused on the analysis of Archean
plutonic rocks of&lt;br/&gt;the Kaapvaal Craton (southern
Africa).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The definition of the nature of the Archean
geomagnetic field&lt;br/&gt;will be of interest to a broad range of scientists
studying&lt;br/&gt;the early Earth and inner core, as well as those
involved&lt;br/&gt;in numerical and experimental simulations of planetary
dynamos. The work&lt;br/&gt;will contribute to scientific infrastructure,
through the development of&lt;br/&gt;the CO2 laser/SQUID magnetometer system,
and to education. Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students will be involved
in the full range of activities&lt;br/&gt;associated with the project, including
field studies, equipment&lt;br/&gt;development and laboratory
analyses.&lt;br/&gt;
