9361882 Dockterman Falling test scores, a struggling economy, an ethnically
diverse population, and changes in the global marketplace have brought the
American educational system under increasing scrutiny and attack. The need for
new skills in the Information Age has prompted reform efforts in all areas of
the curriculum, but with a special focus on science. In concert with curricular
change, reformers have also targeted assessment. They have recognized that what
is evaluated often drives what is taught. Thus, there is a very pressing need in
K-12 education today for practical programs and materials to help all schools
plan and implement alternative assessment approaches. In response to this need,
Tom Snyder Productions, working with the Coalition of Essential Schools,
proposes to prototype and evaluate a technology-based package designed to engage
teachers and administrators in informed discussion and practical ongoing action
in the area of alternative assessment in science instruction. The centerpiece of
this package will be a CD-ROM based simulation, Dealing with Assessment: Science
Education, that simultaneously introduces the issues and provides a foundation
of skills for independent action by teachers and administrators. ***
