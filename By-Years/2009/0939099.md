Initially, sentencing was meant to refer only to the actions of the judge at the
sentencing hearing, but the field has come to understand that all actions by
actors in the criminal justice system have a role to play in final punishment
outcomes. From this perspective, sentencing research can be thought to
incoroporate all "sentencing" decisions, including charging, plea bargains, and
even parole release decisions. The predominant mode of research in the field in
recent years has been the sophisticated statistical analysis of conviction data.
Despite the impressive success of this main paradigm of sentencing research,
there is a growing sense among scholars in criminology that this particular
approach has stalled. This symposium is intended to help identify new avenues
for work in this area, in part by actively connecting the range of scholars
engaging in sentencing research. A further intention is to more explicitly
connect empirical researchers in this field to the policymakers in this area
(e.g., sentencing commissions, judges, legislators) and to integrate junior
scholars and scholars from underrepresented groups into the broader community of
sentencing scholars.
