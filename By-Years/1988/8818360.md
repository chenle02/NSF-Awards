Typically stars are born in clusters of a few hundred member stars or more. The
stars have a range of masses and they evolve at different rates, depending on
their masses and composition. Hence, by observing members of star clusters, the
rate of evolution of stars can be determined. The Principal Investigator
proposes to observe a number of star clusters in our Galaxy, both old and young.
His data will provide valuable input into making comparisons between the sun,
which is approximately 4.5 billion years old, and the evolutionary stages of the
member stars in those clusters.
