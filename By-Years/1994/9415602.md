PROJECT ABSTRACT The overall objective of this research project is to obtain
accurate and quantitative data on decay rates of marine viruses and a
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms responsible for viral decay in the
marine environment. Part of this study will investigate viral decay caused by
solar radiation, attachment to particles, grazing by microflagellates, and
bacteria degradation. The study will attempt to distinguish between decay rates
of viral infectivity and the disappearance of viral particles. The study will
also undertake of marine viruses from several families in order to better
incorporate the "viral loop" into geochemical cycling. The results should yield
important findings toward a conceptual understanding of what controls viral
dynamics in the marine environment, and provide quantitative data for a variety
of marine environments on removal rates and the factors responsible for the
removal of viral infectivity and particles in from the sea.
