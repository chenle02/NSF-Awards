96-14275 Levi The PI proposes to obtain a detailed record of the Matuyama
paleomagnetic field, directions, and relative paleointensities, from the Erk-el-
Ahmar Formaiton in Israel, which contains the oldest known hominid tool-bearing
strata outside Africa. This is a pilot paleomagnetic study of rapidly-deposited
lacustrine sediments which are expected to provide a high resolution record of
the Matuyama geomagnetic field that is suitable for: comparing secular variation
and relatiave paleointensity of polarity intervals; examining field behavior
during successive polarity transitions at the same locality; and testing the
recently proposed hypothesis of intensity asymmetry across reversal boundaries.
The PI also postulates that the detailed magnetostratigraphy will contribute to
an improved understanding of the timing and pathways of the original hominid
migration from Africa. ***
