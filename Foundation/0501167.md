Slaman proposes to investigate the effective aspects of randomness. The central
question to be answered is, "How can we evaluate the random content of an
infinite binary sequence?" One case is well understood, that in which an
infinite sequence X of 0's and 1's is random if and only if each digit is chosen
independently and with equal probability for the values of 0 and 1. In this
case, X's being effectively random has been equivalently characterized by
Martin-Lof in terms of X's having the properties of almost all infinite
sequences and by Kolmogorov and others in terms of X's being unpredictable and
indescribable. Slaman proposes to study the non-uniform case, its associated
criteria for effective randomness, and its possibilities for the sets of random
sequences. Even the most basic questions are open. For example, for a given
infi- nite binary sequence X, under what conditions does there exist a measure
relative to which X is random? This is a classic mathematical problem, given an
individual data set determine a distribution which would generate it.
Qualitatively, a measure relative to which X is random concentrates on the
nonrandom aspects of X and thereby separates those from the random ones. Other
ways to quantify X's random content include the complexity of X's initial
segments and X's ability to compute uniformly random sequences. The proposal is
to investigate all of these and the relationships between them.
