One of the most promising fields within separations technology involves
permeation through membranes. A particularly effective subcategory within this
field uses liquid membranes on a suitable support. The separation is achieved by
a chemical carrier within the liquid that combines with the desired component on
one side of the membrane, by a process called complexation, and is then released
on the other side by a reversal of the process. This method is capable of high
transfer rates and effects the separation of desired species from mixtures
without high energy requirements for phase change or pressure drop. A three-
person research team has been studying this separation phenomenon with each
specializing in an important aspect of the process. Preliminary results have
been encouraging from the multi-faceted challenges encountered in such a system.
What has been impressive thus far is the success that has resulted from using
mathematical modeling to identify and resolve experimental differences from
theoretical expectations. Certain of the models have served to guide the course
of the research plan and yield improved systems.
