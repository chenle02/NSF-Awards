9531115 Zangwill The magnetic properties of ultra-thin (< 5 monolayers) films
are likely to be strongly affected by the surface roughness. The step edges of a
rough film are sites of reduced symmetry and the magnetic moments located at
these sites must experience different exchange constants as well as different
anisotropy fields. The principal objective in this grant is to develop a
consistent theory of magnetic hysteresis that connects the structure and
morphology of these materials to their coercivity and remanence The program
calls for extensive numerical calculations augmented by analytic and numerical
analysis of toy models and continuum equations suggested by the simulations. The
calculations offer direct evaluation of various experimentally measurable
quantities and thus afford comparison with the experiments. %%% Magnetic thin
films are used in a variety of applications, the most well known being in memory
devices. This grant is comprehensive program of theoretical research to study
the magnetic properties of realistic thin films i.e. the program incorporates
the structural and morphological effects (of surface roughness) in an essential
way. ***
