Recent progress in wireless system and network security exploits wireless
channel characteristics, also known as link signatures, to offer enhanced and
sometimes the only available security solutions for ubiquitous wireless
applications; two prominent examples are link-signature based secret key
generation and physical layer authentication. However, it is found that the
current link-signature study makes wrong assumptions about the adversary's
inference capability, which will expose the legitimate systems to severe threats
with little awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective
of this project is to seek a fundamental understanding of the limits in
adversarial inference of wireless channel characteristics, and develop stronger
link-signature based security mechanisms for wireless communications. Various
analytical channel correlation models involving important physical propagation
factors in typical wireless environments will be investigated, and effective
inference algorithms and practical designs will be explored from the adversary's
position, to determine the vulnerability of existing wireless security
mechanisms. Then, two approaches will be considered to further strengthen the
current wireless security solutions: one is to exploit multiple-antenna and
cooperative communication techniques to disrupt the adversarial inference
process, and the other is to integrate cryptographic techniques into link-
signature constructions to achieve improved and guaranteed
protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit is correction of a wide-spread misconception about the link-signature
security, and establishment of a proven scientific foundation facilitating the
development of new wireless security mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are significantly improvement in the
security of current and emerging wireless devices and systems, cross-
disciplinary education, and well-rounded training of future IT workforce.
