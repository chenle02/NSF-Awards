Poor endpoint positional accuracy of current industrial robots has restricted
their applications to tasks that are error tolerant. This research focuses on
improving end-of-arm accuracy by mounting additional sensors and actuators on
the end effector. The rationale is to make the gripper insensitive to link
static and dynamic deflections. This technique requires design and development
of a new sensor and actuator capable of measuring and correcting the end-of-arm
transverse deflections in the vertical and horizontal directions. To separate
the issue of compensating for the end-of-arm deflections from the overall
control problem of the robot arm, the additional sensors and actuators will be
tested on a single flexible beam controlled by a servo loop controller. A
mathematical model describing the combined rigid and flexible motions of the
compliant link will be developed. Performance of the proposed approach will be
evaluated through digital simulation studies. Further evaluation will be
performed by testing the sensor and actuator on an actual flexible link.
