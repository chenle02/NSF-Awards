The Institute for Scientist and Engineer Educators (ISEE) has developed a series
of programs that train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in technical
fields to become effective educators. They are expanding their emphasis toward
broadening participation of underrepresented groups in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields by emphasizing inclusiveness and
inquiry-based learning. Greater participation by women and members of
underrepresented groups in STEM will secure our nation's future and long-term
economic competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ISEE established the
Professional Development Program for early career scientists learning to teach
in 2001. Participants commit ~100 hours to a year-long cycle of activities
including an introductory workshop and follow-up activities. Many will return to
become mentors in the program. ISEE will develop, test, and implement Inclusive
Leadership Institutes. The project will also lead to a Mentor Workshop in
Hawai'i, and 75 Hawai'i mentors will be supported to attend the workshops.
