9732908 Saadatmanesh During the past decade, an increasing level of attention
has been paid to fiber reinforced polymer composites as an alternative
construction materials. Several studies by various researchers in this area have
indicated that one of the most promising applications of fiber composites in
construction is in the area of structural repair and retrofit. In particular,
research in this field has indicated that epoxy bonded fiber composite sheets
and laminates can be used to externally reinforce a variety of civil engineering
type structures for seismic and nonseismic forces. The recent NSF workshop on
research needs in the area of composites for construction, clearly attests to
the promise of this technology and to the need for an effective and coordinated
research plan. This project addresses the long-term durability of the bond at
the interface of composite/concrete and composite/steel. A large number of short
term studies have indicated the effectiveness of fiber composites for
strengthening of structures, however, very few, if any at all, have addressed
the bond and interface behavior, in particular, the long- term durability of the
bond. The successful application of this technology requires a fundamental
understanding of the long-term bond behavior. A comprehensive, accelerated aging
test program will be developed to investigate the bond under various aggressive
environmental conditions simulated by special chemical solutions. Analytical
models based on diffusion theories will be developed to predict the rate of
diffusion of aggressive elements into the composite and the bond. Fick's law
will be adopted to predict the moisture profile, and aggressive elements
diffusion into the composite and the bondline. Peck's relationship will be
utilized to estimate the life of the bond. ***
