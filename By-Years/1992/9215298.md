This research effort is designed to develop an Electro Discharge Machining
(EDM) technology data base for hard to machine, brittle materials and develop an
on-line monitoring and control scheme for process optimization based on standard
statistical and neural network approaches. This will enable the efficient
machining of complex contours in materials such as polycrystalline diamond (PCD)
and conductive ceramics. Since the EDM process is complex and random due to
transient dielectric flow conditions and distribution of debris, deterministic
and stochastic modelling and analysis will be utilized to understand the process
and to develop quantitative models for the material removal rates, arcing and
wire rupture. This research is very timely in the sense that utilization of hard
materials for a variety of industrial processes is on an increase. The ability
to monitor and optimize the EDM process will have a significant impact on the
efficiency and productivity of industry.
