This award supports research in commutative algebra and ring theory. One of the
principal investigators will work on the integral representation of Gl(n). The
other principal investigator will work on the representation theory of artin
algebras and theory of lattices over higher dimensional orders, with special
emphasis on maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over isolated Cohen-Macaulay
singularities. This research is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an
algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it.
Although the additive operation satisfies the commutative law, the
multiplicative operation is not required to do so. An example of a ring for
which multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over
the integers. The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part of
algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches of mathematics
and physics.
