0322512 Sapienza Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: The Evolution of
Entrepreneurial Teams in University-based Spinouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is a longitudinal study of entrepreneurial teams in university-based
spinouts, designed to capture data at the birth of new organizations and then
follow them as the management teams develop. Data will be collected over a 30
month period, on a sample of more than 100 spinout teams from a number of major
American universities. This will provide rich data not only about teams that
successfully create and manage spinouts, but also about teams that do not
continue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory-building part of the project will
develop descriptive and normative theory applicable not only to university-based
spinouts, but to the broader areas of the emergence of organizational purpose,
new top management team development, and team formation in general. The theory-
testing portion of the project will deepen theories of the effects of team
composition on strategic direction and performance. By examining strategic
decision processes during the dynamic process of entrepreneurial team and firm
formation, we gain new insight not only into how decision routines are formed
but also into the evolution of strategic purpose itself. The research team is
comprised of scholars in entrepreneurship, strategy, and organizational theory
with deep knowledge of cognitive theories, team processes, and new venture
creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the study are its
significant implications in the technology transfer arena, which includes
entrepreneurial firms, university incubators, policy makers, and regional
economic development. Insight into how successful entrepreneurial teams are
built will: (1) help technology-based entrepreneurs better foresee the likely
outcomes of the choices they make while building an entrepreneurial team; and
(2) inform the policies, funding, and advice by which governments, universities,
and firms seek to improve technology transfer and commercialization efforts.
