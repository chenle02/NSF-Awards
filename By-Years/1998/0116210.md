0116210&lt;br/&gt;Nelson&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of Washington will provide support for acquisition of a high
resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer for a multi-disciplinary
group of researchers in earth and ocean sciences. Ongoing research programs can
take immediate advantage of the new instrumentation, and it is expected to
significantly enhance research capabilities for faculty and students. University
of Washington will contribute cost-sharing of more than 30% of the cost of this
project from non-federal funds. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
