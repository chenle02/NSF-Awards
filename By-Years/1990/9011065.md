This is a joint project between the University of Colorado and the consulting
engineering firm of Atkinson-Noland and Associates, Inc. of Boulder, Colorado,
in cooperation with engineers from Italy and Yugoslavia. The project will
investigate the lateral load resistance of masonry-infilled reinforced concrete
structures to determine the feasibility of using the method to reinforce
existing reinforced concrete buildings and to evaluate the safety of existing
buildings.
