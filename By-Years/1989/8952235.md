This project will support the establishment of a computer laboratory which will
be used to help develop high level analytical skills in students in selected
mathematics courses. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the quality of the
undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or improved
instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in science,
mathematics, or engineering. In particular, the courses to be affected by this
project are honors calculus, differential equations, applied linear algebra,
applied mathematics, numerical analysis, and modern algebra. The primary
software tools will be a solver with graphics capabilities for ordinary
differential equations, mathematical graphics tools, and a symbolic manipulation
program.
