A dedicated secretariat for the Internet Activities Board (IAB) and its
subsidiary Task Forces will be created. The IAB is responsible to the Federal
Research Internet Coordinating Council (FRICC) comprising members from
government agencies concerned with scientific research: Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, National Air and Space Administration, National
Institutes for Health, Department of Energy, and National Science Foundation.
The IAB manages the evolution of the Government Research Internet which
continues to expand to more and more institutions including government
laboratories and academic research institutions each year. This rapid growth has
been stimulated in large measure by the NSFNET, Regional networks, and
Supercomputer Center initiatives sponsored by NSF. The secretariat will assist
the IAB in carrying out its responsibilities, including development and adoption
of new Internet Standards, short and mid-term engineering of the Internet,
identification of pressing research areas and long term transitions to standard
international protocols and super high speed networks. The dedicated support is
essential to maintain and improve the utility of the research Internet and the
research infrastructure it provides to U. S. scientists and engineers. //
