The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a protective coating for energy conservation and emission
reduction. Multifunctional protective coating materials and processes are
urgently needed to alleviate the problem of ineffective coating technologies.
For example, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems costs can
represent more than 50% percent of a buildingâ€™s energy consumption, yet the high
cost of maintenance and corrosion of commercial HVAC units are often overlooked.
Humidity and exposure to pollutants like hydrocarbons are major causes of
corrosion, commonly observed on the heat exchanger coils from HVAC systems. When
corrosion sets in, the operating efficiency can soon be reduced by 50-70%, and
unit life halved. This will progressively increase energy bills, discharge of
CO2, and health risks for occupants. Current epoxy-based coatings are thick
polymers with low thermal conductivity, which commonly act as an insulating
layer and inevitably reduce the heat exchange efficiency by up to 15%. Moreover,
epoxy coatings are neither flexible nor UV resistant. Eventually, they tend to
peel off or disintegrate, which leaves the coils unprotected from corrosion
damage. The proposed hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) protective coating may
increase heat exchange by 70%, and add elevated anti-corrosion, anti-abrasion
properties to HVAC systems to survive harsh working environments reducing energy
costs and emissions.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a scalable chemical-assisted
ball-mill process for large-scale production of ultra-fine hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) nanosheets. The hBN nanosheet is an electrically insulating and
thermally conductive layered material with excellent thermal and chemical
stabilities making it a promising anti-corrosion, anti-oxidation, anti-wear, as
well as anti-erosion coating additive. The manufacturing process starts with HBN
powder, the polymer deformation and sheer force resulting from collision
facilitate the exfoliation of commercial bulk hBN. The process has the
additional advantage of being able to integrate optional chemicals during ball-
milling, which could provide hBN with designated chemical functionalities. In
addition, thin hBN flakes may be further integrated into continuous film on
various industrial substrates using existing coating techniques, such as vapor
deposition and spray coating. Successful development of the proposed technology
may significantly improve coating performance and provide a process for
integrating materials into a protective coating on different industrial
substrates.
