This goal of this research is to create new techniques for advancing our
understanding of the role of trust within human-autonomous vehicle interactions
and assisting in the design of safe and trustworthy autonomy into future
vehicles. We are witnessing accelerating technological advances in autonomous
vehicles. As the degree of autonomy of vehicles increases and the nature of
human-autonomy interactions becomes more complex, key questions that need to be
asked are how to ensure safety and trust in human-autonomous vehicle
interactions. On the one hand, high-profile incidents make clear the risks from
"overtrust" or over-reliance on autonomous vehicles. On the other hand,
"undertrust" may cause the neglect or under-utilization of automation. This work
will be integrated into the graduate and undergraduate education on cyber-
physical systems, as well as various Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM) outreach programs for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approach is to develop languages and algorithms for formally expressing and
reasoning about trust in human-autonomous vehicle interactions. This includes
new models that can represent a human's trust in autonomous vehicles, together
with new formal methods that can use these models in a tractable manner to
verify trust requirements. The key innovations include new methods to measure
trust based on multi-modal sensing of human cognitive and physiological states,
new methods to express and verify trust-based specifications, and new methods to
explain trust-based decisions in human-autonomy interactions. If successful,
this research will allow the formalization of trust in human-autonomous vehicle
interactions and the design of autonomous vehicles that establish appropriate
levels of trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
