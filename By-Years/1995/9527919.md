9527919 Norton Nitrogen is the element most frequently limiting to plant growth.
Yet, excess use of fertilizers can lead to local excesses of nitrogen which have
negative environmental impacts. Nitrification is a key process in the nitrogen
cycle resulting in N loss from ecosystems, eutrophication of surface and ground
water and the production of atmospherically active trace gases. The bacteria
responsible for the first step in nitrification are known as ammonia oxidizing
bacteria. Basic ecological aspects of soil ammonia oxidizing bacteria remain
poorly characterized, at least partially because the existing methods for
examination of these bacteria in the environment are difficult to use. This
study will develop new methods for the characterization of the quantity and
diversity of these important soil bacteria based on the genetic material which
encodes a key enzyme of ammonia oxidation. These methods will be applied to
examine the soil ammonia oxidizing bacteria in a dryland wheat agricultural
system and in a western montane forest site.
