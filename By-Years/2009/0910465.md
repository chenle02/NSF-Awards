The value of social computing environments has been demonstrated in many
contexts, including web search, shared bookmarking and photo sharing, personal
social networking, online support groups, and information resources such as
Wikipedia. Collaborative game environments have been used as both research
environments to study collaboration and as environments for facilitating
scientific meetings, and professional organizations and scientific communities
also leverage cyberinfrastructure and social network applications to share
resources, collect data, and facilitate communication. Virtual worlds have also
been applied to support a diverse range of professional and work activities,
however, there is so far little empirical evidence on how virtual worlds are
adopted and leveraged to promote scientific progress. The exploratory research
proposed here aims to explore how virtual worlds can be leveraged in the digital
curation community for purposes of improving work practices and training.
