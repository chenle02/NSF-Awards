Problem to be addressed: The Biology Department has realized a 50% increase in
student enrollments in biology courses over a five-year period. Increased
enrollments have stretched the college's ability to provide students with hands-
on use of technology. The purchase of Calculator-Based Laboratory (CBL) Systems
will enable us to offer educational experiences to students which improve
instruction by using inexpensive, durable, modern equipment. Objectives: Improve
the scientific competencies of students to monitor, record and analyze
biological data. Methods: Each CBL System will allow an average class of 28
students to work in groups of two students per station. Students will perform a
multitude of hands-on experiences in 1) Ecology, 2) Environmental Biology, and
3) Physiology. Audience: Twelve hundred students enrolled in undergraduate
biology courses at Waubonsee Community College. Additional students enrolled in
distance learning courses at community colleges in northern Illinois.
Collaborations: None in project year. Fox Valley Education Alliance which
includes five community college districts after the first project year.
Significance of Impact on Undergraduate Education: The project offers hands-on
laboratory experiences using inexpensive modern technology and equipment and
would serve as a model to extend biology laboratory instruction via distance
learning networks both regionally and nationally.
