This award will provide partial support for Dr. Jon Takemoto of Utah State
University to conduct collaborative research for eleven months in Japan with Dr.
Tokichi Miyakawa of Hiroshima University. Their research will be on the
mechanisms of toxin - cellular membrane interaction. They will study the mode of
action of the phytotoxin, syringomycin on the yeast, Rhodosporodium toluroides,
focusing on the phosphorylation of plasmamembrane proteins and the regulation of
cellular calcium concentration. An understanding of and ability to regulate
enzymes associated with cellular plasma membranes would have broad implications
regarding the mechanisms of plant growth and development, as well as plant
pathogenic phenomena. Dr. Miyakawa is an authority on the molecular mechanisms
in the yeast R. toluroides. His laboratory in the Department of Fermentation
Technology at Hiroshima University has the facilities to grow and handle this
organism, together with expertise in the procedures for purifying plasma
membranes and kinases, and assaying protein phosphorylation. Dr. Takemoto has
been investigating the structure and mode of action of syringomycin for the past
five years. Collaboration with Dr. Miyakawa will enable integration of
techniques and a testing of hypothesis across different organisms.
