This award provides support for campaign coordination activities in one of the
principal components of the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program. The GEM
program is aimed at making fundamental advances in our understanding of the
geospace (upper- atmosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere) environment through
coordinated efforts of groups of scientists engaged in observational,
theoretical, and modeling activities. The goals of the program are established
by active scientists based on results and discussions at workshops. The
principal focus of the campaign coordination workshops to be supported by this
project is on observations.
