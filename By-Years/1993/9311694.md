9311694 Elliott This project is in the general area of analytical and surface
chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry. During the tenure of this
thirty-nine month continuing grant, Professor Elliott and his students will
investigate various fundamental and applied chemical aspects of electroactive
polymers. Three thrust areas will be pursued. In the first, the efficacy of
Nafion membrane immobilized ruthenium functionalized porphyrins on electrode
surfaces as electrochemical detectors for olefins will be explored. In the
second, poly N-methyl pyrrole modified electrodes will be evaluated as detectors
for one- and two-carbon polychloroalkanes in aqueous solution. In the third
thrust area, new bisbipyridylalkane-based polymers will be prepared and
evaluated as robust conducting films for preparing polymer modified electrodes.
These materials hold promise as effective electrocatalytic agents. %%% The
successful attainment of the goals of this research could enable the development
of new classes of modified electrode sensors which would be quite useful as
monitors of environmentally invasive species. Additionally, new conducting
polymeric materials targeted for synthesis and evaluation in this project are
expected to have significant technological applications. ***
