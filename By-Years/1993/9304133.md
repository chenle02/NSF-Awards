9304133 Ryan This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of a direct current plasma emission spectrometer (DCP) system to be
installed and operated in the Department of Geology at the University of South
Florida in Tampa. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
needed for the acquisition. The DCP will be an integral part of the research
activities of several faculty members and their students who require high
precision elemental chemical analyses of geological rock and water samples.
Their current investigations include geochemical studies of volcanic and
metamorphic rocks from subduction zones, fluid- rock interactions during
diagenesis of sediments, paleoclimate reconstructions from biotic carbonates,
and the geological record of sea-level changes. ***
