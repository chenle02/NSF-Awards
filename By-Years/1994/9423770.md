The four components of this project span particle acceleration in solar flares
as well as the coordination and development of solar ground-based solar
observations. The PI plans to (1) expand previous analyses showing a direct
relationship between specific hard x-ray spectral evolution signatures in flares
and high-energy interplanetary proton events; (2) examine properties of the 450
unsampled flares to test a proton prediction algorithm previously derived; (3)
explore high energy spatial characteristics of these events to gain insight into
source geometries; (4) address data collected during the maximum of cycle 22;
and (5) employ an REU assistant in analyzing data for rapid optical fluctuations
and linear polarization signatures. In addition, this project will coordinate
ground-based observations in conjunction with new space missions. Finally, the
PI plans to support, in part, numerous observing campaigns.***
