Funds are requested to replace the transmitter for the Urbana medium frequency
(MF) radar, an important contributor to the study of middle atmosphere dynamics.
A new unit will be computer controlled, automatically reset after a power
failure, and more easily maintained by students. In addition, funds are also
requested for the purpose of replacing the single existing receiver with four
new units. This work is important because the Urbana radar will contribute to
the improved understanding of longitudinal differences in mean winds and tides.
