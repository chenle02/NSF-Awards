9303814 Hovis This research project will focus on energies of mineral processes.
Aspects of particular interest include the energies of mixing in ternary
feldspars and the nepheline- kalsilite system as determined by investigating the
enthalpies and volumes of K-Na mixing, the Gibbs energies and entropies of
mixing for nepheline-kalsilite as yielded by phase equilibrium (solvus)
measurements, the dependence of enthalpies and volumes of mixing, normally
assumed to be constant with T and P, on these variables, and the energies
associated with other mineral processes such as order- disorder in
orthopyroxenes and exsolution in alkali feldspars. The major techniques to be
utilized include solution calorimetry, drop calorimetry, and room- and high-
temperature x-ray powder diffraction.
