The study of nonlinear partial differential equations is necessitated by
countless problems from diverse disciplines: physics, economics, biology, etc.
Fully nonlinear equations is a more recent subject within this field, but its
importance is increasing due to the growing number of connections to other
fields. In particular, the study of special Lagrangian submanifolds of Calabi-
Yau manifolds is of particular interest in string theory, and consequently an
active area of research among physicists and mathematicians alike.

Because of the rapid growth and broad interest of the field, it is a natural
topic for a CBMS Regional Conference. Researchers and graduate students who are
new to the field can see how geometric problems of current interest can be
reformulated as problems in nonlinear PDE, and at the same time witness the
often surprising ways in which the geometric aspects of the problem inform the
analytic aspects (and vice versa).

Adding to the appeal of the meeting is the principal lecturer, Prof. Neil
Trudinger. His reputation as an eminent researcher and gifted expositor make him
an ideal choice to deliver the lectures. Moreover, the monograph resulting from
the meeting will be of interest to scientists in a wide range of fields.
