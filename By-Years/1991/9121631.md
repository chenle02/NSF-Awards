This project contains three subprojects, in the first of which three models will
be used to probe the transition structure preferences in the reaction of
enoxysilanes with aldehydes. Double bond orientation, the role of Lewis acids
and facial preferences with chiral Lewis acids will be studied. The second
subproject will develop general synthetic methodology involving the use of
organotin reagents as nucleophiles for stereoselective opening of chiral
acetals. The third area of study involves development of a new class of chiral
Lewis acids based on strain-release Lewis acidity, the invention of a catalytic
asymmetric aldol condensation, the study of a catalytic asymmetric allylation of
aldehydes using metallacyclobutanes and preparation of a reagent for asymmetric
allylation of aldehydes using pentacoordinate siliconate complexes. %%% With
this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. Scott E. Denmark of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Illinois, Urbana. The primary objectives of the research are: 1) to elucidate
those factors responsible for stereochemical control in an important family of
reactions of silicon compounds 2) to expand the synthetic utility of organotin
reagents, and 3) to develop new catalytic reactions for asymmetric synthesis.
Asymmetric synthesis leads to the preferential production of only one of the
many products possible from reactions of a complicated set of starting
materials, and is of critical importance for the efficient synthesis of large
organic molecules.
