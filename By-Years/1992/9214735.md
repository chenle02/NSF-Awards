This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
James E. Johnson at Texas Woman's University. The role of stereoelectronic
effects in nucleophilic substitution reactions at the carbon-nitrogen double
bond will be explored. Geometric isomers of imines will be synthesized, the
rates of their reactions with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles will be measured,
and the structures of the products will be determined. The specific studies that
will be undertaken include: (1) nucleophilic substitution on cyclic hydroximates
and hydroximoyl chlorides; (2) methoxide ion substitution on the Z and E isomers
of n-propyl O-methylethoxy formohydroximate; (3) amine substitution in the Z and
E isomers of hydroximoyl chlorides, and (4) hydrolysis of the Z and E isomers of
a hydroximoyl tosylate and/or a hydroximoyl bromide. %%% The rates of reaction
of several substrates that different in the arrangement of their atoms in space
will be measured. Differences in reactivity and in the structures of the
products will allow assessment of the effect of nonbonding electrons on the
course of the reaction. The results of this study will contribute to an improved
understanding of reactions of organic compounds which contain nitrogen atoms.
