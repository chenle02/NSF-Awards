The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address chronic sleep deprivation among
American teenagers, which has only been made worse by the recent pandemic.
Adolescents' natural internal circadian clocks typically run 1-3 hours later
than adults, leading to the tendency to stay up late, difficulty falling asleep,
insufficient total sleep time, and morning grogginess. This project is designed
to improve sleep for adolescents and young adults by advancing their circadian
clocks leading to healthier sleep. Today, there are almost 42 million
adolescents in the United States aged 11-19, and another 18.9 million young
adults aged 20-24, making the commercial potential of this project to be a $10
Billion market opportunity in the United States alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is commercializing an
innovation in sleep therapy. Approximately half of all American adolescents and
young adults in the United States do not get enough sleep. Cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) for insomnia has been somewhat effective when administered by a
therapist in person, but the in-person model is not scalable. Lack of sleep can
negatively impact physical and neurocognitive development, leading to inability
to concentrate, poor grades, higher risk of diabetes and long-term
cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of mental health issues, depression,
and suicide. The proposed solution applies recent sleep research and innovates
it into a product worn at night and plans to go to market with an integrated
solution of both the product hardware and telehealth support. Healthier sleep
brought by this solution may lead to better recovery, improved memories and
concentration, and enhanced neurocognitive and physical development. It may also
reduce the risks for depression and other mental health issues. The enhanced
physical and mental health may have other positive impacts in society, for
example, reducing healthcare costs and preventing accidents caused by sleep
deprivation. Short light pulses may alter circadian phases of human subjects
during sleep. Based on light flash technology, the team proposes creating a
smart sleep mask that emits light flashes at night during sleep to effectively
advance teenagersâ€™ circadian phases without disrupting their daytime activities.
This light flash technology will be assisted with cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) delivered via a mobile application to promote earlier bedtime and better
sleep hygiene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
