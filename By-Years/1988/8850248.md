Twenty 9th grade students will be recruited from the midwest for the University
of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (WWM)/Milwaukee Public Museum Young Scholars Program.
They will participate in a six-week summer program made up of one-on-one
laboratory training and project development; classes in scientific ethics,
problem solving, and career exploration; orientation and participation in museum
science; and field trips to industrial, medical, and university laboratories and
research sites. Follow-up activities during the school year and subsequent
summer are also part of the project. Key components of the UWM Young Scholars
Program are: (1) the joint participation of the Milwaukee City Museum in
presenting this program; (2) the commitment of ten key research faculty from UWM
and five from the Museum to participate as faculty mentors in the Young Scholars
Program; and (3) the availability of continuing research activities for the
young scholars in subsequent summers through the university's high school
apprenticeship programs and local industrial internships.
