This experimental research program focuses on experiments k in Feshbach
resonances, multiple-condensate systems, and vortex states. The program will use
experiments to vary the strength of the atomic interactions in a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) of Rb-87, with an attention to the physics of component
separation in binary BECs and vortex states in the noninteracting limit of
single-component BECs. The work will contribute directly to the understanding of
vortices and superfluidity in dilute Bose gases. The broader impact of this work
falls primarily within the relationship of cutting-edge experimental BEC
research to undergraduate education. Undergraduate researchers easily use the
operating BEC apparatus. Indeed, the apparatus exists exclusively for their use,
with no competition from graduate students. At the same time, the laboratory
hosts visits by undergraduate classes from colleges throughout the region,
developing and expanding the interest in the exciting fields of atom trapping
and cooling and Bose-Einstein condensation.
