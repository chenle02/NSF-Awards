Governor Mike DeWine allocated $12.1M through the Governors Emergency Education
Relief (GEER) program to upgrade OARnet's last-mile internet connections to 40
smaller higher education institutions (HEI) through a unique opportunity. This
funding is a result of growing reliance on cyberinfrastructure to support in-
person and remote teaching and research. For smaller institutions, having access
to additional advanced CI enriches existing programs while enabling new
opportunities for research and training that rely on external, shared, and co-
developed resources. To foster full use of new connectivity resources, OARnet
and a team from nine smaller HEIs (Northwest State Community College, Chatfield
College, Lorain County Community College, Terra State Community College,
Franciscan University of Steubenville, Sinclair Community College, Columbus
State Community College, Xavier University, Baldwin Wallace University), service
providers (OSC and the CWRU Electron Microscopy Facility) supported by national
entities (EPOC, The Quilt, InCommon/Internet2, Trusted CI), are planning two CC*
proposals - 1. "Regional Connectivity for Small Institutions of Higher
Education" track and 2. "CI-Research Alignment" track. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
regional proposal will develop statewide research and teaching DMZ and VPN
networks and a federated identity management system for secure access to shared
network-accessible resources in classrooms and labs. The CI-Research Alignment
proposal will provide human infrastructure and processes needed to co-develop
shared educational resources and curricula, such as interactive laboratory
simulations and other virtual environments for STEM training that will also
enhance the high school to higher education STEM pipeline (College Credit Plus
Program.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
