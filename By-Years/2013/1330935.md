The innovation proposed in this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
project will harness the popularity and ubiquity of mobile microgames on hand-
held devices for educating children on self-management of chronic health
conditions. Millions of children suffer from chronic conditions which require
regular management, such as diabetes, or from broader states of poor health
caused by obesity. Children are less likely to adhere to proper medication and
behaviors to manage their condition, and thus are more likely to be
hospitalized, or to suffer from long-term morbidity in the future. This project
aims to build engaging, interactive microgames that train children to monitor
and manage their chronic conditions. This project will create microgames for
type I diabetes and obesity. A large-scale evaluation of the diabetes microgame
tool will be evaluated for efficacy in user knowledge and attitudes. The project
should result in an effective game that improves children's understanding of
their condition and adherence to healthy behaviors.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project includes improving the
health of children with chronic health conditions, particularly those suffering
from type I diabetes or obesity. It will improve their knowledge on self-
management behaviors such as monitoring blood glucose levels, avoiding high-
sugar foods, and maintaining physical fitness. The aim is that these children
will stay healthier and avoid further complications in the future. These
microgames can be designed for numerous chronic conditions that require active,
frequent management, and can be built for a variety of hand-held devices,
including mobile phones and digital music players, which allows for wide-spread
adoption and use among today's technologically-adept youth.
