This award provides funds to update the molecular biology instructional program
at the University of Southern Mississippi by establishing an intensive "hands-
on" laboratory in molecular biology/biotechnology. The laboratory in molecular
biology will give the students practical experience in the fundamental
techniques that form the foundation of experimental molecular biology. The major
instruments to be obtained include growth chambers, electrophoresis equipment,
UV spectrometers and low temperature storage units. The grantee is matching this
award with non-Federal sources.
