The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics(SIAM) will present the
Eleventh Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing. This series
of conferences has played a key role in promoting parallel scientific computing
and parallel numerical algorithms. The conference is distinguished by its
emphasis on the information technology aspects of scientific computing on
parallel machines and provides a forum for communication among the scientific
computing, information technology, and computational science and engineering
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bulk of this grant will support small
travel grants to student and junior researchers. The grant will also support
travel grants and small monetary awards to winners in a student paper
competition and a poster competition. All award decisions will be made by the
conference organizing committee (the PI is a Co-chair). SIAM will advertise and
coordinate these activities and if this proposal is funded, NSF support will be
clearly acknowledged at the conference and its web-site and related
publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
