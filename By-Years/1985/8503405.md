Drilling is a unit operation of great importance in industry. As an example, the
cost of drilling may amount to as much as one percent of the cost of an
airplane. Drilling is not, however, a well-understood operation. Tool
geometries, feed rates, and rotational speeds are selected on the basis of
experience and trial runs. Extensive drilling of new engineering materials
requires extensive experimentation, and much grinding of drills having different
shapes. Simulation, by computer graphics, will be used to investigate various
aspects of the drill's cutting action. Models developed in earlier research will
be utilized and a variety of tool designs (point, flute, and helix angle
geometries) will be studied. The computer simulations will be validated by
experiment.
