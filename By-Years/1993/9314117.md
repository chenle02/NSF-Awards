This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Catalano's Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. A new class of tri- and tetrametallic
complexes will be synthesized containing a multiple Group VI metal-metal bonded
core bridged along the metal-metal axis by a bidentate ligand to one or more
square planar transition metal complexes. The goals of the research are to
explore the bonding interactions between the square planar metal and the
multiply bonded core and to probe the chemical and photochemical reactivity of
these assemblies. The research will employ standard inorganic synthetic
techniques using known precursors and the resulting products will be
characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR, absorbtion
and emission spectroscopies and IR and Raman spectroscopy. %%% This research
will lead to a fundamental understanding of the multiple metal-metal bond and
its role in inorganic chemistry, photochemistry and catalysis.
