The CCCP (Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Cornell, and Princeton) Mathematical
Finance Workshop will take place on November 30 and December 1, 2007 at
Princeton University. It has been held annually by the participating
universities since 2004. In just three years, it has become a cornerstone of the
mathematical finance community, providing a platform for the dissemination of
cutting-edge research in the field. It brings together participants from
different levels to discuss their work openly in a small-sized informal forum.
In particular, it gives graduate students an opportunity to expose themselves to
the most recent trends in their areas presented by distinguished leaders in the
field, to engage in high-level open discussions on these topics, and to present
their own research. This provides an ideal setting for the exchange of ideas,
the initiation of new projects and scientific collaboration. Usually,
researchers from each of the four participating universities plus one or two
guest speakers present their work in a half hour talk. The CCCP Workshop is an
open meeting sponsored by the university hosting the event that year. It will be
advertised through the four universities' departmental websites, suitable
mathematical bulletins, and electronic mailing lists available from past
meetings and departmental lists.
