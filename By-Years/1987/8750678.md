A modern differential scanning calorimeter is being used by upper level
chemistry students at Westminster College to study the thermochemical properties
of a variety of materials. The wide range of samples studied include polymers,
liquid crystals, metal alloys, and the products from students' own organic and
inorganic synthesis projects. Students (forty per cent of whom are women) are
gaining hands-on experience with this common testing method while investigating
the physical nature of phase changes in condensed matter. Each student uses the
equipment in at least six different projects, thus gaining a very thorough
knowledge of the operation and applications of this important technique.
Publication of the laboratory projects will extend the impact of these
activities beyond the college.
