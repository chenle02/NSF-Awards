ABSTRACT DMS - 0204326.

M. Gross plans to study the geometry of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau
manifolds. This will be done from the perspective of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow
conjecture and algebro-geometric analogues of this conjecture currently being
developed by M. Gross and B. Siebert. These ideas will be pursued with a goal of
finding a general mirror symmetry construction, associating to any polarized
maximally unipotent degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds a mirror family of
polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. Implications of these ideas to understanding the
behaviour of Ricci-flat metrics near maximally unipotent degenerations and the
counting of rational curves using the notion of log Gromov-Witten invariants
will also be pursued.

The work proposed by M. Gross lies at the intersection of string theory and
geometry. String theory replaces the traditional notion of the point particle
with a small loop of string, moving through space-time. To make string theory
compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be ten-dimensional. Since
space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects six of these dimensions to be a
very small `curled up' geometric object. These geometric objects are called
Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a remarkable
association between completely different Calabi-Yau manifolds: certain
calculations extremely difficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold could be
completed by performing completely different, and much easier, calculations on a
different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror symmetry.
Since this time, many geometers have been trying to understand the mathematics
behind this miraculous observation. The work of M. Gross hopes to give
mathematical insight and explanation for the phenomenon of mirror symmetry.
