9424603 Sturges This project will extend the ability of automated machines in
assembly of three dimensional components using what is termed a spatial remote
center compliance (SRCC) device. This passive device, like its two dimensional
counterpart, the remote center compliance, does not require active feedback
control for these tasks. The engineering problem and objectives are to design
and build SRCC's that can handle non-axisymmetric prismatic parts of arbitrary
cross section and general shapes with a segmented insertion path. In handling
these problems, the basis for analysis is identification of the contacts in
three dimensions, i.e., point, line or surface. The kinematics of these contacts
can be used to determine the dexterity requirements, leading to a design that
can handle the proposed three dimensional assembly tasks. Assembly remains a
costly, error prone, and ubiquitous process, and automatic systems using active
feedback control can be slow and costly. Results from this project will provide
a robust and cost effective solution to these important quality and productivity
problems. ***
