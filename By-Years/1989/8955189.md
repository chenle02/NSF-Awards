In August of 1990, 17 high school physics teachers will have the opportunity to
participate in an Optical Science workshop at San Jose State University (SJSU).
The two week workshop will use the He-Ne Laser as a tool to study optics and
applications of a Laser. Activities include fifteen basic exercises covering
geometrical optics, beam manipulation, beam modulation, fiber optics,
interference, diffraction, and holography. The teachers will literally take away
from the workshops all the equipment and skills they need to start teaching
these concepts the following day| The necessary electro-optical devices and
equipment are provided by SJSU and corporate partners. Prior to the August
workshops, a sub-set of five teachers and the PI, joined by a visiting scholar
from the UK, will set up the workshop laboratory and establish, with the
educational consultant, basic lesson plans. In addition a menu of research
(interesting phenomena) topics will be generated. Follow-up activities include
establishing and supporting seventeen photonic stations at seventeen different
high schools in the area surrounding San Jose State University through the
1990-91 academic year. Each station will have a laser, oscilloscope, digital
voltmeter, and an assortment of inexpensive devices sufficient for all fifteen
prescribed exercises. These stations will use the cost shared equipment.
Teachers use of this equipment will be supported on a daily basis through an
electronic bulletin board. Data and ideas will be shared via a Newsletter. Cost
sharing from SJSU in an amount of $27,570 equals 40% of the NSF award. In
addition, there are corporate and professional association equipment and money
cost sharing contributions.
