The genus Tetrahymena is an important group of ciliate protozoans, possibly
descended with little modification from the earliest eukaryotic organisms.
Species of this genus are commonly used laboratory organisms. Dr. Clifford Brunk
proposes to obtain the DNA sequences of the actin gene in 7 to 10 species of the
genus, and to use these sequence data to reconstruct their ancestor-descendant
relationships. This evolutionary framework will form the foundation for future
studies of other gene sequences in these species. Rates of evolution in
different genes can then be compared, leading to a better understanding of the
mechanisms of molecular evolution. The sequences obtained can also be compared
with those of other early eukaryotes to reveal their evolutionary relationships.
The proposed research has implications beyond the narrow field of ciliate
systematics. The research will illuminate the pattern of evolution in this early
group, and will lead to a clearer picture of the radiation of eukaryotes. This
project will lead to a better understanding of how genes replicate and evolve
within a single lineage over long periods of time.
