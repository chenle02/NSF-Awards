In this project in the Theoretical and Computational program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor DePristo will develop and apply new methods for the study of
the behavior of solids and the interactions of gases with solid surfaces. The PI
will continue his development of the corrected effective medium method. These
new developments will include (1) construction of a new kinetic energy
functional of the electron density and its gradient and (2) determination of
embedding energies for atom-jellium systems. Applications will focus on
providing new information about the surface energy for metal overlayers on metal
substrates, the dynamics of metal atom collisions with metal substrates, surface
structure and segregation in mixed metals, and energy transfer and scattering
involving large gas molecules and solid surfaces.
