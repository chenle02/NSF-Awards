Quantum information science has emerged as a revolutionary new paradigm in
information technology whose impact could span all society. Successful physical
implementation of devices capable of storing and manipulation information stored
in quantum systems could lead to exponentially more powerful computers and
absolutely secure cryptography. The work to be performed under this award will
merge two complementary technologies at the forefront of quantum information
science: trapped atomic ions and cavity-QED. Individual trapped ions are
unmatched in their performance as quantum memories, and single photons are the
only realistic carrier of quantum information between remote locations. A
scalable trapped ion + cavity system capable of storing, manipulating, and
transmitting quantum information over large distances will be developed. The
significant technical hurdles challenging the objectives of this work will be
systematically studied, and the state-of-the-art in critical underlying
technologies will be advanced through a close collaboration with key industrial
companies and fabrication facilities. A theoretical component will explore
coupling strategies between atomic and photonic qubits, while supporting the
experimental program with realistic models of actual devices.
