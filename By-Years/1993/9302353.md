9302353 Seraphin This project is concerned with the investigation of micron-long
graphite fibers called nanotubes. These nanotubes exhibit a different shape
compared to the initially observed spherical fullerenes such as C60. The
objectives of this project are to study: 1) the correlation between morphology
and yield of nanotubes and processing parameters by means of transmission
electron microscopy; 2) the growth mechanism of the nanotubes with the aim to
control the intricate balance of carbon hexagons and pentagons in the
cylindrical geometry of the tubes and end pieces, and to tailor nanotubes of
desired length-to-diameter ratio; and 3) stability and structural
transformations of nanotubes under the electron beam and in-situ upon heating
and cooling. This research will lay the foundations for the nanoscale
engineering of the tubular carbon clusters. The project has technological
importance with respect to the novel mechanical and electrical properties
expected in properly designed nanotube-based materials. ***
