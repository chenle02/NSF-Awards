This project involves a program of stable isotope studies, faunal studies and
AMS 14C dating of high deposition rate sediment cores from an area of the Nova
Scotian continental margin where there is little evidence for slump and
turbidite activity. It will be the first high-resolution climate proxy records
for the last 15,000 yrs from a vast region in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.
Preliminary delta 18O results on planktonic foraminifera from three piston cores
spanning 4000 m of water depth reveal distinctive features which allow
correlation among the cores. These features, which are not yet 14C dated,
probably reflect discharge events of glacial meltwater to the Gulf of St.
Lawrence and to the Labrador Sea. The project will develop the climate history
of ice sheet decay and surface ocean change based on faunal and stable isotopic
studies, and will test hypotheses about the origin and the Younger Dryas cooling
and other abrupt events. Records of nutrient proxies will be recovered form
benthic foraminifera to test the response of deep ocean circulation to surface
ocean temperature and salinity changes. This research is important because it
seeks to improve knowledge of the processes responsible for rapid climate
changes.
