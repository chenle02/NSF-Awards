9423846 Edwards The relationship between the brain and behavior is a dynamic
two-way interaction. Biologists would like to understand both how the brain
generates behaviors, and also how behavioral contexts produce effects on the
brain. It is well-known that social behaviors produce effects on the brain (and
therefore other behaviors), but the mechanisms for such interactions is largely
unknown. In this grant Dr. Edwards and his colleagues will examine how the
dominance status of animals impacts the chemistry of the nervous system and the
subsequent expression of well-defined behaviors such as escape. The brain
chemical serotonin can modify escape behavior. Dr. Edwards group has evidence
that serotonin's effects on brain cells mediating escape vary in fundamentally
different ways in dominant animals versus subordinate animals. The mechanisms
for serotonin's differential effects will be analyzed at the level of identified
cells and specific subtypes of the serotonin receptor. This work will provide
new inqights into the pathways by which social behavior and brain function
interact. ***
