This award will enable the PI and his collegues to complete several remaining
tasks in their continuing study of the geochemistry of island-arc processes. By
using isotopic, trace element and U-series nuclides they have documented
relavent processes - assimilation, fractional crystallization, etc., - at
Paricutin volcano in Mexico, the Tabar-Feni islands in the Western Pacific, the
Carpathians, and in the Aegean arc. During the remaining two years they will
concentrate on finishing the Carpathian and Aegean projects. A small effort will
be devoted to further analyses of trace elements in mantle lherzolites, and the
writing up of the Paricutin and Tabar-Feni work will be completed.
