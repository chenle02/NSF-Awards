A second quantum revolution in and around the construction of a useful quantum
computer has been advancing dramatically in the last few years. Topological
phases of matter, the importance of which has been recognized by scientific
awards that include the 2016 Nobel prize in physics, exhibit many-body quantum
entanglement. This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum
computer. Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the
second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of
matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains
under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations
will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum
revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical
foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual
theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that
the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a
topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will
fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The
project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates
in the interdisciplinary research.

The goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful
quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum
computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons.
A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical
quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local,
yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of
topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and
understanding their computational power. This research addresses the
mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum
computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories,
vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular
categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories,
topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and
universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts
ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of
useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular
categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a
structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter.
