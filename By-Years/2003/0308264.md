Rare events occur very infrequently and are thus very difficult to detect.
However, when they do occur, their consequences can be quite dramatic quite
often in a negative sense. Examples include network intrusions and security
breaches, cardiac events, credit card and other types of financial fraud,
telecom circuit overloads, and traffic accidents. Timely and accurate detection
of rare events is critical. Recent years have seen an explosive growth in the
speed of data collection and storage devices. Most organizations collect
quantities of data about various processes in their computer systems, at various
levels of abstraction, including hardware, operating and communication systems,
database query logs, etc. These comprehensive event logs provide a wealth of
data, analysis of which has the potential to identify the rare events described
earlier. The project includes investigation of the issues in rare class
analysis, and development of a suite of techniques to address them. The focus of
this project is on supervised learning methods for rare class analysis. Specific
tasks include development of novel feature selection schemes and robust
predictive models especially suited for rare class problems, and adapting rare
class learning algorithms to data streams. The research results will be made
publicly available at the project website
(http://www.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/rare.html). The techniques developed, as part of
this research will be applicable across a wide spectrum of applications in which
one is interested in finding those few, unusual, special cases which are highly
significant and of potentially very high value.
