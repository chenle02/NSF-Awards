This award supports a conference entitled: "IMS Second International Symposium
on Probability and Its Applications". The conference will be held from 18 to 21
March 1993, in Bloomington, Indiana. The purpose of this Symposium is to focus
special attention on some of the more prominent directions in probability and
its applications. The symposium's objectives include: 1. Encouraging and
facilitating effective communication among probability researchers through-out a
large interdisciplinary community; 2. Presenting recent research developments
and facilitating prioritization of future directions; 3. Apprising non-
specialists, young researchers and graduate students of the most active areas in
probability research.
