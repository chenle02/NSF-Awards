In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Neumark will study the photodissociation spectroscopy of free
radicals, coordinatively unsaturated organometallic radicals, and neutral
cluster species in order to obtain information on bond energies and on the
photodissociation dynamics. For each system the dissociative electronic states
will be mapped out by measuring the photodissociation cross section as a
function of frequency. This will be followed by photodissociation dynamics
experiments in which the photofragment energy and angular distributions are
measured and the bond dissociation energies are determined. %%% Free radicals
play a vital role in chemistry as primary reactants and reactive intermediates.
These experiments will look at the different spectroscopy and dynamics between
molecules with open shell electronic structures and those with closed shells.
Such information bears directly on the chemical reactivity of free radicals.
