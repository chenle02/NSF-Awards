This award will support collaborative research in intelligent instrumentation
between Dr. Janos Sztipanovits and Dr. Benoit Dawant, Center for Intelligent
Systems, Vanderbilt University, and Dr. E. R. Carson, Center for Measurement and
Information in Medicine, City University, London, England. The objective of this
collaboration is to provide opportunities for the researchers at both
institutions to combine their ideas and experience to advance the state-of-the-
art in intelligent instrumentation in general, and more specifically, to develop
a new generation of patient monitoring systems to be used in critical care
medicine. One of the main research targets in the Vanderbilt University
Department of Electrical Engineering has been the development of generic
intelligent real-time and artificial intelligence techniques to improve the
flexibility of the instruments. The City University has a long research history
in the area of medical instrumentation, and is interested in applying new
technologies to the problem of critical care monitoring. This collaborative
effort will combine the complementary expertise of the two groups. Multigraph
Architecture will provide the framework for the overall design and
implementation of this project. The main aspects of the proposed collaboration
will be the transfer of the technology developed at Vanderbilt University, the
capture and the representa- tion in terms of knowledge-bases of the medical
expertise available at City University, and the implementation and evaluation of
a system prototype. The initial transfer of technology will be done by means of
scientific reports, selected publications, and exchange of software. City
University will then serve as an experimental background for testing the
proposed approach. Results of this test will be reported to Vanderbilt
University and serve as a driving force for modifications and improvement to the
overall architecture.
