9318847 Gildea ABSTRACT The Cariban languages spoken in northern Brazil are
among the least documented in the world, and many are in danger of extinction.
This project will collect documentary recordings of as many northern Brazilian
Cariban languages as possible and begin the process of transcribing word lists
and grammatical information from these recordings. The project will also provide
support for the Brazilian Cariban linguistics students to do intensive field
work in three different northern Brazilian Cariban language communities. The
linguists will use traditional field techniques, including recording,
transcribing, and translating word lists and tests; syntactic analysis will be
via elicitation and analysis of transcribed texts. For these three languages,
the project will produce analyses of phonology, morphology, basic syntax, and
papers on theoretically or typologically relevant issues. With these new data,
the principal investigator will work towards a more reliable classification of
the Cariban family and reconstruction of Proto Cariban lexicon and morphosyntax.
This project is a collaborative effort, designed to help train new Brazilian
linguists in basic linguistic description and historical/typological/functional
approaches to linguistics. It will also be responsive to the needs of Cariban
language communities, offering help in preserving their unique languages and
cultures.
