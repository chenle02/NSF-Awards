At a time when scientific breakthroughs often rely on interdisciplinary
crossfertilization a team of scientists and musicians will introduce our
students to the advantages of approaches that cross disciplines and departmental
lines. It is in this spirit that we propose the development of a bioacoustics
laboratory and a bioacoustics course. The bioacoustics laboratory will be a
multiuser facility based on a Kay DSP SonaGraph 5000, a Racal Store 4DS
instrumentation recorder, and five Macintosh workstations with Macrecorder
software. The bioacoustic laboratory will be made available to students taking
courses in animal behavior, ecology, behavioral ecology, avian biology, insect
biology, general physics, orchestration and a new interdisciplinary course
entitled bioacoustics. Bioacoustics will combine the teaching effort of a
physicist, a biologist, and a musician. The course is designed to use the
intrinsic appeal of music and the sounds of nature to lure students into a
serious and quantitative study of sound and communication theory.
