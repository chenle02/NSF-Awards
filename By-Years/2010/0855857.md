Travel support is requested for about twenty U.S.~participants (recent Ph.D.s,
women, and members of underrepresented minority groups) to attend the 33rd
Conference on Stochastic Processes and Their Applications, to be held in Berlin
from 27th to 31st of July, 2009.

The annual ``Stochastic Processes and Their Applications'' meeting is one of the
main international forum for researchers studying applied and theoretical
problems in the field of stochastic processes. An important part of the
intellectual development of researchers at the begining of their carreer is to
attend international conferences where they have an opportunity to interacts
with people working in a wide range of topics. The 33rd Conference on Stochastic
Processes and Their Applications will feature twenty Plenary Lectures and over
twenty five different Special Sessions covering many aspects of aplied and
theoretical probability.
