9506327 Pilz The transcription factor NF-E2 (a complex of two proteins, p45 and
p18) binds to specific DNA sequences in the regulatory regions of erythroid
genes and appears to be necessary for the transcriptional activation of these
genes during red blood cell maturation. The PI has recently found that murine
erythroleukemia cells (MEL), a model system of red blood cells, that are
deficient in cAMP dependent protein kinase (A kinase), an enzyme involved in
signal transduction, are severely impaired in their ability to mature and
activate erythroid genes. The also have abnormal binding of NF-E2. Preliminary
experiments suggested that A-kinase regulates NF-E2 by phosphorylating p45 and
by regulating the complex formation of p45 and p18. The experiments in this
grant will test examine this further. The phosphorylation of p45 by A kinase
will be studied by determining which amino acids are phosphorylated, to see if
this phosphorylation occurs during red blood cell maturation, and determibne if
this phosphorylation of p45 changes its its complex formation with p18 and
alters the ability of NF-E2 to activate erythroid genes. The next series of
experiments will examine proteins which interact with NF-E2 and see if these
interactions alter its function. %%% The results of this research will increase
our knowledge of the regulation of NF-E2 function and define the role of A-
kinase during red blood cell maturation. They will also provide information on
the general functions of this enzyme in signal transduction. ***
