This project continues and extends upon past studies investigating NOx (reactive
nitrogen oxides: the sum of nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2)
formation in thunderstorms, using a combination of in situ observations and
numerical storm simulations to gain a better estimate of nitrogen oxides
production by lightning and subsequent transport throughout the thundercloud.
The work will result in a better understanding of how reactive oxidized nitrogen
is distributed within thunderstorms as it is generated by lightning and affected
by subsequent chemical reactions. The project involves modeling and field
measurements, explicit cloud-scale modeling to account for several critical
processes of the in-cloud lightning discharge constrained by aircraft
measurements of meteorological parameters and NO within the electrically active
convective cloud cell. Broader impacts of this research include model
developments that will improve performance in terms of robustness and
representativeness for cloud-scale models used to simulate and quantify the
effect of large electrically-active convective storms on the production and
redistribution of photochemically active oxidants, with particular emphasis on
further constraining the highly uncertain global NOx budget - an important
consideration with regard to global climate. The project includes graduate
student research training and results from the study will be used in teaching.
