This grant will enable students to attend the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW
2019) which will be co-located with the International Conference on Logic in
Computer Science (LICS) to be held in July in Vancouver, British Columbia. LICS
is the flagship conference in logic and semantics. LMW seeks to introduce and
mentor students who have already shown interest in logic and semantics research
by bringing them to LICS so they can learn about current research problems, make
connections with their contemporaries, and interact with leaders in the field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity
to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that
both conferences foster. The LMW workshop will focus on mentoring and career
advice to enable undergraduate and graduate students, and especially women, and
underrepresented minorities to pursue and thrive in research careers both in
logic/semantics specifically and in computer science generally. This travel
grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based
and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important
component of graduate school education for our society's future computer science
researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with
world-class researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring
relationships that will serve them well during their research
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
