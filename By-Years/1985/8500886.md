Active and passive remote sensing techniques have been found useful in
investigating surface conditions such as ice, snow, vegetation, and soil
moisture. This research effort expands this activity to the use of microwave
remote sensing for characterization of geophysical media. Theoretical models
that account for absorption, layering, and scattering will be developed to
facilitate interpretation of active and passive remote sensing data. These
models will then be used and compared to the results of controlled laboratory
experiments.
