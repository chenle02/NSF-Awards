The Ohio State University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support at least 7 students for the summer of 1987, of which
almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will
include the following: o Metal Ion Catalysis o Reactions of Metal Cabonyls with
Spirocyclic Isodicyclopontadiene Systems o Metal Cluster Chemistry o Studies on
Microbial Forms of Dextransucrase
