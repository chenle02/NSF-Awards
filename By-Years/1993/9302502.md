The PIs propose to develop a real-time interactive laboratory permitting
undergraduate and graduate students in Alaska to conduct and participate in
real-time experiments at the NSF Sondrestrom Radar Observatory. An example of
this proposal's objective is the ability in real-time to modify the radar mode
to take advantage of certain geophysical conditions such as an auroral riometer
absorption, or PCA event. The potential advantage of interfacing the Sondrestrom
data stream to the NCSA standards would be to enhance the data display and
analysis capabilities of students and provide a bridge to supercomputer models.
