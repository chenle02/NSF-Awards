9223788 Walpole Supporting Predictable Latency and Throughput in Large Storage
Systems This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. This
research is concerned with the design of storage systems that can hide the
latency associated with accessing high-capacity distributed storage and hence
support guaranteed latency and throughput. The main objectives of the project
are to (1) define new storage system interfaces that allow quality-of-service
and synchronization requirements to be passed to the storage system; (2) define
a storage system architecture that can use this information to hide storage
access latency; and (3) implement a prototype latency-hiding storage system. The
principle method underlying the latency-hiding storage system is prefetching,
which is based on information gathered from applications through the storage
system interfaces described above. A storage system with these characteristics
will significantly reduce the burden on programmers of multimedia applications,
particularly those based on stored audio and video, and will help to facilitate
the development of multimedia computing in large-scale systems. ***
