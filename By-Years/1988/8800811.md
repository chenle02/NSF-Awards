A conference/workshop on microinjection techniques and their potential use in
the biological sciences will be held May 20.22, 1988 at the Marine Biological
Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Leading investigators, using the
technique, will lecture and conduct demonstrations as well. Hands.on.experience
will be emphasized with equipment supplied by various manufacturers.
Approximately 50 applicants will be selected by an admission committee from both
plant and animal sciences, to take part in the conference/workshop. This
endeavor should be of immense value to young investigators in biology,
especially to those in areas of plant sciences.
