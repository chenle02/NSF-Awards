0100758&lt;br/&gt;Deering&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Delaware
provides instrumentation to update and expand the oceanographic research
capabilities of the research vessel Cape Henlopen, a ship operated by the
University's College of Marine Studies as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The CTD and vehicle
spare parts supported here will both be used with a towed undulating vehicle for
3-dimensional characterization of physical, chemical and biological properties
of the water column. These improvements will be of substantial advantage to
marine scientists using the ship in their research during 2001 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
