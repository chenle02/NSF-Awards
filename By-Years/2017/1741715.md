The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) proposes to hold a Workshop at
SC'17 in Denver, CO, that will provide a balanced picture of key HPC R&D in
Japan, China, India, and other Asian countries. It is not easy way for US
experts to fully understand what is occurring in Asian countries. This is
specifically true for younger US researchers who are not familiar with where to
access the best research in Asian countries. Broader impacts will include
potential US collaborative efforts in HPC research. More importantly, it enables
US researchers to keep abreast of developments in Asia and to incorporate the
best ideas in their research in the US. It will also enable funding agencies in
the US to keep abreast of the priorities of funding agencies in HPC. The
Workshop will include presentations, posters, and discussions by Asian
researchers from universities, government institutes, and industry in sessions
addressing systems, centers, and government plans, progress in components,
system software, and applications, and human resource and eco-system
development. This balanced program will enable the US research community to gain
a more holistic understanding of the current situation and better evaluate
potential opportunities for collaboration. As part of this proposal, ATIP will
support at least eight young US researchers identified as having a high
potential for research interests that overlap with their Asian counterparts and
who would normally be unable to attend SC. Members of the international research
community have agreed to support attendance by similar students from Asian
countries who are anxious to share their ideas and engage in collaborative work.
The key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for
members of the US and international HPC research community to interact and have
direct discussions with the top Asian scientists and leading graduate students.
