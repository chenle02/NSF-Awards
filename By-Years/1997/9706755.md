DMS-9706755 Harrell This is the block travel grant for the 1997 Congress of the
International Association of Mathematical Physics and for development of new
scientific collaboration in the Asian-Pacific Region The XII-th International
Conference on Mathematical Physics is to be held in Brisbane, Australia in July,
1997. This is organized by the International Association of Mathematical
Physics. The project supports participation of 25 U.S. scientists and
mathematicians. It is also a vehicle to initiate new scientific contacts in the
Asian-Pacific Region. The competition for these funds is national. The criteria
for selection is scientific excellence and an indication that the applicant's
future research and professional growth will benefit from participation in the
conference and further contacts in the Asian-Pacific region. Preference is given
to recent Ph.D.'s and outstanding graduate students. The organizers are
organizing contacts with established researchers who are willing to act as hosts
and organize new contacts. This international encounter covers the full spectrum
of recent developments of mathematical physics, from the dynamics of classical
systems to relativity and quantum field theory. It includes new mathematical
techniques as well as the analysis of increasingly complex physical systems.
