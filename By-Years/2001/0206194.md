AST 0206194 (RUI)&lt;br/&gt;Denn, G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGNs) are the most energetic regions of the universe and are associated with
supermassive black holes. As tidal forces disrupt neighboring stars and clouds
in these galaxies, some of this material, through currently
unexplained&lt;br/&gt;magnetic collimation effects, is directed into two bipolar
relativistic jets. This project will increase our understanding of the kinematic
and magnetic field structure of these jets. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
will be used to create total intensity, polarized intensity, fractional
polarization, spectral index, and rotation measure maps from data for four
sources at a number of epochs. An attempt will be made to obtain qualitative
circular polarization maps, a new aspect of parsec-scale imaging of AGN. These
images will be used to model and determine physical quantities (e.g., shock
compression in planar shocks associated with BL Lac objects.) The research will
be performed at Sweet Briar College, an undergraduate women's college in central
Virginia, and will involve a total of four students over two summers.&lt;br/&gt;
