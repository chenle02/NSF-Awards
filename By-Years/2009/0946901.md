Abstract With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Robert
Hamers, Clark R. Landis and Shannan S. Stahl of the University of Wisconsin
Department of Chemistry will acquire equipment to study solution-phase chemical
reactions and catalytic processes performed at high pressures (50-3000 psig).
The equipment includes reactors which allow monitoring reaction kinetics by
infrared spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance suitable for screening of
reactions at high pressure. The equipment will be used to investigate at high
pressures reactions with air-sensitive reagents or under anaerobic conditions
including catalytic hydroformylation, polymerization and carbonylation
reactions, and the study of oxidative reactions, high temperature chemistry and
nitrous oxide chemistry.

High-pressure reactions have widespread significance in the chemical and
pharmaceutical industries and include some of the most important large scale
chemical processes: aerobic oxidation, hydrogenation and alkene polymerization.
New reactions of this type and fundamental insights into existing reactions are
critical to advance the field; however, such studies are complicated by the need
to use specialized equipment that ensures safety. The equipment requested in
this proposal will enable the discovery and mechanistic investigation of a wide
range of chemical reactions under high-pressure. Students will be trained in the
proper use of this equipment in their research and in course work improving
their preparation for jobs in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries
