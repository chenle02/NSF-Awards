Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The investigators
will conduct a planning activity for a corpus supporting research on authorship
attribution. Planning activities include surveying existing resources and
determining what practitioners need; assessing the costs of obtaining, cleaning,
annotating, distributing and maintaining a test corpus, conducting a workshop to
assess the plans. The workshop builds on the activities of a Working Group that
is already discussing research in this area. Applications of reliable and valid
authorship attribution include literary scholarship, intelligence, criminal law,
civil law, and computer security.&lt;br/&gt;
