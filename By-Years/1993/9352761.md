9352761 Karlin A hands-on, computer based course in 3-dimensional modeling and
analysis provides background and inspiration for a strong undergraduate research
program. State-of-the-art computer work stations and software provide for: (1)
3-dimensional molecular modeling using both molecular dynamics and quantum
mechanical analyses; (2) analysis of DNA and RNA sequences as well as, proteins;
and, (3) 3-dimensional modeling and rendering of images captured by digital
microscopy. These systems will be integrated into laboratory exercises and
activities which expose students to practical use of the computers and software.
