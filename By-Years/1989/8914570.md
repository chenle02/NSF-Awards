The language ML has received much attention during the past few years among
programming language theorists because of an interesting set of capabilities. A
"Standard ML" language, suitable for implementation, has been defined. An
implementation supporting this language is known as "Standard ML of New Jersey."
The purpose of this project is to further develop the compiler and to assist in
its maintenance and distribution.
