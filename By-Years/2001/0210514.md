This project develops the graduate level education and research program in
information assurance at Polytechnic University by building on an NSF DUE CCLI
project for establishment of an undergraduate laboratory in information systems
security. The principal long term goals of this project are to assist in meeting
the national demand for a cadre of professionals with expertise in information
assurance; to create prototype curricular material in graduate information
assurance education that will serve as a widely adopted national model; and to
establish an information assurance laboratory that becomes a national model for
an experimentation environment providing hands-on experiences in topics related
to information assurance.

Activities include: revising existing graduate level courses in information
assurance to incorporate hands-on practical laboratory based experiences that
supplement the theory and principles currently being taught in the classroom;
developing new graduate level courses that complement the existing courses and
result in a comprehensive curriculum in information assurance; establishing a
laboratory consisting of heterogeneous platforms and multiple interconnected
networks to facilitate hands-on experimentation and project work in issues
related to information assurance; and developing a graduate level certication
program in information assurance that focuses both on principles and practice
needed to build and maintain a secure information systems infrastructure. The
project also includes a detailed evaluation and dissemination plan.
