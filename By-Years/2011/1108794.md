The project focuses on further development of constructive and rigorous
asymptotic analysis of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations that
arise in a number of important physical applications. The applications include
(a) evolution of small disturbances superposed on an oscillatory flow in a
channel or pipe, of interest in transition to turbulence, (b) existence and
stability of self-sustaining states in channel and pipe flows, believed to be
omega-limits in intermediate Reynolds number turbulent flow, (c) nonlinear
stability of steadily translating fingers and bubbles in Hele-Shaw flow for
small nonzero surface tension, of interest in pattern formation, (d) ionization
of Hydrogen atoms in time-periodic dipole fields of arbitrary frequency and
amplitude.

Our understanding of the solutions of equations arising in fluid motion and
quantum mechanics is still very limited. The present project develops much
needed new methods to study these problems. Among the immediate applications
outside mathematics we note for instance that understanding turbulent fluid flow
can lead to a more energy-efficient transportation of fluids through pipes.
Also, better understanding of ionization processes has many applications,
including optimal propagation of very intense laser beams through the
atmosphere. Training of students --supported in the project-- will help maintain
the high quality of research in the United States for the coming generation.
