0406601 Wang The objective of this proposal is to develop novel multi-scale and
multi-physics based computational models for normal and sickle red blood cells
in an aqueous environment. The emphasis will be on developing a general multi-
scale modeling platform that incorporates known mechanical, physical, and
chemical effects for biosystems that can be represented as deformable solid
immersed in fluid. Specifically, Navier-Stokes equations will be coupled with
protein molecular dynamics in incorporating the effects of cell-cell adhesion
and deformability on macroscopic behaviors of immersed solid in aqueous
environment. The results will be used to obtain a better understanding of sickle
cell diseases and their treatments.

The developed models and methods will assist in motivating a new generation of
research ideas for computational biomechanics, in particular the formulation of
new synthetic materials mimicing nature and the further development of various
micromanipulation techniques such as microneedle, micropipet, poker, and optical
tweezer.
