This ten-week REU Site will provide a research opportunity for 9 students in
cultural anthropology. The first five weeks of the program will be spent on
instruction in fundamental cultural anthropology research techniques, and the
second five weeks will be spent conducting individual research projects.
Students will be trained in four major areas of cultural anthropology research:
historical and testimonial case studies, participant observation, qualitative
data analysis on text-interview material, and quantitative analysis of census
and survey data. Students will also be taught the techniques and critical
thinking skills necessary for conducting resource material location, library
research, and the use of the Internet for research purposes.

Throughout the ten weeks, students are exposed to such topics as: writing
research results, stages of research, critical thinking, note-taking during
research, getting published, and presenting at conferences. Students also
participate in an ethics seminar and the UNT McNair Scholars' Friday Seminars.
This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
