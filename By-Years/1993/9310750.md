This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, funds an
investigation into the potential capabilities of an omnidirectional vision
sensor to provide guidance and control information for a mobile robot. The work
will explore several basic questions: (1) can scene interpretation for
navigation and object recognition be carried out efficiently on "raw"
omnidirectional images, or is it necessary to compensate for the distortions
inherent in such images; and (2) how best to use image invariants in
omnidirectional vision to minimize computation in robotic navigation.
Exploratory error studies and experimental validation of the omnidirectional
approach will also be carried out. Ultimately this research is expected to
develop a theoretical foundation for omnidirectional vision control of a mobile
robot.
