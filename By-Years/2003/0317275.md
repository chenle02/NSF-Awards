The project is focused on understanding the phylogeny and evolutionary patterns
of mimicry in the oedionychinid flea beetles. This is a large group of 23
genera, with the phylogenetic relationships not understood. The beetles are
diverse, colorful, and involved in numerous mimicry complexes throughout their
range. The PIs intend to reconstruct the phylogeny of this group using
traditional characters of exoskeleton and male genitalia, as well as internal
features, female genitalia, sensilla, and molecular characters. Because this
group is distributed among three continents in tropical areas, elucidating the
biogeographic patterns will provide a basic framework for understanding the role
mimicry may have played in diversification. Analysis of these data, separately
and combined, will provide powerful tests of hypotheses of relatedness, mimicry,
and the evolution of this ancient assemblage of beetles.
