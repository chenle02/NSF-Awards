9420841 Parpia A Symposium on quantum fluids and solids will be held in Ithaca
on June 12 - 17, 1995, on the campus of Cornell University. Instrumentation for
physics at low temperatures together with the results achieved by the
application of these techniques will be emphasized. Attempts will be made to
integrate the interests of the quantum fluids and solids community with those of
physicists in diverse fields. % % % A symposium on the properties of solids and
liquids at low temperature will be held in Ithaca on June 12 - 17, 1995 on the
campus of Cornell University. The symposium will emphasize the techniques and
technology of low temperature physics together with the results achieved by the
application of these techniques. Scientists with established research programs
in diverse areas such as gravitational antennas, detectors (gravitational,
microwave, infrared), micromechanical devices, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Imaging will be invited. ***
