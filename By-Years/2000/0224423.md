&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CISE RR: Acquisition of a Haptic Device
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, acquiring a PHANTOM haptic
device that can display full force and torque feedback to the user, aims at
supporting two haptic research projects inspired by applications such as virtual
assembly, virtual prototyping, remote collaboration, and teleoperation. The
following projects will benefit from the
instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haptic Rendering of Complex Contact States
and Compliant Motion and &lt;br/&gt;Cooperative Virtual Object Manipulation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The former is concerned with how to simulate and render,
with high fidelity and in real time, the effect felt by a human operator due to
the contacts involving the part he/she holds and other parts during manual
assembly in a virtual environment. The device will enable a human operator to
feel the resulted collision and reaction forces and torques to test the quality
and fidelity of simulation. The latter project is concerned with how to
simulate, again with high fidelity and real time, the cooperative manipulation
process of physical objects in a virtual world via haptic devices. With full
force and torque display from the device, the collaborative parties can obtain
the necessary cues for effective coordination. This project provides the
opportunity for cross-discipline collaboration between the
PIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
