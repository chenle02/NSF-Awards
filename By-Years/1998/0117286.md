ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OPP-0117286&lt;br/&gt;Alessa, UAA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop brings together scientists from the circumpolar North to compare
different approaches to the valuation process for terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems protected as wilderness. Also included are land managers, students,
and local decision-makers. The goals are to assess the state of knowledge of
wilderness valuation; explore the roles of nature tourism, ecological
protection, and human-environment relationships among local and indigenous
societies; compare national, regional, and local policy dimensions of wilderness
resource use allocation; and develop a common framework for analysis of cross-
disciplinary, circumpolar wilderness protection issues. &lt;br/&gt;
