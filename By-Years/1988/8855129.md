The University of Pennsylvania Summer Science Academy is a four week,
residential/commuter program for thirty-five academically talented and promising
ninth- and tenth-grade students from the mid-Atlantic region. Additional
minority students are to be recruited, in large measure, through a network of
teachers and other referral sources arising from existing programs for high
school students conducted by the College of General Studies of the University of
Pennsylvania. The central focus of the Science Academy is a sequence of
biochemistry lab experiments, coordinated with readings and classes. Beginning
with the spectroscopy and oxygen-binding properties of hemoglobin, and the role
of ATP as an energy source, student teams, working under the guidance of
University faculty and high school teachers, progress to independent
investigations. Mathematics classes, readings, and activities explore polyhedra,
fractals, exponential growth and decay, and other manifestations of mathematics
in nature. Students sharpen their computer skills by writing programs to solve
challenging problems, and discuss current issues in computing such as privacy
and computer viruses. Twice-weekly seminars, led by scientists from Penn and
other institutions, introduce students to the world of the working scientist and
to some of the social and philosophical issues in science.
