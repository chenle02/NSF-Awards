Bodenheimer, Peter AST 96-18548 The discovery of extrasolar planets around
solar-type stars, and the observational evidence that many very young stars are
surrounded by proto-stellar disks, indicate that disk and planet formation occur
frequently. The characteristics of planetary systems and the early evolution of
young stellar objects are determined by the formation, evolution, and the
dispersal of the disks that surround forming stars. Drs. Bodenheimer and Lin
will investigate the basic physical processes that determine fundamental aspects
of disk evolution : 1) the formation of protostellar disks, 2) the disk
evolution which sets the stage for protoplanetary formation, and 3) the
depletion of the residual disks. Their calculations will help in identifying the
disk evolutionary timescales and the likely outcome of protoplanet formation.
