Elham Izadi will work on questions resulting from the Hodge conjectures for
abelian varieties and curves related to them. She will use correspondences to
produce concrete families of curves in abelian varieties. For abelian varieties
with actions of imaginary quadratic fields, she develops a concrete approach
using families of curves, deformations and specializations, and Hodge bundles at
the boundaries of linear systems. She will run a research group for students on
elementary questions resulting from this project. In the past, using such
research groups, she has been successful in bringing women to the University of
Georgia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, whose main objects of study are algebraic varieties. These are
classically defined as the sets of simultaneous zeros of polynomials. Abelian
varieties and curves are special algebraic varieties with applications in many
areas of mathematics including number theory and coding theory. Classically they
appear in the work of Abel, Jacobi and Riemann among others, who developed the
theory of modular forms. They make ideal testing grounds for important
conjectures in algebraic geometry such as the Hodge conjectures. These are deep
conjectures with far reaching consequences for the study of algebraic varieties.
They were originally formulated in the form of questions by Hodge, then
reformulated and corrected by others including some of the greatest
mathematicians of this century such as Grothendieck.
