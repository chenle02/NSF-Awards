9730174 Lapp The LASER project disseminates and implements high-quality, NSF-
supported K-8 science curriculum materials in more than 300 school districts.
These districts serve some 1,000,000 K-8 students across the country. To
accomplish this, LASER has formed partnerships with: (1) eight regional sites,
to be located in Alabama, California, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, South Carolina, and Washington. Each site contains a coalition of
institutions that includes academic institutions, corporations, state
departments of education, SIs, and museums, and (2) six publishers. The National
Science Resources Center (NSRC) provides the regional sites with expertise and
materials around building awareness, strategic planning, criteria for materials
selection, professional development, science materials support, assessment, and
administrative and community support.
