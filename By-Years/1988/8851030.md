The Saturday Academy, an adjunct of the Oregon Graduate Center which offers
extra-school courses for motivated pre-college science students, will join with
the Business/Education Compact of Washington County (WA) in three programs. (1)
Community-based science and technology teacher enhancement programs. As with
previously successful student courses, they will be taught by a variety of
professionals at sites throughout the area, ranging from industries to academic
institutions. Classes will be informal, participative, stress currently
important areas of science and technology, and provide material for teachers to
incorporate into their own teaching. (2) An invention-oriented creativity and
design competition for middle school students. Teachers will be trained in
techniques of encouraging creativity through the process of invention.
Businesses will be recruited to sponsor the event and provide technical
personnel to work with students in developing inventions. The inventions will be
displayed and judged at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. (3) Computer
networking to link science teachers in other parts of the state to the Saturday
Academy and to each other. This will be initiated at four existing satellites of
the Academy using existing computer facilities to define how such networking can
best be utilized and provide a model for future expansion. Cost sharing by the
partners will total 108% of the NSF funding.
