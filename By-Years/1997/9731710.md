OCE-9731710 Fernandez The project will analyze high-frequency (HF) radar data
and associated ocean surface phenomena. The objectives are to: 1) document the
seasonal evolution of sub-tidal current; 2) relate observed wind to currents; 3)
measure the vertical current shear and relate to wind; and 4) improve and
characterize HF radar ocean current algorithms.
