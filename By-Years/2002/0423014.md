The PIs have submitted a proposal to organize a workshop in secure knowledge
management. The workshop will explore critical knowledge management security
issues such as secure languages, secure knowledge sharing and secure content
management, privacy and some other important topics. These topics are very
important to fully understand the issue surrounding secure semantic web as well
as securing knowledge management practices. This is one of the first workshops
in this area and will enhance the state-of-the-art.
