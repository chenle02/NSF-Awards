This award provides funds to the Psychology Department of Clark University to
continue an REU-Site project designed to build upon and make more effective a
formal curriculum known as the Research Apprenticeship Program. The training
model features apprenticeship, hands-on teaching for a ten week period where
students learn by actively participating in all phases of a research study
including: problem formulation, data collection and analysis, presentation at a
professional meeting, manuscript preparation, and publication. Eight students,
recruited nationally, will work with one of 19 faculty associates, whose
interests collectively address biological, psychological, and sociocultural
aspects of behavior. Research projects represent the full spectrum of
scholarship in psychology, from neuroanatomy to literary analysis, from work
with animals to studies of peoples in foreign cultures. This award contributes
to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
