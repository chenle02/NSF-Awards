The principal investigator will develop statistical theory and methods for
categorical time series. Categorical time series arise in many scientific and
engineering settings in which the observations can be classified by category
(e.g. on or off) and not necessarily by a numerical scale. The principal
investigator will employ the method of the Walsh-Fourier transform to
investigate these time series. Specifically, the investigator will establish a
broad theoretical basis for the application of Walsh-Fourier representation for
real time stationary processes. Furthermore, he will develop sound methodologies
for the scaling of categorical time series via the Walsh-Fourier transform.
Scaling would allow the quantification of the categories and analysis of the
data based on both time and frequency domain techniques.
