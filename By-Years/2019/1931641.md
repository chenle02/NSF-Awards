Solar geoengineering discussions have largely focused on stratospheric sulfate
aerosols and Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB). However, both of these methods of
solar geoengineering necessarily have limits in terms of their ranges of
achievable climates, their potential side effects, and their uncertainties.
Studying other methods of solar geoengineering is essential for expanding the
options available to society for addressing climate change. Studies of Marine
Sky Brightening (MSB) have the potential to fundamentally alter discourse about
solar geoengineering, as well as open up new avenues of research that have been
heretofore under-studied. This project is focused on
MSB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine Sky Brightening (MSB) is a proposed method of
solar geoengineering whereby sea salt particles are injected into the marine
boundary layer. Like Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB), a related geoengineering
technique, MSB would brighten clouds, increasing albedo and cooling the planet.
However, preliminary modeling studies of MSB have shown that radiative forcing
from direct scattering by the sea salt aerosols can be of a similar magnitude to
radiative forcing from cloud brightening. Moreover, although MSB may be less
efficient than MCB at exerting radiative forcing, it may not be as dependent
upon local meteorological conditions: not all clouds can be brightened, and some
areas that may be desirable to cool don't have clouds. This project includes a
systematic exploration of MSB in a hierarchy of models, including radiative
transfer models to understand optimal particle size for scattering, regional
models and large eddy simulators to understand boundary layer dynamics and local
climate effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
