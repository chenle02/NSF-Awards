This award is a Special Creativity Award for the extension of Dr. Williams'
work on bdellovibrios bacteria in marine environments. This and the original
award to Dr. Williams are awarded via the Foundation's Minority Research
Initiation Program. The investigations focus on the distributions of
bdellovibrios in marine environments and their population dynamics. Interactions
with other estuarine organisms will also continue to be studied.
