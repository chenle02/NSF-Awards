This research, conducted in India, explores how economic development affects
gender inequalities and the social position of women. Official statistics are
used to measure the gap be- tween males and females in (1) literacy rates and
school gradua- tion, (2) childhood mortality, (3) labor force participation, and
(4) occupational segregation. These gaps tend to be large in northwest India and
small in the south. This geographical varia- tion provides the opportunity to
study causes of gender ine- qualities. Data are analyzed from more than 300
Indian dis- tricts between 1961 and 1981. The research examines how patterns of
gender inequalities -- and changes in them -- are related to growing
industrialization, agricultural development, and social infrastructure (schools
and medical facilities). A by-product of this research will be the creation of a
computer- ized data base of district-level statistics usable by both U.S. and
Indian social scientists.
