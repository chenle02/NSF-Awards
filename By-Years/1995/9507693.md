9507693 Miller This grant supports a 36-month research collaboration and faculty
exchange program between the University of Rochester (UR) and the Institute for
Molecular Science (IMS) in Okazaki, Japan. This exchange program will enable
extended research leaves for researchers at IMS and the UR in order to conduct
research that cannot be done at their own institutions. Through NSF funding, two
UR postdoctoral or graduate students will spend up to six months in IMS
laboratories per year; in addition, their research advisors will make short-term
visits to Japan at the beginning and end of each research exchange. Through
funding from Japan, IMS research scientists will work in laboratories at the UR.
Research to be conducted under this exchange examines fundamental factors that
control the rates and efficiencies of electron transfer, charge separation, and
charge transport in various media and systems. It further examines how these
factors can be manipulated to obtain new chemistry and useful reaction products
that may have application to materials and devices for photoscience-based
technology. The research will take advantage of highly advanced equipment
available at one or the other of the sites. The quality of the work done by the
American students and faculty will be significantly enhanced by access to
additional resources both in instrumentation and expertise. ***
