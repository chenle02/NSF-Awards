Summary/Abstract: Effects of an introduced predator on ecosystem subsidy and
amphibian decline. S. P. Lawler, P.I.

The purposes of this project are to test whether stocked trout decrease the
amount of emerging aquatic species that serve as prey for terrestrial wildlife,
and to assess whether a declining amphibian responds to trout removal. This is
important because the indirect effects of introduced trout on terrestrial
species are poorly understood, and because trout have been implicated in
amphibian declines. This study also addresses the broader topic of 'ecosystem
subsidy', wherein local ecosystems are influenced by flows of nutrients and
organisms from other areas. Currently, it is unknown how species interactions
within ecosystems affects subsidies to adjacent biological communities. We will
quantify differences in aquatic and terrestrial communities in basins under four
fisheries management schemes: active stocking, discontinued stocking, fish
removals, and historically unstocked. We will test impacts of trout on aquatic
species, relate abundances of amphibians and aquatic insects to population sizes
of bats, birds and snakes, and measure the distribution of insects in uplands.
We will also quantify population sizes and habitat use of the declining Cascades
frog. Our main intellectual contribution will be to measure the importance of
ecosystem subsidy on a large scale, and to assess the role of introduced species
in altering subsidies. Broader impacts include providing research training for
students from under-represented groups, promoting inter-agency partnerships, and
providing information vital to managing mountain wildernesses.
