This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focusses on the development of quinoprotein enzyme based biosensors for
the analysis of histamine, dopamine, and alcohols. Professors Tachikawa of
Jackson State University and Davidson of The University of Mississippi Medical
Center and their students will study the preparation and characterization of
biosensors using the enzymes methylamine dehydrogenase, aromatic amine
dehydrogenase, and methanol dehydrogenase. Electrochemical methods,
electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements, and Raman spectroscopy
will be used to characterize the structure and function of these enzyme based
biosensors. This project is unique in using oxygen and NAD independent redox
enzymes in biosensors and in the long-term medical applications are anticipated.
This project will examine the utility of developing enzyme based biosensors that
use oxygen and NA independent quinoprotein enzymes. Professors Tachikawa of
Jackson State University and Davidson of The University of Mississippi Medical
Center will study the construction and characterization of these biosensors with
their students. A broad, interdisciplinary approach to this project will involve
use of electrochemical techniques, quartz crystal microbalance measurements, and
Raman spectroscopy to determine the structure and properties of these new
biosensors. Long-term goals focus on developing new applications for
quantitative and qualitative analysis in medicine.
