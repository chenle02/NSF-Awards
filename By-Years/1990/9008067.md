The research problems in this project belong mainly to four areas: Stochastic
Optimization, Information Theory in Bayesian Analysis, Statistical Analysis in
Chaotic Models, and Problems in Merging Micro-data Files. The stochastic
optimization project is expected to develop a mostly automated and possibly fast
converging algorithm for finding the global minimum of a complicated function.
The investigations in information theory in the Bayesian analysis area are
devoted to the application of various information measures to the development of
new theories for choosing the better of the two experiments. Investigations
under Chaos and Statistics pertain to Bayesian statistical analysis of chaotic
nonlinear times series. The development of statistical theory for file-merging
methodology, which is used heavily in evaluating policy implications by federal
agencies, is a continuation of a project supported by NSF in the past.
