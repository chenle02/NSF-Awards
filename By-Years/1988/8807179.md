This proposal describes a comprehensive program aimed at developing new methods
for the production of speciality biochemicals and advanced biomaterials. These
materials will be formed by reversing the normal hydrolytic action of two
proteases. These proteases will be modified to alter their selectivity and to
enhance their stability under reaction conditions. Trypsin or chymotrypsin
specificity will be altered by several techniques; site-directed mutagenesis,
screening for mutants which produce enzymes with the ability to act on the
substrates of interest, refolding partially denatured enzyme around novel
substrates and a new approach which will permit the insertion of synthetic amino
acids at the active site of the enzyme. Cathepsin C will be modified by a
refolding procedure, and immobilized by a variety of techniques. Methods for
enhancing the reversal of the hydrolytic reaction for dipeptide and oligomer
synthesis with non-natural amino acids will be developed. These include the use
of non-aqueous solvents (both water-miscible and immiscible) to increase
substrate solubility and the use of directed methods for enzyme immobilization
to enhance enzyme stability under reaction conditions. Changes in enzyme
conformation induced by non-aqueous solvents and by immobilization will be
probed by several techniques, including EPR.
