9451751 Delemesster A computer laboratory for economics has been established and
is designed to strengthen the pedagogical effectiveness of teaching
undergraduate economics. The experimental markets approach is used, and students
gain a better understanding of economic behavior through interactive
participation rather than only through passive learning. The use of economic
experiments in instruction also enables students to experience the functioning
of markets and to discover (or reinforce) the principles of economics in a
laboratory setting. The computer lab consists of personal computers linked to a
local area network. The networked system is necessary to run real-time
experiments, such as a double-auction market, which requires shared information.
