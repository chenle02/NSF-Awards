The goals of this research project are to (1) assess how new data streams
available during a crisis can improve logistical decisions, and (2) facilitate
data stream integration into humanitarian logistics operations, such as search-
and-rescue (SAR) and relief distribution efforts. Since the devastating January
2010 Haitian earthquake, there has been an increasing use and a deeper
understanding of the role of new technologies in disaster relief, as well as the
challenges of integrating these technologies into response activities. The
deliverables of this project will be a comprehensive data source taxonomy
focused on humanitarian logistics and a formal description of the necessary
processes to prepare real-time datasets for use in humanitarian emergencies.
Furthermore, this work will identify needed advances in dynamic routing models
to accommodate these new data streams and the complex set of decisions in the
field. Field-based activities will bring together undergraduate/graduate
students, faculty and practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, this
project will provide a framework for researchers in the field to further this
line of work. The project also identifies a new class of routing models that
combine orienteering and path planning problems needed to address the challenges
of these unique problem settings. Integration of emerging data streams into
humanitarian logistics, such as SAR operations, has potential to save lives and
minimize suffering of people affected by natural disaster and other crises. The
likelihood of success in model creation and implementation in practice will
increase with a series of ongoing conversations between practitioners, inter-
disciplinary research teams, humanitarian organizations and the broader crisis
mapping community. This research will also impact undergraduate and graduate
students by exposing them to new applications of their operations research
knowledge.
