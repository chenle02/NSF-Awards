Chemical biology is the research focus of the NSF REU program that is jointly
hosted by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Montana State
University and by the Native American Research Laboratories (NARL) at the
University of Montana. Students who participate in this REU program will perform
frontier research at the interface of chemistry and biology. Projects are
available in areas of research including proteomics, protein-protein
interactions, protein-macromolecule interactions, protein-small molecule
interactions, protein structure-function relationships, enzymology, and small
molecule synthesis. Students will work either in the NARL or in labs at MSU, and
joint group meetings and a mid-summer symposium will facilitate interactions
between the two sites. Native American students and students from Montana's
Tribal Colleges are especially encouraged to apply, as are students from small
colleges within the upper Northwest region of the country. Additional
information and electronic application materials are available at
