Louisell DMS-9500565 Louisell will continue his investigations in the area of
delay-differential equations, and in systems theory and control, particularly in
topics where the two areas overlap. One of these involves the links between the
Lyapunov method used for analyzing eigenvalue abscissas and the Newton-Raphson
method of quadratic optimal control. Because of the direct linear algebra
approach of Louisell's method, it is well suited for a Newton-Raphson approach
to constructing LQ-optimal controllers for delay systems. Through this method he
can link such areas as LQ-optimal control, H-infinity optimization, and risk
sensitive control. This direction will be further developed. The proposed
research involves delayed feedback in the control of linear systems. One might
expect that delays destroys stability, but in fact, stability may be obtained by
increasing delays. This research will lead to a better understanding of this
phenomenon.
