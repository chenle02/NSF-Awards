9352598 Haywick The Department of Geology and Geography offers a variety of
undergraduate courses in the geosciences including components of mineralogy,
petrology, and sedimentology. Petrographic techniques learned in these courses
are vital to students interested in pursuing graduate research in geology as
well as to geologists employed in the petroleum, hydrology and mineral
exploration industries. The Department is using a cathodoluminoscope in the
undergraduate teaching curriculum and encouraging undergraduate students to use
it in directed research projects in the fields of sedimentology, mineralogy,
petrology and low temperature geochemistry. The addition of a cathodoluminoscope
to the department significantly improves undergraduate teaching in a wide
variety of geology courses. Students benefit by gaining more comprehensive
knowledge of lecture material and through the technical skills they develop
during cathodoluminescence analysis and thin-section microscopy. This greatly
enriches their understanding of geological processes and gives them the
knowledge they need when competing for entry to graduate schools or the work
force. ***
