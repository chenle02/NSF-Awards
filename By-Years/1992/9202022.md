This grant supports the research of Professor H. Iwaniec and W. Duke to work on
several problems connected with analytic number theory and automorphic forms. In
particular, they will attempt to establish analytic continuation of L-functions
derived from the product of two L-functions which have functional equations.
They will also attempt to establish the equidistribution of roots of quadratic
congruences to prime module and finally they will study generalization of the
Linnik problem about lattice points in family of varieties. This is research in
the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
