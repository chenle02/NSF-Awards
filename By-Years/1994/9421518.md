9421518 The Native American linguistic work of Dr. Frank Siebert has been
ongoing for the past 60 years. His work in Penobscot is the most significant of
any researcher working in that language, and now that the language is nearly
extinct, completely irreplaceable. Dr. Siebert also has worked on Catawba,
Montagnais, and other Native American languages which are now extinct or nearly
so. The cataloguing and preservation of Dr. Siebert's life work on Native
American languages is an urgent priority. Dr. Siebert has data on wire
recordings, wax cylinders, aluminum plate records, 33 RPM records, audio tapes,
cassette tapes, computer disks, and notebooks, some dating back to the 1930s.
This project will ensure that all of these data are recorded and preserved in
contemporary, durable media, and transmitted to qualified scholars and
institutions for safekeeping and scholarly use. The materials will also be
properly catalogued. To the extent that his health and strength permit, Dr.
Siebert will work toward completing for publication his Penobscot Dictionary.
