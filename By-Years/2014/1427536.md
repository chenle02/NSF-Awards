This project, procuring and acquiring a large computing cluster appropriate for
Big Data research, aims to enable research in a number of fields of national
concern such as bioinformatics, ocean energy, social media mining, environmental
and climate modeling, image processing and analysis emergency response, health
and medical informatics, national security, infrastructure maintenance and
reliability, law enforcement, commerce, and manufacturing. Of particular note
are seven projects spanning a wide range of application domains. These include
the - Extension of LexisNexis's High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC)
platform to incorporate a Wider Range of Algorithms; - Analysis of Big Data for
Bioinformatics; - Use of Machine Condition Monitoring and Prognostic Health
Monitoring to Improve Ocean Turbine Reliability; - General Challenges found when
Mining Streaming data; - Analysis of Underwater Acoustic Signals for Tasks such
as Unexploded Ordinance Detection; - Use of Machine Learning to Improve Video
Compression Schemes; and - Challenges of Climate Modeling. All these demand the
advanced computation resources under this acquisition. The study of Big Data
encompasses the analysis of extremely large datasets, building models which are
able to incorporate vast numbers of instances and features in order to make
reliable predictions and connections.

Maintaining and promoting the growth of Big Data has become an essential
activity to ensure that the problems that now seem insurmountable may be solved
tomorrow. Two aspects of this growth are developing and providing courses for
students focused on the tools and techniques necessary for Big Data research,
and more focused training in these tools for existing researchers whose area of
expertise lies in other aspects of research. Best practices will be followed for
cultural diversity, involving students and researchers from underrepresented
groups.
