9451027 Chao Psychology and other disciplines have faced criticism and sometimes
illegal activities directed at their use of vertebrate animals in research.
Reactions often involve new and more restrictive guidelines for the care and use
of laboratory animals. Also, the implementation of these guidelines and the
increased measures necessary to guard against vandalism require substantial
expenditures of scarce funds. This project therefore supports an introductory
undergraduate physiological psychology laboratory which uses simple invertebrate
preparations and psychophysiological experiments. Basic computer equipment and
accessories are used. Demonstrations illustrate a variety of neurophysiological
phenomena, and undergraduates learn different electrophysiological and
psychophysiological techniques. Given the continued controversy over the use of
vertebrate animals in teaching and research, it is also expected that many
departments of psychology and biology will find this approach to the
undergraduate study of neuroscience valuable.
