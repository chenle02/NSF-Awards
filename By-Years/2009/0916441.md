The objective of this project is to advance the state-of-the-art in acquiring
and modeling dynamic non-rigid objects. The specific examples of non-rigid
objects that the project is to focus on include: human faces, hands, soft
tissues, cloths, and animals. The PI seeks to address the following two
fundamental questions: (1) How can non-contact optical methods be used to
measure dense 3D surface motion without physically modifying the appearance of
the surface? (2) What physical and/or biological properties can be inferred from
the acquired dense 3D motion data?

The research team addresses these two questions by two simple but general ideas,
namely the space-time approach and data-driven models. The space-time approach
builds upon space-time stereo, and enables accurate optical measurements of 3D
surface motion, as well as automatic registration of shape sequences among
different dynamic objects. The data-driven models are used for both material
recognition and deformation-EMG correlation. The project has a wide range of
scientific impacts, including generating data for 2D face alignment and 3D face
recognition in biometrics, generating data for 3D face emotion recognition in
human computer interaction, measuring human body deformation in biomechanics,
modeling soft tissues for orthopedics and computer-aided surgery, and building
virtual human models for entertainment and education. These scientific impacts
translate into benefits to society, for example, by building more accurate
biometric systems to secure our country, innovating surgery procedure to reduce
health insurance cost, and creating 3D digital replicas of great teachers to
make our education available anywhere, anytime, at a lower cost.
