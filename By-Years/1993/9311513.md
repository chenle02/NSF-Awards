The research entails investigations into wavelets in 2-dimensions which are
free of direction bias, construction of wavelets on compact subsets via mapping
properties, analysis of Burger's equation and applications of wavelet theory to
ill-posed problems arising in the theory of integral equations and statistical
inverse problems.
