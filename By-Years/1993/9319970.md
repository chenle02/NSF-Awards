9319970 Klypin This is a grant for theoretical research of the formation of
various types of astronomical objects in modern cosmological models. The main
goal is to make detailed theoretical predictions for objects and structures for
a very wide range of scales and to confront these predictions with observational
data. Basically all possible cosmologically relevant scales will be considered:
from the fluctuations of the microwave background, which probe scales larger
then, say 100 Mpc, to superclusters and clusters of galaxies on 10-100 Mpc
scales to galaxy clustering at 1-10 Mpc and to submegaparsec scales, which are
important for the epoch of galaxy formation. Comprehensive analysis of
cosmological models and confrontation of the models with observational results,
which also cover a vast range of sizes and different types of objects, are the
key points of the research.
