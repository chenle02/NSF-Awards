This planning grant proposal is written in response to the NSF 00-131 Program
Solicitation for Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate
Program (HBCU-UP). We believe that this planning grant will provide substantial
assistance to Savannah State University (SSU) in conducting an assessment of
science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) education. Accordingly,
Savannah State University will develop an institutional plan to enhance SMET
education through curriculum improvement, faculty development, and
infrastructure facility acquisition and utilization. This planning grant will
not only significantly enhance the academic environment at SSU, it will also
assist the institution in assessing its strong programs as well as those SMET
disciplines, where SSU is not producing enough qualified graduates (with GPA 3.0
or higher) to enter graduate programs, be competitive and receive their Masters
or Ph.D. degrees.

Savannah State University is already assessing its programs and thus NSF support
will complement our planning process to improve curricula and instructional
programs in those disciplines that are not producing large enough numbers of
well qualified graduates entering graduate school or the work force in SMET-
related fields. This assessment period will end during the mid-semester in the
Spring of 2001; planning will take place between March 2001 and August 2001. We
anticipate receiving continued support from the NSF to plan the SMET improvement
grant proposal.
