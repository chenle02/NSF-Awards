0418035&lt;br/&gt;Holguin-Veras&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institute (PASI), jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE), will take place in Sao Paulo, Brazil, July 2005 in the area of
transportation science. The institute is designed to enhance cooperation among
transportation researchers in the Americas and to promote new interactions among
the next generation of transport scientists. The project has attracted leading
transportation researchers from the US and Latin America in diverse fields such
as engineering, decision sciences, management and economics, a reflection of the
multidisciplinary nature of the institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PASI will
include a diagnosis of the state of the art and practice of transportation in
the Americas, technical reports on current research activities, and breakout
discussions to define a common research agenda for the immediate and long-term
future. The activity will be a significant collaborative training event with the
participation of 20 faculty members and 27 graduate students from the United
States and from Latin America. In addition, the PASI will develop a website to
disseminate results of the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
