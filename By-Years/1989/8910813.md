This is a novel electrical engineering approach to the difficult problem of
determining the physical condition of a bone by a non-invasive electromagnetic
measurement. A new era is emerging, namely, non-invasive detection of incipient
failure of biological and non-biological structures without the use of ionizing
radiation. This proposal suggests a new means for accomplishing this goal. It is
clear that this is a high-risk high-gain research proposal. If successful, this
type of research could revolutionize diagnosis in bone disease and healing.
