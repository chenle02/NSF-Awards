The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the worldwide issue of how biofouling
(unwanted attachment of biological species, e.g., barnacles, oysters, mussels)
of ships is addressed. The current antifouling methods are harmful to the
environment (toxic paints are employed and they can pollute waterways) and
costly in terms of maintenance to mitigate biofouling and the increased fuel
costs due to frictional drag during a vesselâ€™s operation. This project seeks to
develop an innovative, electronic approach to biofouling prevention by
developing ultrasonic transducer arrays that are optimized for submerged
operation in a marina. The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina
owners and nationwide marina operators. Over time and with further product
development, commercial transport and large Navy vessels may also be addressed.
This project seeks to enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave
generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and sensor arrays along with
the understanding of how these waves prevent the attachment of bio-species to
ship hulls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project seeks to address the challenges of commercial deployment of
transducer and sensor arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas.
The program has four scientific objectives: 1) Improve transducer and power
amplifier components and construction to maximize sound pressure levels in
water; 2) Develop and construct complex coherent transducer arrays to project
adequate sound pressure levels at distances greater than 10 feet to prevent
biofouling agents from attaching to ships; 3) Integrate sensor arrays into an
autonomous system that can adjust sound pressure levels based on feedback
algorithms; and 4) Develop a proof-of-concept system to adopt an autonomous,
electronically steerable transducer array system to the interior of boat hulls.
This latter adaptation may open markets where large ships such as commercial
transport and Naval vessels can be addressed. The project will innovate in areas
such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers,
acoustic amplifier design, submersible marine electronics, and
electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
