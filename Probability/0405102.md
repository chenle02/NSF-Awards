0405102 Lalley The principal focus of the project will be on stochastic models
of population dynamics and related interacting particle systems. These include
models of spatial growth and competition, and models of epidemics and endemics
in geographically structured populations. A substantial part of the research
will be directed to the behavior of certain interacting systems on noneuclidean
and other nonstandard graphs. Particular problems to be investigated will
include coexistence of competing species, growth and spread of populations,
weak-to-strong survival transitions, and spatial propagation of epidemics and
endemics. These have important connections with other developing areas of
probability, especially percolation, first-passage percolation, and random graph
theory. Secondary foci of the project will be on (1) analytic techniques for
studying systems of generating functions, both finite and infinite, especially
those that arise in random walk and related combinatorial enumeration problems
on tree-like structures; and (2) signal extraction and inference procedures for
time series generated by chaotic dynamical systems. Stochastic interacting
particle systems are widely used as models in various areas of science,
especially in statistical physics and in population biology, but also in
economics. These systems consist of "particles" (which in different contexts may
represent molecules, biological organisms, economic agents, etc.) that interact
in various ways, but generally in a non-deterministic fashion. Mathematical
studies of such systems seek to understand how large-scale collective phenomena
(such as magnetism, propagation of epidemics in large populations, tumor growth,
etc.) arise from and are determined by the details of the individual particle
interactions. An important goal of this project is to contribute to our
understanding of how the geometry describing the interactions between particles
affects the nature of macroscopic behavior, and in particular, to understand how
the behavior of certain model particle systems may vary in unusual geometries
that may describe social and biological connections in certain animal and human
populations.
