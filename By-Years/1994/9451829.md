This project provides a completely self contained observing and image gathering
facility to be used in varied capacities by different undergraduate populations.
Introductory Astronomy students will have the opportunity to use a completely
computerized 8 inch telescope, coupled with a computer controlled CCD camera to
obtain images. Engineering students, in their junior year, will can do
astronomical projects using the same equipment. This project has been motivated
by new skills the project director learned this past summer participating in the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics program entitled "Research
Techniques for Undergraduate Faculty At Small Observatories". An observatory
under construction at the college, with a 16" computerized Schmidt-Cassegrain
telescope, will be utilized in conjunction with some of the equipment in this
project by engineering students in advanced projects.
