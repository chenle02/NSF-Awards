9352140 Molnar We are modernizing and improving the undergraduate General
Physics Lab taught at Douglass College, the nation's largest women's college,
which is located at Rutgers University. The female students who take General
Physics I and II at Douglass College primarily plan to major in math, science,
and engineering. A substantial number of them are minority students. The General
Physics Lab has been taught separately from the lecture course with a weak
connection in topics. It has emphasized tedious data-taking and quantitative
verification of physical laws. In order to provide greater instructional support
for these students, who do more poorly in General Physics than students on other
campuses, we have completely modernized the General Physics Lab sections taught
at Douglass College, in addition to tightly coupling the experiments to the
material covered in lecture each week. The modernization encompasses the
introduction of computer-aided experiments along with replacing outmoded
apparatus. We have obtained a dozen Macintosh microcomputers with lab interfaces
and sensors to run Microprocessor Based Laboratory experiments. We have also
replaced of our air tracks, optics, and electrostatics experiments. Our
objective is to build in our students an intuitive feeling for physical concepts
through hands-on experience in the laboratory. The new experiments are based
upon our success with minilabs in other courses, which focuses on understanding
physics principles as they are concurrently discussed in lecture. We feel it is
particularly apt to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Douglass College by
changing our way of teaching physics at Douglass so that physics is no longer a
major hurdle in a woman's path to a scientific career, and thus, to career
equality. ***
