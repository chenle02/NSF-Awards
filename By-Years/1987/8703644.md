Biomembrane physics has been subject to a tremendous development during the
last decade. This is due to experimentors who, using techniques from modern
physics, have provided an accurate experimental description of certain synthetic
lipid bilayers and reconstituted cell membranes. As a result of the experimental
efforts, these model membranes now present themselves as extremely well-
characterized systems with properties which are believed to be common to a great
variety of biological membranes. At the same time, the experimental work has
highlighted an urgent need for a parallel theoretical actiity. Dr. Scott's
research addresses questions involving the nature and manifestiation of
molecular interactions in biomembranes. The first is an analytical project in
which new models for lipid bilayer condensed phases will be constructed and
analyzed. The second is a large scale simulation of model lipid-protein
interactions in membranes. Statistical physics is a difficult field to work in
and more so when combined with biology. Dr. Scott's recent record demonstrates
that he is most capable of handling any problems that arise and will make
significant contributions to this field.
