This award will support travel and meeting expenses for participants at the
Fourth International Congress on Pacific Neogene Stratigraphy to be held in
Berkeley, California. The overall theme of the Congress is to explore recent
developments in isotopic and seismic stratigraphic tech- niques. Special

oceanographic and climate condi- tions in the Pacific Region. Funds in the award
will be used to defray registration expenses of students and ensure
participation of key foreign scientists.
