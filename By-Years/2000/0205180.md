&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to host a workshop bringing together animal behavior
and information technology experts to design an on-line computer database of
behavioral information. The database might include, for example, videotaped
images or audio-recordings of animals engaged in various types of behavior,
measurements of the frequencies and contexts with which different sorts of
behavior are produced, and useful techniques for collecting behavioral data from
different species. It would also include software tools to link and extract
information from existing databases, as well as to visualize and analyze the
behavioral data effectively. The resulting database will help animal behavior
researchers share their data with each other (n a search for general patterns),
with researchers in other fields (e.g., genomics, neurobiology, ecology), and
with the general public who are often fascinated by animal behavior. Funds will
be used to host the workshop (travel expenses), to produce a prototype version
of the database, and to share this prototype database with other behavioral
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
