Joseph 9622104 This research planning grant involves developing a new set of
problems to be used as a testbed for general integer programming (IP) problems.
Although many special case IP have been well studied, the general IP problem
remains relatively unexplored. Consequently test problems used in early
exploration of general IP problems are still in use today and are insignificant
in size when measured against modern computing power. A novel technique for
developing a modern testbed of general IP problems will be utilized which
differs from conventional methods in several ways: first, an optimal solution is
determined by solving a knapsack problem over a given solution area; second,
constraints are constructed to maintain feasibility of this optimal solution and
implicitly enforce specified bounds. This approach provides a convenient
mechanism by which the problem structure around a known solution can be changed,
thereby expanding opportunities for study of the general IP problem and its
characteristics. This technique places no limit on problem size and should be
able to generate problems of reasonable size. The research planning grant
activities include an in-depth study of a methodology for generation of test
problems with known optimal solutions. The results of this activity will lay the
foundation for a joint effort undertaking a full project including the design of
procedures for problem generation, software development and validation,
statistical studies and analyses. Development of a modern set of test problems
for the general IP problem will fill an important gap and accelerate progress in
IP research. IP problems abound in manufacturing areas such as sequencing,
scheduling, planning, facility layout and design.
