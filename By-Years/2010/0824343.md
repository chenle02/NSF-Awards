Proposal to acquire three items of shared-use scientific instrumentation for use
on R/V Kilo Moana operated by the University of Hawaii as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The
three items requested, as prioritized by the PI, are: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1)
Reagent-grade water upgrade&lt;br/&gt;2) Cable Metering System&lt;br/&gt;3)
Meteorological System upgrade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;
In the present proposal, the items recommended for support provide an important
shared-use infrastructure capability for basic instrumentation that is cost-
effective, and will significantly improve capabilities for users of R/V Kilo
Moana which services a diverse group of investigators from around the U.S. The
University of Hawaii technical support group has the expertise to operate and
support the recommended systems on the vessels.&lt;br/&gt;
