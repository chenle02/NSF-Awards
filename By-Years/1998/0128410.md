This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase Iproject will explore a
system for improving the sensitivity of fluorescence-based metal-ion sensing. It
will use a novel mesoporous material that responds to the presence of certain
metal ions by undergoing a precipitous drop in fluorescence intensity. This will
enable the detection of trace amounts of toxic or otherwise problematical metal
ions in e.g. drinking water, hazardous waste sites, and industrial waste
streams. This sensing system can then be incorporated into a test strip-like
format in a polymer matrix to give a mass-producible and hence cost-effective,
single-use trace metal sensor. These sensors can be made widely available and
thereby can improve the amount of information on the presence of metals of
concern in the home, workplace, and environment.
