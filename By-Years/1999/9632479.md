CTS - 9632479 P. Somasundaran Columbia University ABSTRACT The project deals
with the use of adsorbed polymer-surfactant aggregates for the separation of
organics and inorganics. The objective is to develop an understanding of the
mechanisms of separation using such aggregates (admicelles). Selectivity will be
achieved by introducing suitable functional groups on the polymer surfactant.
The project will involve spectroscopic characterization of the adsorbed
aggregates and studies on the incorporation of organics and metal ions.
Partition coefficients and separation kinetics will be determined. A correlation
of aggregate properties with separation efficiency will be attempted. The
results may lead to the development of improved techniques for efficient removal
of trace contaminants or separation of chemically similar materials.
