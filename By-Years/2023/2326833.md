Agriculture faces increasing challenges all around the world in the face of
climate-change related issues. A new focus on climate smart agriculture
catalyzed by developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence will
be needed to better manage complex agricultural cyber-physical systems to
maintain productivity to ensure food security while constraining the impact that
agriculture has on greenhouse gas emissions.

This proposal is to provide support for U.S. participation in a workshop on
Internet of things (IoT)/artificial intelligence(AI)/machine learning
(ML)-enabled precision agriculture to be hosted by Ben-Gurion University at
Beer-Sheva in July 2023. The focus will be on big data acquisition and AI/ML-
based analytics in precision agriculture. It will cover a wide range of topics
focused on scoping of the key challenges remaining in how to use IoT/AI/ML to
support further development of sustainable agriculture.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
