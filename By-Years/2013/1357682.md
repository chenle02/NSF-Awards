Researchers are developing a low-power nanomaterials-based microheater gas
sensor platform. During this project, the research team will tailor the platform
for realtime monitoring of hazardous gases such as hydrogen sulfide. To fully
discriminate among hazardous gasses, there needs to be an understanding of gas-
nanomaterial interactions and how these interactions depend on the temperature
of the microheater gas sensors. Discrimination between various gases with
similar chemical reactivity will require new measurement techniques and
development of new nanoparticle materials with enhanced affinities for specific
gases.

The low power microheater gas sensor arrays have a very small form factor,
average power consumption of microwatts to a few milliwatts, and can accommodate
multiple sensors on a single chip without increasing in size. Small, low power,
low cost multi-gas detectors that can selectively detect various gases can have
a large impact on worker safety, public health, and environmental protection.
These gas sensor arrays can be wirelessly interfaced to smartphones, making the
data more accessible to the individual user, and remotely accessible via
wireless networks. Wide area deployment of such sensors would enable mapping of
environmental pollutant and toxic gas release in both industrial and public
settings.
