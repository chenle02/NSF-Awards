This award establishes a research site at the Arizona State University of the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Water Quality (WQC)
located at the University of Arizona. The research will focus on applied health-
related water microbiology and environmental engineering. The overall objective
is to perform research to improve the quality of drinking water and investigate
physical, chemical and microbial processes that affect the quality of potable
water supplies. In addition, the IUCRC at Arizona State University will
establish an undergraduate training program for the minority students. A number
of area municipalities and industries will form an industrial consortium to
provide financial and intellectual support of the research site.
