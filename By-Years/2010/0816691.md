The proposal will investigate the proximate factors leading to highly variable
and spatially synchronized seed production in a wind-pollinated, obligate
outcrossing tree species, the valley oak (Quercus lobata). This phenomenon,
known as mast-fruiting or masting behavior, is believed to be driven by either
environmental forcing or pollination coupling. Environmental forcing postulates
that trees use weather as a cue to determine the resources they devote to
reproduction in a particular year. Pollen coupling assumes that pollen is
limited and that fertilization efficiency is dependent on pollen production by
nearby trees. This proposal will test these hypotheses using long-term data on
acorn production by Q. lobata collected on a statewide scale combined with
detailed data on individual phenology, microclimate, overall pollen abundance,
and the fate of female flowers. The project will collect statewide data on acorn
production, a highly variable food resource important to both game and non-game
wildlife. The project focuses on a tree species of considerable conservation
interest because of development, habitat conversion, apparent lack of
regeneration, and susceptibility to future climate change. The work proposed
here will help to emphasize the key role Q. lobata and oak woodlands in general
play as a natural resource important both to wildlife and to ecosystem function.
The extensive dataset on seed production by forest trees that will result from
this research will be made electronically available, first in summary form and
ultimately as metadata, for future researchers interesting in using the data to
examine patterns and test hypotheses regarding the ecology and evolution of
masting behavior.
