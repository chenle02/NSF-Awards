This award will fill a critical gap in Pacific apparent polar wander through
analysis of the skewness of profiles recording Vine- Matthews magnetic
anomalies. The PI will combine together skewness data using a new method that
has developed to solve simultaneously for the paleomagnetic pale latitude,
longitude and their 95% confidence limits, and anomalous skewness and its 95%
confidence limits that best fit the data in a maximum-likelihood, least- squares
sense. She will analyze the skewness of Pacific anomalies 12r-24r (32-57 Ma).
These data will fill a large gap in paleomagnetic data for the critical interval
preceding the elbow in the Hawaiian-Emperor chain and spanning the major plate
reorganization during chrons 21-25. She will use the results to further
constrain the timing and rate of southward motion of the Hawaiian hotspot
relative to the paleomagnetic axis, to construct a detailed chronology of
anomalous skewness, to test alternative plate reconstructions, and to
investigate the geocentric axial dipole hypothesis.
