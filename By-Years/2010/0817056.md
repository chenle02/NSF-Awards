&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are awarded to this Post-doctoral Fellow
to explore the reasons behind the observed inconsistency between the nutrient
retention hypothesis and observations of nitrogen budgets in high latitude
catchments areas. She hypothesizes that this may be due to spatial and temporal
inhomogeneities in nutrient processing along flowpaths. She will conduct
observations of the manner in which permafrost extent influences the sources and
forms of nitrogen as well as the relative rates of reaction and transport of
nitrogen as a function of permafrost depth. This will be accomplished at a
series of scales ? regional, hillslope, and soil profile scales. Observations
will be made of both naturally occurring tracers and introduced tracers.
