For nearly a century, researchers have studied the pond-dwelling ciliated
protozoan Tetrahymena, making numerous fundamental discoveries in cell and
molecular biology, including two that won Nobel prizes. To maintain its position
as a premier model organism, Tetrahymena needs well-developed and maintained
genomic resources. Remarkably, Tetrahymena houses two distinct nuclei with
distinct genomes 'one germline and one somatic' within its single cell. Over
five years ago, the somatic genome was sequenced and annotated, revealing about
25,000 genes. Although the data have been invaluable to Tetrahymena researchers,
the genome assembly and many of the gene models are flawed or incomplete (as is
typical of such draft-level projects). Using transcriptomic and comparative
genomic data obtained from other sources, this project will perform much needed
repairs to the essential genomic resources. In addition, the germline genome
sequence has just now become available. This project will explore the structure
of the germline genome, how it is related to the somatic genome to which it
gives rise in development , and ways in which both genomes have changed over the
course of evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: These data will be
used to update and enhance the resources and functionalities of the Tetrahymena
Genome Database, serving a wide community of researchers and thus providing a
strong broader impact to the cyber-infrastructure of science. This community
also takes very seriously its commitment to the integration of research and
education. The project will provide laboratory and bioinformatic experience to
graduate and undergraduate students. In partnership with the Ciliate Genomics
Consortium, a network of faculty and students at diverse colleges and
universities, the project will establish a self-sustaining program to
continually update Tetrahymena's genomic resources while empowering students by
engaging them in original and valuable research.
