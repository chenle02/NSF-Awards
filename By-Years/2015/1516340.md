In West African countries, cell phone penetration can range from 40 to 80% and
upwards, with over 2 million Android devices in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and
Liberia alone. The investigators propose the delivery of a smartphone
application that will improve care-seeking, epidemiology, and prevention by
monitoring civilian location patterns, habits (e.g. walking, sleeping), and
resource needs (e.g. hand sanitizers or gloves). This project addresses three
key problems. First, how well can smartphones sensors support real-time
monitoring and prediction of the scale of an infectious disease (in this case
Ebola) compared to stochastic epidemiology models? Second, how can smartphone
communications be used to educate a population about prophylactic behaviors and
change such behaviors? Third, is mHealth (mobile health) sustainable in West
Africa, or is the infrastructure too underdeveloped to support such innovations
over the long term? Our project is novel in that it uses passively obtained
location information, sensor data, and dynamic surveys to understand the health
and potential for infection among the population in real time to supplement CDC,
WHO and UN efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID proposes to seek to use
machine learning to classify data obtained from phone sensors (e.g. location in
a village with high disease rate, reduced movement, self-photo of rashes) along
with survey questions to determine if users are developing symptoms that may be
similar to Ebola. The project will also look at human mobility patterns compared
to stochastic epidemiological models to determine the efficacy of real-time cell
phone tracking. The coupling of these sensor modalities will be used to model
users as a noisy sensor and compare how this information agrees or predicts
historical trends. Finally, the project will use features of behavioral science
to explore what feedback does to affect user behavior, such as, knowing about
their risk for Ebola.
