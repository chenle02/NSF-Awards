This project helps support U.S. participants in the 2008 Rocky Mountain
Mathematics Consortium Summer School. The school educates graduate students and
junior faculty on the recent developments in computational methods for partial
differential equations. This topic is of major importance in applied mathematics
and is key in developing a better understanding of, and prediction capability
for, complex physical systems. Topics to be covered at the intensive two-week
summer school include: numerical methods for time-dependent problems, nodal
Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (theory and implementation), high-accuracy and
spectral element methods on structured and unstructured meshes, introduction to
parallel computing and high-performance computing on present-day architectures,
and various applications such as fluid flow and weather prediction. The
lecturers include Jan Hesthaven (Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown
University, and Director of the Center for Computation and Visualization), Amik
St-Cyr (National Center for Atmospheric Research), Henry Tufo (Colorado
University-Boulder and National Center for Atmospheric Research), and Tim
Warburton (Rice University).

The school has an impact on the U.S. maintaining its leadership role in
computational science, by equipping U.S. graduate students with an understanding
of the latest computational methods, preparing students to be able to perform
parallel computations on developing architectures, and enhancing their
understanding of the important role that mathematical modeling and simulations
plays in science. The summer school is held just prior to the thematic year-long
program on Computational Geosciences at NCAR, and thus prepares graduate
students and junior faculty to participate more beneficially in this program.
This project also has a large impact on math and science education in Wyoming,
as some of the speakers and participants are guest lecturers at the local
workshop "Thinking and Doing Math and Science with Engineering," a program that
presents Wyoming K-12 math and science teachers with feasible ways to make
mathematics and science more pertinent and exciting to their students.
