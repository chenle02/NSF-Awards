As scholarly digital content has proliferated over the past decade, the field of
library and information science has had to undergo radical curriculuum changes
to deal with primary library tasks designed for print and analog media. The
major educational and research changes related to digital information have led
to a number of leading institutions to form interdisciplinary "iSchools" and
begin a dialogue to adapt collectively to the new forms of information and
access practices. This proposal is for a workshop to gather selected iSchool
administrators and faculty focusing on pedagogical issues to discuss and reach
common agreement on primary curriculum goals. This workshop is designed to
present and analyze individual existing approaches and construct implementation,
evaluation and dissemination plans to guide future activities.
