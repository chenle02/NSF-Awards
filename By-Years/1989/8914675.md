This research project will systematically examine the interaction between the
various procedures involved in measurement of mechanical parts using coordinate
measuring machines (CMMs). The areas of special study include the systematic,
random and stochastic errors in coordinate measuring, the sampling methodologies
appropriate to different part geometries, and the algorithms used to analyze the
coordinate data to produce mathematical descriptions of geometric entities. The
interaction of these three factors in determining conformance to design intent
(tolerancing systems) will be addressed.
