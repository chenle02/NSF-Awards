Two sets of experiments will be carried out using the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory tandem Van de Graaf accelerator in the low MeV/u range. In the first,
oxygen ion projectiles with energies between 0.3 and 2 MeV/u will be used to
bombard molecular hydrogen and noble gas targets. The energy and angular
distributions of resulting electrons will be studied. In the second set, the
formation of doubly-excited states of Ag4+ and Ag12+ incident on He, H2 and Ar
gas targets will be studied. This study will contribute fundamental information
about electron- electron correlations in such collisions.
