Biology laboratory instruction must be changed from a "cookbook" approach to one
that emulates activities of a scientist doing science. This project uses a
student research video portfolio to improve biology laboratory instruction by
encouraging exploration and investigation and by stimulating interest. With the
proper environment, students have the time to analyze their work, communicate
ideas and concepts, and develop cooperation with colleagues. A phase contrast
microscope and video camera system are used to create a video tape record, after
which a computer interfaced with video equipment is used to edit the tape and
insert captions, labels, and text. The purpose is to create a minidocumentary of
the biological investigation which can be used for study, assessment of the
experiment, and evaluation of the student's progress in a particular course.
This research video portfolio plan affects all the biology and health science
majors as well as summer programs for public school students. This plan is
revolutionizing the way science is taught at the college: biology laboratories
are becoming a place for student self-learning and freedom to explore science.
