Design Optimization for Robustness to Single-Event
Effects&lt;br/&gt;Institution: William Marsh Rice
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;Technology trends
and economic factors are driving forces behind the widespread move to mainstream
computing and communication systems based entirely on commodity hardware and
operating systems. Yet, the premium that we as a society place on the
reliability of such systems has increased commensurate with our reliance on them
for the smooth operation of our lives. Soft errors resulting from single-event
effects (SEEs) are an important-and possibly dominant-failure mode that impact
the reliability of such mainstream commodity systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will develop low-cost SEE-reliability-aware and SEE-reliability-driven
design solutions based on optimization to maximize robustness to SEEs, commonly
termed SEE-hardening. SEE-hardening is an attractive low-cost solution to
increase reliability since it does not require any runtime support from either
the hardware or the operating system. SEE-hardening can also be used to
complement and reduce the overhead cost of traditional fault detection and
tolerance techniques. The optimization algorithms for SEE-hardening resulting
from this work provide seamless tradeoffs between SEE-hardness and area-delay-
power, enabling cost-effective solutions commensurate with the criticality and
reliability requirements over the lifetime of the target application. A major
impact of this research is to enable ubiquitous low-cost highly reliable
computing, by expanding its reach to domains that lack the financial resources
to acquire custom solutions. Through academic and industry collaborations, this
project will develop an integrated testbed and web-based resources to facilitate
broad research in reliable system design, an area that is rapidly gaining in
importance and interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
