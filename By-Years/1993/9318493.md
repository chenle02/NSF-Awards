Project Summary ATM-9318493, Ching-Sheng Wu This proposal will study the basic
theory of the plasma emission process as well as its applications. The issues to
be addressed include: (1) the effect of velocity dispersion of the beam
electrons, (2) finite spectra of backscattered Langmuir waves and low frequency
turbulence, (3) effect of quasilinear relaxation of the beam instability on the
emission process, (4) nonlinear effects on mode coupling, (5) application of the
theory to emissions associated with the bow shock, and (6) discussion of type II
and type III radio bursts.
