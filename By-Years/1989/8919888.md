Dr. Wallen has developed a model that integrates the central effects of
hormones with peripheral mechanisms affecting their metabolic fate that has
direct relevance to the development of human steroid replacement therapies. From
work with humans and primates, it is clear that removal of female ovaries or
damaging their ability to function drastically reduces sexual interest and
satisfaction. A critical problem is which steroid hormone or combination of
hormones can mimic the action of the ovaries and adrenals on these behavior.
This is further complicated since blood of female rhesus and human females
contains special proteins that can tightly bind estrogens and androgens. When
hormones are attached to these proteins, called sex hormone binding globulins or
SHBG, they cannot affect the nervous system and are inactive. When they become
unattached from the protein they are once again active. Although both steroid
hormones bind to SHBG, androgens bind more tightly than estrogens. Dr. Wallen is
examining whether the binding of androgens to these special blood proteins frees
estrogens to influence behavior. His work will clearly define the role of both
estrogens and androgens. Furthermore, finding that SHBG strongly influences the
behavioral effectiveness of ovarian and adrenal steroids will markedly change
current views of hormone action. The outcome of his innovative work will provide
new information on how steroid hormones interact to modulate their individual
dynamics and effectiveness and could lead to the development of better hormonal
treatments for humans with endocrine disorders.
