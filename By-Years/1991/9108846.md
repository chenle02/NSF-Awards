The widespread use of composites in the durable goods sector of the civilian
economy has been limited due to high material and manufacturing costs. The
principle research objective of the State Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Low-Cost, High- Speed, Polymer-Matrix Composites Processing
Center at the Michigan State University is to advance the research and
technology transfer activities and to enhance the competitiveness of the
producer and user industries in the State and surrounding areas. There are
42,000 plastics related jobs in the State of Michigan and this total is expected
to rise to 52,000 by 1995. The State has targeted composites and plastics as a
"key" growth area. The "core" research program will include the following
technical thrust areas: Advanced Prepregging, Thermal Management and Novel
Processing, Resin Transfer Molding, Reactive Processing of Natural and/or
Recycled Constituents, and Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Composites
Design and Processing. The strong presence of the automotive industry along with
its large, medium, and small suppliers will provide a focus and realistic
guidance to the research strategy. The development of knowledge- based
processing systems in the form of computer software will play an important role
in technology transfer. The participation of the University of Michigan, Wayne
State University, Michigan Technological University, and the Michigan Molecular
Institute in the "core" research program is a special feature of the center.
Each participating company (28) in the center is providing one member to the
Industrial Advisory Board. The Michigan Materials and Polymer Institute (MMPI),
a private, not-for-profit industrial funding consortium will channel its
industrial contributions and responsibility for this area to the center. The
State of Michigan, industry and NSF will provide matching funds totalling
$750,000 in the first year. An additional $184,000 will be provided by industry.
