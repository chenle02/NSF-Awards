During fruiting body formation in myxococcus xanthus, dramatic changes occur in
gene expression. We plan to analyze several developmentally regulated genes in
order to learn how these changes are regulated. 1) The mbhA gene encodes a
lectin which appears during aggregation. The promoter for this gene resembles
the nitrogen regulated promoters from E. coli. We plan to use site-directed
mutagenesis to characterize this promoter. We also plan to locate the upstream
enhancer sequences, previously identified, and search for proteins which
recognize it. We will use the Salmonella ntrA gene to clone and sequence the
Myxococcus NTRA-like sigma factor. We also plan to examine why the mbhA mRNA has
such a long half-life, 2 hrs. 2) frz genes are homologous to Salmonella
chemotaxis gene. They are developmentally induced, but not an operon. The role
of frzCD in stimulating the other frz genes will be studied since it contains a
DNA-binding domain similar to sigma-43. Missense mutations in this domain will
be isolated. Fusion proteins will be purified and assayed for DNA-binding
activity. We will also identify the transcripts and promoters of the frz genes.
3) Alkaline phosphatase is induced at late times of development (sporulation).
We will clone and sequence the gene. The cloned gene will be used to study late
gene expression.
