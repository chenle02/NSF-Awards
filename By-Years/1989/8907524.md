Increased co2 will have major impacts on plants--- including increased
photosynthesis, increased growth, decreased water use, and decreased tissue
nitrogen. These changes will be even more intense in legumes which have
symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Rates of nitrogen fixation are often
determined by available photosynthate or size of nodules. The impact of
increased co2 on two species of lupines (Lupinus) will be investigated at the
Duke Phytotron. These plants have nitrogen- fixing nodules and thus are likely
to have increased rates of fixation as co2 concentrations increase. In addition,
lupines have alkaloids as their anti-herbivore defense compounds. Since
alkaloids contain nitrogen, increased co2 is very likely to impact on alkaloid
concentration as well. To study this interaction, lupines will be grown under
three different concentrations of co2 and three different levels of foliage
damage. Foliage from these plants will be analyzed for changes in chemical
composition, and will be fed to a native species of herbivore, Orgyia vetusta.
This research is the first to investigate a three-level interaction between a
plant, its nitrogen-fixing symbiont, and herbivore. Results will be of great
interest to those studying atmosheric gases and global change issues.
