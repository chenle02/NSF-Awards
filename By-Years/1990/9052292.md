This project modernizes the content of several courses in Engineering
Technology. Specifically affected are the AC and DC Machines sequence and the
Process Controls Course. The objective is to expose students to modern state of
the art methods and equipment for performing data acquisition and control
functions. The project equipment includes two complete data acquisition and
control systems that interface with previously owned equipment and consists of
two personal computers with data acquisition and control software, variable
frequency drives, and other miscellaneous interfacing hardware. These make
possible new laboratory experiences that significantly enhance the education of
both associate degree and bachelors degree graduates in electrical engineering
technology. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
