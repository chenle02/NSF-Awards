The purpose of this project is to conduct a detailed study of student classwork
of twelfth grade students in several schools to empirically validate statistical
measures of the mathematics and science curriculum. This study will develop and
use new techniques for the measurement of actual practiced curriculum. The
techniques are called "deep probe" because they involve detailed collections of
student classwork and discussions with teachers. The results should help other
studies develop more appropriate methods of determining exactly what is taught
in classrooms.//
