This award provides support to Washington University to establish a three-year
International Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Japan titled
"Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Japan in Advanced Technology
(REUJAT). Nine students each year will have an opportunity to do research in the
area of advanced technologies for the detection and mitigation of damage to
civil engineering structures subjected to severe dynamic loading as a result of
events like earthquakes, hurricanes, and blasts. The REU site is designed as a
summer experience with five weeks spent in Japan at the University of Tokyo and
3 to 4 weeks in the U.S. at the students' home institution. In addition to
research, relevant technical tours and cultural/social events are planned.
Undergraduate engineering students from across the U.S. will be recruited for
the REUJAT program.
