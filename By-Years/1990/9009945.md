A standard for multichip module (MCM) packages is proposed called "Tiny
Packages". This is to be used by university researchers in VLSI subsystem design
using multichip modules (MCMs). The goal is for fabrication to be done through
MOSIS in a similar manner to the use of the "Tiny Chips" standard at the single
chip level. The first version of public domain computer aided design (CAD) tools
for MCM design is developed making use of the "Tiny Packages" standard. These
tools optimize the placement of chips on the substrate and the multilayered
routing of substrate interconnections to exploit MCM high-performance potential.
The utility of these tools will be refined and validated by application to the
re-packaging of a commercial digital signal processor (DSP) printed circuit
board. The relative features and performance of the two designs will be
compared. At no cost AT&T will provide the unmounted chips, fabricate the MCMs
designed, then assemble and test the resultant redesign.
