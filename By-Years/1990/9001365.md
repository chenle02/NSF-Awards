This project continues mathematical research centering on topics in the theory
of several complex variables. The work involves studies of complex manifolds,
representing the geometric point of view, together with analytic investigations
into value distributions and continuity properties of complex functions. One
primary focus concerns what is known as the Hartogs phenomenon whereby a
holomorphic function of several variables defined in a region surrounding a
domain (such as in a complex annulus) continues as a holomorphic function to the
inner region. Work will be done in extending the idea in two directions. The
first is to determine the extent to which a separate analyticity implies joint,
while the second is concerned with the Hartogs phenomenon as it relates to
mapping into complex manifolds. Although many manifolds reflect this property,
some do not. The outstanding problem remains one of giving conditions on the
target manifolds so that the extension property holds for all mappings into the
manifold. Value distribution theory is concerned with the extent to which
holomorphic functions defined in the space of several complex variables can omit
or assume given values. The measurement of such affinities involves
generalizations of the classical Nevanlinna theory which was developed for
functions of a single variable during the first decades of this century. For
nonconstant functions, their affinity for any value is almost always the same as
for any other. The exceptions represent the deficiencies of the function - the
measure of the set of deficiencies will be of primary concern during this
investigation.
