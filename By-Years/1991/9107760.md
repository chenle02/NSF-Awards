This research is developing techniques for reducing the occurrence of run-time
errors in circuits and systems. Emphasis is on preventing the introduction of
faults into the system through verification and synthesis techniques, and on
improving the detection and diagnosis of faults causing run-time errors so that
the faults can be removed from the system. Topics being pursued are: 1.
Developing synthesis methods that automatically synthesize a synchronous,
register-transfer level (RTL) hardware specification from a behavioral VHDL
language specification; 2. determining what coverage of multiple stuck-at faults
or bridging faults can be expected or guaranteed by a test for delay faults in
an arbitrary circuits; 3. investigating methods for utilizing the use of output
waveform characteristics in delay testing; and 4. finding fault models for
intermittent failures, and methods to detect their presence.
