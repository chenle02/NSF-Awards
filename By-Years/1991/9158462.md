The "surface phase" in polymer systems is of enormous scientific and technical
importance. Bonding of interfaces (weldability), friction and wear behaviour,
and chemical stability depend on the structure and properties of the surface
phase, but polymer science has not yet succeeded in developing a comprehensive
approach to characterize and study it. This proposal requests support to expend
the use of ion beams and neutron and xray scattering to probe the distribution
and conformation of polymer species near surfaces so as to understand how to
describe and control the behaviour of the surface phase.
