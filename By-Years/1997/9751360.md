This project is improving the learning, retention, understanding, application
and appreciation of physics concepts and principles by students enrolled in all
introductory physics courses. It is also providing a model of recent technology
and curriculum materials for 2-year colleges. This goal is being accomplished by
acquiring faster and more powerful computer technology that can update, expand,
extend, and broaden the current use of microcomputer and digital video
technology in physics. This technology provides quick graphical feedback that
makes possible a larger number and variety of experiences, which can motivate
and challenge students. Software and hardware is being acquired for a new
laboratory of networked microcomputer workstations equipped with high speed
digital video capture and laboratory interfaces with appropriate sensors and
probes. The workstations also include shared laser printers and a local physics
network server. This project is encouraging students to support science by
improving their experiences in physics, as well as increasing science literacy.
It is helping to prepare students in physics courses for the next century and to
stimulate other community colleges to consider adapting these approaches. *
