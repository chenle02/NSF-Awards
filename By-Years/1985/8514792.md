Research will be conducted on the microbial response in soils to the influx of
selected organic substances that are subject to biological degradation. The
investigators plan to study soils with originally low concentrations of organic
matter to determine whether naturally occurring populations of micro-organisms
can adjust to the application of the selected chemical or whether inoculation
with acclimated cultures is necessary to initiate degradation. Results of this
research may be applicable to engineering design of soil application systems for
managing hazardous wastes.
