This project uses laboratory experimental methods to understand other-regarding
behavior. Much of contemporary theoretical modeling of social processes assumes
that individuals are narrowly self-interested. While this approach has generated
interesting results in many areas, it tends to fail in social situations in
which other-regarding behavior becomes important. One environment, relying on
`dictator experiments,` is exceptionally fruitful for analyzing the degree to
which other-regarding interests matter. Simply put, in a dictator experiment one
subject is given the power to divide a pot of money -- taking some and giving
some to a partner. Under one set of experimental conditions, the `dictator`
engages in an equal division of the money. In another experimental condition the
dictator takes everything and leaves nothing for the partner. This project
systematically manipulates the decision environment to introduce others into the
decision process. This research explores the extent to which the concern for
others creeps into an individual's decision calculus. This research touches on
fundamental issues of fairness and equity.
