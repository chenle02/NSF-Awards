The RAS genes were first discovered as the transforming principles of oncogenic
retroviruses, but have subsequently been found to be important normal
constituents of the mammalian genome. They have been highly conserved in
evolution and are members of a larger family of genes which encode small
molecular weight guanine nucleotide binding proteins. Although the function of
RAS remains unknown, there has been recent, striking progress in understanding
of the RAS proteins, and much more can be anticipated in the near future,
including: an understanding of effector function for RAS in micro-organisms,
discovery of a large number of additional, RAS-related genes and their modes of
action, the regulation of RAS and RAS-related proteins, their processing, their
structure, and their physiological role. It is becoming clear that a vast array
of cellular processes are controlled by these proteins, and hence, an
understanding of RAS is not only essential for an understanding cellular growth
control, but for much of cell biology as well. About 300 investigators
representing cell biology, molecular biology, pharmacology, and structural
biochemistry are expected to participate. The proposed meeting on "The Function
and Evolution of RAS Proteins" will bring together investigators in the field of
RAS research in order to accelerate the exchange of information, promote
cooperation and catalyse the development of fresh approaches to the
understanding of this important cell biological problem.
