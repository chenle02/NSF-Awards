This project provides an instructional wind tunnel facility for a fluid
mechanics laboratory. The equipment includes a 12-inch wind tunnel with an
instrumentation system, a microcomputer, hardware and software for an automatic
data acquisition and analysis system and a digital multimanometer. This
equipment, together with existing facilities, completes and improves instruction
in the fluid mechanics laboratory by enabling students to perform experiments in
the areas of boundary layer and external flows. The capability of computer
interfacing allows students to carry out the proposed experiments previously
deemed too laborious or impractical by traditional methods.
