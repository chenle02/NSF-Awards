The research objective of this grant is to elucidate contact self-cleaning
mechanics of natural and synthetic micro/nano-fibrillar adhesive materials and
design and demonstrate high performance synthetic elastomer fibrillar adhesives
with such self-cleaning capability. Geckos and beetles can clean their foot-
hairs when they are contaminated with particulates on surfaces by several cycles
of loading, shearing, and unloading of their footpads on a clean surface, called
contact self-cleaning. Such biological self-cleaning mechanics of is not fully
understood yet. Moreover, although the recent synthetic fibrillar adhesives have
demonstrated high strength and repeatability as good as biological counterparts
on clean and smooth surfaces, their performance degrades significantly on dirty
surfaces since they cannot shed the dirt particles. To achieve the research
objectives of this project, the research tasks include modeling of self-cleaning
mechanics of fibrillar adhesives, development of a design method for high
performance elastomer fibrillar adhesives with such self-cleaning capability,
and fabrication and characterization of directional elastomer fiber
arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed bio-inspired fibrillar gripping
materials with contact self-cleaning capability would enable new commercial
gripping materials that could work repeatedly and reliably in broad real-world
commercial applications such as sports, flexible electronics, medicine, space,
product design, packaging, and robotics. Interdisciplinary research work in this
study will be transferred to many educational activities in mechanical
engineering, robotics, and bioengineering. Two new courses developed by the
principle investigator will use the biologically inspired adhesive and micro-
mechanics concepts and research facilities and results in this project to design
and implement new bio-inspired materials in student semester-long projects.
