The Civil Engineering Technology department at Walla Walla Community College is
awarding 81 scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students
over a four-year period. The department is the only two-year program in the six-
state northwest region to have received TAC/ABET accreditation. Coupled with a
renewed recruitment effort, the scholarships are raising the number of students
majoring in civil engineering technology from 25 to 45. This is bringing the
number of enrolled students to that experienced a decade ago. The civil
engineering program has a history of a high job placement rate. The number of
scholarships being awarded for years one through four is 12, 18, 22, and 29
respectively. This number of scholarships is in accord with the institutional
need of financial aid for 60% of its students. The institution is putting into
place a sustainable scholarship fund with donations received from industry
partners during the project period. The institution's 10,000 square mile service
area has a multicultural population including a growing number of Hispanics who
currently account for over 23% of the population. The project is increasing the
proportion of students of Hispanic descent in civil engineering technology to
reflect that of the general population.
