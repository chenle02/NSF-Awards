This research project will examine the technologies and models required to
enable rapid response electronic markets for time-sensitive goods. The research
will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team from Management Science,
Economics and Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and will include
collaborators from industry: Avendra, GE Global Exchange and IBM. Time sensitive
goods have an associated time attribute. Examples include aircraft landing time
slots, tickets to entertainment events, and hotel rooms on a particular day. The
project methodology includes (1) empirical analysis of electronic markets to
understand the current state-of-art of models and technology, (2) design of
market structures and mechanisms, (3) design of data delivery systems, (4)
design of market software agents, and (5) implementation of project results.
Before time-sensitive goods can be extensively traded in eMarketplaces, new
market mechanisms (with extensions of economic theory), and rapid response IT
technologies (with associated efficient optimization algorithms) are needed to
handle these goods in an online environment, and to enable market agents (buyers
and sellers) to reach "equilibrium" quickly. Integrating time-sensitive goods in
disparate electronic marketplaces will require new advances in the design of
data delivery systems, and will require significant changes in the fundamental
propositions governing online agent behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
