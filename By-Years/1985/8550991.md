The goal of this project is the improvement of science and mathematics teaching
in the New York City area through the establishment of a Center for Science and
Mathematics Education. The Center, established at City College, will coordinate
the specific project activities aimed at accomplishing its goal. These
activities include: 1) leadership training workshops for principals and science
administrators in order to train, motivate, and support their teachers, 2) in-
service science and mathematics courses for elementary and secondary teachers to
increase their content background and enhance their pedagogical skills, and 3)
conferences for educators on topics in science and mathematics education to
provide participants up-to-date information on specialized topics and to provide
practical support for their teaching efforts. A bimonthly Newsletter, funded by
local sources, will be published to provide a teaching information exchange.
There will be two, two-day Leadership Training workshops held in the fall of
each year, one for elementary principals and science administrators, and one for
junior high principals and science administrators. Follow-up workshops will be
held in the spring. Twelve courses will be offered in pairs, one course being
content-oriented and the second emphasizing the educational applications of that
content at the appropriate grade level. Two pairs of courses are offered for
elementary teachers, one for either elementary or junior high, two for junior
high, and one for high school teachers. The topics covered are physical science,
computer programming and applications, and mathematics. One hundred and eighty
teachers will be able to take advantage of these courses which will be offered
during the academic year and during the summer. The conferences will be held in
the fall and spring of each school year.
