Through a two phase endeavor, this investigation is initiating a model program
that will make the disabled aware of their potential to become engineers, and is
establishing innovative means to bring these individuals into the engineering
education system. Phase one special education personnel in private and public
schools and others who have direct interaction with the disabled to explain the
goals of the program and enlist their aid in achieving these goals. %%% In
similar fashion, engineering firms and profesesional organizations are being
approached to make a commitment to the education and employment of the disabled.
%%% The work of the second phase involves exploring for ways to make engineering
education possible and attractive to the disabled. Recruited tools are being
divised, from interactive computer programs to incentive booklets. An outreach
seminar is being planned whose main purpose will be to make an engineering
career for the handicapped a reality in the minds of the disabled and those who
work with the disabled. %%% A third phase is planned and would see the model
program expanded to a nationwide forum. The lessons learned and knowledge gained
in the current project will be transferred to concerned persons thought regional
centers at strategic locations in the United States.
