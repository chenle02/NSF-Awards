Abstract:

This project aims to develop theoretical ideas in mathematical statistics and
probability that will be of genuine use to scientific practitioners. The current
proposal concerns five major projects: a detailed look at Markov Chain Monte
Carlo methods, in particular the eigenvalue theory that determines rates of
convergence; the application of MCMC theory to truncated data; inferential
theory for scatterplot smoothers, including the relative efficiencies of
competing criteria adaptively selecting the "window width" of the smoother, and
also the cost of adaptation on the accuracy of the smoother; random matrix
theory and its connection with the zeros of Riemann's zeta function; and finally
conversion curve methods for improving the accuracy of bootstrap confidence
intervals. The connecting theme for the five projects is the combination of
mathematical theory with computer-intensive algorithms.
