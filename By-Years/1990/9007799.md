This work is aimed at investigating the dynamics of interactions of 10 to 100
electron volt hyperthermal ions with surfaces. Topics to be addressed include
projectile energy loss as a function of incident mass and scattering geometry;
rainbow angle positions as a function of potential and projectile energy; peak
broadening caused by vibrational motion in the target; sticking and embedding;
and energy transfer and damage thresholds.
