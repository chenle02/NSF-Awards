Proposal Number: OPP-9707783 Principal Investigator: Chris Elfring ABSTRACT The
National Research Council (NRC), through its Polar Research Board (PRB),
proposes to establish a Committee on Science Priorities for NSF's Arctic Natural
Sciences Program. The Arctic Natural Sciences Program (ANS), administered by the
Arctic Section of NSF's Office of Polar Programs, is a multidisciplinary program
that provides grants to support state-of-the-art research in space sciences,
atmospheric sciences, biology, geology, glaciology, and oceanography in the
Arctic. The program coordinates with related NSF programs and many grants
involve collaborations with other agencies and nations. The committee would be
charged to gain an understanding of the program's operation and current research
priorities and provide guidance on setting future priorities given the diverse
scientific issues that fall within the purview of the ANS program. The committee
would suggest improvements to the program's management strategy; suggest ways to
compare proposals in widely diverse fields; and suggest how to judge which
proposals are best-suited for the ANS program versus other, related NSF
programs. The committee also would suggest mechanisms to facilitate interagency
and international collaborations. The committee would solicit wide input from
the arctic research community, perhaps via an electronic mail or other
mechanism. The study would be carried out by a committee of approximately 8
experts having a range of experience in the arctic natural sciences, including
space sciences (mesosphere and up), atmospheric sciences (including
stratosphere), oceanography (including chemical and physical), glaciology
(including past climates), biology (including ecology, bio-oceanography, and
related areas), and geology/geophysics, as well as the ability to grasp concepts
in varied disciplines.
