Dynamics Days is an annual interdisciplinary conference designed to stimulate
interactions among researchers in nonlinear science. Dynamics Days 2012 will
cover a broad range of topics, including pattern forming systems,
characterization and control of nonlinear systems, synchronization of nonlinear
systems, and complex biological systems. The meeting will be hosted by the
Department of Physics, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
the Institute for Physical Science and Technology and the Institute for Research
in Electronics and Applied Physics of the University of Maryland, College Park.
This year's schedule is designed to provide a broad overview of nonlinear
dynamics and will include tutorial talks which will be geared toward introducing
opportunities in nonlinear dynamics.

Dynamics Days has been very successful at providing a forum for bringing young
scientists, especially graduate students and postdoctoral students, together
with experts from a variety of fields. Although the regular attendees are
primarily in the fields of mathematics and physics, the interdisciplinary field
of nonlinear dynamics has continued to grow rapidly in recent years, expanding
to other disciplines. Researchers from physics, mathematics, chemistry,
engineering, biology, and the social sciences are expected to attend Dynamics
Days 2012.
