Understanding conceptual change in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) education is critical for helping students develop deep
understandings of complex ideas and models, and thus, for supporting
undergraduate students' success and persistence in STEM fields. This EHR Core
Research (ECR) project in the area of STEM learning will explore how multiple
factors influence college biology students' conceptual change regarding
evolution by natural selection. The project team will gather data from
introductory biology courses across the United States, and expects to analyze
responses from a total of about 14,000 students. The results of the analyses
will provide evidence to support the refinement of theories of conceptual change
regarding evolution by natural selection, suggest new ways to promote conceptual
change in the classroom, and provide a model for future studies of conceptual
change in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The categories of variables that the
project team will investigate include students' motivation, epistemic beliefs,
cognitive and metacognitive strategies, formal operational reasoning, and
biology content knowledge. Students in each of 60 different participating
introductory biology classes will be administered the Conceptual Inventory of
Natural Selection (CINS), as well as three other instruments (in different
combinations) both pre- and post-instruction. This will support structural
equation modeling (SEM) analyses of how the variables influence conceptual
change in each individual class, as well as the development of an overarching
model summarizing the ways in which all variables investigated influence
undergraduate students' conceptual change in introductory biology.
