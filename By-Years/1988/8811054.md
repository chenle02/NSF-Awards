This action provides funds for the analysis of data from pictures taken of high
energy particle interactions in bubble chambers and participation in the
preparation of experiments using electronic techniques. These experiments use
the facilities at Fermilab and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The
bubble chamber experiments involve the interactions of photons and neutrinos
with matter and have been particularly useful in studying the properties of
particles containing heavy quarks. The bubble chamber experiments are the last
and most definitive to be performed in the United States.
