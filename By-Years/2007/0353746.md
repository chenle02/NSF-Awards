The University of Akron establishes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site affiliated with the College of Polymer Science. Ten undergraduate
students, with a background in a physical science, engineering, computer science
or mathematics, are recruited every year for a 12-week summer research
experience. Students participate in research projects within the
multidisciplinary field of polymer science, including theory, modeling and
simulation of polymer properties; polymer synthesis and kinetics; and physical
properties of polymers. Students also participate in weekly research meetings,
visits to industrial laboratories, and in a final research symposium where they
present the results of their work.
