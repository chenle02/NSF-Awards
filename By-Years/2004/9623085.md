Swanson 96-23085 This proposal supports the work of Professor I. Swanson to work
on problems in commutative algebra. She intends to study how, in Noetherian
rings of prime characteristic, primary deomposiiton varies with Frobenius
powers. She also hopes to develop algorithms for calculating adjoints and cores
when the ring is not two dimensional. This research is on the boundary between
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Both fields arose from the classical
problem of studying mathematical objects defined in the plane by the simplest of
equations, namely polynomials. Today, the fields use methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely are extensively
used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
