This research is on test methods for finding process parameter faults in
memories embedded in advanced technology chips. The effect of threshold voltage
variation and noise (e.g., leakage, charge sharing, crosstalk, etc.) on the
functionality of a memory cell is modeled (using circuit simulation and
analysis) in terms of read/write error margins and variance of access delays.
Algorithms for failure modes in memories, based on fault models generated from
process and circuit studies, are being developed. Tools based on them allow
functional and parametric testing of static RAMs. The issues of testing gigabit
stretchable DRAMs with multi-valued address decoding schemes are being analyzed
from an algorithmic standpoint. Fault models, pertaining to these analog-like
components, and memory testing algorithms are being explored. One methodology
for testing high-density SRAMs and multivalued stretchable DRAMs with mixed-mode
circuits, uses the measure of the harmonic distortion of a pure sinusoidal input
signal in order to extract detection and diagnosis information for various
technology, parametric and layout-related faults in the memory chip.
