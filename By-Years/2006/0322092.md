This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project will develop
and test remote radio frequency measurements for integrity monitoring of gas
fuel-pipelines. This novel application of&lt;br/&gt;RF measurements uses the
pipe as a transmission line. Antennas launch pulses that travel inside the pipe,
without disturbing the transported fluid. Pulses reflect-off
obstructions/breaches in the pipe and are measured by distributed low-cost
receivers to locate the fault. Phase-I research demonstrated the proof of
concept for this automated monitoring system and defined interfaces with an
emergency management telecommunications system that provides notification to the
pipeline response team and warning to affected residents/businesses - all within
minutes of the event. The objectives for Phase-II are to develop an engineering
model FloWatch system, to install this system in an operating gas pipeline, and
to perform end-to-end testing of the sensors and emergency notification system.
&lt;br/&gt; The outcome of this research will lead to a marketable product,
which when implemented by pipeline operators, can save millions of dollars
annually in pipeline spills and avert potential loss of life and property.
Further benefits will result through improved pipeline operations that will
result in lower-cost and reliable delivery of energy needs for businesses,
industry and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;
