Syringomycin is a peptide phytotoxin produced by the bacterium, Pseudomonas
syringae pv. syringae. The toxin is a major virulence factor in many plant and
crop diseases. Previous work supported by NSF showed that syringomycin's primary
site of action is the host plasma membrane. Several plasma membrane- associated
events caused by syringomycin were demonstrated including changes in K+ efflux,
Ca2+ influx, H+-pump ATPase activity, membrane charge potential, and protein
phosphorylation. Also, the structure of syringomycin was determined. Further
studies on the mechanism of action of the syringomycin are being pursued. The
studies exploit the action of the toxin on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Preliminary studies revealed that syringomycin affects S. cerevisiae in ways
which resemble its effects on plant plasma membranes. Syringomycin-resistant,
temperature-sensitive mutants are being isolated and characterized. The normal
versions of the defective genes are being isolated by gene complementation
techniques and characterized. These genes encode proteins that function in the
syringomycin response pathway. Revertants with second-site suppressor mutations
are being studied to determine how the identified gene products interact in the
syringomycin response pathway. This project is significant because it determines
how an important, ubiquitous bacterial phytotoxin causes plant disease and
provides basic information about the function, structure and regulation of the
plant cell plasma membrane.
