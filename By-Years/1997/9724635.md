This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of Florida to acquire a 400 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with solids and imaging accessories. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) synthesis of photoactive transition metal-containing polymers, (2) dynamics
and ordering of confined molecular systems, (3) synthesis of solid acids and
characterization by NMR and `Cal-ad`, (4) the interaction of fluorinated
molecules with metal oxides, (5) microporous solids: clathrates and zeolites,
and (6) molecular motion in biomolecular solids. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
