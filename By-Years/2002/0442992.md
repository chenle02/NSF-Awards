Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing a suite of dynamically
linked instructional materials, tutorials, demonstrations, experiments,
graphical interfaces, and computational and visualization tools for improving
statistics and probability education. Intellectual merit: The proposed
interactive tools target both lower and upper division undergraduate students
including those enrolled in a wide range of cross-listed service courses in
disciplines such as economics, biochemistry, education, engineering,
biomedicine, neuroscience and psychology. The project team combines faculty
expertise in computational and statistical modeling research and open-source
software development, with staff in a Center for Teaching Statistics and an
office for Educational Technology Service. Broader impacts: Undergraduate and
graduate students figure prominently in the design, implementation, and
validation of the resources, via an iterative cycle of design-and-analysis with
instruction, training and learning taking place simultaneously. The Web-based
nature of the resources also facilitates the involvement of a diverse population
of users. Collaborative efforts with other institutions further bolster the
functionality and effectiveness of the resource as a contemporary pedagogical
instrument. Finally, the materials serve to advance understanding in the general
population of basic probability and statistical modeling techniques, and data
and result interpretation for informed and scientific decision-making on social,
biomedical and environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;
