The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) proposes to investigate the
feasibility of developing an online magazine in the history of mathematics and
its use in teaching, with a target audience of grades 9-14 teachers of
mathematics. The online magazine, a new component of the NSF-funded Mathematical
Sciences Digital Library, is intended to be a living, growing resource, and will
incorporate features such as hyperlinks and interactive graphics. A range of
materials will be included in the magazine including expository articles,
translations of original sources, historical problems, a mathematical calendar,
reviews of books and websites, teaching materials and translations of articles
previously published in other
languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
