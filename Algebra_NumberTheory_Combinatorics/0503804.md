The principal investigator intends to prove new subconvex bounds for
automorphic L-functions or improve on existing subconvex bounds. Such bounds
reflect the arithmetic nature of their source objects as they cannot be derived
from simple analytic principles. In return, they provide the key to the solution
of several deep diophantine problems addressing equidistribution phenomena.
Proving these bounds unconditionally also sheds light on the Generalized Riemann
Hypothesis as they are consequences of it. In the focus of the proposal are
families of GL(2) x GL(1) and GL(2) x GL(2) type. The techniques leading to
subconvex bounds for these families have so far been restricted to the field of
rational numbers or holomorphic forms. The principal investigator will try to
extend these techniques to totally real number fields and non-holomorphic forms.

This proposal belongs to the theory of integers. Because of their fundamental
character, integers are at the source of many theoretical and practical
constructions including algorithms for secure communication through the internet
or efficient communication through a noisy channel. Automorphic forms and their
L-functions are among the mathematical objects that make the hidden symmetries
of integers visible. It has been observed, but not proved rigorously in a single
instance, that the zeros of every automorphic L-function are distributed in a
very special way. This observation is the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis which
implies many otherwise unknown properties of the integers. For various important
questions a weaker hypothesis, concerning the size of L-functions, suffices. The
principal investigator intends to prove new instances of this weaker hypothesis.
