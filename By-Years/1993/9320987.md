9320987 Kozik Canisius College Dr. Mariusz M. Kozik, Chemistry Department,
Cansius College, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for research into the properties, activation, of
electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide when complexed to heteropolyoxide
ions. Complexes of carbon dioxide with a variety of heteropolyoxides containing
tungsten and another metal will be prepared and characterized. The
electrochemical properties of these complexes will be examined by cyclic
voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis. Electrochemical reduction of
carbon dioxide to methane will be attempted at potentials close to the
thermodynamic value of -0.24 v. Carbon dioxide is a cheap, easily obtained, non-
toxic material which theoretically can be converted to a variety of useful
products including hydrocarbon fuels. However, its use has been limited because
it is an unreactive compound which is difficult to activate. In this project a
new electrochemical method will be developed to cleanly convert of carbon
dioxide to methane in an energy efficient manner.
