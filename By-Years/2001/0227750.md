Dr. Steven G. Greenbaum has mentored minority students in physics for more than
twenty years. His academic advisorship and mentoring role has supported the
graduation of Afro-American physicists from MIT and from other prestigious
schools. Also noteworthy is the outcome of his students professionally. His
evidence of commitment is embedded in the achievement of his students. The
emotional support and encouragement for minority students to study science has
been meritorious; the work with minorities in science is, in general, remarkable
and likely to be continued.
