Everyday objects like paper clips, pencils, and aluminum cans are taken for
granted, yet their design and production present tremendous challenges to
engineers in terms of working tolerances, quality control, and economy of
manufacture, not to mention aesthetics and ergonomics. Thus, these simple
artifacts provide ideal case studies for introducing students to a wide variety
of engineering concepts, principles, and problems in already familiar and
readily accessible real-world contexts. In this project, a variety of analytical
and computer models of simple objects like paper clips will be developed, in
conjunction with desk-top experiments, to introduce students to the methods and
limitations of design, analysis, and development in engineering. The simplest
models will be accessible to firstyear students, yet will necessarily involve
enough restrictive assumptions and simplifications to make them suitable also
for refinement, extension, and further use in subsequent courses. The analytical
and computer models, as well as the complementary desk-top experiments employing
actual paper clips and, to the extent permitted by the scope of the project,
other manufactured objects, will be suitable to introduce and guide individual
and group design exercises focused on the redesign and improvement of the
artifacts explored. In addition to the development and use of models for design
and redesign, this project will also develop larger contexts into which to
present the design problem, so that students will be exposed to other aspects of
product realization, including marketing and sales considerations. In this way,
the analytical aspects of engineering will not be presented in a vacuum.
Finally, the pedagogical resources developed in this project will be presented
in articles for wide dissemination and use throuqhout the enqineerinq
curriculum.
