Computer aided design and simulation of a large class of separation processes
involving many components (e.g., distillation and absorption) is currently
carried out under the assumption that the various components are always at exact
thermodynamic equilibrium at every part of the equipment. This is not always
true, and frequently the separation is controlled by the rate of transfer of
components from one fluid to another. Yet, presently, models based on mass
transfer are not available for use in design and simulation. This proposal
outlines a research program to develop and test such rate-dependent models. If
successful, the results will have a potential impact on a large number of
multicomponent separation operations. Further, the results of this study will be
useful in evaluating the current status of design concepts based on rate-
controlled separation processes and in determining whether currently available
experimental data are sufficient to proceed with the development of design
procedures such as the ones suggested in this proposal.
