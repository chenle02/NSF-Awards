Professor Slodkowski will investigate the structure of envelopes of holomorphy
where he is especially interested in problems related to their construction and
univalence. Some questions of existence of analytic discs and varieties in
envelopes of holomorphy and of the uniqueness of Levi-flat hypersurfaces will
also be addressed. Finding answers to these questions should be very helpful in
solving a second set of problems involving the extendibility of holomorphic
motions and related questions concerning the holomorphic axiom of choice. The
areas under investigation here involve the theory of functions of several
complex variables. The structure imposed by requiring that a function of several
complex variables be differentiable (as in elementary calculus) is a very rich
one. In particular, given a set in which such a function is defined, it is
important to know the largest set to which all such functions can be extended
maintaining their differentiability. This "envelope of holomorphy" is not well
understood and one of Professor Slodkowski's projects is to develop methods to
find it.
