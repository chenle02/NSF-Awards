9409840 Dunn This Research Initiation Proposal supports a tightly coupled
experimental/theoretical program in the linear and nonlinear constitutive
response of piezoelectric ceramics. Emphasis is placed on the role played by
microstructural-level phenomena which occur at the grain and sub-grain levels
and which result in a constantly evolving microstructure which then influences
the overall constitutive response. A constitutive model that is
thermodynamically sound and which incorporates the micromechanics as internal
variables will be developed. ***
