The current project, Meeting the Challenge for STEM Gender Diversity, will
strengthen the capacity of higher education institutions and federal agencies to
work collaboratively to recruit and retain women in the academic STEM
disciplines. Through a carefully constructed protocol, grounded in
organizational change theories, a national framework will be developed and
utilized as a tactical blueprint for: 1) assessing family friendly policies and
practices according to levels of demonstrated institutionalization and
inclusivity, and 2) promoting and implementing a flexible workplace environment
at the level of precision required for dramatic change and sustained impact.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance: This project will set
in motion the deep and pervasive adjustments to institutional policies,
procedures and processes that will ensure that all STEM faculty, particularly
women and women of color, will be represented in numbers equal to or higher than
parity with pools from which they are selected.
