Several applications over the Internet, such as script and cryptographic
processing, database management, and multimedia processing, involve processing
of secure, computation-intensive, multimedia, and high-bandwidth information.
These applications require large-scale scientific computing, reliability, and
high-bandwidth at the server nodes. This joint project between two campuses of
the University of California (Davis and Riverside) develops a scalable
distributed software system architecture, where the major functionalities
required in the Internet servers are partitioned, and resources are allocated on
the basis of their needs. The amount of computation and architectural
requirements of these applications are determined through actual execution on
servers. New techniques are developed to handle system-level issues like
admission control, functionality distribution, content management, traffic
management, and dynamic reconfiguration of resources, inter-process
communication, and lightweight I/O. They are implemented on a prototype system,
which is built using a combination of the available off-the-shelf components and
special-purpose devices. The outcome of the project will impact the development
and management of future large-scale Internet servers. The project is conducted
in collaboration with researchers at Intel Corporation, and would have a
potential for future technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
