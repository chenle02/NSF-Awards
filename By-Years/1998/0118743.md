Force feedback devices, or haptic interfaces, have the potential to increase the
qualityof human-computer interaction by adding the sense of touch. However,
there are still few practical force feedback applications, due in large part to
the stringent computational requirements of haptic rendering. In order to
maintain a high fidelity system, haptic update rates must be as high as 1000 Hz,
rather than the 30 Hz updates for graphical displays. This is especially
challenging for 6-degree of freedom (DOF) haptic devices which are used to
display forces and torques for arbitrary pairs of objects. This requires
accurate contact determination and contact force and torque computation of all
collision points in less than a millisecond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
focuses on three aspects of high fidelity haptic display or ''virtual touch''.
The first goal includes developing new geometric and physically-based algorithms
that can improve the state of the art by more than an order of magnitude, in
addition to the expected improvements in processor speed and computing power
over that time. This will be based on hybrid spatial data structures,
simplification hierarchies, multi-resolution representations, bounded error
approximations, and massively parallel rasterization hardware. The second goal
is to pursue applications that can benefit significantly from the use of high-
fidelity 6-DOF haptic displays. This includes virtual prototyping of nano-
structures, haptic visualization of biological interaction between molecules,
maintenance analysis and interactive modeling and painting. The third goal is
the evaluation of 6-DOF haptic rendering systems as a tool for human-computer
interface. This will be done in collaboration with Boeing, Sandia Labs, and
Sensable Technologies. If successful, the proposed research will provide
enabling algorithms and a prototype software system for designing a high-
fidelity virtual touch system.&lt;br/&gt;
