This research uses laboratory experimental methods to study behavior in a
variety of computerized economic decision-making environments. All of the
experiments use human subjects acting under a cash reward structure. The
resulting experimental data are used to evaluate the predictive ability of
models of individual and aggregate market behavior as well as the sensitivity of
market outcomes to variations in the institutional rules that define the
structure of market information flows. The performance of three distinct trading
institutions (double auction, posted offer, and sealed bid-offer auction) are
studied in markets where the competitive equilibrium is nonstationary. Other
topics of inquiry include: the effects of introducing short selling
opportunities into asset markets where speculative "price bubbles" are regularly
observed; the ability of asset futures markets to convey and aggregate a
sequence of exogenous information injections that reduce uncertainty regarding
the asset's value at the end of spot market trading; tests of price expectation
formation models using price forecast data from both market and non-market
experimental environments; and tests of the competitive model using a hostile
parameterization of an experiment where two commodities are traded concurrently
via the double-auction institution.
