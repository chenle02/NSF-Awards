Prime the Pipeline Project (P3): Putting Knowledge to Work is designed to engage
high school students as active members of a scientific village comprised of
students, math and science teachers, university faculty, undergraduate student
mentors, industry professionals, and scientists. Participants include a cohort
of up to 60 grade 10 high school students and 50 high school teachers (half
science and half math), from the Phoenix, Arizona east valley. Village members
work collaboratively on problems that are of high interest, mirror the
workplace, and have social significance with solutions that require the
application of skills and concepts from STEM and workplace technologies while
drawing upon a repertoire of problem solving heuristics. Students stay in the
science village for 3 years beginning in grade 10 and participate in combined
after school and campus-based academic-year programs and summer institutes. Math
and science teachers participate as both learners and co-leaders. Teachers are
engaged in professional development Connections Courses that focus on the key
concepts and technologies needed to solve problems, strategies for assessing
student understanding, and STEM career opportunities. Business and industry
partners such as Intel and Microchip provide support by co-developing integrated
projects, mentoring youth and teachers, and offering summer apprenticeships. The
project website includes participant updates while encouraging communication and
providing career advice. The P3 project's innovative design provides an
opportunity to determine the effectiveness and transformative nature of a
sustained 3-year scientific village approach as a means to increase STEM majors.
