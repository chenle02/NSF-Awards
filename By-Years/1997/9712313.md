Sanford 9712313 An extensive survey of the Denmark Strait Overflow will
conducted in 1997 and 1998 using expendable current and conductivity-temperature
profilers and the towed transport meter to complement traditional hydrographic
measurements. The goal of the study is quantify the effects of bottom friction,
entrainment and hydraulic control on the overflow. An additional objective is to
identify the generation mechanism for eddies, especially the role of
conservation of potential vorticity as the flow descends the slope and the
growth of perturbations through baroclinic instability.
