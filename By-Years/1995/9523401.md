In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Farrar will continue to study the solvation of selected
cations by photodissociation in mass-selected solvated cluster ions. Alkaline
earth and early transition-metal cations will be solvated with variable numbers
of polar solvents such as NH3 or H2O. The solvation process will be assessed by
determining energies of low-lying electronic states and by vibronic analysis of
isotopic clusters of solvent. Two-color and photochemical hole-burning
experiments are proposed to examine thornier issues dealing with these broad
cluster spectra. Ab initio calculations will allow comparison of vibrational
frequencies in excited electronic states. The goal of this research is to
understand the steps involved when isolated atomic ions in the gas phase acquire
shells of solvent molecules, such as water, ammonia, or alcohol, in liquid or
solid phases. Such information is important, because different solvents have
varying affinities for a given ion, and these solvent shells can alter the
chemical and physical properties of the ion substantially. These studies have
application in understanding ion-molecules reactions which happen in the upper
atmosphere, for example, or during plasma deposition processes
