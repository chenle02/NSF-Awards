Williams College proposes to organize a workshop that focuses on developing and
disseminating new tools and curricula for undergraduate courses in distributed
systems and computer networks that leverage the resources available in publicly-
accessible testbeds. Given the ubiquity of distributed systems, it is imperative
that undergraduate computing education properly address their design and
implementation. A key challenge today in teaching distributed systems at the
college-level is providing students access to computing and networking resources
distributed across the country and world. Educators have an opportunity to fill
this gap using a variety of publicly-accessible testbed and cloud platforms now
emerging in academia and industry. The 20-30 workshop attendees will come from a
variety of institutions, including research universities, liberal arts colleges,
and industry. The goal of the workshop is to identify a set of teaching
materials that may be used at a broad cross-section of colleges and universities
to provide undergraduates with the necessary background and motivation to become
involved in systems research. The workshop will result in a report that details
the participants' findings, as well as a website that aggregates the relevant
educational material.&lt;br/&gt;
