The School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science of Polytechnic
University is continuing its undergraduate research program in the areas of
electrophysics and information systems. Students are recruited from a variety of
other schools, including primarily undergraduate institutions. The research
environment is enriched by additional undergraduate students funded from other
sources. Each participant has regular meetings with an individual faculty mentor
to plan work and review progress throughout the eleven week program. Project
topics in electrophysics include microwave-plasma interaction, propagation of
microwaves inside buildings and in urban radio channels, ultra-short pulsed
laser, computational electrophysics, and thin film devices. Information systems
include image communication, multivariable feedback control, wireless
information networks, robotics, adaptive filtering, target recognition in
infrared images, and digital signal processing. A monetary prize is awarded to
the best project.
