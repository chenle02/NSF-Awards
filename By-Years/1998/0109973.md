&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
develop a prototype instrument for measuring harmful bi-products of chlorination
in drinking water. These disinfection bi-products are subject to EPA
regulations. The Phase I project demonstrated that the concept of differential
UV absorption measurement, i.e. absorption before and after chlorination, is
suitable for the needed measurement. A pre-production prototype instrument will
be constructed during the Phase II project. This device shall employ a multi-
pass cell design using our novel dual-ratio technique that eliminates concerns
about long term drifts. The overall instrument architecture design and systems
design will be carried out prior to assembly of the full microprocessor-
controlled recording device. Extensive laboratory and field tests will be used
to review design changes before production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential
commercial applications of the instrument proposed may be used in
the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory or in-line at utilities. The market for the proposed
product is quite substantial as EPA regulations will result in the installation
of such devices at all utilities and drinking water facilities.&lt;br/&gt;
