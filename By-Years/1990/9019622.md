The proposed research is a continuation of studies on somatic mutation and
rapid genomic change in plants. Work accomplished under that previous grant
documented somatic variation in several plant species. Differences in ribosomal
DNA within clones of Solidago and somatic changes among a sexual progeny of
Taraxacum officinale in ribosomal DNA and alcohol dehydrogenase were detected.
In addition, the previous work documented such flexible genomes within Taraxacum
progeny which responded to environmental pressure. Finally, techniques were
developed for minisatellite DNA analysis of plant species and applied to somatic
variation among apples. The work proposed here will extend studies of rapid
genomic change by examining genomic changes in heat-shock as well as ribosomal
DNA genes in Brassica. The effect of genomic changes on plant phenotype and
fitness will also be determined. Studies of somatic variation will continue with
an analysis of minisatellite DNA variation within individuals of Pinus longaeva.
These proposed studies will provide fundamental data on the types and frequency
of somatic genetic variation in plant populations and determine the phenotypic
and fitness consequence of such changes. The results of this work will provide a
basis for assessing the importance of such somatic processes for the evolution
of plant species. Moreover, somatic variation occurs in all organisms, and has
been implicated in the normal aging process, as well as the development of
tumors. The proposed work will provide detailed information about the effect of
accumulated somatic variation, which could be of use in studying age-dependent
genetic changes in humans.//
