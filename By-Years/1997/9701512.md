Dobbin 9701512 This Doctoral Dissertation research examines the diffusion of
work and family policies in U.S. organizations between 1960 and 1996. It focuses
on three questions: (1) Which employers provide work/family benefits?, (2) Why
do organizations adopt work/family policies? and (3) What are the implications
of work/family policies for redefining gender relations and restructuring work
life? This project investigates work/family policies related to maternity leave,
parental and family leaves, childcare and elder care programs and flexibility
about the timing and location of work. Historical data will be collected by
surveying a stratified random sample of profit, non-profit, and public sector
organizations to get information on their personnel practices. Additional data
on why organizations adopt work/family policies will be collected from personnel
management literature and organizational documents (e.g., personnel manuals,
press releases, work/family brochures) to determine how work/family policies
affect organizations' social construction of gender and their understanding of
the boundaries between work and family. **** ??
