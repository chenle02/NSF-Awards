The goal of this project is to contribute to the development&lt;br/&gt;of a
national science and engineering academic workforce that&lt;br/&gt;includes the
full participation of women in all levels of faculty&lt;br/&gt;and academic
administration, particularly at the senior academic&lt;br/&gt;ranks, through the
transformation of institutional practices,&lt;br/&gt;policies, climate and
culture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, Hunter College will design and
implement a program &lt;br/&gt;to improve the institutional practices and
culture&lt;br/&gt;that affect the hiring, retention, promotion, salary,
and&lt;br/&gt;professional development of women in the natural and
social&lt;br/&gt;sciences. As part of the largest public urban university in
the&lt;br/&gt;nation, Hunter College will be a model for the other
CUNY&lt;br/&gt;colleges and for urban public universities generally. Goals
include: a) to develop,&lt;br/&gt;test, and disseminate measures for
identifying, measuring, and&lt;br/&gt;reporting hidden and subtle, as well as
visible and obvious,&lt;br/&gt;indicators of gender equity; b) to correct
unintended institutional&lt;br/&gt;practices that work against the advancement
of women scientists;&lt;br/&gt;c) to educate administrators and other
evaluators, via workshops and&lt;br/&gt;training manuals, about inadvertent
gender biases in evaluating&lt;br/&gt;and recognizing scientists' contributions
and about strategies&lt;br/&gt;for equalizing men's and women's ability to
advance; d) to develop&lt;br/&gt;interventions to advance junior and mid-level
women scientists&lt;br/&gt;via a sponsorship program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The&lt;br/&gt;overall mission
of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the&lt;br/&gt;participation of women in
the scientific and engineering&lt;br/&gt;workforce through the increased
representation and advancement of&lt;br/&gt;women in academic science and
engineering careers.
