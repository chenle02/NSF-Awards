9414615 Sahinidis This award provides funding for research toward an algorithm
for finding global solutions to nonconvex, nonlinear problem (NLPs) and mixed-
integer problems (MINLPs). The approach is based on the solution of a sequence
of convex underestimating subproblems generated by evolutionary subdivision of
the search region. The key components of the algorithm are new optimality-based
and feasibility-based range reduction tests. The former use known feasible
solutions and perturbation results to exclude inferior parts of the search
region from consideration, while the latter analyze constraints to obtain valid
inequalities. The algorithm integrates these devices with an efficient local
search heuristic. Nonlinear optimization is often useful in engineering design
for the selection of design parameters. If successful, the algorithm could
enable more optimal designs to be found more rapidly and at lower cost.
