Dr. Linda H. Doerrer, Department of Chemistry, Barnard College, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division
of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her work under a CAREER Award to
investigate transition metal fluoraryloxide anions, which are relevant to
industrial polymerization processes requiring weakly coordinating anions and the
general field of fluorous chemistry. A second area of study involves bulky
phosphine ligands that faciliate electron deficient coordination environments
and the binding of small molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration of
Professor Doerrer's research and education endeavors benefits from the
predominantly female environment at Barnard College and an ongoing international
collaboration at Oxford University that gives undergraduates at both
institutions an opportunity to engage in research in an international setting.
Professor Doerrer will organize and administer an outreach program for students
in grades 9-12 and their teachers to learn about the emerging area of
nanoscience at the Columbia University National Science and Engineering Center.
The PI will also revise advanced undergraduate laboratory courses at Barnard to
incorporate inorganic synthesis, and develop a new general chemistry course
designed for students with generally strong high school backgrounds, but
relatively weak chemistry preparation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
