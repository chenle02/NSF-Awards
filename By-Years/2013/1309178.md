The proposed project concerns several problems in geometric and quantum topology
in dimensions 3 and 4. Based on his recent work, the PI proposes an approach to
the A-B slice problem, a formulation of the topological 4-dimensional surgery
conjecture for non-abelian free groups. In recent years algebraic invariants
have been found for key examples of decompositions of the 4-ball, and the goal
is to combine them to formulate an obstruction to surgery in the context of the
A-B slice problem. The project also includes a number of problems in quantum
topology; some of them are motivated by the PI's recent work with Cooper on
categorification of the Jones-Wenzl projectors. Specific problems concern
algebraic structures underlying categorified spin networks and the colored Jones
polynomial, and an approach to categorification of 3-manifold invariants using
ideas related to localization. The PI's ongoing collaboration with physicist
Fendley is aimed at identifying higher categorical structures in the context of
quantum statistical mechanics.

Topology is the study of shapes that locally look like the Euclidean space.
Topological study of shapes in dimensions 3 and 4 is particularly important due
to connections with physics, and it became apparent in the 1980s that the
geometric classification in these "low" dimensions is a substantially more
difficult problem than that in dimensions greater than four. At the same time, a
wide array of tools and insights from other areas of mathematics and theoretical
physics is available for solving topological problems in three and four
dimensions. A part of this project will use such algebraic tools to address the
classification of large-scale 4-dimensional shapes. The relevant algebraic
invariants (in particular, the Milnor group) precisely encode the topological
information about the motion of strings in 3-space. Another part of this project
will explore interdisciplinary connections between Topology and Statistical
Mechanics, with expected applications in both fields.
