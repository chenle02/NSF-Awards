This action provides funds to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research for
NSF's share of this jointly funded research project, the principal investigator
of which is Dr. Gail McKoon of the Psychology Department of Northwestern
University. The research is concerned with reading; it focusses on the ways
information in memory can contribute to the inference processes that occur
during reading. One source of information for inference processes is short-term
memory for parts of a text that have just been read. When this information is
available, it allows, for example, inferences that decide the correct referent
of a pronoun, or inferences that relate causally two events described by the
text. The research will test the hypothesis that short-term memory information
can vary in its degree of salience and that this will affect inference
processes, so that more salient information is more easily used to form
inferences. A second hypothesis is that inference processes are controlled by
local coherence. Propositions that are in short-term memory together because
they are in the same small area of a text are said to be locally available. The
idea of local coherence is that these propositions will be connected to each
other only if the connections are required to make the local structure coherent.
A second line of research will examine the dependence of inference processes on
knowledge in long-term memory. Exploratory experiments will examine whether
inferences can be driven by the lexical structures of verbs. Other experiments
will examine the use of generic knowledge such as the meanings of words and the
sequences of actions that form typical events. Another set of experiments will
examine how the meanings of words are combined and how they are determined by
context. This research forms a part of a large body of ongoing research on how
people comprehend text that they read. It is relevant to such societal concerns
as assisting the growing number of children and adults who can read text
mechanically but cannot comprehend what they read to become truly literate.
