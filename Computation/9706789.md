Simon 9706789 The investigator collaborates with Prof. G. Buck, St. Anselm
College, to study knots and their applications. Knots are closed loops in space
that may be tangled in complicated and essential ways. While knots usually have
been studied as idealized one dimensional filaments, the focus here is on
"physical knots," knots made of real physical stuff, from rope to DNA or other
large flexible molecules. These are modeled as mathematical knots endowed with
physical like properties such as self repelling energy or thickness. The twin
goals of physical knot theory are to mathematically model and help understand
the real physical systems, and to use the physically inspired measures of knot-
complexity to develop novel methods for knot recognition and classification. The
specific targets of this project include: determining precise relations between
different measures of knot complexity, understanding critical points and the
configuration space of polygonal knots, understanding the connections between
parametrizations and topological properties of harmonic knots, extending knot
energy ideas to other structures such as graphs, modeling gel electrophoresis of
DNA loops, and using knot energies to help understand physics phenomena such as
self-radiating tubes and knotted vortices. Knotting and tangling happen at every
scale studied by science, from microscopic DNA loops to everyday rope to tangled
magnetic field loops in the solar corona. The investigators and their students
will study problems that are fundamental and arise in all the physical systems:
How are knots and tangles created? What mathematical properties of the physical
systems lead to knots becoming simplified or completely untangled? How do the
mathematical properties of different kinds of knots influence their physical
behavior? One focus task is to gain a better understanding of gel
electrophoresis of DNA loops, hence of the gel process itself; this is one of
the most important b iotechnology techniques, so a solid understanding is
important. The project requires powerful computing and visualization, so it will
train students, as well as stretch the technology, in these areas.
