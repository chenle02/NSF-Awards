Attempts are being made to determine the mechanism by which frog virus 3
selectively blocks host cell translation. To accomplish this it is planned to
identify and isolate the FV3 virion-associated translational inhibitor, to
determine the mechanism of FV3 mediated translational shut-off by identifying
where in initiation the translational defect occurs, and to determine whether
the 5' untranslated region of viral messages controls their translational
efficiency. During the past twenty years, the sequence of events and specific
components involved in eukaryotes have been determined and the importance of
translation control in gene expression has gained general accpetance. However,
despite advances in both areas, there remain significant gaps. For example the
precise roles for several eukaryotic initiation factors and function(s) of their
various subunits is not known. In light of this, it should be apparent that
model systems, of which FV3 is one, will be most important in advancing our
understanding of translation and translational control. Dr. Chinchar is well
qualified to carry out this research.
