The Varian A-1 well, drilled to approximately 1.5 km depth a few kilometers
northwest of Parkfield, California, presents an opportunity for analysis of
seismic signals close to the San Andreas fault zone at a location where a large
earthquake is predicted. The U.S. Geological Survey has committed funds to open
the well so that a seismometer array can be installed for seismic vertical
profiling. This project will result in the design, fabrication, purchase, and
assembly of a seismic sensor system to be installed in the Varian A-1 well. In
addition to its location close to the nucleation zone of major earthquakes, the
deep well is an excellent observatory site for sensitive measurements because it
is not subject to surface and near-surface seismic noises. This project will
contribute to a better understanding of earthquake-generating mechanisms and to
improved earthquake prediction capabilities.
