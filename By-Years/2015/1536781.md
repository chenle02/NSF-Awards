Ocean salinity has always been more challenging to measure than temperature, yet
is just as important to the density of seawater. At present it is inferred from
measurements of the electrical conductivity of seawater, as well as temperature
and pressure. An alternative approach is to use the optical refractive index,
but this requires very high sensitivity measurements, which here-to-fore have
been impractical. The refractive index is especially attractive because it is a
more direct measurement of the seawater density and salinity, and would provide
a measure of Absolute Salinity, instead of the conductivity-based Practical
Salinity, which has systematic errors due to the variations in the
concentrations of non-conductive nutrients. Salinity has emerged as an
especially important variable for understanding the global water cycle, and
since most rain originates by evaporation from the ocean, the salinity signals
it leaves behind are proving useful for seasonal predictions of rainfall on land
and for identifying long-term trends in the water cycle. Since water
availability is an issue of great societal concern, improved salinity
measurements have become an oceanographic priority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here an
approach to salinity measurements using the refractive index is described that
uses a multi-wavelength interferometer. A new high-speed analysis technique has
been invented (patent applied for) that combines the sensitivity of a
monochromatic interferometer with the absolute accuracy of a broad spectrum
instrument. Extensive use is made of fiber-optic components from the
telecommunications industry to achieve very low noise levels. This project will
construct and demonstrate a novel and practical sea-going interferometer to
directly measure the Absolute Salinity and achieve new levels of accuracy in
measuring the density gradients of the ocean.
