This project is designed to conduct a terrestrial Annelid and land snail
biodiversity survey of the northern and western Philippines that will provide
information on that nation's rapidly vanishing unique biota. The work will
contribute new information towards revisionary systematics of the perichaetine
megascolecid earthworms, and provide new knowledge of terrestrial leeches,
Enchytraied oligochaetes, and terrestrial gastropods of the Phillipine island
archipelago. Field work will consist of numerous collecting trips to the
remaining small areas of old-growth lowland and montane rainforest in the
northern and western parts of the country. The electronic products of the
research will include a web-searchable database on the Philippine Annelida, a
large archive of images, identification and study aids, and an interactive key
to the earthworms of the archipelago, including common exotic species.
