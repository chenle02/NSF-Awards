The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and the National Science Foundation
(NSF) will jointly organize a small invitation only workshop to explore an
integrated approach to nano-electronics from materials to systems to be held in
October 2014 at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai,
India. The primary goal of the Forum is to identify future research directions
for highly functional, space-limited, digital and analog systems that must
operate with extremely low energy consumption and utilize new physical
principles by exploring the fundamental science of future information
technologies. Leading academic and industry researchers from the US, Europe, and
Asia will attend this workshop, but only the US participants will receive
benefits of NSF support. The SRC is also seeking intellectual support from NSF
community to run the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the
outcome of the workshop, albeit somewhat technical in nature, is expectedly very
large. The potentially critical role of nano-electronics in future information
technologies cannot be underestimated. Thus, one of the several goals is to
explore novel approaches that may set the national agenda for research in this
domain possibly leading to new NSF programs in the future, as is also the case
with SRC. In the long run, the outcome will benefit the educational arena as
well via adoption of technical material in new courses and university
curriculum. To this end, in addition to the main scientific program, a tutorial
day for disseminating educational material will also be organized preceding the
workshop.
