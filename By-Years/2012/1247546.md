Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technologies have been proposed and researched for
15 years, yet only some relatively experimental systems are in operation today.
This research explores some essential but unexplored techno-economic aspects of
DSA that are crucial if these systems are to come to commercial reality. One
major thrust is an exploration of how substitutable different frequency bands
that these systems might use are with each other. Another major thrust is how a
firm that might be considering the use of DSA technologies can manage the
technical and financial risk inherent in them. To accomplish this, a fungibility
score based on mathematical models and agent-based simulations are developed to
evaluate the substitutability among spectrum bands to assist firms as well as
policymakers in assessing candidate bands for use in a DSA system. For risk
management, the project employs real options analysis to develop a set of risk
measures and mitigation strategies for technical and financial risk to assist
secondary users in DSA systems. This work will help policymakers develop better
guidelines for the industry. It will also help firms seeking to use DSA
technologies reason more clearly about which technical and financial choices are
best and why, providing guidelines for growth and job creation. The expected
outcomes of this project will include a set of tools that will enable entrants
into a secondary spectrum market to make decisions as well as for policy makers
to evaluate the factors that may influence their regulatory guidelines in order
to promote viable DSA markets.
