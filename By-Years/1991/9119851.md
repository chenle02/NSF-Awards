This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of photoelectrochemistry. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Bard and his students will pursue fundamental
investigations of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reactions at the
semiconductor/liquid interface. Three specific photoelectrochemical research
thrusts will be pursued, namely (1) the preparation, characterization, and study
of quantum particles and films of cadmium (II) and iron (IV) sulfides; (2)
studies of the influence of semiconductor surface structure on
photoelectrochemical efficiency using scanning tunneling microscopy and
tunneling spectroscopy techniques; and (3) preparation of new semiconductor
materials by photodeposition of metals on semiconductor single crystal,
polycrystalline film, and particle surfaces and by chemical vapor deposition and
homogeneous synthetic routes. %%% This research builds upon results obtained
under Dr. Bard's previous NSF grant, CHE-8805865. In addition to providing
fundamental insights into the processes that occur at the semiconductor/liquid
interface, this research is of particular interest in the application of
semiconductor-based systems for the utilization of solar energy in such areas as
the production of useful chemicals and the destruction of wastes.
