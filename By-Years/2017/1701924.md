Algebraic geometers study spaces that are (locally) defined by polynomial
equations. One powerful method of studying these spaces, which has seen exciting
recent developments, is the method of degenerations. Applying this method allows
to reduce complicated geometric objects to configurations of simple ones
replacing some geometric aspects by combinatorial ones. Such degenerations can
be useful for study of geometric problems: the very rough philosophy is that one
studies the combinatorics (i.e., the discrete data) of the pieces in order to
deduce things about the more complicated original space. The research supported
by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques, especially
those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces from
algebraic geometry. The main goal of tropical geometry is transforming questions
about algebraic varieties into questions about polyhedral complexes. A process
called tropicalization attaches a polyhedral complex to an algebraic variety.
The polyhedral complex, a combinatorial object, encodes some of the geometry of
the original algebraic variety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first main project
involves using new techniques from tropical geometry and combinatorial topology
to compute top-weight rational cohomology of the moduli space of curves, finding
explicit new cohomology classes therein. A complementary aspect of this project
is to develop stack-theoretic foundations for tropical moduli spaces. The second
project studies the geometry of Brill-Noether varieties of curves, i.e. moduli
spaces of linear series on curves. The approach builds on recent advances in the
moduli theory of limit linear series, and will yield a refined understanding of
Brill-Noether varieties. This project will also uncover further connections
between Brill-Noether theory and the combinatorics of graphs and Young tableaux.
These connections are then amplified in the third main direction of research,
which consists of several combinatorial investigations that will shed additional
light on the close connection between graphs and algebraic curves.
