Abstract ATM-941167 Stull The objective of this research is to explain
atmospheric exchange processes near the surface. Because the boundary layer has
finite thickness, processes at the bottom, in the interior, and the top of the
boundary layer interact to modulate the next exchange. We will develop theories,
gather new field data, and utilize existing data to study exchange processes at
these three levels. To investigate processes at the bottom, we will examine the
role of convective thermals in causing substantial surface transport during calm
wind conditions. A relevant application is to the equatorial western Pacific,
where heat and moisture fluxes contribute significantly to the global energy
budget, but which are not well explained by traditional drag laws. Thermals also
create a poorly-understood layer between the surface- layer and the mixed layer,
which we will study with a variety of airborne platforms and wind profilers.
Over heterogeneous topography, the boundary-layer top is not level. This causes
complex scalings in the boundary layer, and plays a major role in convective
cloud formation. We will investigate the levelness of the mixed-layer top with
field data and with theory.
