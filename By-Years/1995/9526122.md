9526122 Harrison Funds are provided to hold a workshop on "Sea Level Change" at
University of Miami in November, 1995. The workshop participants will discuss
various facets of sea-level change and the unresolved questions about the
various factors that can produce the observed signal of ca. 1.5 mm/year sea-
level rise indicated by tide-gauge records. Geodetic, gravity, physical
oceanographic, rheological and geological data on sea level will be reviewed and
an attempt will be made to assess both observational and modeling information.
Funds for the workshop are being provided jointly by NSF and NOAA. ***
