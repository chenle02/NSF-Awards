The investigators study the dynamical behavior of systems of difference and
differential equations that describe interacting populations with and without
genetic variation. Special consideration will be given to the onset of chaos and
of strange attractors, e.g., a period-doubling cascade to a strange attractor
that is forced by changing a single intraspecific parameter. The proposers will
attempt to reverse the onset of chaos by the periodic harvesting or seeding of a
population. These studies will include numerical experiments and analytical
arguments employing techniques such as stability theory, invariant set theory,
bifurcation and perturbation theory. The development of an ecosystem, whether
natural or managed, is affected by complex interactions among environmental and
genetic components. The proposed research will study mathematical models that
attempt to capture some of the essential features of these interactions. The
objectives of the research include understanding: (i) how environmental and
genetic parameters influence species coexistence and extinction; (ii) the onset
of chaotic fluctuations in the densities of ecosystem populations; and (iii) how
harvesting and seeding strategies affect ecosystem stability. Such knowledge may
help in maintaining biodiversity in natural ecosystems, in the management of
natural resources such as forests and lakes, and in the development of disease-
resistant crops.
