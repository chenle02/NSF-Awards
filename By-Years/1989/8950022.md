A two week workshop is being held at the U. S. Geological Survey Training Center
in Denver, CO, in conjunction with the State University of New York College at
Brockport. The workshop is for 25 faculty who teach courses with a Hydrology and
Water Resources Content. The workshop is bringing participants up-to-date on the
science of hydrology and those technologies used to measure, analyze, and
calculate hydrologic flows, surface and groundwater resources, and pollutant
loadings and consequences. The workshop is providing the faculty with the latest
in water resources information and instructional materials for their classroom
and encouraging them to use this information. The workshop is actually producing
resource materials suitable for students of introduction college courses in the
earth sciences. In addition, the faculty are being made aware of the extensive
hydrologic data base available through WATSTORE and electronic data sources that
can be used for both faculty and student research. The U.S. Geological Survey is
contributing its facilities and staff in support of this workshop.
