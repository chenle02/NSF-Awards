Optical imaging has had a tremendous impact on biological research and medical
applications and procedures. Among the various imaging techniques, multiphoton
fluorescence microscopy (MPM) has been used to image at significant depths
within the brain. MPM uses a laser source to excite fluorescent molecules tagged
to specific cells. When these molecules are excited, they emit light of a
certain color that can be collected to produce an image. The goal of this
research is to increase imaging speed and quality by synchronizing the
excitation of the fluorescent molecules with the collection of the emitted
light. By synchronizing the excitation and collection, the light is more
efficiently collected, enabling faster imaging speed with better image quality.
This project aims to build the synchronization system and will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr. Tzu-Ming Liu at the National Taiwan University in Taiwan.
Dr. Liu's group specializes in high-speed imaging and has developed and tested
high-speed synchronization systems.

Synchronizing the laser source and collection is advantageous for imaging deep
within scattering materials such as brain. Currently, imaging depth is limited
by the sample's thermal damage threshold, corresponding to a maximum allowable
average power. For deeper imaging, the peak power must be increased. Now, to
remain below the damage threshold, the repetition rate of the laser source must
be decreased, reducing the imaging speed. With synchronization, only a few
pulses per pixel (~5) are required to produce a clear image, compared to ~100
pulses per pixel without synchronization. With fewer pulses per pixel required
to produce an image, this synchronization system will enable faster deep-brain
imaging. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National
Science Council of Taiwan.
