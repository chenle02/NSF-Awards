This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University purchase laser equipment. This
equipment will be used in the following research activities: High Resolution
Laser Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Molecular Ions and van der Walls Cluster
Ions, Laser Multiphoton Resonant Ionization Detection of Electron Stimulated
Desorption, Neutral Angular Distributions, Rotational and Vibrational Relaxation
of Diatomic Molecules in High Temperature Gases, High Resolution Studies of Line
Profiles in Coherent Anti-Strokes Raman Scattering, and Laser Prepared State
Selected Atomic Collisions. Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and
nearly monochromatic electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is used in
chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the dynamics of proteins and
nucleic acids to photoelectron transfer processes, and from interfacial
chemistry to picosecond pulse shaping. Lasers are also useful in optics,
communications, and engineering.
