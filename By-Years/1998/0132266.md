This is a SGER project to explore the possibility of remote sensing of large
strain gauge arrays, which may be &lt;br/&gt;embedded in building walls and
bridges, for continuous or on-demand monitoring of the structure's
health&lt;br/&gt;condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The power handling
capabilities of a chip consisting of active analog vlsi transistorized bridge
circuits,&lt;br/&gt;which determines the state of the strain gauge will be
investigated, Initially the commercially available&lt;br/&gt;gauge products will
be used as an arm in the active bridge that will be sent to mosis for
fabrication into a &lt;br/&gt;vlsi chip. The attenuation characteristics of
structural materials such as reinforced concrete are also to be determaned as
well ass a means of transmitting data into and out of the embedded bridge. As a
preliminary proof of concept the remote system will be mounted on the exterior
of a wall whereas longer range studies&lt;br/&gt;will incorporate it embedded
inside of walls.
