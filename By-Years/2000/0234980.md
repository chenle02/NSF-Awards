This project will establish an Internet database of food web, which describe the
trophic structure and function of ecological networks, combined with tools that
will increase the ability of scientists and students to exchange and analyze
information about the networks. The database design will be extensible to other
ecological interactions and network types. The content will focus on trophic
interactions among organisms and also bioenergetic parameters that enable the
modeling of network dynamics. These biocomplexity informatics activities serve
the user interested in network theory relating to biological and non-biological
systems. The project involves an interdisciplinary collaboration in ecology,
informatics, computer science and information technology. In addition to San
Francisco State University, the Santa Fe Institute and the National Center for
Ecological Analysis and Synthesis are involved. Broader impacts include
establishing an interdisciplinary interdepartmental collaboration at a minority
inner-city public university and increasing the participation of
underrepresented minorities in ecology and computer science.
