This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance new
real-time tracking technologies that increase the efficiency and reduce the
costs of container shipping across the world. The container shipping industry
underpins the modern supply chain and represents a $1.5 B market. The proposed
solution introduces 5G internet-of-things to tracking in worldwide shipping by
demonstrating performance in the dirty, complex, and highly-cluttered
environments of repair facilities and terminals crowded with container
stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project will be the
continued exploration of backscattered mm-wave radio frequency identification
(RFIDs) for localization and communication. In addition, although hardware and
standards used for standard ultra-high frequency RFID-based localization systems
have benefited from decades of improvements, methods appropriate for higher-
frequency methods are virtually unexplored and feature radically different
challenges. This effort will advance the tag and reader hardware and software,
followed by optimization of the standard for the concurrent localization and
communications with mm-wave backscatter tags. Finally, the project will conduct
verification and validation of the mm-RFID system's mechanical and functional
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
