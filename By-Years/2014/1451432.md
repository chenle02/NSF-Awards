Genetically-encoded reporters of neural activity are a transformative tool for
understanding brain function because they allow for the simultaneous measurement
of activity across many neurons defined by genetic and anatomical criteria. The
current generation of such reporters use light to signal activity, which limits
their ability to be used deep in brain tissue and across the full range of
neuronal activity. The goals of the project are to overcome these limitations by
developing reporter proteins that can be engineered to emit unique electrical or
magnetic signals in response to neural activity. The project will also develop
sensors that are optimized for detecting these signals from individual neurons
in intact brain tissue in the freely-behaving animal. The proposed
'electrogenetic' toolbox will allow neural activity to be recorded with high
fidelity from defined cell types across the entire physiological range of
neuronal firing rates, from any location in the mammalian brain, and in the
freely-behaving animal. This strategy leverages existing and widely available
technology for recording electromagnetic signals in the brain, and thus has the
potential to be rapidly adopted for a wide range of neuroscience applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a new strategy for measuring
neural activity from genetically-targeted neurons in the intact brain. An
interdisciplinary team of investigators will first use gene therapy techniques
to express candidate proteins in particular neurons, then will screen for
electrical or magnetic signals using conventional electrodes or nanoscale
magnetometer probes. Understanding how neurons of a particular type are
activated in the behaving animal is crucial for understanding the neural basis
of sensation, cognition and behavior. Indeed, the lack of tools for
interrogating identified neurons while they are in action is a major impediment
to understanding functional neural circuits in the brain. In addition to
breaking this impasse in basic science, a potential broader impact of this
project is that the tools to be developed in this proposal may provide
information leading to improved diagnosis and treatment of nervous system
disorders including mental illness, autism, addiction and epilepsy.
