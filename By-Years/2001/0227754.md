This award is to the Middle Tennessee State University to support the activity
described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the
Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners
include the Middle Tennessee State University (Lead Institution), Austin Peay
State University, Tennessee State University, Tennessee Technological
University, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Oakland High School, Riverdale
High School, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Tennessee Department of Health,
Communicable and Environmental; Disease Services, Tennessee Wildlife Resources
Agency, BioVentures Inc, Esoterx Center of Innovative Research, Orchid Cellmark,
Tennessee Biotechnology Association. The program includes: establishment of
training programs; provision of equipment and materials; development of
laboratories for teachers to encourage the use of hands-on biotechnology
exercises in science curricula; establishment of internships for teachers to
work in the partner companies; establishment of a seminar course for students
and company employees in biotechnology; and enhancement of biotechnological
growth by developing and applying novel sensors in microarray technology.

Currently there are more than 50 biotech companies in the region that have
started with research done at the regional universities. This proposed effort
will provide the workforce to make and keep these companies competitive in the
biotech industry. It will also provide the workforce for additional jobs created
by the regional university research enterprise. These jobs will have
considerably higher salaries than the traditional jobs in the region. The
academic institutions involved serve traditionally underrepresented groups. In
addition minority students will be involved in this effort.
