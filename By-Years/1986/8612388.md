The program is based on having senior engineers from industry present lectures
on 10 special topics emphasizing industrial problems and practice in 7 of the
regular engineering courses. These lectures are to become a regular component of
those courses. The students will have studied basic principles prior to the
industrial presentations so they are prepared to understand and appreciate the
"real world" problems and solutions presented by the industry engineers. The
program is designed to allow academic institutions to more effectively utilize
the resources of industry during the undergraduate education of engineers.
