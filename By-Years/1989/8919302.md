Most knowledge of parent-offspring relations in mammals is based upon studies
of mother-infant interactions. Recently, there has become a new awareness of the
importance of the mammalian father in the care and development of his offspring.
Indeed, paternal behavior does occur in a minority, but significant number, of
mammals primarily among rodents, carnivores, primates and humans. However, our
knowledge on on paternal care is based largely from descriptive studies. Thus,
very little is known about the basic mechanisms underlying this behavior. Dr.
Gubernick has selected a species in which their biparental care system is well
documented. The males actively participate in rearing young and display all the
components of parental behavior exhibited by mothers, and to the same extent,
except nursing. Dr. Gubernick will determine the hormonal mechanisms and sensory
controls underlying the prepartum onset and postpartum maintenance of his
behavior. This work provides a model for the investigation of family systems and
of mechanisms of paternal behavior that operate in other species, such as
humans, that might otherwise be undetected. The findings will be of considerable
theoretical importance for the formation of general principles of paternal
investment and the evolution of parent-offspring relations.
