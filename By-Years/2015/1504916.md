An Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) implementation and research
project will be conducted at Morehouse College with the goal of utilizing a
highly innovative utilitarian scientific literacy curriculum to increase
retention of freshman STEM majors. Special emphasis will be placed on second
semester freshman STEM majors who are at-risk of changing to a non-STEM major.
This will be accomplished by: 1) presenting scientific literacy
workshop/seminars to all freshman STEM majors at Morehouse College in their
Living Learning Center - Orientation and Training program; 2) identifying second
semester freshman STEM majors who may be considering changing to a non-STEM
major using written assessments and focus groups; 3) enrolling these at-risk
second semester freshmen in a cohort and exposing them to advanced scientific
literacy best practices that are designed to retain them in the STEM major.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational research agenda of this project is to
determine the efficacy of the programmatic activities in retention of STEM
majors as a means of contributing to the knowledge base concerning best
practices for freshman intervention and retention in STEM. Increasing student
retention in STEM ultimately increases America's scientific workforce and global
economic competitiveness.
