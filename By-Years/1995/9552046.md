This project reflects the importance of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) in the
analysis of important engineering problems and developing effective solutions
with DSP hardware and software tools. This project is modifying the overall
curriculum to ensure that DSP methods are introduced in the junior year for
electrical engineering students. The ECE curriculum had placed a primary
emphasis on analog signal processing, including communications, control systems,
electronic circuits, and analog filter design. Due to the limited availability
of DSP facilities, ad hoc DSP projects had been assigned to students who work
under the supervision of senior staff. There are about 100,000 professionals in
the metropolitan Detroit area, employed primarily in the automobile and related
industries, and the school is strategically located to allow for innovative
curriculum development to benefit both local and national industries. The
project has an interdisciplinary thrust that provides all engineering students
with an opportunity to learn the theory and practice of DSP techniques. This is
ensured through the creation of two new undergraduate courses, which include
innovative experiments and projects that emphasize both theoretical and
practical aspects of DSP are proposed. Also, graphical tools are used to teach
the basic concepts of DSP more effectively. Further, the DSP laboratory and
capstone design course provides students with practical skills in applying DSP
software and hardware tools for solving real-world problems. The DSP laboratory
operates cooperatively with the Vehicular Electronics Design Laboratory (VEDL)
has been developed as part of the strategic plan of the School of Engineering.
Both undergraduate students and practicing benefit engineers from industry
(through the continuing education program) benefit from the establishment of the
laboratory.
