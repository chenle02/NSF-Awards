Gender issues relate very directly to the participation of women in science and
to issues concerning the nature of modern science and technology. Prominent
scholars have individually investigated and analyzed both phenomena in recent
years, but there have been no opportunities for those historians, philosophers,
sociologists, and anthropologists currently pursuing the social and humanistic
studies of women and science, engineering, and mathematics to meet and discuss
their theories and results. Dr. Sally Gregory Kohlstedt, a historian, and Dr.
Helen Longino, a philosopher, are holding a workshop to bring together such
researchers with the goal of improving the conversation, finding areas of
agreement and contention, and publishing a result of their deliberations. The
subsequent conference will allow other scholars an opportunity to present papers
on related topics and a much larger audience to consider the issues and discuss
the implications of research on "The Women and Science Question." The workshop
and conference are being held May 10-13, 1995 at the University of Minnesota.
