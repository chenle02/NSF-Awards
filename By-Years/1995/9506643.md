SBR-9506643 Michael D. Blum Eric C. Straffin Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale Dissertation Improvement Research: Fluvial Response to Climate Change
and Human Activities, Burgundy,France The proposed research will develop a model
that relates fluvial processes, flood regimes,land-use patterns, and dominant
climate regimes for the Arroux-Loire River system in Burgundy, France. The model
will provide for the reconstruction of fluvial responses to past climate and
environmental changes, as well as for the prediction of fluvial response to
anthropogenic changes in regional climate in the near future. Documentation of
over 200 years of changes in the fluvial landscape will be developed from
cartographic and remotely-sensed data. Those changes will then be interpreted
within the context of known land-use patterns, and historic changes in climate
and river discharge regimes. Models developed for the period of historical
monitoring will then be compared with reconstructions of older alluvial
deposits, prehistoric land-use, and correlative proxy paleoenvironmental data to
determine the r elationship between fluvial depositional and erosional processes
and climate regimes over the last 2000 years. If the model correlates climatic
regimes and fluvial styles, and this is valid for older alluvial deposits, then
it may be possible to predict fluvial responses to future climate change for the
same region. In this way the study provides a first step towards linking global
environmental change with changes in landscape, enabling those regions with
critical land-use needs to better plan for potential future environmental change
