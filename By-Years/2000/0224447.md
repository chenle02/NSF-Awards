The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Virtual Proving
Ground Simulation will focus unique capabilities and facilities for vehicle
system simulation at the University of Iowa and electromechanical system
simulation and design at the University of Texas at Austin on the goal of
creating fundamental new capabilities for virtual proving ground simulation of
complex vehicle and equipment systems, including off-road equipment, hybrid-
electric vehicles, and next-generation enhanced vehicle mobility and vehicle
power systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I/UCRC will create and make available to
its members an internationally unique virtual proving ground using (1) state-of-
the-art networked computing facilities for high fidelity engineering simulation,
(2) the National Advanced Driving Simulator at Iowa for driver-in-the-loop
virtual proving ground simulation, and (3) unique capabilities at UT-Ausgtin,
including access to facilities at the Center for Electromechanics. With these
assets and significant extensions to be developed in the proposed research
program, the I/UCRC will support its members with internationally unique
modeling , analysis, and virtual prototyping capabilities for simulation of
complex vehicle and equipment systems.&lt;br/&gt;
