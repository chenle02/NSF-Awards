Abstract Proposal: DMS-9803624 Principal Investigator: Jiang-Hua Lu This project
is about applications of Poisson geometry to topology and to Lie theory.
Specifically, we propose to study equivariant cohomology of flag manifolds using
certain Poisson structures on them. This should also yield results on the Lie
algebra cohomology of nilpotent Lie algebras. Partial results have already been
reported in a joint paper with Sam Evens in which we give Poisson geometrical
interpretation of the Kostant harmonic forms on flag manifolds. Poisson
structures arise from physics, the first one being written down by the French
mathematician S.D. Poisson in 1809 when studying classical mechanics.
Subsequently they were investigated by the Norwegian mathematician S. Lie.
Nowadays, it finds applications in physics, control theory, machining automation
and robotic manipulation.
