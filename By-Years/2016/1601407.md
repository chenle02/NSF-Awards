This research project centers on the connections between number theory and
random matrix theory. In particular, the study of prime numbers and divisors is
now influenced by the work of physicists in modeling high energy systems by
understanding the statistics of random matrix theory. This project explores the
relationship between these apparently independent areas of research. The work
studies the analytic theory of L-functions, which are fundamental objects in
number theory that encode arithmetic information. Examples include the Riemann
zeta-function, which encodes information about prime numbers, Dirichlet
L-functions, which encode information about the equidistribution of primes in
arithmetic progressions, and the L-functions associated with modular forms,
which encode the equidistribution of more complex sequences, including rational
points on elliptic curves. The investigator aims to develop a theoretical
framework to explain by number theoretic means the statistical behavior of the
values and zeros of such L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and
collaborators plan work in a variety of projects, each involved with some aspect
of L-functions. One project begins with a novel approach to understanding
moments of the Riemann zeta-function through a study of convolutions of
correlations of shifted divisor functions. This research incorporates a
multidimensional discrete analogue of the Hardy-Littlewood Circle method.
Another project is to improve bounds on the proportion of zeros of the Riemann
zeta function on the critical line. A third project involves work related to an
approach to the Riemann Hypothesis as a mollification problem; it is to
understand an exact formula for the second moment of the zeta-function
multiplied by a specific long Dirichlet polynomial. A fourth project is to prove
that at least 60% of the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions are on the critical
line.
