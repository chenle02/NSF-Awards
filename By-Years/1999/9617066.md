The focus of this research is to determine how chiral solvents will effect a
chiral dianion. Lithium-NMR will be used to investigate solutions of the lithium
salts of the R and S chiral isomers of several substituted cyclooctatetraene
dianions in a variety of chiral solvents. The NMR studies will indicate the
extent to which ion association equilibria are perturbed by the chirality of the
solvent and the dianion. The effects of the dual chirality on the electron
affinity of the cyclooctatetraene ring systems will also be studied. With this
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic Dynamics Program
is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Cheryl D. Stevenson of the Department
of Chemistry at Illinois State University. Professor Stevenson will focus her
work on demonstrating the extent of solvent chiral recognition that can be
achieved with cyclooctatetraenyl dianions. The area provides an excellent
opportunity for involvement of undergraduate and masters level students.
