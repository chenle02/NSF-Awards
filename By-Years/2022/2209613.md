The Esker group is developing thin film production capabilities at San José
State University (SJSU). These specialized thin films, known as “targets”, are
to be used in nuclear reactions at particle accelerator facilities to produce
and study nuclei far from stability. A central focus of this project is
producing and studying the excited states in Indium-100 (100In) using an Iron-54
(54Fe) target and a Chromium-50 (50Cr) beam. 100In is 13 neutrons away from the
lightest stable indium isotope Indium-113 (113In) and has never been studied in
this type of reaction. It is of particular interest because it is the nearest
neighbor to the doubly magic Tin-100 (100Sn), which has long been a focus of
experimental efforts. An important component in establishing the target
capabilities at SJSU is the introduction and education of undergraduate research
students in nuclear science. SJSU is a primarily undergraduate minority serving
institution (PUI &amp; MSI), and nuclear science is a rarity at both of these
institutions. The inclusive research experience supported by this project will
help to broaden the nuclear science pipeline, especially for women and under-
represented minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to
support the target work of the Esker group as well as supporting the production
of an 54Fe target. This target will be used in a 54Fe(50Cr, p3n) 100In reaction
to be run at TRIUMF using the EMMA + TIGRESS experimental set-up. This will
support the approved experiment S2023, to investigate the nuclear structure of
100In, the β-decay daughter of 100Sn. This region of the nuclear landscape has a
number of exciting features that make it a focus of experimental and theoretical
efforts: the doubly magic shell closure around N = 50 and Z = 50, the
enhancement of np interactions along the N = Z symmetry line, and the close
proximity to the proton dripline. By populating the high spin states in the odd-
odd nucleus 100In and watching its subsequent decay, the group expects to
greatly expand the known structure of this isotope. This experiment would
provide valuable information to further develop theoretical descriptions of
nuclear behavior in this region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
