The subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) is one the most widely recognized
biological features in the ocean, however, a mechanistic understanding of the
dynamics processes leading to its formation and maintenance has not been fully
accepted. Under the common assumption that marine grazers are food-limited and
that phytoplankton in the SCM are light-limited, one simple question has
remained particularly puzzling - why isn't the SCM grazed away? Based on new
results, we hypothesize that 1) growth and loss processes are not uniform among
the algal taxa represented in the SCM, 2) some algal groups, small unicellular
algae, are indeed better adapted to the low light conditions of the SCM than
other algal taxa and 3) functional feeding responses of resident micrograzers
operate to maintain the SCM as a persistent feature. The project initiates new
taxon-specific experiments that focus on the dynamics of phytoplankton growth,
herbivorous grazing and cell sinking in the SCM. Taxon-specific rates will be
determined from corroborative methods which exploit algal pigments as
chemotaxonomic markers. Our goal is to develop a taxon-specific understanding of
rate processes that control the formation and maintenance of the oceanic SCM.
