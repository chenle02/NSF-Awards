9322284 WHITLEDGE This project is to develop a REU program, specifically
targeted towards the participation of minority and women undergraduate students.
Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from the HMCU's from the
South Texas region. There is a wide range of projects with research
opportunities and there is a good plan to integrate students with the general
student population at UTMSI by the assignment of a graduate student mentor.
