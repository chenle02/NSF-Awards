New viruses occasionally appear in human populations and can significantly
affect public health as evidenced by the pandemic spread of HIV. However, little
is known of the ecological and evolutionary factors that impact the population
dynamics of emerging viruses. Part of the problem is that it is difficult to
conduct experimental studies using pathogenic viruses and their animal hosts
because of time, space and ethical constraints. Bacterial viruses and their
bacterial hosts provide an easy to manipulate model system to study the dynamics
of large virus and host populations over a short time scale.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal specifically addresses several prominent
hypotheses regarding the emergence of viruses into new host types. The first aim
is to ascertain whether initial virus fitness on the novel host is positively
correlated with the probability of emergence. The second aim is to determine
whether virus adaptation is enhanced in mixed host communities as compared to
communities containing a single host type. The third aim is to establish whether
gene flow between virus populations infecting different hosts enhances adaptive
evolution. The fourth aim is to investigate the significance of translational
adaptation (i.e., evolution of phage codon usage to match host tRNA abundance)
in viral emergence. Together these experiments constitute one of the most
comprehensive experimental approaches to the study of virus emergence attempted.
Successful completion of the work may allow more realistic models of virus
emergence and enhance our ability to identify and counteract potentially
dangerous viruses.&lt;br/&gt;
