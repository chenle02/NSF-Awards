Abrupt volume change near a critical point is a unique property of polymer gels
on which many commercial products are being developed. This project undertakes a
comprehensive study of volume change kinetics in gels near the critical point. A
range of supercritical and subcritical gels will be created by copolymerizing
isopropylacrylamide with diethylacrylamide or acrylic acid. The kinetics of
volume changes will be determined by measuring the change in mass by weighing
and the change in dimension with a videomicroscope system. The objectives are to
tie the broad range of kinetic phenomena together: continous and discontinous
volume changes; swelling and shrinking; volume changes induced by variations in
pH, solvent, ionic strength, and temperature; and the effect of changes in gel
structure. The results will provide data needed for application-oriented
research, clarify the relative rates of these changes, and guide development of
an appropriate mathematical model.
