New scientific instruments have been recently acquired by the Physical Sciences
and Mathematics Department at Mount St. Mary's College. These include an
ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer, a gas chromatograph (GC) with a micro
preparative assembly, a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), and an
atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer. This instrumentation is being used to
update the curriculum in the undergraduate laboratories by providing students
hands-on experience with analytical techniques where lecture presentations have
often sufficed in the past. A major curriculum component being developed is that
involving the role of the computer in data acquisition and treatment, with
important applications in Instrumental Analysis as well as in the Physical and
Honors General Chemistry laboratory courses.
