9314610 Glibert This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the
collaboration of Patricia Glibert of the University of Maryland and Patricia
Metzler, a Ph.D. student at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The project
aims to measure planktonic nitrogen transformations off the coast of Brazil. The
importance of nitrogenous nutrients in marine primary production has long been
recognized. Their regeneration is known to be a major source of nitrogen for
oceanic primary producers, but it is the rate of supply of "new" nitrogen which
ultimately determines the amount of production. There have been virtually no
direct measurements of the rates of nitrogen transformation in the western South
Atlantic. In this project, the researchers will apply 15N stable isotope tracer
techniques to investigate physiological and trophodynamic responses to nitrogen
fluxes in Brazil's coastal and offshore waters. The experiments will elucidate
the relationship between size- and time-dependent responses by plankton to new
nitrogen inputs and the dependence on new versus regenerated nitrogen. These
studies will benefit both sides by producing data for an undersampled part of
the world's oceans, establishing a new area of research in Brazil, and training
a Brazilian student in methodology for these experiments. ***
