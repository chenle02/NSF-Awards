Often precipitation systems are organized into banded structures. These
structures include hurricane rainbands and precipitation bands associated with
low pressure centers. Often the heaviest precipitation occurs in these bands. It
is believed that banded structures are associated with instabilities in the
atmosphere know as conditional symmetric instability (CSI). Using an advanced
numerical model, the Principal Investigator will continue a line of research
that involves assessing various atmospheric forcing terms and how they effect
the CSI. Special attention will be paid to radiation and surface forcing terms
If successful, this research will provide better understanding and potentially
better prediction of banded precipitation structures.
