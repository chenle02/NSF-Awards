Denver&lt;br/&gt;Causation and the Rule of Law&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least
since the time of David Hume, philosophers -- including such notable ones as
Immanuel Kant and Bertrand Russell -- as well as certain physicists -- including
Ernst Mach and Gustav Kirchhoff -- have wondered about the connection between
the laws of nature and the relation of cause and effect. This project
contributes to that discussion in a way that remains closer to the content of
actual physical theories than&lt;br/&gt;most of the literature on the subject.
After criticizing various standard accounts of lawhood, this project delineates
three different classes of laws of physics. The distinction between these three
different classes of laws is arrived at by an examination of the structure of
classical continuum mechanics, but it is shown that these classes appear in
other physical theories, such as Quantum Mechanics, as well. It is further shown
that&lt;br/&gt;what is known as the Green's function (for a differential
operator) is the mathematical locus of causal claims within physics. Once the
causal relation and laws have been located within a physical theory, standard
views of the relationship between laws and causation including what are known as
the "singularist" view and the "covering-law" approach are evaluated and found
wanting. Other concepts closely related to those of law and of causation, such
as the notion of physical necessity, are explored as well. The project results
in an accurate and precise account of the relationship between physical laws --
of each of the three types -- and causation as embodied in the Green's function.
