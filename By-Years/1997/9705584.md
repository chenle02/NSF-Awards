ABSTRACT The proposed project is to study the transport processes in rapid
phase-change and ablation of liquids. The work is relevant to materials
processing such as laser doping and cleaning of contaminants from microdevices.
Emphasis will be given to the development of the temperature and stress fields
in the liquid, the thermodynamics of phase change, and the mechanism of material
ejection. Pulsed lasers operating primarily in the micro/nanosecond range will
be used to induce phase change in liquids. In addition to visualization, the
following measurements will be made: transmission and scattering, pressure field
and recoil momentum, and absorption and emission spectroscopy. Theoretical
modeling that accounts for short-time thermal behavior will also be conducted.
