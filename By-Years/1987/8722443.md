Professors Miller and Wolman will examine an area along the Potomac River in
eastern West Virginia that was struck by a catastrophic flood in November 1985.
They will study the ways physiographic, hydraulic, and hydrologic conditions
determine specific erosion features on alluvial river bottomlands. Flow
simulation modelling will be used to produce patterns of river dynamics that
will be compared with documented patterns of erosion and deposition on the
valley floor produced by the flood. Catastrophic floods are major determinants
of the evolution of river valley floors, but they are poorly incorporated into
models of floodplain evolution. This research will augment our understanding of
floodplain processes. The results of this research will be of considerable value
for scientists and policy makers interested in floodplain land use and
management.
