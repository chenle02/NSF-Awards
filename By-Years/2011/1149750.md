The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
award is to study the mechanical behavior of biomimetic materials with extreme
topological features. This will be carried out by developing predictive
theoretical and computational methods to understand the mechanical deformation
of biomimetic systems and by performing detailed experiments at the micro- and
nanoscale. Mechanical behavior of three different systems will be studied
including cellular structures with heterogeneous organization, composites with
tough interfaces, and functional polymeric surfaces. The research will provide
new understanding of the behavior of biomimetic materials and will elucidate the
intricate interplay between topology, structural organization, mechanics and
function in these systems. This study will pave the way for creating functional
surfaces with controllable frictional, adhesion and mechanical properties and
provide guidance for the design of mesoscopic materials with tailorable
properties.

The creation of new knowledge on the mechanics of biomimetic materials is
expected to have broad implications in the development of multifunctional
materials, surface engineering and coatings, tissue engineering, nanotechnology
and optics. Strong efforts are planned to link the research results to
educational efforts, by developing new courses reflecting interdisciplinary
philosophy at the university level and practical training for K-12 students,
undergraduates, graduate students and high school teachers. The education and
research plans will tie together, by developing an education website "Science of
Shapes" in the context of K-12 outreach and by organizing the Science/Technology
and Art Workshop (STArt). The outreach activities will affect large bodies of
minorities and underrepresented groups, and the project creates an unusually
cross-disciplinary and well-rounded PhD experience.
