This ADVANCE Fellows award is to support the academic career of the PI in
engineering. The PI plans to develop a strong, coordinated program of research
and education in biomedical engineering. The planned research consists of two
lines of investigation: (i) continuation of her efforts to determine a
correlation between the muscle control signal measured at the nerve, at the
muscle and the force generated; (ii) development of a new area of research, gait
analysis. The central hypothesis for the electrophysiology research is that an
automated methodology can be designed to produce accurate information on central
nervous system intent, and hence, a correlative index of activation can be
derived. Bipedal gait (walking on two legs) is one of the most complex tasks to
master, and normal gait is well documented. Computerized gait analysis provides
very accurate information about joint motion muscle activation, and the PI plans
to use this tool to study gait in diabetics. The broader impacts of this
research are significant for health care delivery, with collaborations
established with researchers in biology as well as engineering. The planned
education activities include the further development of two graduate courses,
one teaching mathematical skills for research and the other on gait analysis. It
is expected that the these topics will be very attractive to women and Hispanic
students, and the PI has a strong commitment to advancing diversity in this
engineering field. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers. It is anticipated that the ADVANCE award will not only
advance the PI's career in academic science, but also allow her to serve as a
role model and mentor to women students who are pursuing careers in academic
science, engineering, or related fields. The award will be managed by two
directorates, BES and ECS, given the nature of the research.
