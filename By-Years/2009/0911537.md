This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor George Richter-Addo at the University of
Oklahoma and Professor Michael Shaw at Southern Illinois University at
Edwardsville to determine the electrochemical behavior of metalloporphyrins
containing the NO ligand. Both the NO molecule and metalloporphyrins (e.g., the
heme group in the liver enzyme cytochrome P450) are biochemically relevant and
undergo electron-transfer reactions. However, the effects of the NO ligand on
the electron transfer properties of metalloporphyrins are not well understood.
New and innovative spectroelectrochemical methodologies are being developed to
provide, for the first time, the needed spectral data for complete
characterization of important intermediates to gain insight on the location of
electron addition and removal, and to determine the fate of the redox-generated
intermediates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrochemistry is being used in this work
as a tool to inculcate the broader community with fundamental concepts in
chemistry in a way that brings chemistry into the home. The research and
instructional outreach programs extend to communities in East St. Louis and to
Langston University that have large numbers of underrepresented minority
populations, and to K-12 home schooled students and their parents. Students
involved in this project develop a mature understanding of modern
electrochemical methods and issues which prepare them for careers in fields
which involve the interaction of chemistry with electrodes, including modern
batteries, fuel cells, and photocells. Knowledge of how electrochemistry
provides insight into the chemical properties of materials is essential to a
broader understanding of how nature utilizes electron transfer for critical
processes such as photosynthesis and respiration.&lt;br/&gt;
