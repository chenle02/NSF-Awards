This proposal describes research required to prepare and certify reference
materials for the quality control of measurements of the parameters of the
oceanic carbon dioxide system. Such reference materials are essential to ensure
adequate quality control of the measurements planned as part of the JGOFS
studies. The reference materials proposed encompass all the four parameters of
the oceanic CO2 system: total dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH
and the fugacity of CO2 in equilibrium with a water sample. Additional work
proposed is relevant to the final goal of obtaining comparable and accurate
measurements by a variety of different times during JGOFS. In particular,
collaborative studies of the various methods, so as to develop reliable well-
tested procedures for sea-going use will be organized and reported on.
