Since the identification and control of unknown stochastic systems is a basic
problem in control theory, we intend to continue our research on stochastic
adaptive control. We intend to study more extensively the adaptive control of
partially observed, linear, finite dimensional stochastic systems based on our
previous work. Some related problems of adaptive control for study are
approximations to self- optimizing adaptive controls identification of time-
varying parameters and asymptotic distributions.
