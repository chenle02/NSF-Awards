Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0746757&lt;br/&gt;Ian Appelbaum, University of
Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
experimentally understand the necessary device physics concepts required for
development of Silicon-based spintronics. This is motivated by the need to
demonstrate a scheme for electronic logic processing alternative to the
presently-used charge-based physical paradigm now reaching its scaling limits.
The approach is to use spin-polarized hot-electron techniques for spin detection
in an ultra-high-vacuum wafer-bonded Silicon device
structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the proposed activity
flows from the use of hot-electron techniques to circumvent prohibitive
limitations for spintronics devices made from Silicon. This allows experimental
exploration of the fundamental spin transport and materials parameters to enable
Si spintronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the research component
are derived from leveraging the existing technological and economic
infrastructure of Si-based electronics to extend performance trends of our
present technology with Si spintronics. The advantages afforded by spintronics
devices enabling lower-power, instant-on electronics will allow increased device
portability and are especially important in light of today?s increasing energy
costs and its environmental impact. The Broader Impacts of the integrated
educational and outreach component are achieved through training graduate
students (including those underrepresented in engineering) in diverse aspects of
science and engineering including semiconductor device design, processing,
measurement, and spintronics ? all these are essential for an increasingly
technology-based economy.&lt;br/&gt;
