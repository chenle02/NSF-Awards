The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop theoretical and
computational methods to solve problems in algebraic statistics and its
applications. The specific problem areas described in this proposal concern
Gaussian graphical models and statistical models in evolutionary biology. The
problems in the proposal have typically been open for many years and are
fundamentally of an algebraic character; however, advanced algebraic techniques
have rarely been applied to them. The motivation for studying these problems
comes from the fact that the statistical models under investigation in the
proposal arise frequently in applications, including economics, computational
biology, and sociology. The specific problems that Sullivant will address for
Gaussian graphical models are the identification problem, the computation and
existence of maximum likelihood estimates, and the structure of covariance
constraints. The specific problems that Sullivant will address in evolutionary
biology are the identifiability of mixture models, the computational and
combinatorial complexity of gene trees and species trees, and the comparison of
speciation models to tree building algorithms. The techniques Sullivant will
employ to address these problems come from computational algebra, algebraic
geometry, and combinatorics.

Algebra is the mathematical study of sets with operations, for example the set
of all polynomials with the operations of "adding polynomials" and "multiplying
polynomials". Statistics is the science of data analysis. Parametric statistics
uses statistical models (families of probability distributions) as tools for
analyzing data. Algebra and statistics come together in the field of algebraic
statistics, which is based on the observation that many parametric statistical
models are described parametrically via polynomials. Sullivant proposes to
exploit the algebra/statistics connection to address a number of problems in
algebraic statistics and its applications to evolutionary biology. In
evolutionary biology, Sullivant and his students will study phylogenetic models,
which are statistical models for determining the ancestral relationships between
a collection of extant species. These models are used in applications in
increasingly complicated ways, but even basic questions about the models remain
open. The projects in the proposal will involve research with both graduate and
undergraduate students.
