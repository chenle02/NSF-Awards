The Media Working Group is producing a one-hour documentary about a group of
undergraduate women at Ohio State University who are pursuing non-traditional
paths of study in a variety of technology and science fields. The Gender Chip
Project is designed to provide role models and encouragement for girls (ages
14-18) and young adults who wish to enter STEM careers; and to raise general
public awareness about the continuing need to develop STEM education and career
opportunities for young women. The broadcast documentary will be complemented by
distribution of the program with additional material on DVD. The project will
also design a website for Guidance Counselors and young women contemplating STEM
education. Project evaluation will be conducted by Kathleen Tyner, Lead
Evaluator from Hi-Beam Consulting in San Francisco.
