This funding is to support the Doctoral Consortium (DC) at the 18th Annual
Interaction Design and Children conference (IDC 2019). IDC is the premier
international conference for researchers, educators, and practitioners to share
the latest research findings, innovative methodologies, and new technologies in
the areas of inclusive child-centered design, learning, and interaction.
Students in the DC will present their research questions, approach, and agenda,
and receive feedback from faculty mentors and peers. The constructive feedback
will enrich their research by enabling them to better articulate their research
focus, and refine their research methods and approach. DC participants will also
have the opportunity of sharing a poster of their research during the main
portion of the conference, in order to give them further opportunities to
present and refine their research and connect to a larger scholarly network.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IDC will be held June 12-15 in Boise, Idaho. This award
will support 10 students' participation in the doctoral consortium and partially
defray the costs of four senior mentors' participation. The consortium
organizers will broadly advertise the opportunity to participate among mailing
lists related to children and technology design and among organizations that
support groups traditionally underrepresented in computing. Participants will be
selected in a holistic process that includes their stage of the PhD, the quality
of their research and the benefits they will receive from participating, and
efforts to recruit from a diverse set of topics, methodologies, institutions,
and intellectual backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
