This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project supports two
groups that will study optimization and fast symmetric fast Fourier transform
(FFT). The optimization group will identify specific problems, apply the
software for unconstrained optimization to the transformed problems in order to
find out which algorithms work best, develop special software for any new
methods and finally construct an algorithm for the nonmetric multidimensional
scaling problem and compare it with other approaches. Extensive computations
will be necessary to accomplish these goals. The group will use an Alliant
computer that was purchased with an earlier RIMI grant. The symmetric FFT group
will continue to develop even more efficient ways for the computation of the
discrete Fourier transform of periodic sequences. This particular work will
examine ways to design fast symmetric FFTs that do not depend on the Cooley-
Turkey FFT. This group's approach will be based on the highly efficient fast
polynomial transforms that have been introduced by Nussbauner. This
comprehensive applied and computational mathematics effort will significantly
increase the research capability of a predominantly minority institution. The
principal investigators are well trained and have reasonable publication
records. Faculty and students working on this project will use the Alliant
computer to further strengthen their mathematical research skills.
