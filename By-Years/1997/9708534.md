This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Michigan. The project is to conduct a case study of how
families in Culver City, CA, a diverse community in Los Angeles, understand and
act in their roles as family members. The basic questions are to understand how
the nuclear family has changed in light of the decline of the prevalence of the
standard `married-couple-with-children` family to only 26% of all households in
1993. Using multiple methods of surveys, formal interviewing and participant
observation, the student will test the hypothesis that increasing numbers of
non-traditional, non-nuclear family arrangements will be overtly seen as
`normal` by a diverse set of respondents in light of the socio-economic changes
of post-industrialism that the community is adapting to. This research is
important because it will advance our understanding of the ability of people to
reinterpret their lived experience in a positive manner, by redefining the
meaning of key concepts like `family`. Understanding the lived process by which
these core cultural features are changing will allow policy makers and social
actors to develop programs and policies to facilitate and develop a more
cohesive civil society.
