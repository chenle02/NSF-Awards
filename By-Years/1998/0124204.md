During secondary aluminum processing, oxidation of the aluminum in reverberatory
furnaces leads to the formation of dross, which contains aluminum in metallic
form that is entrapped within its oxide. Among the detrimental effects are loss
of aluminum, promotion of metallurgical defects in aluminum products and reduced
furnace efficiency, due to the insulation effects of the dross layer. The PI
proposes to study the transport processes that lead to dross formation through a
numerical and experimental study of the oxidation of molten aluminum alloys in a
furnace environment. The goal will be to determine optimal furnace conditions
that will minimize the formation of dross. The project is collaborative between
the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Gas Technology Institute.
Reduction of dross formation has potential for significant increases in energy
efficiency and reduction of waste in this industry, which produces 1/3 of the
aluminum produced in the United States.
