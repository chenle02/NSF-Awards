Existing structures in the U.S. which were designed prior to the adoption of
modern seismic design codes present a potential problem for poor dynamic
behavior during an earthquake. Methods to upgrade structures and repair
structures after earthquakes are important to earthquake hazard mitigation and
earthquake engineering. This research project transfers the knowledge and
technology developed by Mexico after the September, 1985, Mexico earthquake
related to repair and retrofit of structures. The approach is by using the case
study method. Documentation of the cases focuses on the design process and the
technical approach used. These results are then directly transferable to
earthquake hazard mitigation in the United States.
