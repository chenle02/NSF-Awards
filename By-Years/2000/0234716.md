This project focuses on the function of a class of genes called the nuclear
receptors. Nuclear receptor genes are found in virtually all animal species.
They are responsible for controlling the expression of other genes; they switch
"on" or "off" other genes as part of an animal's developmental program. A
particular subgroup of nuclear receptors, called the NR2E genes, specializes in
functioning in the embryonic development of the nervous system. For example,
mutations in NR2E genes of humans and mice result in developmental defects in
the specification of certain types of neurons. This project studies the function
of the NR2E genes in the nematode worm C. elegans, an excellent genetic system
for studying the mechanism of nervous system development. The Wightman lab is
determining the function of two NR2E genes, nhr-67 and nhr-111, and comparing
these results to their previous work on another NR2E gene, fax-1. The results
obtained from this study will describe the role of NR2E genes in nervous system
development, as well as test specific hypotheses about the nature of nuclear
receptor gene evolution. Undergraduate students are carrying out most of the
experimental work, since Muhlenberg College has no graduate students or
postdocs. Therefore, this project serves the broader goals of the National
Science Foundation by supporting an important educational mission of training
future science and healthcare professionals. The project also has a significant
impact on the local scholarly environment, by fostering a "culture of science"
that encourages student inquiry and passion for science.&lt;br/&gt;
