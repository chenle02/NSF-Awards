This research will develop a new lithographic technique called dynamic maskless
holographic lithography (DMHL) that achieves maskless lithography by combining
holograms and spatial light modulators with photolithography to produce patterns
in two and three dimensions. This is a new paradigm in photolithography.
Significantly, this process does not require a mask, eliminating a manufacturing
step. It provides an approach to micro (and eventually nano) lithography that,
if successful, will have low operating costs, low capital investment, and would
be flexible in process. The application of holograms to photolithography gives
the opportunity to produce patterns in three dimensions, and controlling this
using a computer provides flexibility and the ability to manipulate light in
real-time, something that cannot be done with fixed masks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high cost of mask-sets puts conventional lithography
out of range for many users; as such, a maskless approach to lithography that is
flexible is desirable. An ideal lithography technique would include low
operating and capital cost, high fidelity, flexibility in process and materials,
ability to pattern on near- or non-planar surfaces, and the ability to
manufacture in three dimensions. The DMHL process developed in this research
meets many of these criteria. DMHL provides new opportunities for education in
optics, microscopy, nanosystems, and lithography. There is a potential future
tie-in with an RET program at the University of Pittsburgh, which will bring
MEMS engineering and microfabrication to high school teachers, benefiting
students in the science and math classroom.&lt;br/&gt;
