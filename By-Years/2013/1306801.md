This work by the Rutgers particle physics group is mainly focused on advancing
the potential of the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider by a combination
of novel physics analysis, exploration of instrumentation improvements, and a
broad outreach program. Research topics include understanding the properties of
the recently discovered Higgs boson, searches for supersymmetry, and other
searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The group will also continue
its leading efforts in the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT), which is a novel
diamond-based proton-on-proton interaction rate monitor around the LHC beam-pipe
near the CMS detector. The Rutgers group will also participate Quarknet outreach
activities, including helping New jersey teachers and students deploy a large-
area cosmic ray detector.
