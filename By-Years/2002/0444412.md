We propose to develop and empirically evaluate the software tools,analysis
techniques,and compiler optimizations necessary to generate automatically a
customized Linux image,and to affect the necessary ap- plication transformations
that use it.Moreover,we will quantify the success of our techniques using
scienti .c applications and software prototypes executing on commodity cluster
platforms.We will employ parallel and .oating-point intensive codes as well as
scientic database programs.We will focus on execution platforms viable at the
high-end .clusters of SMP,IA32 and IA64 systems .the latter allowing us to
investigate relevance to NSF's current TeraGrid [65 ]effort.The result,we
believe,will be a software system that auto- matically enables high-performance
scientic computing on commodity systems through application-specific
customization and dynamic adaptation of a low-cost,popular,and familiar Linux
operating system.
