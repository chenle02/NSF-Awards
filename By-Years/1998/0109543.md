This is a proposal for Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to join Power Systems
engineering research center (PSerc) PSerc is a consortium of universities and
industries, formed to collaboratively tackle critical power systems problems.
The inclusion of CMU in PSerc will benefit both institutions: CMU has resources
that will enhance PSerc's problem solving capabilities, and PSerc will make it
possible for CMU's researchers to work on problems that would otherwise be
inaccessible to them.
