Recent advances in the area of simulation modeling have focused on improving
simulation modeling languages. These advances have addressed the semantic gap
between simulation model design and an executable simulation program. They
represent important advances for improving the productivity of simulation
modelers but do little to aid the non-simulation trained decision maker. The
objective of this research is to advance the state of the art of the actual
simulation model design. The goals are to: 1) reduce the dependency of domain
experts on simulation analysts, 2) assist experienced systems analysts, 3)
facilitate effective communication between experts and analysts, and, 4)
accurately translate system design goals and objectives to executable simulation
code.
