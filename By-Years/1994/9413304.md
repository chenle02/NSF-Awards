9413304 Hamilton This research will investigate theoretically and
experimentally nonlinear effects in laser generated Rayleigh and Lamb waves. A
comprehensive theoretical model for nonlinear Rayleigh wave propagation in an
isotropic elastic solid will be developed. The general theoretical approach will
be extended to include Lamb waves in plates. A main focus of the study is
identification and description of effects that can be exploited in
nondestructive testing, for example, determination of the third-order elastic
constants that describe nonlinear effects in isotropic solids. In parallel with
this work, experiments will be carried out using laser-generated nonlinear
Rayleigh and Lamb waves at the General Physics Institute of Moscow. ***
