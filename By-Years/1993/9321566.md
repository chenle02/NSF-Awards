931566 Meyer This project examines the structure of stream food webs using a
combination of stable isotope addition and gut analysis. Of particular
importance is the estimation of microbial production and assessment of its
importance in stream food webs. This approach will be used to understand the
effects of a resource alteration on food web properties: the effects of a large
reduction in litter inputs. %%% This study will determine the utility of food
web analysis in detecting the ecological effects of environmental alterations
that depress ecosystem resources. The results will be of value in forest and
stream management, fisheries, and conservation biology. ***
