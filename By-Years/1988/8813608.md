This work addresses both scientific issues and technological problems related to
hyperthermophilic archaebacteria, their metabolic processes, and associated
biomolecules. The genus, Pyrococcus (which includes two species: Pyrococcus
furiosus and Pyrococcus woesei), is comprised of anaerobic heterotrophs growing
optimally at approximately 100> C. Given the rapid growth rates and relatively
high cell yields for the bacteria in this genus, it represents an important
biotechnological opportunity for the isolation of thermostable enzymes and for
biotransformations at elevated temperatures. Work will focus on optimization of
growth rate and biomass yield, engineering analyses of important metabolic
characteristics, and on efforts to identify enzymes of potential industrial
significance. The results from this study will be important in solving the myrid
of engineering problems associated with large-scale cultivation and utilization
of hyperthermophilic microorganisms (i.e., those capable of growth at or above
100> C). These recently discovered bacteria are not yet well characterized but
hold great potential from a biotechnological perspective. Studies, such as the
one described here, are important in providing a basis on which research in this
emerging area can develop.
