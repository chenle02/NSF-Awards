9312544 Golding The aim of this experimental and theoretical research project is
to achieve a detailed, microscopic description of the motion and energetics of
defects that hop or tunnel between two closely spaced sites in metals. Interest
in defect dynamics has assumed significance recently for fundamental as well as
technological reasons. Experimental tools, such as lithographic techniques, are
being developed to allow the study of a moving ion and its interactions with
conduction electrons and lattice vibrations. Understanding the basic mechanism
underlying these fluctuations is crucial for assessing the stability and
reliability of material for submicron structures and devices. The project
theorist co- principal investigator is at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. %%% ***
