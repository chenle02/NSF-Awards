The objective of this project is to provide research-like experiences for lower-
level undergraduates in an introductory cell biology course. Making use of the
eight spectrophotometers acquired with the grant, students are guided through an
open-ended, individualized series of experiments on the biology of the enzyme
alkaline phosphatase. This enzyme has practical significance both in clinical
diagnoses and basic research, but its biological function is not readily
apparent. Thus students quickly recognize that they can make contributions to
the knowledge base early in their academic lives, building the confidence and
expertise that will encourage them to consider biology as a career.
