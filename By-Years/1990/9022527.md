This equipment award, for robotics and vision equipment, supports research in
rapid prototyping, visualization, automated manufacturing, and dexterous
manipulation. The visualization work aims to create an electronic environment
for the building of objects to be manufactured. Rapid prototyping occurs when
the electronic version of the object is translated into codes and fixturing
sequences that enable the object to be manufactured. When this process is fully
automated and optimized, then the goal of automated manufacturing has been met.
The work on dexterous manipulation is tied into the manufacturing process
because the factory of the future will need complex robots that are able to pick
up and handle a variety of objects. This research project is one of the few
projects in the United States that addresses the full range of issues that need
to be addressed in automated manufacturing. The equipment will support basic
research on vision (robots need to see), manipulation (robots need to grasp
objects), machine tooling and planning from electronic media (allowing the rapid
development of products), and factory task optimization (allowing the
inexpensive, high quality, mass production of products).
