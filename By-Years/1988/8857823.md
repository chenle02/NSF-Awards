This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides support for the work of Dr. Peter
Chen, Harvard University. This work is focused on exploring the applications of
gas-phase laser spectroscopy to solve fundamental problems in organic reaction
mechanisms. Isolation of transient reaction intermediates under collision-free,
low temperature conditions will be carried out. Particular attention will be
given to thiazolium ylides, antiaromatic hydrocarbons, and halocarbenes.
Powerful spectroscopic tools based on mass spectroscopic and photoelectron
detection will be used to examine these species. Not only important structural
information, but thermodynamic and spectrosopic characteristics will result.
These studies will delve deeply into the structure of reactive intermediates and
the chemical and physical processes leading to them.
