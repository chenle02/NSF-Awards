The proposed research involves a multidisciplinary approach to the study of
Aptian-Albian black shales: 1) Refinement of Aptian-Albian stratigraphy with
development of an integrated higher resolution foraminiferal and calcareous
nannofossil biostratigraphy is proposed, and 2) detailed sedimentologic and
geochemical (organic; stable isotopic) studies of Aptian-Albian "black shale"
sequences in order to document the stratigraphic sequence of anoxic vs. oxic
conditions and resulting changes in type and/or preservation of organic matter.
Our study will involve intensive investigation of selected land and DSDP/ODP
sequences of Aptian-Albian age from a broad spread of paleolatitudes and
paleoenvironments. The objectives are: 1) to improve the understanding of and
better constrain models for the origin of organic carbon-rich strata of mid-
Cretaceous age, which are a major portion of the hydrocarbon source best of the
world; 2) to investigate the forcing of black shale deposition by tectonic,
paleoceanographic, eustatic and climatic events; and 3) to understand the
relationships between biotic evolution and formation of sedimentary (e.g. Mn)
ore deposits to OAEs and OASEs.
