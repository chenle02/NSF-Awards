This pathways project will study how audiences in public spaces, in this case
those in a museum setting, relate to and make sense of large data displays. The
project is preliminary to development of a traveling, hands-on exhibition
enabling users to create and utilize representations of big data displays such
as maps and charts. As the test case, the project will use science maps that
provide an overview of science generally and specific areas of STEM, charting
and exploring the history and future of science and technology. The data
collection portion of the project will take place at the New York Hall of
Science, the Marian Koshland Science Museum, COSI in Columbus, Ohio, and
WonderLab Museum in Bloomington, Indiana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
create a foundation for the design of museum exhibits and educational programs
that teach museum visitors how to explore, engage and make better sense of big
data. The project is potentially transformative because big data is becoming
ubiquitous and making sense out of large data displays is necessary in order to
understand big data sets.
