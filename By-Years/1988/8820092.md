Sequential changes in gene expression control differentiation in Bacillus
subtilis during sporulation. Little information exists on the gene products of
early sporulation, when rapid assembly of unique, intracellular, sporulation-
specific membranes occurs, i.e. asymmetric spore septum and engulfment
membranes, to establish the intracellular forespore. Dr. Andreoli has
demonstrated 8 unique membrane proteins in forespore membranes and isolated
genes for 4 of the 8 proteins (S1, S2, E3 and E4) by screening with specific IgG
B. subtilis genomic library. Restriction maps for the cloned S1 E3, and E4
inserts were constructed. The S1, S2, E3 and E4 genes will be isolated by
subcloning into lambda ZAP to locate the relevant genes in the inserts recovered
from the genomic library and the genes will be mapped in the B. subtilis
chromosome. The results should tell whether each of the membrane protein genes
map at known spo loci, or others. %%% Current understanding of B. Subtilis
molecular genetics makes this cell system ideal for studies of the control of
sporulation. The early stages of this dramatic developmental change involve the
rapid development of unique, intracellular, sporulation- specific membranes.
This work will allow the identification of and role for some of those proteins.
