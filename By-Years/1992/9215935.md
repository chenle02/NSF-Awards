To exploit the fact that many construction projects are planned and work methods
selectedbased on previous experience, a scheduling model using case-based
reasoning is presented. This model not only adapts previous cases to suit a new
project to be scheduled; it also extracts and summarizes planning knowledge from
several cases and stores that as part of its knowledge base for future use. Thus
the storage problem that arises when keeping many cases around is reduced, as
planning knowledge is incrementally compiled. To efficiently retrieve this
compiled knowledge or the cases, CasePlan uses a product model that describes at
a general level what design elements are present in projects and how they
structurally or functionally relate to another. The product model is used for
case classification and learning planning knowledge. The research demonstrates
the importance of product models in organizing and compiling knowledge. The
CasePlan system resulting from this research will also be a state-of-the-art
automated scheduler for construction. Its schedules will have enough detail to
drive a discrete-event simulation of construction execution of the project,
which can provide execution feedback and serve to assess the quality of
CasePlan's output.
