Evolutionists from Darwin to the present have discussed the problem of the units
of selection. Darwin understood the issue as follows: Do traits evolve because
they benefit individual organisms or because they are good for the group in
which they occur? More recently, a third alternative has been proposed--that it
isn't the organism or the group that is the unit of selection; rather, traits
evolve because they benefit the genes that code for them. This issue becomes
important because of the issue of evolutionary altruism. An altruistic trait is
none that reduces the fitness of organisms that possess it while benefitting the
group in which it occurs. Altruistic traits are bad for the individual but good
for the group. In the past ten years, there has been a considerable amount of
interest among both philosophers and biologists in the unit of selection
problem. Some of their work has been in reaction to the ideas presented by the
two investigators in this project, specifically, Professor Wilson's study of
1980 and Professor Sober's work of 1984. Under this grant, Professors Sober and
Wilson are collaborating to evaluate the work over the past decade and produce a
synthetic treatment of where the conceptual issues now stand. They are also
investigating possible connections between the issue of evolutionary altruism
and selfishness and the psychological issues and altruism and egoism. Although
the evolutionary and psychological concepts are logically independent of each
other, the question remains of how one might argue for or against theses
concerning their empirical connection.
