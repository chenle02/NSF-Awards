This project is a research needs workshop to focus on the systems aspects of
environmental control design research in buildings. A two-day workshop will be
conducted in Fall 1985 in Washington, DC. This workshop will develop a research
agenda for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems research in
engineering programs, which will be responsible to the needs of design
engineers. Topics included within the scope of the workshop will include: HVAC
sizing and energy performance; computers in HVAC design; HVAC controls and
systems integration; and economic-performance evaluation of HVAC system
alternatives. The workshop proceedings will be published and distributed and
summaries of the workshop will also be written and submitted to appropriate
engineering journals.
