The aim of this research project is to study the solutions of systems of partial
differential equations that arise in several complex variables. Important
mathematical applications of this research include establishing the regularity
of solutions and the convergence of solutions for which only Taylor series
coefficients are known. Important applications to physical systems include
equations that arise in statistical mechanics and meteorology. For example, the
planar dimer model is a statistical mechanical model of certain two-dimensional
surfaces in space that is a higher dimensional generalization of the simple
random walk on integers. The limit shape of such surfaces is modeled by a
partial differential equation closely related to the complex Burgers' equation
studied in this project. The same equation is also relevant in the study of the
quasi-geostrophic equations that model the behavior of certain atmospheric
phenomena.

The main part of the project involves the problem of understanding geometric
conditions that imply that a sufficiently smooth CR mapping between two Cauchy-
Riemann (CR) manifolds is smooth when the manifolds are smooth, and real
analytic when the manifolds are real analytic. Closely related problems that
will be investigated include the local and microlocal regularity of CR functions
on abstract CR manifolds. The tools that may be used include a new family of
Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transforms, analytic discs, and the methods developed
in the theory of holomorphic extendability of CR functions on hypersurfaces.
