This is an award to provide support for research on the utility of airborne
imaging spectrometry in quantitative analysis of eutrophication-related water
quality parameters. Objectives of this project are to identify the optical bands
that describe organic and inorganic constituents of interest in judging water
quality and to correlate these measurements with concentrations of suspended
sediment and chlorophyll-a. The planned test-site for model development in this
project is the Hudson/Raritan River Estuary and coastal waters of New Jersey.
The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord with Program
Announcement NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards
for Women Scientists and Engineers. It addresses the potential use of a remote-
sensing concept that would complement or conceivably replace the need for
extensive sampling of coastal waters in establishing their quality and
determining changes that result from an influx of pollutants from streams
discharging to coastal waters. Results of this research may be applied in
engineering design of coastal pollution abatement facilities.
