In this U.S.-U.K. cooperative research project, Arthur Kney of Lafayette College
and Simon Parsons of Cranfield University's School of Water Science propose to
examine combined effects of ion exchange and magnetic fields in the treatment of
synthetic waste streams containing heavy metals. The project builds on Dr.
Kney's recent results supported through a NSF Small Grant for Exploratory
Research. That research demonstrates that an applied magnetic field integrated
with an ion exchange operation affects chromatographic results. The proposed
collaboration with Dr. Parsons primarily involves studies of magnetic water
conditioning mechanisms. They will work on magnetic conditioning experiments
using cations with varying magnetic susceptibilities - lead (II), nickel (II),
cadmium (II), copper (II), and zinc (II). In addition, they will investigate the
effects of ion concentration, ion-exchange material, and magnetic field
intensity.

This cooperative research project takes advantage of British expertise in
magnetic water conditioning and in the treatment of scaling waters with magnetic
fields. The collaboration could provide information to advance the fields of
chemical free water and wastewater treatment.
