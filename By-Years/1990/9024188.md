Freshwater systems are a major feature of the arctic landscape because
permafrost prevents drainage, and evaporation is low. They must be studied and
understood in their pristine condition as a major part of the Arctic interacting
system. The broad goal of the project is to understand and predict how the
tundra, lakes and streams function and how they respond to change. A specific
goal is to understand the extent of control by resources (bottom- up control) or
by grazing and predation (top-down control) and to understand the exchange of
nutrients between land and water. The heart of the project is the long-term
experimental manipulations of ecosystems to examine processes and the effects of
change. A part of the project is to monitor year-to-year variability and to
measure long-term changes. The data collected in plots on the tundra and in
small areas of the stream and lakes will be scaled up to the whole watershed
level through mathematical modeling. In the future, the watershed model will be
interactive with other data bases so the model and process information may be
extrapolated to the larger region. A prediction may then be made for such
questions as the future export of nutrients from the whole of the north slope of
Alaska when temperature and precipitation changes.
