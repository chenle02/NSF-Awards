project will serve as a bridge between global climate modeling and regionally
focussed hydrologic studies of northern high latitudes. It will mesh with both
the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) and the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP). The first task will be the compilation of a
climatological database, including monthly fields as well as spatial and
temporal variances, for use in (a) validating climate model simulations of the
high latitude hydrologic cycle and its variability, and (b) quantifying the low
frequency variability in high latitude hydrologic quantities. The database
compilation will focus on precipitation and runoff fields, supplemented by
computations of atmospheric moisture flux convergence, which will be used to
estimate the net P E (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) on a regional
basis. The second task will be to diagnose quantitatively the high latitude
hydrologic cycle of the AMIP simulations in order to determine the reasons for
the model overestimation of arctic precipitation. The last task involves the use
of a regional atmospheric model to determine what resolution is required to
realistically simulate the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation
over topographically complex areas in high latitudes. All three tasks are
interdependent and each is an important contribution to efforts to increase our
ability to estimate the potential for global climate change. ***
