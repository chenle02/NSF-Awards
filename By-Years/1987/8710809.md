This planning grant will be used to design research that will investigate the
learning processes and strategies of Black young adults participating in
literacy intervention programs. Those participants who successfully perform
specific literacy tasks (high-literacy proficient adults) will be compared to
participants who do not demonstrate competence on these tasks (low-literacy
proficient adults). The research will involve comparisons of task
characteristics, such as type of task and requirements for processing
information, as well as learner characteristics, such as problem solving
approach, errors made, and cognitive strategies used. Pilot data will
demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the approach. Literacy tasks for
inclusion in this research will be selected from the National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP) Young Adult Literacy Study conducted in 1985. The
selection will be based on a content and error analysis of those tasks included
in the NAEP assessment which differentiated high vs low proficiency in a
national sample of Black young adults. The principal investigator, a well-
trained recent Ph.D. in educational psychology, will also conduct a literature
review in the fields of cognitive psychology, the psychology of reading, and
adult literacy and education. This information will be synthesized to provide
the theoretical basis for the research. This reseach has potential utility in
designing instruction in literacy intervention programs.
