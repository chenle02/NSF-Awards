It is proposed to carry out an experimental and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;program of
research related to the dynamical modelling,&lt;br/&gt;identification and
feedback control of optical tweezers. By the&lt;br/&gt;proper use of feedback
control and identification techniques, &lt;br/&gt;we plan to increase the
accuracy and bandwidth of the optical &lt;br/&gt;tweezer as a sensor by orders
of magnitude. The testbed application&lt;br/&gt;for these techniques is to use
the tweezer to sense, in&lt;br/&gt;real time, mechanical or chemical changes to
a biological&lt;br/&gt;molecule; for example, the mechanical ``unzipping'' of
DNA.&lt;br/&gt;Current techniques for such sensing are limited by the effects
of&lt;br/&gt;thermal noise (Langevin forces) and the internal dynamics
of&lt;br/&gt;the molecule itself. Techniques are proposed that
incorporate&lt;br/&gt;dynamical models of the molecule as well as recursive
system identification&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to estimate the parameters of trap-
molecule interaction&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of significant background noise.
The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research program will consist of developing appropriate
models for&lt;br/&gt;molecule-trap interaction, feedback control and
identification,&lt;br/&gt;and experimental testing of the algorithms on the
existing and&lt;br/&gt;operational optical tweezer instrument in the PIs
laboratory at&lt;br/&gt;UCSB.&lt;br/&gt;
