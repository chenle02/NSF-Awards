In this project, tunable piezoelectric resonator concepts will be explored for
use in frequency control and electromechanical filter applications. The
centerpiece of the research is a technique for tuning piezoelectric resonators
through the use of shunt capacitance. This concept can be particularly useful in
applications in which mechanical resonators are used as frequency sources
(including electronics and radio frequency communications applications) and in
electromechanical filtering. In order to fully exploit increasing the resonator
frequency, maximizing the tuning range and quality factor, and understanding the
temperature-frequency characteristics of the resonator. This proposal presents a
three-year research plan to address these and other issues. The impact of the
research will be made through the generation and dissemination of knowledge that
will be pertinent to the frequency control community. The research will also
have impact through the training of students. In addition to graduate students,
undergraduate and high school students will involved in the project through a
new diversity initiative at the University of Pittsburgh called the Pitt
Engineering Career Access Program.
