9714843 Dlott The goal of this work is to understand the mechanical dynamics of
molecular materials, and to relate the dynamics to chemical reactivity and
function. The proposed work falls into two distinct areas, (1) vibrational
energy transfer and (2) shock waves in materials. Simple liquids, such as
acetonitrile and water, and solids such as naphthalene which are of current
theoretical interest will be studied. Shock waves will be used to study shock-
induced chemical reactions in simple model systems, and shock-induced material
transformations and relaxation processes in complex systems such as glasses and
proteins. Shock methods with greater time resolution using surface sensitive
spectroscopies will be developed. Studies of laser photothermal imaging
materials will be extended to a variety of imaging materials with different
architectures to develop a general understanding of the fundamentals of laser
photothermal imaging processing. %%% An understanding of ultrafast dynamics and
shock wave induced chemistry in condensed matter systems that include liquids
and solutions, polymeric solids and proteins play an important role in a number
of materials areas such as biomedical applications, and photothermal laser-
imaging materials for graphic arts applications. ***
