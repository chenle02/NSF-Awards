The Young Scholars Instrumentation Institute is a three-week summer program
together with year-long follow-up activities designed to provide high quality
science enrichment and career awareness for 20 students entering 11th grade from
the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The main institute components, focusing on
chemistry and physics, will be introduction to instrumental techniques, a
research project utilizing these techniques, and career planning activities.
Young Scholars will gain hands-on experience with IR, NMR, UV-visible
spectophotometers, refractometer and gas chromatographies. Field trips to
Litton-Amecom, NIH and the county policy laboratory will give students an
opportunity to observe the increasing sophistication of modern instrumentation--
from routine laboratory instrumentation to the highly sophisticated FTIR, mass-
gas chromatograph interface, high resolution NMR and a one-of-a-kind microplasma
detector. The institute, field trips and follow-up activities will expose Young
Scholars to the breadth and wealth of science careers. Prince George's Community
College's excellent science faculty and laboratories have lead to the
development of special science projects targeted to different populations. These
programs, enthusiastically endured by participants, county science supervisors,
and the Maryland State Department of Education, answer the nationally and
locally recognized need for upgrading content knowledge, generating interest and
excitement in science topics and introducing science career opportunities.
