This project supports a workshop that is designed to reach out to a broad
scientific community of aerosol scientists on issues associated with
carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere. Considerable controversy exists among
aerosol scientists regarding terminology and methodology for measuring and
reporting carbonaceous fractions of atmospheric aerosol. This workshop will help
to develop a consensus on terminology for carbonaceous aerosol (e.g. the
definition of black carbon), address carbon aerosol sampling difficulties, and
recommend standardized analysis for carbonaceous aerosol for the purposes of
sample intercomparison between field campaigns and longer-term measurement
sites.
