Turbulent, nonpremixed combustion is to be modeled using a combination of direct
numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) approaches. The
numerics will employ spectral collocation (Fourier transforms) and spectral
element (Chebyshev transforms and P-type finite elements) techniques. The
following physical issues will be investigated through DNS: flame tip dynamics
near extinguishment, lifted flame structure and the validation of percolation
theory applied to flame sheet "holes", and the coupling between the
instantaneous values of a conserved scalar and its rate of dissipation in
spatially developing turbulent flames. The LES work will be aimed at developing
a subgrid turbulence closure using a scalar single-point probability density
function, with application to a homogeneous turbulent flow undergoing a finite
rate binary reaction. The main objects of this research are the effects of
exothermic reactions on turbulence, application of the spectral-element method
to compressible reacting turbulent flows, and application of LES to finite rate
reacting turbulent flows. The results should identify shortcomings associated
with some of the turbulence models presently in use and guide the way to
improved techniques for closure, thus advancing our ability to reliably model
more physically realistic combustion chamber flows.
