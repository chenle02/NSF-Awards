Dr. Romero-Severson and colleagues propose the construction of BAC libraries for
five insect taxa (Tribolium castaneum, Nassonia vitripennis, Oncopeltus
fasciatus, Thermobia domestica and Schistocerca Americana) selected for their
phylogenetic position, scientific importance and scarcity of existing genomic
resources. These taxa represent the insect orders Coleoptera (beetles),
Hymenoptera (wasps and bees), Hemiptera (true bugs), Thysanura (silverfish) and
Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). In combination with the whole genome
sequences of the Dipteran insects Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae,
these libraries will enable the scientific community to test important
hypotheses concerning insect genetics, genomics, development, ecology,
systematics, and evolution. This effort will dovetail with the ongoing
development of an insect genomics database at Purdue University.

The Clemson University Genomics Institute (CUGI) is the subcontractor for the
BAC library construction. Over the past five years, the CUGI BAC/EST Resource
Center has constructed most of the plant and fungal BAC libraries used in
agricultural genomics. The CUGI BAC/EST Resource Center will supply the insect
libraries as high-density hybridization filters and clones on a cost recovery
basis for academic programs.
