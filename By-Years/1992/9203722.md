This proposal outlined a program to examine the structure, chemistry, and
electronic structure of the oxide eutectic interfaces in two-phase oxide
systems, particularly the directionally solidified eutectics, using the state-
of-the-art 200 kV field emission TEM and under ultra-clean conditions using a
UHV-HREM. Multiple views of the interfaces in two-phase oxides aid the
visualization of interfacial relaxation and characterization of interface
structure in three dimensions. The relaxation mechanisms and interface defects
will be analyzed within the context of the bicrystallography theory and compared
with computer simulated structures. The program includes also the in-situ/ex-
situ heating and diffusion experiments to observe and anylyze dynamic properties
of interfaces. %%%% This proposal utilizes unique characterization techniques,
including field emission TEM under ultra-clean conditions, to characterize the
interface structure and defects in two-phase oxide systems. Interfacial
relaxation will be studied to delineate the mechanisms, and the observed results
will be compared with computer-simulated structures. The results can have
general applicabilities in the oxide studies.
