0125468&lt;br/&gt;Severinghaus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
continued measurements of gas isotopes in the Vostok ice core, from Antarctica.
One objective is to identify the phasing of carbon dioxide variations and
temperature variations, which may place constraints on hypothesized cause and
effect relationships. Identification of phasing has in the past been hampered by
the large and uncertain age difference between the gases trapped in air bubbles
and the surrounding ice. This work will circumvent this issue by employing an
indicator of temperature in the gas phase. It is argued that 40Ar/39Ar behaves
as a qualitative indicator of temperature, via an indirect relationship between
temperature, accumulation rate, firn thickness, and gravitational fractionation
of the gas isotopes. The proposed research will make nitrogen and argon isotope
measurements on ~ 200 samples of ice covering Termination II (130,000 yr B.P.)
and Termination IV (340,000 yr BP). The broader impacts may include a better
understanding of the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in
climate change.
