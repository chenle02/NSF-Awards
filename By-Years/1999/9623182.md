ABSTRACT Sherman & Andrade IBN 96-23182 An Investigation of Selection for Male
Sacrifice Behavior Males of many arthropod species contribute nutrients to their
mates during courtship or copulation ( nuptial feeding ). Such cases,
particularly among the insects and spiders, are interesting because they
represent deviations from the more typical mating pattern of male polygyny with
little material investment. The functional significance and ecological
conditions controlling increased male investment in insects has been a topic of
interest for behavioral ecologists and evolutionary biologists. The proposed
project will increase understanding of mating systems where males provide
nuptial gifts by determining the conditions under which the most extreme type of
male nuptial feeding -- male copulatory suicide--can be selected. This project
is a comparative study of two congeneric spider species (Latrodectus hasselti
and L. geometricus) in which males appear to sacrifice themselves to females
during copulation. Field observations of daily movements, courtship behavior and
mating success will be combined with staged laboratory interactions and
estimations of reproductive output to characterize the mating system, selective
pressures, and demographic characteristics of these two species. Information
gathered from this species will be used to produce a model for the selection of
male copulatory suicide that will place the behavior within the existing
framework of sexual selection theory.
