This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop
noble metal and polymer stabilized magnetic nanoparticles and biodegradable
microspheres as nanovehicles for use in magnetically guided drug delivery. Site-
specific release of therapeutic agents results in greatly reduced whole body
dosages to minimize toxicity. Controlled, ultra thin coatings for magnetic
nanoparticles would yield biocompatible systems with significantly improved
magnetic susceptibility required for effective magnetic guidance through the
arterial system. Analgesics and stable magnetic nanoparticles would be contained
in and subsequently released from biodegradable polymeric
microspheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of these highly
magnetic nano-vehicles would be as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging
contrast agents, magnetically guided drug delivery systems, and for cell
separation techniques.
