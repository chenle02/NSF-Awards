9318422 Lorenz The PI will investigate various aspects of atmospheric
predictability and climate determinism, using concepts from the theory of
dynamical systems. He will base these studies on numerical integrations of
relatively low-order mathematical models. These will permit the use of large
ensembles. The procedures can then be transferred to larger models, presumably
with smaller ensembles, if this proves desirable. The PI will also continue to
seek the true significance of the very low dimensionalities for the atmosphere
or the climate system (obtained by processing sequences of observations of a
single variable) that have been appearing in the recent literature. This
research is important because it will provide a fundamental base of knowledge
upon which climate prediction models will be developed. ***
