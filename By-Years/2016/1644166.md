This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Southern Illinois University
Carbondale in Carbondale, Illinois will provide scholarships for talented, low-
income students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing STEM degrees.
The program, called Pathways to STEM Leadership (PSL), will improve the
recruitment, retention, graduation rates, and job placement of community college
students transferring to Southern Illinois University Carbondale STEM colleges.
The program is designed help STEM students become future leaders in industry by
providing them with leadership training, mentoring, a cohort experience, and
community service opportunities. The development of technical leaders has become
a critical need for the United States in helping to maintain a competitive
position in a technology-based global economy. Scholarships and support for low-
income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to
obtain STEM degrees, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will
contribute to the economic well-being of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will conduct research to determine the influence of formal and
experiential leadership training opportunities on student persistence and
completion of STEM degrees. This work is based on the results of a prior NSF
S-STEM project that emphasized the development of leadership skills. That
project resulted in high rates of degree completion and successful entry into
the workforce by low-income students in the college of engineering. This project
will utilize a matched control group to help identify the impact of cohort-based
leadership training on factors such as persistence, grades, graduation rate, and
placement upon graduation. The project responds to a need expressed by
technology-driven companies for improved technical leadership skills in
graduates entering the workforce. The findings from the program will be
disseminated widely to the STEM education community.
