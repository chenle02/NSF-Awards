The NSFNET infrastructure has expanded at an exponential rate and has
precipitated the need to evaluate trends that impact future network development.
High performance computing and advanced 3- dimensional graphics environment
coupled with new media technologies provides an expanded visual domain to
represent and study complex network topology and data. This project will
organize, aggregate, reduce, and investigate large network databases while
considering a design criteria that can be applied to a more diverse set of
information flow problems. This study is a major step in the development,
visualization, and investigation of network data archives and can reveal
communication trends in the nsfnet and its components. The archiving and
distribution of this investigation will provide a valuable national resource and
has the potential of becoming a general purpose visualization tool for network
analysis.
