Dynamic programming algorithms are widely used for analyzing the control of
nonlinear dynamic systems. These algorithms are computationally intensive,
especially for stochastic problems. Supercomputers and parallel processing will
facilitate the use of dynamic programming algorithms for realistic problems that
could not be addressed in the past because of computational limitations. The
proposal concentrates on the following issues: a) parallel processing of
Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP),
b) coupling DDP to finite elements models, and c)special algorithms for SDP with
binary control variables. The research focuses on systems with continuously
valued state variables, and hence the analysis will examine the computation of
SDP with linear or nonlinear interpolation in the state space. The computational
effect on CPU and on parallel processing of using implicit or explicit finite
element models in conjunction with DPP will be investigated. Large-scale
numerical results will be computed at the Cornell National Supercomputer
Facility (CNSF) in co-operation with CNSF staff. The results of the
investigation will be applied to several "real" problems arising in
environmental management as well as to hypothetical test examples.//
