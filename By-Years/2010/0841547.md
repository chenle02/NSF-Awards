This is a Marine Genomics workshop under the auspices of the US- European
Commission Taskforce on Biotechnology Research to occur in October, 2008 in
Monte-Carlo, Monaco. The goal of this workshop is to bring together marine
microbiologists, bioinformaticians and biotechnologists to explore future
applications of (meta)genomics for basic and biotechnological research. These
goals are consistent with the recommendations of the US-EC Taskforce on
Biotechnology Research. Since the previous workshop was held in the United
States, the location for this next workshop has been established by colleagues
in Europe. The workshop will be examining two broad themes: investigating marine
microbial adaptation, biochemistry, physiology and ecology through
(meta)genomics and 2) accessing marine microbial (meta)genomics for industrial
applications. These themes will be addressed in four sessions: 1) current issues
being addressed in marine microbiology, 2) technological hurdles that still
exist in marine microbial (metagenomics), 3) biocatalysis, drug discovery and
industrial production based on information obtained from marine microbes and 4)
laws, regulations, intellectual property rights and ethical considerations
involved in marine microbial biotechnology. The outcome of the presentations and
discussions will be a workshop report which documents the highlights of the
major findings, abstracts of the presentations and the conclusions and
recommendations from each session. It will also include challenges and potential
areas for EC/US collaboration on the interface between marine (meta)genomics and
marine biotechnology.
