This grant explores non-crystalline materials using neutron and X-ray
diffraction to characterize the atomic structure. The emphasis is on binary and
quasi-binary metallic liquids and related amorphous metallic alloys prepared by
mechanical alloying. Amorphization is investigated in mechanically alloyed
intermetallic alloys to find a correlation between the degree of chemical order
in solid and liquid alloys and the process of glass formation by rapid quenching
and mechanical alloying. Topological and chemical short range order is
determined from diffraction patterns using conventional, synchrotron, and pulsed
neutron sources. The structure of inorganic glasses produced from the liquid
state and sol-gel processing is also examined.
