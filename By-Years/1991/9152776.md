Scanning Electron Microscopy for Undergraduate Student Research and Instruction
in Biology Acquisition of a scanning electron microscope will enhance
undergraduate education and research. The senior capstone experience,
independent research investigations, Honors research, and selected laboratory
courses will benefit from SEM capabilities. Our course offerings will now
include a new course, Introduction to Scanning Electron Microscopy. Problem-
solving approaches will be emphasized in both student research and
classroom/laboratory investigations. The departmental goals which will be
advanced through SEM capabilities include: 1) the improvement of undergraduate
education 2) the enhancement of student capstone and research experiences, 3)
and further development of critical thinking, quantitative and analytical skills
of students. A critical point drier and a sputter coater with vacuum pump,
essential for specimen preparation are also included in the request.
