This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop an effective diesel particulate filter (DPF) that can be reliably
regenerated with integral electrical heating elements. A fabrication process
will also be developed that ensures economical manufacturability of the filter
in high volumes. The greatest challenge in the design of reliable particulate
filter and trap systems has been achieving adequate regeneration, or the
oxidation (burning) of particulates that accumulate in the filter substrate
diesel engine operation. The objectives of Phase II will include designing an
actively regenerating filter structure, optimization of EC material for use in
the DPF substrate, development of manufacturing processes suitable for scale up
to volume production, construction of prototype DPF substrates, testing, and
ultimately integration of the EC-integrated DPF into a functioning DPF system
ready for field testing. The anticipated result of the Phase II project is an
actively regenerating EC-integrated DPF prototype substrate suitable for field
testing in the US EPA.s Voluntary Retrofit Program.

The EC-integrated DPF will fulfill new emissions controls scheduled to take
effect in 2007. There is presently a compelling need for a compact, simple-to-
maintain, durable, and effective diesel particulate filter for both new and
existing diesel- powered vehicles. The EC-integrated DPF could potentially
reduce diesel particulate emissions by 9.5 million tons annually, preventing
thousands of premature deaths due to respiratory illnesses, cancer and heart
disease. .
