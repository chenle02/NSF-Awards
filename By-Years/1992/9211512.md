9211512 Russell This is a REU supplemental award to IRI-9211512. The objective
of the RALPH (Rational Agents with Limited Performance Hardware) project is to
understand the effect of limited computational resources on the design of
optimal decision-making systems. Work to date has specified a normative theory
of metareasoning to control computation, and has applied it to several
combinatorial problem classes; in all cases significant performance improvements
over standard algorithms have been record. The methodology for applying the
theory has been developed in detail, and has been used by other researchers to
solve complex problems. The PI will continue to work on more general decision-
theoretic metalevel architectures; probabilistic planning and scheduling
systems; and composition of real-time systems, for which preliminary results
have been obtained. A software environment will be developed that allows complex
real-time agents to be constructed automatically from elementary soft-real-time
components. A final element of the proposal is the construction of provably
optimal bounded agents. Working initially in a class of simple rile-based
machines, it will be shown that a learning algorithm can converge quickly to an
approximately optimal rule set. These results will be extended to find the scope
and limits of adaptive methods for achieving bounded rationality, thereby
contributing to the foundation for a science of artificial intelligence.
