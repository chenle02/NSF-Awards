Solidification fronts propagate inward from the upper and lower margins of
sills, lavas, and lava lakes, regardless of size, and largely control magmatic
evolution. These fronts or crusts are characterized by strong changes in
crystallinity and viscosity. They partition magmatic processes into two regions:
(1) an inward region dominated largely by fluid processes (e.g., crystal
settling and convection), and (2) an outer region, within the solidification
fronts themselves, dominated largely by intercrystalline processes (e.g., porous
flow and compaction). The aim of this proposal is to investigate the dynamic
interplay between these regions and to understand the physical and chemical
processes that characterize each region. The proposed investigation involves
both field and theoretical work. It will improve our understanding of how
relatively thin magma bodies solidify and permit modeling of that process.
