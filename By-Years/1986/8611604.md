This is an in-depth study of the passivation of zinc electrodes. It is probably
the most detailed study of passivation in a single system ever performed. It
will test finer points of the theory, which may then be applied to other
systems. Passivation is a serious problem in batteries, fuel cells, and other
electrical devices; on the other hand, passivation also affords protection
against corrosion in structural metals.
