The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project is to drive restoration and preservation of coastal wetlands by
unlocking their ecosystem value. Many coastal communities are underserved and do
not have resources to adapt to increasing risks from erosion, storms, and sea
level rise. Enhanced coastal resilience and restoration promotes biodiversity,
which bolsters coastal communities through improved fisheries, tourism, and
water quality, as well as other "blue economy" benefits. This project will
enable coastal communities to access funds from monetizing project co-benefits
and promote nature-based solutions with economic and environmental benefits.
This project advances NSFâ€™s mission by developing analytical tools that can
directly benefit national welfare. The project can create significant impact by
enabling more environmentally sustainable adaptation techniques, expanding
financing alternatives for coastal wetlands restoration, and promoting equitable
actions. This solution creates ecological and socio-economic benefits by
addressing the need for more sustainable communities given coastal migration
trends and rising sea levels and increased storm intensities.

This approach utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and artificial
intelligence to accurately and systematically measure the carbon stock in
coastal wetlands. The project will include an integrated suite of technologies
for new datasets, a modeling framework to identify coastal shorelines at risk of
erosion, high fidelity maps of blue carbon stock, and the characterization of
biodiversity in relation to the environment. This project is expected to make
significant contributions to the protection of coastal wetlands and the
development of novel methods to analyze blue carbon stocks. The project will
build on the existing software platform developed during Phase I and extend its
application to determine the different blue carbon pools in marshes and mangrove
ecosystems. By accurately measuring erosive conditions and carbon stock at a
high spatial resolution in coastal wetlands, this solution has the potential to
enable markets to meet sustainability goals while preserving the numerous
benefits that wetlands provide to the environment and communities. The project
would also decrease the uncertainty in the measurement of blue carbon at a high
spatial resolution, a critical factor for creating trustworthy and reliable
carbon credits, which can be used to finance the restoration and preservation of
coastal wetlands.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
