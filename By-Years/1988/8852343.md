Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an indispensable source of chemical
information. NMR studies provide much of the basis for theoretical concepts of
molecular reactivity and architecture that are fundamental in undergraduate
chemical education. Direct experience with NMR techniques helps students
appreciate the basis of these concepts. NMR techniques are the most versatile of
all modern instrumental methods. Because NMR instruments can be used in so many
parts of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, students are aided in the
important task of integrating what they learn in different courses. Students
graduating in chemistry, whether entering the job market or graduate school, are
being significantly improved through the use of the NMR spectrometer. The NMR
purchased allows for maximum information output in students' hands without undue
diversion of faculty attention from the close individualized relation with
students that is the pride of the department. The grantee is matching the award
form non-Federal sources.
