Aldroubi 0103104 The investigator and his colleagues develop a mathematical
framework and fast computational schemes for the reconstruction of functions,
signals or images from noisy, very large sampled data sets, acquired on
nonuniform grids, by nonideal acquisition devices. The problem of nonuniform
sampling and reconstruction is treated in the context of shift-invariant
subspaces, Besov spaces, and in arbitrary dimensions. The theory is developed
for the case when the samples are obtained from weighted averages. Density
conditions for exact reconstruction are established. When the data are noisy,
incomplete, or when the assumptions needed for exact reconstruction are not
satisfied, bounds on the error between the reconstructed and original signal are
derived in terms of the sampling densities, the averaging functionals, and the
noise statistics. The development of the mathematical framework and the
computational schemes requires a new set of techniques and ideas, and involves
several areas of mathematics including wavelet theory, frame theory, functional
analysis, and harmonic analysis. The project is motivated by problems arising in
data transmission, geophysical exploration, astronomy, spectroscopy, and
biomedical imaging. The problem of reconstructing a signal or an image from a
set of nonuniform samples is encountered in many applications of signal or image
processing. For example, the loss of data packets during transmission through
internet or from satellites can be viewed as a nonuniform sampling and
reconstruction problem. In geophysical exploration, the earth's magnetic field
is measured by a combination of airborn, fast moving acquisition devices, as
well as scattered stationary devices resulting in highly nonuniform sampling
patterns, and a huge data set. The goal is to reconstruct the magnetic field and
use it to reveal geological features. In fact, modern digital data processing of
signals or images always uses a sampled version of the original analog signals
or images. However, the sampling devices are never ideal, and the collected data
consist of average samples. Moreover these data are often very large,
incomplete, and corrupted by noise. The question then arises whether and how the
original signal can be recovered from the data. Therefore the investigator aims
to 1) quantify the conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a signal
exactly from different sets of nonuniform average-samples; 2) use these
analytical results to develop explicit, and computationally efficient
reconstruction schemes; and 3) analyze the performance of the algorithms under
adverse conditions, or when the data are incomplete or corrupted by noise. The
development of a theory and algorithms that perform well under stringent and
realistic situations will help the analysis, processing and management of very
large data sets obtained digitally by new acquisition modalities, and
transmitted or received by communication networks such as the internet, cellular
phones, and other distributed communication systems.
