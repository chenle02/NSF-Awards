Exhumation processes of deep crustal rocks are still poorly understood.
Exceptionally deep exposures of Caledonian continental crust within the Bergen
Arcs of western Norway regionally expose granulite to eclogite transition rocks,
thus offering a window into the roots of a continent-continent collisional
orogenic system that subsequently was unroofed. This project will derive P-T-t
paths from metamorphic relationships, thermobarometry and geochronology.
Systematic observations of the structural relationships combined with the
petrologic and geochronologic results should provide significant insights into
both the tectonic evolution of this deep crustal portion of the Caledonides and
the understanding of orogenic processes in continent-continent collisional
belts.
