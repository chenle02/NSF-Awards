Experiments will continue an investigation of highly- excited molecular
hydrogen. These experiments will include measurements of field ionization and
autoionization spectra of the triplet nd Rydberg series, two-photon spectroscopy
of the triplet np series, and a study of the Stark effect. A new area of
investigation will be a novel set of experiments to study reactive collisions of
Rydberg H2 with other atoms and molecules. Similar measurements will be extended
to other diatomic molecules, including He2, N2. and H1. A new line of research
will aim at improving our understanding of complex atoms, such as iron-group
elements. This research will combine multi-laser measurements of highly-excited
states with MQDT analysis and then will attempt to work downward in energy
toward the complex spectral regions observed by classical emission spectroscopy.
This approach has the potential to provide new insights and understanding of
complex atoms.
