9314295 Maris This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
condensed matter physics between Humphrey J. Maris, Brown University, and
Sebastien Balibar of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. The objective of
their research is to investigate a broad range of nucleation phenomena in liquid
and solid helium. They propose experiments to study how bubbles form in helium
when the liquid is subject to a negative pressure, and how liquid nucleates from
the solid phase. While the U.S. and French institutions have the basic
facilities for optical measurements at low temperature, each one has specialized
equipment and expertise. The U.S. investigator brings to this project
considerable expertise in studies of liquid helium and supercooled liquid
hydrogen. This is complemented by the French group's expertise in solid helium,
and their ability to grow high quality solid helium crystals. The project will
advance our understanding of the properties of helium. ***
