The proposed work is a theoretical investigation into the optical wave
properties and potential novel utilization of crystals having holographically
recorded patterns. These aspects will be considered from the perspective of
applications requiring large information capacities, such as optical
interconnects and switches, optical data processing and computing elements,
neural nets, and other. In particular, the electromagnetic field interactions
that take place inside such crystals will be explored in order to: (a)
characterize and evaluate the actual scattered fields produced by predetermined
patterns, (b) investigate various effects that distort the desired form of such
scattered fields, (c) assess the intrinsic limitations of the scattering
mechanism, and (d) formulate optimal conditions for achieving optical processes
of specific interest. For this purpose, the projected study will employ suitable
canonic models of crystals containing patterns in the form of superposed
gratings. These will be examined by a recently developed technique, which views
the pertinent multiple scattering problem in terms of Feynman diagrams that were
modified and expressed as flow graphs. By further extending and then applying
this approach, accurate information on the complexity of the diffracted field
will be derived. In turn, this information will be used to obtain qualitative
and quantitative data on practical effects such as crosstalk interference,
signal degradation due to crystal imperfections, realizable dynamic range of
operation, deleterious effects due to interface boundaries, and other
performance facets of relevant optical applications.
