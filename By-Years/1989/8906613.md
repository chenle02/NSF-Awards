This grant supports nuclear physics experiments designed to search for and
study intrinsic reflection-asymmetric configurations in odd-A and odd-odd
actinide and rare-earth nuclei. Measurements sensitive to the predicted parity
doublets that are characteristic signatures of such configurations will be
carried out. The results will be compared with theoretical models. In addition,
the principal investigator will prepare an extensive review article concerning
the properties and spectroscopy of the odd-A deformed nuclei.
