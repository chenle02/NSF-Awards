As the use of elastic cloud architectures and mobile computing systems
increases, the need for an additional layer of software based networking arises.
The research community has proposed open standards to specify network services
without coupling specifications with network interfaces, referred to as Software
Defined Networking (SDN). Such a software layer can improve the performance of
network routers and switches. As demands due to network security increase,
aggregation of traffic from diverse applications including high performance
computing will further require novel solutions for the data
plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores hardware as well as software-
based solutions to optimize the SDN data plane with respect to latency,
throughput, and power efficiency. The work investigates novel algorithms, data
structures, and architectures that exploit state-of-the-art technologies
including heterogeneous multi-processor system-on-chip architectures,
multi/many-core processors, and Programmable Gate Arrays to realize flexible
designs for data plane kernels and understand performance tradeoffs. Novel
solutions based on hashing and data structures for large-scale IP lookup as well
as parallel solutions for multi-field packet classification to support high
performance will be developed. The work also develops new techniques for network
virtualization and data aggregation using hybrid trees and virtual engines to
achieve high performance on various platforms. The broader impact of the project
includes providing a flexible and scalable solution for a high performance
Internet backbone to support next generation networking.
