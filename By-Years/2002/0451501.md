The purposes of this research are to further probe the experimental model and to
evaluate the roles of specific emotions as mediators of bias. Our work
distinguishes generic prejudice -- prejudgments about classes of cases and
defendants -- from other forms of juror bias that undercut the impartiality
principle of the Constitution. Peremptory challenges may be the most effective
weapon against generic prejudice. Attorneys use peremptory challenges to remove
venire people who show signs of generic prejudice against a type of client,
charge, or category of offense. However, judges, scholars, and theorists have
attacked peremptory challenges on applied and theoretical grounds. Existing
studies support the utility of a judgment model of generic prejudice to parse
types of bias, but leave open the question of why different fact patterns
produce different types of bias. Our study develops an experimental method to
study generic prejudice in the context of peremptory challenges, and tests the
role of jurors' emotional responses as one explanation for the bias.
