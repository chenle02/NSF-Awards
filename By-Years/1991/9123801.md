This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, focusses on the use of lanthanide ion luminescence to investigate
diffusion-enhanced energy transfer between lanthanide energy donors and
inorganic acceptors. The objective is to develop an understanding of resonant
exchange energy transfer previously shown to dominate these systems and of
chiral discrimination in the energy transfer between chiral lanthanide and
chiral inorganic ions. Also to be examined are lanthanide complexes as
intercalation agents for probes of double-helical DNA and as targeted MRI
agents, further studies of the photophysics of sensitized luminescence for
immunoassay analytical applications, and characterization of siderophore and
model siderophore complexes of lanthanide ions. Molecular mechanics/dynamics
calculations will be used to direct the design of certain reagents, particularly
in chiral recognition and DNA intercalation. %%% This project is concerned with
the use of the special luminescence characteristics of lanthanide ions that
result from laser irradiation to examine a variety of chemical events and to
develop improved methods that may have potential for the study of metal ion-
protein and metal ion-DNA interactions, and ultimately for clinical analyses.
