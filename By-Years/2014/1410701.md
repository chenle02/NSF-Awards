This award will support the running of the 'Sixth IberoAmerican Congress' that
will be held at the City University of New York Graduate Center from May 20-22,
2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference, which runs every three years, is
dedicated to the topic of complex analysis broadly defined. The conference seeks
to bring into contact researchers in this important field from North, Central
and South America, each region having its own strong complex analysis
communities. This year's thematic focus will be on the theory of Riemann
surfaces and the inter-related areas of algebraic curves and moduli, complex
dynamics, Kleinian groups, Teichm√ºller spaces, and hyperbolic geometry. The
invitation list of plenary speakers is distinguished and diverse. Workshop
sessions, to be held in parallel, will provide ample opportunities for young
mathematicians to present their work and to engage other experts in informal
mathematical discussion.
