This award supports cooperative research in aerodynamics by Cesar Farell of the
University of Minnesota and Raphael Guarga of the University of the Republic in
Montevideo, Uruguay. They will study the aerodynamic characteristics of boundary
layers in wind tunnels and various aspects of tunnel design. Atmospheric wind
tunnels have been built in both the Hydraulic Laboratory in Minnesota and at the
School of Engineering in Montevideo. Basic design research will be carried out
on components of open and closed circuit tunnels. Inlets, diffusers and their
effect on flow quality will be investigated along with turbulence management
using pressure tubes, anemometry and flow visualization. Data from both tunnels
will be compared with current models of the aerodynamics of structures, energy
conservation and effect on pedestrians. The growth of wind tunnel research and
wind engineering in Uruguay will benefit from this work as will the capacity to
train and use scientists and engineers. The U.S. will benefit through added
manpower and a broadened work scope of different component geometries and
scales. Thus the goal of the SDC program of mutual benefit to both will be
fulfilled.
