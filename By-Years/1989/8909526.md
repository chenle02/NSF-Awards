The last few years have been witness to renewed interest in the analysis of
models of growth because of recent contributions of the basic capital model to
our understanding of a wide variety of economic phenomena. This project develops
convex models of endogenous growth with special emphasis on the following areas:
(1) the analysis of the determinants of growth and the possibility of sustained
growth; (2) the study of the process of innovation or new product development;
and (3) the study of the dynamic effects of taxation. The project explores the
connections between these three areas and extends this work into open economy
settings. This research should provide new insights into economic growth,
technological change and tax policy. Previous work by the investigator tying the
literatures on dynamic taxation and the determinants of growth demonstrates that
different tax policies and trade policies can generate permanent differences in
the growth rates of different countries. This project will extend the past work
with special emphasis on the effect of market power, education and different
economic policies on sustained economic growth in an open economy.
