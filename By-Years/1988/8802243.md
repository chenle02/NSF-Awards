New methods of evaluating the performance of acoustic materials especially at
high sound levels are important if progress is to be made in such fields as
aircraft noise source reduction. This project develops analytical models and new
experimental procedures for determining surface sound absorption and internal
sound propagation in a variety of common porous media at high sound pressure
levels. The project contains both a theoretical and an experimental phase. In
the experimental phase, an attempt is made herein to develop a simple nonlinear
theory which predicts sound propagation in air saturated perfectly rigid media
at high intensity. This theoretical development is based on work initially done
by Forchheimer and normally used to describe steady flows at high particle
velocity through porous media. The theory is experimentally tested on a variety
of porous materials including cellular, layered fine fiber, and nonconsolidated
granular materials all of varying porosity and structural frame stiffness. The
results should be of great value to engineers and scientists who deal with sound
propagation and absorptions at high intensity levels in both commercial and
military applications.
