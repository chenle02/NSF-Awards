Mesozoic plutons in the Klamath Mountains province (CA) intruded a structurally
deformed oceanic crustal section and represent the eroded roots of an island arc
volcanic belt. Emplacement of these magma brackets a major tectonic episode (the
Nevadan orogeny) during which the style of magmatism changed significantly. This
proposal will involve a detailed geochemical and petrologic study of four
plutons spanning this time interval. Mineralogical data will be acquired to
evaluate physical conditions (pressure, temperature, etc.) attending magma
formation during the transition in magmatic style. Geochemical and isotopic data
will be used to elucidate processes of magma evolution. This integrated study
will hopefully provide important insights into the deep crustal processes
associated with island arc magmatism.
