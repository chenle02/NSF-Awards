9513462 Berndt This award will support the travel and minor research costs for
five American investigators under the direction of Dr. Christopher Berndt,
Department of Materials Science and Engineering from the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, to enable the group to conduct cooperative research
regarding the thermal spray processing of polymers with a group of Australian
researchers from the Department of Materials Engineering at Monash University
under the guidance of Prof. George Simon. The project aims to improve the
quality and types of polymers and composites that can be thermally sprayed as
coatings on metallic substrates. Lower melting points and the macromolecular
structure will influence lamellae formation, diffusion and oxidation mechanisms.
This project brings together the thermal spray expertise from the American
researchers with the Australian polymer experts. Fundamental explanations will
provide insight to polymer adhesion and environmental degradation. This research
is important in promoting the technology into petrochemical and automotive
industries requiring corrmsion resistant barrier coatings. The collaboration in
Australia is supported through the Department of Industry, Science and
Technology.
