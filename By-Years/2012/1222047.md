Abstract: People routinely encounter TV, radio and web messages that compare an
abstract and complicated issues to a simpler, more concrete concept. For
example, a new report that the economy veered off course compares the abstract
economy to a simpler vehicle, while the headline "Banks Tighten Their Grip"
compares complicated banking policies to physical grasping. The current project
is based on conceptual metaphor theory, which predicts that metaphors are not
simply a matter of words: rather, they are a tool of thought that people use to
understand abstract concepts. It is expected that metaphorical framings are not
simply interpreted as mere figures of speech, but have an important and
predictable influence on how people think and feel about issues.

Eight experiments test the hypothesis that exposure to metaphorical framing will
lead people to form attitudes toward an issue by drawing on their knowledge of
the concrete concept to which it is compared, despite the fact that the issue
and the concrete concept are unrelated.

One important implication of metaphorical framing theory is that metaphorical
framing will have a greater or lesser impact on attitudes depending on how the
person initially understands the attitude. The proposed experiments therefore
test the hypothesis that volunteers who are initially led to focus on vague and
complicated aspects of an issue will be more likely to rely on a metaphorical
framing to form their attitudes than are volunteers who are initially led to
focus on clear and simple aspects of the issue. The proposed experiments also
test the hypothesis that metaphorical framings are less influential when they do
not match a person?s prior conceptualization of the topic.

Overall, the proposed research will help us better understand how everyday
communications, many of which are based on metaphors, influence everyday
thinking. In addition, students will receive training and experience in
conducting scientific research.
