Funds are requested to help support the Material Measurement Symposium to be
held at the Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Francisco,
California, April 9-13, 2012. The funds requested will be used to support
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending the meeting.

The Material Measurement Symposium will consist more than 100 conference papers,
including 15 invited talks, 58 contributed talks, and more than 30 contributed
posters over 15 technical sessions (13 oral and 2 poster). The focus of the
symposium is on emerging characterization techniques that hold the promise the
help reveal the microscopic mechanisms underpinning the performance and life
time of energy storage and conversion systems. This symposium will bring
together scientists and engineers across various disciplines to address the most
challenging issues in characterizing materials and energy systems in transient
and nonequilibrium states.
