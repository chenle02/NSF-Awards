The goal of the project is to improve the cell and molecular biology curriculum
at the Department of Biology at Central Michigan University, The project will
(1) develop a hands-on, instrument-based, course in microscopy; (2) improve the
quality and effectiveness of laboratories in existing courses in Cell Biology,
Molecular Biology, Methods in Molecular Biology, and Electron Microscopy for a
strongly research oriented undergraduate program. The equipment requested
includes high quality light microscopes equipped with optics and accessories
designed with multiple applications of brightfield, phase, polarizing, DIC and
epifluorescence, and a state-of-the-art image processing and analysis system.
These new microscopes and one existing transmission and two scanning electron
microscopes, one of which is equipped for x-ray (EDS), will interface, by film
and video, with the image processor. Bench-type laboratory courses and
activities which expose students to the practical use of instrumentation in real
experimental situations will use this integrated imaging system.
