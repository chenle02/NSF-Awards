Equipment for the HERMES experiment at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg, Germany
will be constructed. This experiment will provide new and precise information on
the spin structure of the nucleon at the quark-gluon level. Polarized gas
targets of hydrogen, deuterium, and 3He will be used in the polarized beam
stored in the HERA electron storage ring. The equipment will be built by groups
based at Caltech, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Illinois.
