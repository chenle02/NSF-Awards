Experimental tests of the theory of spin exchange collisions in ground state
hydrogen, including hyperfine effects, will be performed. Measurements of
hyperfine induced frequency shift cross sections will be made near .5 Kelvin in
collaboration with the University of British Columbia using their supercooled
hydrogen maser. The same measurements but at 10 Kelvin will be performed at
Williams College using the apparatus developed during the previous grant. The
results will test the theoretical treatment of low energy atomic collisions to
the degree to which collisions between hydrogen atoms may limit the stability of
cryogenic hydrogen maser frequency standards.
