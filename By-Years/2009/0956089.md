This project was solicited by the Biological Oceanography Program to support a
community planning activity for a new interagency program (CAMEO, or Comparative
Analysis of Marine Ecosystem Organization). CAMEO will be implemented as a
partnership between the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service and the National
Science Foundation Division of Ocean Sciences. The purpose of the program is to
strengthen the scientific basis for an ecosystem approach to the stewardship of
ocean and living marine resources. Therefore, the broader impacts of this
activity include relevance to ecosystem and fisheries management. A Program
Office will be established at the Marine Biological Laboratory to organize an
initial meeting of the CAMEO Scientific Steering Committee to begin to develop a
CAMEO science plan.
