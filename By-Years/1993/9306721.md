A 21-year record of butterfly faunal composition and seasonality has been
obtained along an environmental gradient across northern California, from sea
level over the crest of the Sierra Nevada. Some 175 species have been monitored.
This data set potentially bears on many ecological questions, including the
nature and stability of interspecific association, the determinants of
biological seasonality, the sensitivity of species to fluctuations in weather
and the potential of entire faunas to respond to directional climatic change.
The data are in binary (presence- absence) form, and satisfactory statistical
methods for extracting such information from them need to be developed, tested
and refined. Recent advances in a method called "conjunction analysis" are
encouraging. This project will maintain the established sampling program. %%%
Research projects of this type are, in addition to being important to basic
ecology, of significance to the better management and conservation of vulnerable
species. Additionally, such studies may bear on pest management approaches for
agriculture since many butterflies and moths can reach epidemic densities.
