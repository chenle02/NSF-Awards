The investigator studies a variety of problems concerning interface dynamics in
fluids and materials. The problems are 1) control of droplet formation and 2)
microstructral evolution in anisotropic and inhomogeneous elastic media. He
brings together physical experiments, modeling, mathematical and numerical
analysis, and large-scale scientific computations to study certain fundamental
problems related to interface motion, such as interfacial pinch-off and
evolutions of interfaces in three-dimensional systems. One of the major goals is
to develop and apply start-of-the-art computational tools with emphasis on
utilizing adaptive methods and parallel computing, and designing robust
numerical methods for integro-differential equations involving multiple physical
effects with multiple spatial and temporal scales. The investigator studies some
fundamental problems related to multiphase phenomenon in physical systems. In
particular, he develops mathematical models and performs large-scale
computations to investigate diffusional evolution of microstructure in
solid/solid phase transitions and control of droplet formation in a fluid/fluid
system. Many structural metals, such as steels, aluminum alloys and superalloys,
are products of solid-state diffusional transformations. The multi-phase
microstructure resulting from such transformations is a key variable in setting
the macroscopic mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength and toughness
of the alloy. A goal of this study is to model and simulate the process of
microstructure evolution through mathematics and computations, and eventually to
provide engineers information on how to generate different microstructures with
desirable material properties. The investigation of droplets concerns how to
control the formation of drops of many sizes (frequently referred to as
satellite drops) in a situation like a dripping faucet or in the breakup of a
jet. The presence of satellite drops is undesirable in many practical situations
such as in ink jet printers and disk atomizers. He studies the use of focused,
external acoustic waves for the control of satellite drops. If successful, this
idea can be applied to many modern technologies.
