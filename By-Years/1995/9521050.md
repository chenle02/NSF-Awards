9521050 Newman This grant is to provide partial support to the Seismological
Society of America for preparation of a special issue of the Bulletin of the
Seismological Society of America devoted to the January 17, 1994 Northridge,
California, M=6.7 earthquake. Professor Keiiti Aki, Science Director of the
Southern California Earthquake Center, will be the special editor for this
series of papers. The issue will appear in February, 1996. The Northridge
earthquake is the most costly natural disaster to strike the United States even
though the size of the earthquake is not particularly large when compared to
recent earthquakes that have struck the U.S. or other regions in the world.
However, this earthquake occurred in a highly urbanized area. It also occurred
in an area that is well instrumented for seismological, geodetic, geophysical
and engineering post-earthquake studies. This issue of the BSSA will provide the
scientific and engineering communities a timely framework for the data, analysis
and conclusions regarding the Northridge earthquake. This project is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
