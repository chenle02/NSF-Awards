This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in robotics
and control theory between Mark Spong of the University of Illinois and Rogelio
Lozano of the University of Compiegne. The objective of their research is to
study adaptive control of underactuated mechanical systems. This class of
systems is quite broad and encompasses both holonomic and nonholonomic systems
such as balancing and walking robots, space robots, flexible link robots, and
flexible joint robots. They will apply recently developed methods of integrator
backstepping to underactuated systems. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration considerable expertise in robot dynamics and nonlinear control.
This is complemented by the French investigator's experience in adaptive control
theory and its application to the area of robotics. The proposal will further
understanding of these systems and their potential for application in
manufacturing.
