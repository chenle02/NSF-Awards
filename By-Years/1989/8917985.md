The embryonic development of the Drosophila salivary glands provides several
advantages for analysis of the genes involved in determination and
differentiation. In the ectoderm of the germ band extended embryo, the glands
begin development at a defined position which suggests the involvement of
several known pattern regulating genes. Differentiation then occurs within a few
hours, implying that there are few steps leading from commitment to
differentiation. This proposal suggests methods to identify genes acting in the
salivary glands at this early stage and to order them into a pathway for
salivary gland development. Salivary gland marker genes will be identified using
P-lacZ transposons that express beta-galactosidase in tissue specific patterns
that include the salivary glands. Embryos homozygous for lethal transposon
inserts will be examined for phenotypes that alter salivary gland development.
For non-lethal inserts, mutations will be induced by imprecise transposon
excision to test whether an adjacent gene is required for the development of
salivary glands. For some inserts that are shown to be within or near to a gene
that is important for salivary gland development, regions flanking the insert
will be cloned by plasmid rescue and these regions searched for embryonic
salivary gland transcripts. To get clues to gene function, exonic regions will
be sequenced and examined for homology with known genes. Finally, mutations in
required genes will be examined for effects on beta-galactosidase expression in
several enhancer trap lines. Results form these tests will help define a pathway
for embryonic salivary gland development. %%% Investigations of the genes that
form patterns in early drosophila development have been spectacularly successful
in solving the longstanding riddle of how a single fertilized egg cell develops
the intricate and regular pattern that characterizes the mature embryo. This
proposal is an attempt to extend those studies downstream to the actual
formation of a differentiated organ, the salivary gland.
