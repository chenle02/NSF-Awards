Sediments from oceans and continents constitute a valuable recorder for
fluctuations of geomagnetic field direction and intensity. Paleodirectional
studies from such sediments have made important contributions to
magnetostratigraphy, continental margin accretionary tectonics, and to core
processes which lead to reversals and secular variation of the geomagnetic
field. Reliable paleointensity data can provide a new higher resolution tool for
magnetostratigraphy and constraints for unique descriptions of geomagnetic field
models to explain reversals and secular variation. This study will elucidate
important effects of clay and silica content on the recorded paleodirection and
intensity of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and carry out a combined
laboratory and field study to develop a better acquisition model for ocean
sediment magnetization and design more reliable techniques for extracting
geomagnetic paleointensity from sediments.
