The scientific tasks of this project include modeling and data acquisition
related to improving our understanding of large scale plasma structures in the
high latitude ionosphere. The electrodynamics of auroral arcs will be studied
using plasma line measurements to be conducted using the Sondrestrom radar
facility, which has been recently upgraded to facilitate such measurements.
Initial modeling efforts will be aimed at understanding the origin and complex
evolution of polar cap patches and sun aligned arcs under north- and southward
IMF conditions. To provide realistic inputs for the modeling effort and to
provide a comparison for the output, data which the PI helped in acquiring as
part of the CEDAR-organized HLPS (High- Latitude Plasma Structure) campaign will
be used along with other data from a variety of ground-based and in-situ
sources.
