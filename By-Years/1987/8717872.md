Zuckerman will make observations in the optical, infrared, and millimeter
regimes of: 1) dust disks (perhaps pre-planetary) around main sequence stars,
with emphasis on Beta Pictoris, 2) cool companions and dust clouds around T
Tauri and other pre- main-sequence stars, and 3) dust and molecules around mass-
losing evolved stars, including planetary nebulae. Techniques include use of the
stellar coronagraph, in the optical and infrared, and infrared speckle
interferometry. Planets are thought to form from dusty gas accumulated around
young stars. Dust disks suggestive of planetary formation have recently been
detected around a few stars. Zuckerman will pursue this and closely related
subjects with state-of-the-art instrumentation, including a camera that blocks
out the light from the central star and a computer-based technique that yields
very sharp infrared pictures. Zuckerman is a co-discoverer of a possible
planetary companion of a nearby star.
