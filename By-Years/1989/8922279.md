The Rosensteil School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of
Miami has requested several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed
in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in
association with the two research vessels the institution operates. A
substantial part of the ships' operating schedule during 1990 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ships and of the University to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Scintillation counter for
measurements of radio-isotope tracers and other chemical parameters, -Disk
drive, laser printer, terminals and other peripheral computer equipment for
increasing the reliability and performance of shared-use, sea-going computing
capabilities, -Spare circuit boards for the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
system that makes precision measurements of subsurface circulation features,
-Deck unit for controlling CTD that obtains detailed profiles of seawater
conductivity and temperature as a function of depth, -Fluorometer and
transmissometer for measuring chlorophyll and other optical properties in the
water column, -Dissolved oxygen probe and precision temperature sensor for
improving dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements at depth in the water
column, and -Conductivity fast response sensor for attaching to the CTD. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the Institution
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
