This project, Science Education for Equity Reform, (SEER) is a response to
demographic trends which show that the population of 18-22 year olds in the
1990s will be both smaller in magnitude and different in composition. If the
needs of the nation are to be met, the demographic data affirm that we must
remove those barriers which keep females and minorities from choosing careers in
science and engineering. The two-fold objective of Project SEER is to improve,
both qualitatively and quantitatively, the science instruction at the K-5 levels
and, at the same time, to achieve a condition of equity which allows full
educational opportunity for each child regardless of gender, ethnic origin, or
any other factor which limits achievement. SEER is a pilot project to be carried
out in the six elementary schools of University City, Missouri School District.
This demonstration project is destined to serve as a model for potential
adoption by other school districts that want to achieve equitable science
learning for all children. One hundred elementary teachers from University City,
Missouri will be selected to participate in this program which includes a 3-week
physics institute for teachers K-5, a 1-week curriculum institute for teachers
K-2 and development of curriculum models and activities for grades 3-5 during
the summer of 1989. In addition there will be academic year physics institutes
followed by a 1-week curriculum institute for teachers and the refinement of the
K-2 curriculum during the summer of l990. The Educational Equity Center of the
Mid- Continent Regional Educational Laboratory (MCREL) will work with the
American Institute of Physics on this program. An amount equal to about 20% of
the NSF request is being cost-shared by University City School district and
private sector funding.
