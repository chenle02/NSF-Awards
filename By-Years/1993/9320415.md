9320415 Tamargo This proposal is for the growth and characterization of novel
ternary and quaternary II-VI compound semiconductors and heterostructures that
will provide a range of unique properties needed for the design of practical
visible light emitters. At present, rudimentary blue-green lasers based on
ZnCdSe/ZnSe heterostructures have been demonstrated. The ternary is the small
bandgap material or well. However, non-ideal band offsets between those two
materials and defects due to lattice mismatch within the II-VI structure and
with the substrate limit the performance of the device. As in III-V technology,
it is possible to combine binary II-VI compounds to form ternary and quaternary
alloys and thus adjust the band structure ad lattice constant of the materials
to those desired. Very few of these II-VI mixed alloys have been grown and
investigated. It will be enhanced through several collaborations for additional
materials characterization. Simple devices using those heterostructures which
posses more promising properties, will also be investigated. ***
