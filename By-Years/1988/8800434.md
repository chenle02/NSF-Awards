Seismic isolation is now in the process of moving from the research laboratory
into practice. It has been enthusiastically accepted in Japan but less so in the
USA. The reasons for the apparent reluctance in the USA could be a lack of
awareness of recent research results and recent developments in implementation
of this new technology. This research project is to develop a U.S. National
Program on Seismic Isolation for the implementation of base isolation in the
U.S. and for the dissemination of design methodologies and their eventual
incorporation into building codes. The planning for the program will be based on
the research agenda developed by the workshop conducted by the Applied
Technology Council to identify unsolved problems and unresolved research issues
in base isolation. The objective of the research is to develop a management
structure, research program and technology transfer mechanism to achieve the
goals outlined in the previous workshop.//
