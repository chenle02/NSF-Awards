9552914 Sullivan With a discipline focus of physics and mathematics this Young
Scholars project would enroll 30 middle school girls for each of two summers.
Using Seattle University as a base, during the four week summer program, they
will work with practicing scientists on a series of field, laboratory and
computer simulation activities to understand wave behavior and scientific
methodology. These activities will be complemented with field trips to
industrial and environmental sites. During the following academic year they will
work on a small group research projects. The fourth week of the summer is spent
at Camp Hamilton in the Cascade Mountains where the young scholars will make
environmental measurements on Lake Hannah and construct a model of the lake
bottom from soundings they've taken.
