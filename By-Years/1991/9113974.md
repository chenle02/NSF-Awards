Two officials of the State Committee on Science and Higher Education of the
RSFSR (Russian Federation), Drs. Vladimir Kinilev and Marat Guriev, will
participate in discussions with U.S. university and state education officials in
a series of meetings and site visits organized by Georgetown University with
primary support from the Ford Foundation. The main purpose of including these
two officials is to initiate discussions on potential cooperation on the issue
of the equivalency of degrees and academic training programs between the Soviet
Union and the United States. This is becoming an increasingly important issue to
both countries as growing numbers of scientists and engineers trained in the
Soviet Union come to the U.S. for temporary or permanent work.
