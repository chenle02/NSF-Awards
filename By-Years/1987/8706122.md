This research program is concerned with the numerical evaluation of singular
(improper) integrals and numerical solutions of singular integral equations.
With regard to the latter, effort will be directed to establishing the
equivalence of the approximations between singular integral equations and
Fredholm equations as well as the implementation of the numerical schemes on
parallel processors. The results of the research program will have direct
applications in tomography, fracture mechanics and astronomy, just to name a few
areas.
