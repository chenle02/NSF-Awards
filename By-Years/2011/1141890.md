Time series data, from ocean moorings, on key aspects of evolving ocean
properties are of considerable importance in assessing the condition of the
ocean system. They are needed, for example, their understand how the oceans are
warming, and how they continue to uptake greenhouse gases such as CO2.

The Cape Adare Long Term Mooring (CALM) program goal was to observe the bottom
water export from the Ross Sea to the deep ocean. To accomplish this two
instrumented moorings were set on the continental slope off Cape Adare (western
Ross Sea, Antarctica), positioned to capture the export of Antarctic Bottom
Water (AABW), some of the coldest and densest water found in the global ocean.
Data records for the moorings spans over some four years in this very remote
part of the ocean. The CALM analysis will address some specific objectives: ?
Characterize the temperature, salinity and current variability associated with
the Ross Sea AABW export. ? Examine the linkages between observed variability to
regional tides, atmosphere and sea ice forcing. ? Relate the Ross Sea AABW
export fluctuations to the larger scale climate system dynamics, such as ENSO
and SAM, and to AABW formation along other margins of Antarctica, e.g. the
Weddell Sea
