Alternative definitions of partial ancillarity, in the presence of nuisance
parameters, will be examined with regard to loss of information involved when
inference is based on the conditional distribution given the values of such
partial ancillary statistics. Similarly, definitions of partial sufficiency will
be examined with respect to loss of information when inference is based on the
marginal distribution of such partial sufficiency statistics. Finally, a
generalized likelihood principle will be formulated for inference concerning
parameters of interest in the presence of the nuisance parameters. This is
foundational research in statistics for data structures confounded with
variables other than those of research interest. Statistical methods based on
partial information have become quite popular in practice and this foundational
work is needed and timely.
