This award is in support of a one year standard grant to investigate ice ocean
interactions during the late Quaternary in the Hudson Strait region of the
northwest North Atlantic, which is the major sediment and meltwater route for
deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Sediment cores will be obtained during
a 1992 cruise to Hudson Strait and Frobisher Bay and these will be analyzed for:
1) carbon-14 of foraminifera, 20 stable oxygen and carbon isotopes of planktonic
and benthic foraminifera, 3) down core mineralogy, and 4) changes in
foraminifera species
