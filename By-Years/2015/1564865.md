Kenyon College will award scholarships to low income, academically talented
students, supporting them with high-impact practices (HIPs) to increase their
persistence and graduation. Scholars will be engaged over four years, exposing
them to HIPs early in their undergraduate careers, since the majority of
students nationwide who leave STEM fields do so during their first two years.
Activities begin with a summer learning community, and continue with structured
and unstructured service learning projects, faculty-student mentoring, and
internships and research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four annual cohorts
of 12 low-income, high-achieving students with interests across the STEM
disciplines will receive scholarships. The project will test and evaluate the
impact of STEM-focused HIPs beneficial to first-year students, aiming to
increase persistence of these STEM students, especially those from groups with
traditionally lower STEM degree completion rates. The research component of the
project will also identify HIPs most likely to result in students pursuing STEM
careers. An external expert will provide formative and summative evaluation of
program impact, as well as future sustainability. Kenyon will contribute
findings of best practices to the field, and will make special effort to share
research emerging from its testing of HIPs and other programs in the liberal
arts, for which there is little STEM-specific data.
