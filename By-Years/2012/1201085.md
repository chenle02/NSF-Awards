Public Abstract: "Objective Operational Learning and Applications"

Andrew Lim and J. George Shanthikumar

The research objective of this award is to study a general approach called
"Objective Operational Learning" for estimating an objective function and
optimizing a stochastic system. The essential feature of this approach is that
it is a hybrid between classical model-based approaches to stochastic
optimization and purely non-parametric data driven methods that require minimal
assumptions. Its advantage is that it allows the decision maker to incorporate
structural knowledge of the system (which may only be partially correct) into
the initial model, but to become increasingly data-driven and less dependent on
these initial assumptions as the data set increases in size. The goal of the
research is to show how objective operational learning can be applied to
problems of interest in operations research and management science, and to
establish theoretical properties such as small sample performance and asymptotic
convergence of this approach. If successful, the research will lead to the
development of new data driven methods for optimizing stochastic systems that
perform well when the size of the data set is small but with attractive large
sample properties, and insight into how these methods can be used through a
number of case studies involving applied problems of interest to industry.
Applications of interest include (but are not restricted to) staff and patient
scheduling applications in healthcare and service systems, pricing and revenue
management problems, and inventory control. Outcomes of research will be
disseminated through journal and conference publications and research
presentations, undergraduate research opportunities, and advanced undergraduate
and graduate level courses and seminars.
