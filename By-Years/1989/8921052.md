This study will provide systemic evidence about the institutionalization and
transformation of the citizens' movement against drunk driving. It will
contribute to our understanding of the role of citizen action in responding to
social problems of wide community concern. Previously, the PI has been funded by
NSF for three prior stages of the research. In 1990, he will survey all new
local groups formed since 1986. Trends in group organizational structure,
mobilization and efforts will be used to answer questions about social movement
organizational careers, the dynamics of the relationship between media cycles
and movement cycles, the changing gender composition of successful movements,
and the effects of growing opposition.
