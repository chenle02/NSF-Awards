The proposal is for an exploratory project to study and prototype software
protection techniques designed to prevent attacks on input programs by reverse
engineering. A comprehensive study will address the effectiveness of debugger
and emulator detection mechanisms. Techniques will be developed to counter
program slicing analysis and a prototype will be built to enable refinement and
study of new software protection methods. This work directly addresses the
enforcement of content access rights in Digital Rights Management (DRM)
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goals of the project are: to study and
develop new software protection algorithms that are effective enough to defeat
feasible reverse engineering efforts to crack protected programs; and prototype
these algorithms in an operational system that can then be used to measure
performance and effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
