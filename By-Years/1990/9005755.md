The objective of this research is to develop a real-time intelligent assembly
system which integrates the operations from the assembly design process to the
optimal assembly schedule generation. The goals of the research are: (1) obtain
the precedence knowledge of the assembled object automatically either from a
rule-based system, or from neural network learning schemes; (2) find the mapping
between the precedence knowledge and investigated neural networks; (3) generate
the optimal assembly schedule based on the mapping between the precedence
knowledge and the network and algorithms; and (4) implement a systematic
intelligent assembly system which integrates the design process and the
generation of the optimal assembly schedule. The system is applicable to
automobile assembly, electronic circuit board assembly, industrial flexible
manufacturing and other fields related to the precedence-constraint planning and
scheduling problems.
