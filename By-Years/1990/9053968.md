Prince George's Community College (PGCC) and the University of Maryland at
College Park (UMCP) will conduct a model program in cooperation with the Prince
George's County Public Schools. The program is designed to address the shortages
of woman and monorities among engineers and scientists. The program, Sciences
and You (SAY), will strengthen 30 women students' backgrounds in 1-3 weeks
summer institutes, after graduation from high school and enroll them in a two
year mathematics or science transfer program at PGCC. They will complete their
baccalaureate degrees at UMCP. The goal is to bring at least 50% of the original
cohort to graduation in science/engineering fields. Internships, monitoring,
tutorials, field trips, parent/student evenings are among the program
activities.
