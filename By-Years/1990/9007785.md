The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to carry out fundamental studies to
characterize intrinsic kinetics and adsorption parameters for proteins in ion
exchange and affinity chromatography systems. The PI also proposes to establish
the methodology for designing large-scale chromatography for proteins. Several
model proteins which have well characterized molecular weights, isoelectric
points, amino acid sequences, and three dimensional structures will be studied.
Computer simulations which have been previously developed for isocratic
operations will be extended to gradient elution systems. Nonlinear isotherms,
size exclusion, mass transfer resistances, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics,
and other time-dependent adsorption phenomena such as protein aggregation and
conformational changes will be considered in the model. The model and
simulations will be validated with column experiments on ion exchange and
affinity chromatography. After validation, the simulations can be used for
designing more efficient and cost-effective processes by choosing appropriate
design and operating parameters, such as buffer pH, types of buffer, salt
concentration, feed size, particle size, and flow rate.
