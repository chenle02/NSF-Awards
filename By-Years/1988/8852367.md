The University of Kentucky Hazard Community College will purchase a complement
of scientific and computational equipment to improve instruction in introductory
physics laboratory courses. The equipment, which includes air tracks,
oscilloscopes, function generators, microcomputer interfaces, sensors, and
motion transducers will allow students to obtain "hands-on" experience in the
use of modern techniques for data acquisition and analysis. The improved speed
and accuracy achievable with this equipment will allow students to explore a
wide range of basic physical phenomena, and should help them gain greater
understanding of the underlying physical principles. The University of Kentucky
Hazard Community College will match this NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
