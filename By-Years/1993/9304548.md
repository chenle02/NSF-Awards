Infrared spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that hydrogen is structurally
bound within all of the major "anhydrous" mantle minerals as an OH- for O=
substitution in the crystal lattice. This substitution may represent the primary
storage mechanism for water in the upper mantle. This proposal seeks to carry
out analyses on a variety of samples to determine the hydrogen isotopic
composition of nominally anhydrous minerals in relation to other geochemical
parameters. These results will provide insights into the nature of water in the
mantle and will set constraints on the earth's degassing, water recycling, and
the conditions associated with the formation of a variety of mantle suites.
