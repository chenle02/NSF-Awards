This proposal addresses the problem of Applied Optics and Light Instrumentation
for the Graphic Arts student. The program is directed toward a non-science and
Publication audience. It is proposed to set up experiments using equipment from
the graphics industry rather than the "traditional" introductory physics
experiment in lights. This is a program which should contribute to an increase
in scientific literacy. //
