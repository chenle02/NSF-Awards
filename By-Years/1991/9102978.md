The principal investigator will study the problem of imbedding three
dimensional CR manifolds into Euclidean space. He will approach the problem of
imbeddibility of CR manifolds in terms of a moduli space and attempt to describe
those CR manifolds which are imbeddible by relating the problem to a circle
action on the boundary of a convex domain. In particular he will try to
understand how the circle action changes when the CR structure is perturbed. A
CR manifold is an important abstract structure in the geometry of spaces of
complex numbers. To better understand these spaces one would like to visualize
them as subspace of the usual Euclidean space such as our everyday three
dimensional space. The principal investigator will attempt to describe when this
visualization or "imbedibility" is possible.
