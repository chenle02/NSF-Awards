The studies address through investigation of students in Arizona High School
summer programs how students learn, understand and manipulate scientific models
of the carbon cycle and the water cycle. The investigators of this project have
identified problems that on-line tutors have with creating conditions for
students to regulate their own behavior. Instead of taking advantage of the
available learning opportunities, some students ask for hints until the tutor
gives them the correct answer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators
hypothesize that lasting benefits require changing students beliefs about
shallow compared with deep modeling practices and breaking their modeling habits
and instilling new ones. They intend to add affective learning companions to the
on-line tutors. The modules use the teachable agent metaphor called Betty's
Brain. &lt;br/&gt;The study analysis will be conducted in high school summer
schools in Arizona for students that are mostly Native Americans. The students
are self-selected for attending the summer school. Data collection will include
student logs, verbal protocols and affect sensor data from the summer school
participants (approximately 30 students). Three studies will be conducted: 1. to
develop a meta tutoring tool, 2. to develop an affective learning agent with
verbal and physical gestures, and 3. a measure of whether the new tool results
in increases in learning. The analysis will involve causal inference and data
mining of student records of their activities. The third phase of the learning
will compare students who use one agent with the teachable agent; a second group
will compare two agents, the teachable agent and the meta-tutor; and a third
group will compare three agents. The outcome of the study is a developed and
tested tool to increase student learning and statistical analysis of records
maintained by the investigators of student activities with the teachable agent.
The study should help indicate whether computer tutors are more effective if
they have integrated features that mimic human performance.
