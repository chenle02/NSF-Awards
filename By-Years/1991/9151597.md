The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a diode array uv/vis spectrophotometer
for use in several upper division laboratory courses. With the aid of this
equipment new experiments reflecting the importance of inorganic materials and
bioinorganic chemistry are being introduced to the undergraduate curriculum. The
study of the size-dependent bandgap and particle size of semiconductor clusters
and the oxidation of iron porphyrin complexes are two examples of the innovative
