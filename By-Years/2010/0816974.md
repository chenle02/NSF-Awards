Proteasome-mediated protein degradation is a major regulatory mechanism in the
cell. Recent studies from Dr. Xie's laboratory have shown that the proteasome
homeostasis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by a
negative feedback circuit in which the transcription factor Rpn4 upregulates the
proteasome genes and is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In addition to the
proteasome genes, Rpn4 controls the expression of numerous other genes,
including a number of key stress response genes. Interestingly, the RPN4 gene
itself is induced by a wide variety of environmental stresses. These
observations indicate that Rpn4 serves as a hub in a stress response network
onto which the environmental stimuli "fan in" and from which the response
signals "fan out". The Rpn4-proteasome negative feedback circuit gauges the
output signals by keeping the Rpn4 protein level in check and therefore is
considered a core regulator of the Rpn4-mediated stress response network. The
main focus of Dr. Xie's research is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Rpn4
degradation. This is a crucial step to understand how the Rpn4-proteasome
negative feedback circuit operates in response to environmental stress.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will make a significant
contribution to the training and education of students at various levels.
Graduate and undergraduate students and high school students have participated
in this study. More graduate students will be recruited to this research.
Students will not only receive hands-on training of the powerful techniques of
yeast genetics and molecular biology, but also learn how to ask and solve
important biological questions. The information obtained from this study will
directly benefit protection of the environment.
