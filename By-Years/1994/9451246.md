9451246 Turner A 1-meter optical spectrograph will be acquired, which will
enable students in our advanced physics laboratory to conduct three new
experiments: (1) a high-resolution study of the spectra of hydrogen and
deuterium, and use of these data to determine the mass of the deuteron and the
effects of spin-orbit coupling, (2) a study of the Zeeman effect in Hg, and (3)
a study of the continuous and absorption spectra of the sun and of the
absorption spectrum of the earth's atmosphere, and use of these data to
investigate the Doppler shift and how it can be used to determine the radius of
and distance to the sun. These projects, which are modeled after ones at
Middlebury College and MIT, will supplement and complement existing exercises in
the areas of electronics and atomic and nuclear physics. Data will be analyzed
and visualized using the department's NSF-funded computational physics
laboratory.
