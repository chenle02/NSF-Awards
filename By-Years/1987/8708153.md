Surface infrared spectroscopy will be applied in this study of gallium arsenide
anodic oxidation. The technique will be used both for the characterization of
pre-oxidized gallium arsenide, and for investigation of the oxide as it is being
formed. The surface infrared spectroscopy will be applied as an in-situ,
multiple internal reflection geometry to directly measure the chemical
composition and rate of growth of anodic oxides at the interface between gallium
arsenide and the growth electrolyte. This will enable determination of the
reaction mechanisms of the oxide growth, the chemical kinetics of the reactions,
and the composition of the oxide layer produced. In addition, the effects of
process parameters on kinetics and on composition will be investigated to
determine optimum growth conditions. Advantages of native oxides as insulating
layers on semiconductors include simplicity of processing, dependable film
adhesion and system purity. The anodic oxidation process for gallium arsenide
has been demonstrated as very promising. Previous studies have shown that the
process is kinetically controlled, however the chemical kinetics and mechanisms
of the oxidation reactions are not yet known. The successful passivation of
gallium arsenide by native oxides has been a barrier to their full scale
application in integrated electronics and optics.
