This award provides funding for the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics
(CIG) to build and sustain essential cyberinfrastructure and computational
capacity for geodynamics and seismology. Over the past decade, CIG has developed
and disseminated widely-used, open-source codes for research and education in
computational seismology, mantle convection, magma dynamics, short- and long-
term lithospheric and crustal deformation, and geodynamo modeling. CIG has
changed the culture in computational geophysics research by improving scientific
software development practices and has influenced the education of hundreds of
geodynamicists. CIG?s approach towards writing and disseminating scientific
software has become indispensable to its community and has established and
sustained deep ties to computational sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific
computation is integral to solid Earth geosciences, allowing us to understand
and quantify the processes that shape Earth. Computational models link
observations and quantitative models describing the Earth?s interior and
evolution. This project will continue the development and dissemination of high
quality scientific software to enable cutting edge geodynamics modeling, and to
prepare a diverse workforce to address fundamental science questions. While
CIG?s primary mission is development of high-quality open-source software, a
growing role is the education and development of geoscientists who are prepared
to effectively use and advance computation in research and teaching. Workshops,
hackathons, meeting special sessions, and tutorials foster emerging
computational geoscientists who represent the long-term legacy of the project.
