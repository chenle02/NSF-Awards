This research equipment award is made to partially fund the purchase of special
apparatus that will be used to make fatigue crack growth measurements at
elevated temperatures and under hygrothermal conditions. It is planned to
combine the moire interferometry and acoustic emissions techniques to locate
cracks in a tree dimensional body.
