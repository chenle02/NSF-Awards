This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project is a Type III (A:C) partnership
between Villanova University, an NSF PFI grantee (0332490), and Bucknell
University, an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never
been a PFI grantee). The project applies core and emerging research in acoustic
signal processing, aiming at increasing acoustic system performance and
enhancing ultrasound imaging. This is achieved through advances in signature
analyses and feature extractions. Novel fusion modalities based on multiple and
distributed sensors are examined for further system performance improvements.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This partnership recognizes the growing acoustic and
ultrasound local and national job markets, spanning the healthcare, automotive,
and aerospace sectors with applications ranging from medical diagnostic and
therapeutic needs to predictive maintenance of machinery and products, and
extending to acoustic source training and localizations. The proposed activities
will serve to improve acoustic and ultrasound data analyses and imaging. The
enhancements in medical ultrasound imaging have clear societal impact, as they
will increase diagnostic capabilities and quality of life while reducing medical
costs. In the predictive maintenance field, if more information can be acquired
describing the state and properties of existing machinery, better decisions can
be made with regard to failure prediction and safety
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are
Academic Institutions: Villanova University (lead institution), Bucknell
University, and Gwynedd-Mercy College; Private Sector Organizations: Siemens and
The Boeing Company; State and Local Government Organizations: Ben Franklin
Technology Partners; and Federal Government Laboratory: Naval Sea Systems
Command (NAVSEA).
