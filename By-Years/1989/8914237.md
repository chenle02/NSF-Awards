Frequent reference is made in the scholarly literature of geography and related
fields to the ways in which decision making at a specific site is influenced not
only be the characteristics of that site but also by the relationships between
that site and other sites, but most analyses of these relationships have been
anecdotal and descriptive in nature. This doctoral dissertation research project
will systematically analyze how proximity to urban markets affects decisions by
Philippine peasant farmers to make investments to increase soil productivity.
The hypothesis will be tested that the relationship between investments and
market proximity is U-shaped, with maximal investments made at locations that
are either close to or far from urban centers, while lower levels of investment
are made at intermediate distances. Information from a survey of 225 farm
households an analyses of soil samples from fields will be used to determine how
proximity to markets and other factors has affected decisions about which crops
were planted and what investments were made to improve soil productivity. This
project will provide specific means to analyze the potential utility of policies
aimed at simultaneously encouraging economic development and maintaining soil
quality, but it will have an even more significant impact as a means of
distinguishing how characteristics of specific sites are evaluated with respect
to relationships with other sites as farmers make locational decisions. The
research project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising
graduate student to expand and refine her basic research skills.
