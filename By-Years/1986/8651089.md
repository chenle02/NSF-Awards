This project will improve and strengthen optics, atomic, and nuclear physics
laboratory experiments currently offered to undergraduate physics majors. In
this program, three existing experiments will be upgraded, and five new optics
experiments and one new experiment each from atomic and nuclear physics will be
added. Students will be introduced to methods and techniques used in the fields
of lasers, optics, electro-optics, atomic and nuclear physics. The project
objectives are achieved by providing hands-on experiences with state- of-the-art
instrumentation. The project will improve the quality of instruction, stimulate
student interest and provide opportunities for junior and senior level research
projects.
