This project is an investigation into the representation theory and cohomology
of finite groups over fields of prime characteristic. Of particular interest is
the structure of modules and the homological properties of modules. The
p+incipal investigator will work on the complexes associated to polynomial
subrings of the cohomology ring of a group. He will also study topological
applications of the theory of varieties and cohomology rings. The research
supported concerns the representation of finite groups over fields. The
structure of the groups is realized through the action of the groups as
transformations on spaces. This is currently one of the most active areas of
pure algebra.
