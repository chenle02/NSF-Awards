The main goal of this project is to extend the capabilities of ERCP with high-
resolution optical imaging while making the insertion and examination technique
as minimally invasive as possible. In addition to high-quality and high-
resolution imaging in a miniature instrument, these advances will be engineered
into a single-operator system with 4-way tip deflection and new accessory
devices. This project will develop the tip bending mechanism without sacrificing
size, cost, and performance of the proposed mini-pancreatoscope (MP). The new MP
will be tested against current ERCP procedures by gastroenterologists using a
synthetic model for ERCP training that contains force sensors.&lt;br/&gt;
