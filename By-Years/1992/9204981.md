The principal investigator will investigate the hypothesis that a correlation
exists between the measured oxygen isotope fractionations among coexisting
minerals in felsic igneous rocks and cooling rate of the rocks as determined by
40Ar/39Ar studies. Samples will be studied from both fast- and slow-cooling
bodies. If successful, the resulting data would also provide a valuable new tool
for the determination of cooling and uplift rates in orogenic terranes.
