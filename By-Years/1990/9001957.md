The principal investigator will study global invariants on strictly
pseudoconvex manifolds that arise as renormalized Chern classes for complete
Kaehler metrics. He will continue his study of pseudodifferential operator
calculi adapted to the study of degenerate operators similiar to the Bergman-
Laplace operator. A goal will be to obtain index formulae relating the
renormalized Chern numbers to "analytic" indices for degenerate elliptic
complexes. And he will continue an investigation of the problem of embedding
three dimensional CR-manifolds. For many years mathematicians have studied the
behavior of certain differential operators on hypersurfaces which extend off to
infinity. This study has its origins in the calculus of Newton. In this project
the principal investigator will analyze operators which have large variations
over very large domains "near" infinity. In the past, only progress on operators
which have small local variations was made.
