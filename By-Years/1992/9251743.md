gene. Techniques employed include density gradient separations, construction of
a genomic library, subcloning, and characterization and sequencing. Equipment
includes: an ultracentrifuge and sequencing gel systems. Other courses employing
elements of these techniques and utilizing the equipment include microbiology,
biochemistry, instrumental analysis, developmental biology, animal physiology
and both the NSF Summer Enrichment Program for high school teachers and a fall
workshop for talented high school juniors.
