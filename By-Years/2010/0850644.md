This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of North Dakota (UND) for the summers of 2009-2011.
The site is implemented by the Sustainable Energy Research Initiative and
Supporting Education (SUNRISE) program. It is coordinated by program director
Evguenii Kozliak of Chemistry assisted by co-PI Wayne Seames from the Department
of Chemical Engineering. SUNRISE science and engineering faculty will serve as
REU mentors to at least eight NSF-supported students plus additional students
supported by other sources conducting chemistry-focused undergraduate research
that contributes to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies. The ten-
week summer program includes weekly sessions with an emphasis on publication-
quality research projects and the improvement of oral and written communications
skills. An ethics component is designed to motivate participants to learn, and
more importantly, to practice ethics. SUNRISE is committed to training
individuals who will develop the necessary innovative solutions to these
problems and who can speak to the impact of these issues to diverse populations.
Native American students will be recruited from two feeder programs, SUNRISE's
Native American Freshman Experience and UND's American Indians in Engineering.
SUNRISE partnerships with two minority serving non-doctoral California State
University schools will be utilized to recruit students who otherwise would be
unlikely to consider research as a career, including Hispanic, women and other
underrepresented group students. Other participants will be recruited from non-
research colleges and Universities in the upper Midwest. Students will conclude
the program with a university-wide poster session.
