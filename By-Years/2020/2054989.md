Complex numbers, an extension of real numbers, are indispensable in science,
engineering, and economics. For instance, a circuit driven by an alternating
current, such as that in a generator that delivers power to a household, can be
analyzed using complex numbers. This project is in the setting of complex
numbers and complex-valued functions. The fundamental theorem of calculus, which
is in the setting of real numbers, uses an integral formula to establish a
connection between functions and their derivatives. The principal investigator
will study the smoothness of complex-valued functions using an integral formula
representation in higher-dimensional spaces, or in more general spaces, and
consider some applications of this theory. The project will also support the
training of graduate students through their thesis work. &lt;br/&gt;This project
has four research topics. The principal investigator will study the regularity
of Cauchy-Riemann equations on strictly pseudoconvex domains, or domains that
have a sufficient number of positive or negative Levi eigenvalues in a complex
manifold. The research will focus on minimum regularity requirements for the
domains while seeking solutions that have higher-order regularity. More
generally, the principal investigator will study the integral representation of
complex differential forms and use it to study the stability of deformation of
complex structures on strictly pseudoconvex or Z(1) domains. The principal
investigator will study the classification of neighborhoods of a compact complex
manifold using methods from complex analysis and dynamical systems, and will
continue to study the CR singularity of real submanifolds in complex Euclidean
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
