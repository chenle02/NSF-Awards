CTS-9529248 K. R. Amarnath Charles Byers EPRI ABSTRACT "Electro-Separations
2020, A Workshop on Future Directions in Electrically Driven Separations" will
bring together several scientists and engineers from universities, industries
and government laboratories to discuss electro-separation technologies. Electro-
separation has been defined as "The use of electricity, or electromagnetic
fields to produce or enhance chemical or physical separations." The technologies
have the potential to solve separation problems that are difficult by existing
methods, to save substantial amounts of primary energy, and to perform strategic
environmental separations. The workshop will combine seminars by experts in
electro-separations and all technical aspects will be open to discussion. The
research needs in this topic will be identified, prioritized and documented in
the proceedings. The experience and knowledge transfer from this workshop may
catalyze research and development with significant impact on cost-effective
electro-separations technology, leading to widespread use in pollution
prevention or control and for environmentally conscious manufacturing with
energy savings.
