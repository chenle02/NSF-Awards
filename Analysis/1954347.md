Complex analysis is one of the most important areas of mathematics. Complex
analysis in one variable is a mature and beautiful subject. It has broad
applications to various branches of mathematics and physics, including algebra
(Fundamental Theorem of Algebra), topology (Riemann Mapping Theorem), number
theory (Prime Number Theorem), fluid mechanics, optics and electrostatics
(Conformal Mappings). Holomorphic functions in several complex variables were
studied more recently, in the past one hundred years. Function theory in several
complex variables is fundamentally different from the theory of one complex
variable. Its development has influenced modern analysis in partial differential
equations, harmonic analysis and complex geometry. The results of the project
will have wide appeal to a large section of the mathematics community. It has
already found applications in modern technologies that involve non-smooth
boundaries such as electrospray and scattering. The principal investigator is
engaged in the development of a textbook on one complex variable theory for
partial differential equations to make these interesting topics more accessible
to a wide range of students not just in mathematics, but also in physical
sciences and engineering. The project provides training opportunities for
graduate students and the principal investigator is actively involved in
teaching and training students at all levels. The goal of the project is to
explore several diverse and interconnected areas in several complex variables.
The focus is on two of the most important equations in several complex
variables: the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the tangential Cauchy-Riemann
equations. Classical results on these equations require that the domains have
smooth boundary, or the ambient spaces are Euclidean or Stein. A large part of
the project is on domains with non-smooth boundary and on complex manifolds. The
principal investigator has initiated the study of the Cauchy-Riemann equations
on Lipschitz domains using harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. The
problems include the Hausdorff property of Dolbeault cohomology groups, Levi-
flat hypersurfaces and complex foliation, Runge approximation and function
theory on non-smooth domains and complex manifolds. These problems are central
to several complex variables, complex geometry and partial differential
equations.
