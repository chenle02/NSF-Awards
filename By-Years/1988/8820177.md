Dr. Hai-Lung Dai is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study intermolecular potential functions for van der Waals
complexes using molecular beam and laser spectroscopic methodology. Dr. Dai is
using stimulated emission pumping (SEP) on van der Waals complexes to study the
interaction potential between molecules and the dynamics of reaction and energy
transfer of vibrationally excited molecules. Model intermolecular potentials are
being developed and tested with the van der Waals mode frequencies and the
complex structures which are experimentally observed. Vibrational
predissociation of the complexes is being examined as a function of both the
vibrational energy and the vibrational mode. Stimulated emission pumping will
also be used to prepare a large quantity of complexes in a selectively excited
vibrational level. The product vibrational state distribution after
predissociation will be probed. Correlation between the excited level and the
product states may reveal the effect of attractive forces in vibrational energy
transfer and the propensities of low energy collision-induced V-V transfer.
