The principal investigator will participate in a UK-funded research cruise to
study a hydrothermal plume above the Central Indian Ridge immediately north of
the Rodrigues Triple Junction in the Indian Ocean. Large-volume water samples
will be collected for particulate and dissolved thorium isotope studies. Thorium
will enable the quantification of rates of chemical processes occurring on
particles within this hydrothermal plume. The study also will investigate the
processes controlling the geochemical fractionation of 230Th and 231Pa.
