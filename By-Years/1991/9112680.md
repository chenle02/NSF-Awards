An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program
(Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth Sciences, 1991) is understanding and
modeling the geospace environment. As part of its contribution to the U.S.
Global Change Research Program, the National Science Foundation's Division of
Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research initiative, Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal of supporting basic research into the
dynamical and structural properties of geospace, leading to the construction of
a global geospace model with predictive capability. The subjects of the first
GEM campaign are the magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and
the connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.
This study will focus on whether a spatial relation exists between the particle
cusp location and particle plasma convection structure. Sounderstrom incoherent-
scatter radar observations will be used to establish the geophysical conditions
required to identify the cusp from radar observations.
