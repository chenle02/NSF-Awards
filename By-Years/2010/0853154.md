Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Chang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for partial
support of a international conference, to be held&lt;br/&gt;at Princeton
University on May 4-8, 2009. The conference will focus on the work of Charles
Fefferman. In keeping with the breadth and influence of Fefferman?s work, there
will be speakers from a wide variety of fields in analysis and with applications
for problems in several complex variables, PDE, geometry, dynamical system and
mathematical physics. There will be an emphasis on the global over view of the
power of analysis on mathematics in general, and also the interaction between
analysis and different areas of mathematics and the role of this interaction in
recent and future research directions. Specifically the purpose of this
conference is:&lt;br/&gt;? to disseminate the major results in analysis and the
tools developed in analysis from the last decades.&lt;br/&gt;? to assess the
effect of these results on the development of mathematics and to discuss focus
areas for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
