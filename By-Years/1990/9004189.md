This award provides funds to acquire an automated temperature-pressure control
system and an anvil guideblock assembly that will be incorporated into a multi-
anvil high pressure apparatus operated in the Center for Lithospheric Studies at
the University of Texas-Dallas. The high-pressure-temperature (up to 250
kilobars and 2000C) equipment will be used for phase equilibrium studies
emphasizing a systematic study of melting relationships in model systems that
approximate the Earth's mantle in composition.
