Invariants such as dimensions and symmetries are useful tools in mathematics and
other disciplines. Understanding links between different invariants is a
demanding task in modern mathematics. This research project is to study
noncommutative algebras (mathematical structures in which xy does not
necessarily equal yx) by using algebraic, combinatorial, geometric, and other
invariants, and to build a bridge between the subject of noncommutative algebra
and other active research areas. The PI will investigate the structure of
several important families of algebras and work on central questions in the
subject. Since noncommutative algebras have been used extensively, this project
will deepen the understanding of other mathematical areas including
noncommutative algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and mathematical physics.

A central theme of the proposal is the noncommutative McKay correspondence, a
concept motivated by the classical McKay correspondence that has recently been
extended to several new areas. Specific topics include noncommutative quotient
singularities of Hopf algebra actions on Artin-Schelter regular algebras; skew
Calabi-Yau property and the Nakayama automorphism of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein
algebras; and the noncommutative discriminant of algebras which are module-
finite over their center. The PI has introduced a number of invariants with
fruitful applications in the study of automorphism groups and locally nilpotent
derivations of noncommutative algebras, as well as the noncommutative Zariski
cancellation problem. The PI will continue to search for distinct invariants of
noncommutative algebras, to develop foundations for new research directions, and
to work on central open questions in the field. The noncommutative McKay
correspondence is one essential guideline for the interplay between
noncommutative algebra, Hopf algebra and theory of quantum groups,
noncommutative invariant theory, and noncommutative algebraic geometry.
