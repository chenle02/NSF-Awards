General Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to improve our
understanding of state repression, human rights violation and the circumstances
involved with their use. For nearly 50 years, research in political science and
sociology has attempted to understand why governments repress their citizens.
Despite these efforts little is known about the relationship between those who
order repressive acts ("principals") and the individuals committing such
activities ("agents"). The research draws together different approaches in the
literature to develop an encompassing theory of repressive organizations. The
PIs generate new data on human rights violations, using Northern Ireland as the
case of interest. The PIs test theoretical predictions regarding when and where
repression can be expected as well as how it may be contained. This study has
implications for understanding and ultimately preventing human rights violations
within the United States and around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To account for variation in the use of repression
across time and space, the PIs develop a theory focusing on three factors: how
principals and agents interpret challenger threats; how event reporting
determines the information available to principals and their agents; and how the
repressive apparatus is organized. They examine highly disaggregated data on
threat, reporting, organization, and repression across space, time, and
organizational unit. In particular, the PIs collect new micro-level event data
on the repressive activity of the United Kingdom and Northern Irish governments
that took place from 1968 through 1998. This dataset uses British Army files
from the Brigade, Battalion and British Cabinet levels to determine the degree
of knowledge and reporting across these levels and to assess the role of
principals and agents in this conflict across time (by day), space (by
neighborhood) and actor (by battalion).
