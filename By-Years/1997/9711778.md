Brustein and Berntson Women's participation in France's electorally-successful
Front National is growing and will likely prove integral to the future electoral
success of that anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic political party. Women's
participation in the Front National's traditional and "family" values platform
is also required to ensure the success of its social and political goals. The
proposed research is a case study of women's participation in the Front
National. Until recently women's participation in far-right political parties
has been neglected by scholars, who perhaps assumed for various reasons that
women would not join such parties. Informed by an interest-based model of
political participation and by work on the narrative construction of identity,
this dissertation project will enhance our understanding of women's reasons for
joining such parties and will explore the dimensions of their participation. The
study will do so through semi-structured interviews with women who belong to the
Front National in Montepellier and Toulon, France. ***
