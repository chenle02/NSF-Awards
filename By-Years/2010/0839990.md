This public health informatics Small Grant for Exploratory Research is a small-
scale, exploratory, high-risk proposal that is potentially transformative in its
research collaborations between the US and China. The proposal team is building
on the momentum gained from two US-China public health informatics workshops
held in Beijing in March 2008. New partnerships are expected to emerge. The
outcomes have the potential to transform approaches to public health
informatics, not only in US and China, but potentially across the globe, in
particular in exploring transnational social networks and taking advantage of
the kinds of data collection and integration methodologies and technologies
employed by the two countries' public health agencies. It affords the
opportunity to provide new and longer-term research and educational programs
between US and Chinese institutions and practitioners.
