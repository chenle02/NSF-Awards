Abstract

Award: DMS-1005973 Principal Investigator: Yair Minsky

The PI proposes to investigate a number of different aspects of hyperbolic
geometry in 2 and 3 dimensions, the structure of the representation spaces that
parametrize these geometric systems, and the dynamics of the groups that act on
them. The SL(2,C)-character variety, X(F), of a group F parametrizes conjugacy
classes of representations of F into SL(2,C), the isometry group of hyperbolic
3-space. Discrete faithful elements of X(F) correspond to hyperbolic
3-manifolds, and the PI will work to understand better the interaction between
topological and geometric features of these manifolds, as well as the structure
of the discrete-faithful locus itself. In addition, he will pursue a study of
X(F) as a whole, considered as a dynamical system under the action of the outer
automorphism group of F (particularly when F is a free group). A new dynamical
decomposition of X(F) was recently discovered, whose structure seems to be rich
and relatively unexplored. In addition the PI will study geometric aspects of
Teichmuller spaces, which parametrize hyperbolic structures in two dimensions,
and of Mapping Class Groups, their natural automorphism groups.

The interactions between geometry, topology and dynamics play a entral role in
mathematics as well as its applications. A geometric space, such as our own
universe or the configuration space of some system, may admit dynamical
phenomena such as flows, iterations or group actions. The behavior of these
phenomena, as well as the geometry of the space, can be strongly influenced by
its topological structure, namely the underlying connective tissue on which the
geometry is overlaid. Furthermore, we often find that geometry and dynamics
persist at higher levels of abstraction: the collection of all geometric
structures on a given space can itself be organized into a new "higher" space,
with its own geometry and its own inherent symmetries which give rise to
dynamical structure. The interaction between these phenomena at different levels
can enrich our insight about the original systems. The PI's own research focuses
on particular instances of this general template, namely the geometry and
topology of 2- and 3- dimensional spaces, and the corresponding dynamics for
their higher parameter spaces. This low-dimensional setting is particularly
amenable to our intuition and is partly motivated by direct visual analogies
with our physical world, but it also happens, for a variety of reasons, to be a
meeting place for a number of different areas of mathematics as well as physics,
so that a fuller understanding in this domain can enrich, by analogy as well as
direct mathematical connection, our approaches to other parts of mathematics.
