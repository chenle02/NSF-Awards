Understanding room air and air contaminant distribution is essential to the
design of a ventilation system and the control of room thermal and air quality
conditions. The objectives of the proposal are: (1) Investigate the regional
airflow characteristic of a realistic ventilated room, especially with
obstructions, with heat sources, with both obstructions and heat sources, and
under low turbulence airflow conditions. (2) Develop a method for scaling among
different sized rooms. (3) Evaluate and improve existing numerical simulation
models to predict the air and air contaminant distribution in ventilated rooms
under realistic situations. (4) Provide experimental data for the analysis and
evaluation of theoretically-based models of room air and air contaminant
distribution in ventilated rooms.
