Interdisciplinary (99) The project is developing an approach to teaching
undergraduate biophysics that allows students to develop teamwork skills needed
for interdisciplinary research. The coursework focuses on learning modules that
utilize interactive software based on SciPy (scientific tools for python). The
modules play a role similar to laboratory experiments, and are studies by teams
of students. Each team has members with different skills coming from biology,
chemistry, engineering, computer science and physics. The learning modules can
be modified easily and analyzed in ways that foster creativity and interaction
between team members. The software runs on all major computer platforms and is
easily installed on the students' computers.
