This project aims to connect several areas of mathematics that relate to modern
mathematical physics. The theory of knots -- ordinary, tangled loops of string
in three-dimensional space -- goes back to Lord Kelvin, who proposed that the
periodic table was made from different knotted forms of the ether. Since that
time, knot theory became a well-established subject in mathematics, even as the
physics of Kelvin's proposal came into disfavor. The main challenge of knot
theory in mathematics is to recognize when two knots are the same or different.
More recently, knots have reappeared in the mathematical physics relating to
supersymmetric gauge theory and string theory. Through their reappearance in
mathematical physics, knots have re-emerged in mathematics in sophisticated
form. This project will elucidate the interplay among these fields within math
and physics, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. In
addition, the principal investigator will train graduate students, support a
research seminar, run a math circle, and perform other activities aimed at
developing young mathematicians.

"Knots, Sheaves, and Mirrors" refers first to a connection between Legendrian
knots and constructible sheaves, and second to a study of the moduli spaces
involved under the identification. A Legendrian knot can arise as a boundary-at-
infinity of a Lagrangian submanifold, so given the micro localization theorem
(proved by the principal investigator and Nadler) relating sheaves and the
Fukaya category, it is perhaps not surprising that Legendrians have a purely
sheaf-theoretic description. In fact, the exact relationship is somewhat subtle,
but in the end one can equate augmentations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg
differential graded algebra with constructible sheaves on the base plane
containing the front diagram. With this equivalence in hand, it is then natural,
following the ideas of mirror symmetry, to study the moduli spaces of "rank-one"
objects --- and these prove to be interesting spaces, related to Bott-Samelson
resolutions, from which one can recover categorized HOMFLY invariants of the
knot. The project will also study the sheaf-theoretic description of Legendrian
conormals of topological knots (along the lines of Aganagic-Ekholm-Ng-Vafa),
wild Hitchin systems corresponding to algebraic singularities whose link is the
knot.
