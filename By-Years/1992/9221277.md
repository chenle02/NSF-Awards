Experimental and computational methods will be applied to determine the kinetic
acidities of a variety of hydrocarbons. Experimental methods will include the
determination of exchange rates from cyclohexylamine-N-t catalyzed by cesium and
lithium cyclohexylamides by tritium NMR. Some rates will be determined for
deuterium exchange with cyclohexylamine-N-d2 using mass spectroscopy and
deuterium NMR. Theoretical calculations will be carried out for proton transfer
reaction between various hydrocarbons and bases, and compared to experimental
results. Calculations of ion-pair SN2 displacement reactions will be continued.
These reactions show unusual highly bent transition states and may give relative
reactivities different from the corresponding ionic reactions. %%% This grant
from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor
Andrew Streitwieser at the University of California, Berkeley. The acidity of
very weakly acidic hydrocarbons will be determined by recently developed
sensitive techniques. This will extend an important body of knowledge.
Theoretical calculations will be made that relate to the acidity of hydrocarbons
and the results will be compared to the experimental findings. This work will
provide a fundamental understanding of weakly acidic hydrocarbons and the
consequences to chemical reactivity of the carbon-hydrogen bond in hydrocarbons.
Additional calculations will be carried out on a fundamental displacement
reaction process in organic chemistry. Preliminary calculations have shown an
unusual geometry in the course of this reaction and this work will be continued.
