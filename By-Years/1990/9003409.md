The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae makes a variety of glycoproteins, called
mannoproteins owing to the high content of mannose. These mannoproteins contain
both O- and N-linked carbohydrate chains, and differences in the structure of
the carbohydrate component have been found between different mannoproteins and
between mannoproteins localized to different parts of the cell. The synthesis of
mature N-linked chains involves initiation of outer chain addition to the core
precursor, followed by elongation, termination, branching, and then maturation
by mannosylphosphorylation and alpha 1-3- mannosylation. The objective of this
research is to investigate the enzymology of the termination reaction which
regulates whether the N-linked chains are of the small or large type. A specific
assay will be developed for the terminase activity so that it can be measured in
the presence of other mannosyltransferases in crude extracts. The terminase will
be purified by standard procedures, and factors that modulate its activity will
be studied. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, common baker's yeast, provides a useful
model for studies on eucaryotic development and on the structural function
relationships of the carbohydrate component of glycoproteins. This work will
lead to a better understanding of the developmental role of these compounds.
Yeasts are important in biotechnology and the results of these studies may form
the basis for developing new useful types of yeasts.
