This mathematics research project aims to develop a unified theory of many body
systems (such as gas dynamics) by connecting mesoscopic models (Boltzmann
equation) to macroscopic models (fluid) and microscopic models (many particles).
The investigator and collaborator will study these connections in models of
various physical systems such as tornados, shock waves, water-oil mixtures, and
plasma in tokamak fusion reactors. Results of the research are intended to lead
to advances in understanding of these and other important systems. In connection
with the research, the investigators plan to develop graduate topics courses,
undergraduate directed study courses, research activities for undergraduate
students, and workshops for practicing mathematicians.

One of the fundamental questions in partial differential equations is the
development of a unified theory of gas dynamics connecting the mesoscopic
Boltzmann equations to the macroscopic fluid models (hydrodynamic limits) that
arise in formal limits, and the Boltzmann equations to microscopic N-body
problems (Grad-Boltzmann limit). In this project, the investigator and
collaborator study the rigorous passage to both limits mathematically in various
physical situations. The first part of the project concerns the hydrodynamic
limits when free interfaces occur naturally: (i) vortex patch solutions of the
incompressible Euler equation, (ii) two-species Vlasov-Boltzmann systems
modeling binary fluid mixtures with sharp interface and surface tension, and
(iii) shock formation in the compressible Euler equations and its kinetic
approximation. The second part of the project concerns the Grad-Boltzmann limit
in the presence of a thermal stochastic boundary. The investigators study the
passage from the N-body Newtonian system interacting with stochastic boundary
toward the Boltzmann equation with diffuse reflection boundary. They will
investigate the mixing effect of such boundaries and aim to establish a rigorous
passage for a time interval greater than a mean free time. They will also study
the link of generic steady non-equilibrium states between the mesoscopic and
microscopic levels.
