Chapman This award will allow the University of California at Los Angeles to
renovate and modernize approximately 14,000 square feet of lab space into a
computer modeling research facility in the chemical and biological sciences. The
existing space does not conform to current fire, life safety, code, and access
requirements. The renovation of the fourth floor of the south wing of Young Hall
will make available a Chem-Bio Research Visualization and Learning Center
dedicated to high-resolution computer graphic display instruction and research,
as well as support spaces. This facility will be used by researchers, students,
both undergraduate and graduates, and postdoctoral fellows. The vision for this
center has been responsible for creating an environment that will foster
interaction among various groups for innovative computer utilization. Novel
methods are also employed by the new center arrangement to provide means of
enhancing the chances of minority and women in the life sciences. This project
will be cost-shared with the State of California and is an integral part of
their science challenge designed to attract and retain students in science and
to improve the attitudes of students towards science. ***
