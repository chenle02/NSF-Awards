This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
a sub-micron x-ray tomography scanner capable of providing in-vivo and high
resolution images of specimens from mice to bacteria. In this era of molecular
medicine, where disease and developmental disorders are being re-defined by
their peculiar molecular, genetic or cellular profiles, there exists a
significant disparity between the type of information gleaned from histological
methods and that obtained from conventional non-invasive imaging modalities.
With a resolution that is better than these imaging modalities and more than ten
times higher than that of current x-ray imaging systems, the proposed device
will generate images of development and disease not possible by current methods.
The Phase II research will concentrate on the development of the x-ray optical
system, including beam conditioning, tomographic imaging capability, and the
imaging x-ray lens, and will result in a table-top commercial prototype
computerized tomographic imager with 400 nm resolution. The commercial
application of this project will be in the area of medical research. When
compared to existing in-vivo imaging technologies, the higher resolution of the
proposed x-ray imager will translate to improved sensitivity and specificity of
morphologic changes associated with growth and disease. Researchers will be able
to use this tool for investigations of a number of medical conditions, including
tumor angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis and arthritis.
