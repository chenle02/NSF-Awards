9308341 Jiang The purpose of this Research Initiation Award is to develop a
continuum model which is capable of describing the macroscopic behavior of
ferroelectric crystals undergoing phase transformations under the combined
influence of thermomechanical loads and electric fields. A unified approach
which is valid for transformations induced by mechanical, thermal and/or
electrical components is the ultimate goal of this research.
