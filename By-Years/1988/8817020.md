Superplastic forging offers a possible methodology for net-shape forming of
ceramic materials. Scientific aspects of superplastic sinterforging of high Tc
superconducting materials will be investigated and methodologies will be
developed for the fabrication of precise axisymmetric shapes with optimum
texture. Numerical simulation of the deformation process will be carried out for
designing the preform shape of the forging.
