High purity, submicron, spherical, high surface area particles of covalent
ceramics are key to achieving high density materials, which exhibit high
strength and creep resistance at high temperatures. Currently available covalent
ceramic particles, lead to poor high temperature strength and creep resistance.
This program will investigate a simple process that will produce stoichiometric
high purity, submicron, spherical ceramic particles with a very high surface
area which will allow for self sintering of covalently bonded ceramics. The
particle synthesis process consists in evaporating high purity silicon into a
plasma of nitrogen or methane to produce Si3N4 or SiC particles. The properties
of the sintered ceramic will be assessed. It is expected that the sintered
particles, produced at substantial savings, will replace existing materials and
expand the market in automotive, aerospace, all engines conversion, wear and
cutting tools.
