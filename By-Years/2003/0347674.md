&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: CAREER: Integrated Resource Conservation in Sensor
Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed networks
of thousands of collaborative sensors&lt;br/&gt;promise unattended systems for
many monitoring, surveillance&lt;br/&gt;and control applications. Sensor
networks are expected to operate for&lt;br/&gt;long time. This makes network
lifetime the central problem for a&lt;br/&gt;sensor network designer. This
project pursues a system-level&lt;br/&gt;integrated approach to extend network
lifetime. More specifically,&lt;br/&gt;new sensor location discovery methods are
being developed that will&lt;br/&gt;conserve resources such as computational
power and radio bandwidth within&lt;br/&gt;a sensor; new MAC protocols is being
designed to optimize for&lt;br/&gt;low power, low data rate sensor networks;
novel approaches are&lt;br/&gt;investigated for data aggregation services such
as event detection and&lt;br/&gt;target counting. Because sensor self-
positioning, MAC control,&lt;br/&gt;and data aggregation services in a sensor
network are strongly dependent&lt;br/&gt;on each other, their interaction and
design are jointly&lt;br/&gt;explored using an integrated approach for extending
network lifetime.
