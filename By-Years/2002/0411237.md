Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation of scientists and
engineers need to prepare for a technological workplace that includes Grid
computing, but little work is being done to provide Grid education to
undergraduates. This project identifies and adapts Globus Toolkit 3 tutorial
materials to make them appropriate for undergraduate computer science students.
This toolkit is the first complete implementation of the Open Grid Services
Infrastructure (OGSI). This project adapts existing instructional materials by
clarifying and describing prerequisite knowledge, adding description and links
to background details, adapting the existing laboratory exercises for
undergraduate study, and identifying the ACM/IEEE knowledge units that
correspond to the laboratory exercises. The exercises will be assessed and
refined.
