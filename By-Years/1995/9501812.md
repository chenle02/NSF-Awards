Replication is key to achieving performance and fault tolerance in widely
distributed systems. Conservative replica management schemes do not scale well,
yet optimistic approaches depend in complex ways on workload, architecture,
topology, and failure modes of the system. This research captures the design
space for optimistically replicated systems in a flexible, object-oriented,
simulation model, allowing alternative architectures to be evaluated on a `level
playing field.` The object-oriented nature allows specialization of model
components, permitting experimentation with alternative designs, communications
bandwidths, failure distributions, workload models, etc. A flexible workload
generation tool which can be tuned to produce synthetic traces matching the
statistical properties of various anticipated environments is also produced. The
simulation and synthetic trace generator are validated by comparison with
analytical models and measurements of real systems. This reqearch will enable
designers of a broad range of distributed database and filing systems to assess
the impact of an optimistic app roach to achieving high performance and
availability in large scale systems. The educational plan seeks to add a `hands-
on`, experimental component to the operating systems curriculum.
Synchronization, scheduling, and concurrency control simulation labs are
constructed and piloted using the same object-oriented simulation methodology as
in the research plan. This provides a balance to the current theoretical
approach to teaching operating systems to both undergraduate and graduate
students.
