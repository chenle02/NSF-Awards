This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test
feasibility of using inexpensive wireless chipsets as a means of directly
measuring mechanical vibration. Microwaves are a reliable means of sensing in
the harshest of industrial and laboratory environments. The radar signals can be
transmitted to the object of interest from a remote location via waveguide or
through microwave transparent materials. However, the current state of the
technology uses high-end radar devices with extremely high component costs that
prohibit its use in most applications. The proposed research will develop a
prototype non-contact sensor based on the latest electronic components used for
wireless applications. Through specialized assembly of chipsets developed for
Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 wireless applications, it may be possible to assemble
ultra low-cost radars for measuring vibration. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Vibration
and position sensing are critical measurements in many industrial and laboratory
processes. Applications for the sensor are many of those within the $800 million
accelerometer market and include factory automation (especially in the chemical
and biological industries), electric motor (of all sizes) monitoring for
condition-based-maintenance, semiconductor/thin film manufacturing and quality
control, and automotive applications, particularly engine monitoring and terrain
sensing. &lt;br/&gt;
