The most abundant and most speciose fish at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica belong to
the suborder Notothenioidei. These fish live under conditions where it is often
very dark, particularly under thick ice or during the winter. This study will
focus on the functional ramifications of the anatomically diverse lateral line
systems of these fish. The lateral line is a mechanosensory structure which is
hypothesized to play a role in feeding. The lateral line system of the
notothenioidids includes features that converge on those of fishes from other
dark habitats such as the deep ocean and caves. This project will determine
which notothenioids can use the lateral line to feed in the dark and will focus
on two hypotheses: (1) the lateral line is tuned to detect important prey and
(2) deeper living fish have more sensitive lateral line systems. This approach
combines studies of behavioral responses to live prey and artificial stimuli,
physiological responses of lateral line nerve fibers to artificial stimuli. and
anatomical studies of the diverse lateral line system. The role of the lateral
line system in fish is not clearly understood and this research project will
make an important contribution to the field.
