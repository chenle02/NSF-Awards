The objective of this project is to develop a new type of scalable elliptic
solvers with high parallel scalability, and a fundamentally new approach in
solving Poisson or modified Helmholtz equations in 3-D is proposed. The solution
of these equations constitutes a major computational cost for many computational
engineer problems such as incompressible flows by projection methods,
electrostatic potential problems in molecular biology, and enforcing divergence
free constraints of magnetic field in plasma MHD simulations, etc. The approach
proposed is based on combining deterministic local boundary integral equation
methods and random Brownian walk probabilistic representations of PDE solutions,
resulting in straightforward parallel non-iterative solvers for the Dirichlet-to
Neumann mappings of the elliptic PDEs, thus the complete solutions of the PDEs
with the help of the FMM.

The high performance computers nowadays use many cores in the order of hundreds
of thousands designed for parallel implementations. The challenging for
algorithms designers is to develop highly scalable and parallel methods to solve
the mathematical equations coming from the representations of real world science
and engineering problems. The development of the proposed algorithm in this
project is a step toward to achieving such a degree of scalability and
parallelism for problems, such as flow-structure interactions and electrostatics
in computational biology and plasmas. The idea of using both random and
deterministic methods in the proposed method is fundamentally different from
traditional purely deterministic methods such as multi-grid and domain
decomposition methods, and has the potential to produce high impact in the field
of scientific and engineering computing at extreme scale.
