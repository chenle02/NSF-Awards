The is a joint effort through subcontracts, with Raj Roy, Georgia Institute of
Technology, and Steven Strogatz, Cornell University The researchers will
investigate synchronization of chaotic lasers for purposes of using chaos as a
carrier for new modes of communication including multiplexing information
bearing signals and private communications using chaotic carriers as well as
methods for optical channel equalization using nonlinear properties of the
fiber. The program will include experiments on Nd:YAG and Erbium Doped lasers,
analysis of synchronization methods and innovative communications techniques,
and mathematical analysis of synchronization of a few and assemblies of chaotic
oscillators with application to optical communications. A "group meeting"
workshop will be held semi-annually and each year we will invite experts in
optics, optical engineering, and optical communications to provide additional
research expertise to broaden the horizons of the students, postdoctoral
fellows, and faculty involved in this project
