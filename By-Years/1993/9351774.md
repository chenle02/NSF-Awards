This project will implement a workstation laboratory where students can gain
hands-on experience with state-of-the-art software with Computer Aided Software
Engineering (CASE) tools. The CASE tools will be used in three required, upper
level CIS classes: Systems Analysis, Systems Design, and Database Design. In
these courses real development projects are used, for example, designing an
inventory system for a manufacturing company. The students experience the
complete development life cycle by beginning the analysis of the system in the
Systems Analysis course and designing/implementing the system in the Systems
Design and in the Database Design courses. Students will develop and/or work
with data flow diagrams, entity relationships, input/output
prototype/specifications, file/database structures, policies, procedures,
structure charts, function point counts, objects, and object repositories. The
multi-class project provides students with experience in project management,
interpersonal skills and group dynamics.
