ABSTRACT CTS-9617257 The research objective is the determination of the
structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of supported metal cluster
catalysts during reaction. Specifically, small clusters of Ir and Rh will be
obtained by decomposition of organometallic precursors supported on magnesia,
alumina and NaY zeolite. They will be characterized gravimetrically, and with
EXAFS/XANES, UV Laser Raman, and IR Spectroscopies, while catalyzing the
hydrogenation of either propene, toluene or benzaldehyde. In addition, the
catalysts will be characterized ex-situ by the same techniques and by hydrogen
chemisorption, TPD, TPR, and STM. The results will help relate catalytic
properties with cluster qize, structure and composition. The data from clusters
supported on different carriers will provide relationships between catalytic and
electronic properties and other support-induced effects. The fundamental
properties to be determined from these quasi-molecular catalysts will serve to
accelerate the development of catalytic science and technology as well as
related areas, such as nanotechnology and sensor technology.
