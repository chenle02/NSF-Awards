This is a recommendation for an award to support research directed toward the
solution of a specific environmental flow problems which include (a) nonlinear
free surface hydrodynamic flows and flows in porous media, (b) two-and three-
dimensional flows in porous media including flows in fractures, and (c) the
transport of pollutants in porous media. The objectives involve the development
of methods to accommodate equation types that are not generally tractable by
boundary element methods. The principal investigator is an outstanding
researcher in the area of hydraulics and groundwater flow. Award is recommended
as a 36-month Continuing Grant, the initial amount is $62,442 starting on
January 1, 1987.
