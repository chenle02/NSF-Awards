This platform presents a hardware-neutral way of developing sensing and
ubiquitous computing applications. It is focused on making sensing application
available to a larger community of users and developers. It is centered around 2
core concepts: a layered approach to system design, and a set of simple network
APIs and data abstractions. The design and simple programming model make it
possible for novice developers to rapidly design and develop new and creative
applications. The project focuses on lowering the knowledge and skill required
of application developers that wish to integrate sensor information. It does
this through a combination of simple data structures and information models, and
a layered network-based API that hides unnecessary details from developers,
freeing them to focus on specific tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While commodity
sensors and software are becoming more readily available every day, the
programming interfaces exported by those systems are tightly bound to the
sensors the system supports. Researchers believe that this platform presents a
positive first step toward sensing systems that are flexible and general-purpose
enough to support a wider array of sensors than is possible in competing
systems.
