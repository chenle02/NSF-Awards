Within fold-thrust belts (FTBs), folds that form under shallow crustal
conditions (i.e. elastico-frictional regime) initiate primarily by either
buckling or bending mechanisms. Theoretical and analog modeling as well as some
limited field-based data sets on folding mechanisms under shallow-crustal
conditions leave us with two critical unanswered questions: What are the limits
(e.g. interlimb angle, bed thickness, strain rate) to buckling and bending?
Beyond initial folding, do 'buckle' and 'bend' folds continue to tighten in
their own unique ways or, at a certain stage, are their folding mechanisms
indistinguishable? Surely, folding is much more complex than most models
predict; studying natural fold examples provides a more complete picture to
folding histories. The P.I. proposes to better understand folding processes
using natural fold examples in the Anti-Atlas FTB (Morocco), which is primarily
composed of buckle and bending folds that formed within the elastico-frictional
(EF) regime. Unique strain patterns associated with each fold type are
accommodated by fracture networks and large-scale cataclastic flow within the EF
regime. These fractures will be examined to unravel the strain histories, and
therefore, folding mechanisms.
