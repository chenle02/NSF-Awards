This project improves the sophistication of cellular and molecular components of
the curriculum. The department is redesigning a course for majors to introduce
them to the major building blocks of living organisms, and to teach them the
modern techniques of molecular biology. The purchase of centrifuges, liquid
chromatography, paper chromatography, and electrophoresis equipment,
photographic equipment, and of a UV/visible spectrophotometer allows the
department to introduce new laboratory experiences involving cell fractionation;
protein, DNA and RNA separations; quantitative measurement of proteins and
nucleic acids; restriction digestion of nucleic acids, and the cloning of
restriction fragments. The instruments are also being used in Immunology and
Genetics courses and laboratories in Plant Physiology. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
