The project "Scholars in Chemistry at Spelman" will provide a comprehensive
research and academic enrichment program for talented minority women student
interested in majoring in Chemistry or Biochemistry. The first year 5
sophomores, 3 juniors, and 2 seniors will be chosen. Thereafter, students who
have left the program, will be replaced with students at the sophomore level.
Each student's academic career will include enrichment activities such as
special weekly lectures, a visiting lecture series, seminar participation, and
professional conference attendance. Two years of research experience with
faculty mentors, who also serve as role models will culminate in a written
thesis. A summer of research experience before the junior year, as well as a
summer at an outside research facility will give scholars a strong mentor in her
major on entry to the College. This mentor may or may not become her research
mentor. The College has established an Office of Science, Engineering, and
Technical Careers (OSETC) to assist in counseling, graduate school contacts, and
the application process.
