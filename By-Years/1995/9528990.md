The goal of this project is to increase effectiveness of human-computer
communication by improving the quality of automatically generated speech. Using
the known linguistic structure that is a by-product of text generation, the
research investigates both utterance-level and dialog-level control of prosody
(i.e. phrasing, emphasis and intonation) i n a commercial synthesizer. The
approach -- development of statistical models of the mapping between meaning and
prosodic structure -- is novel in its emphasis on automatic learning algorithms
associated with the aim of portability to different task domains/generators. The
research involves: collection and automatic prosodic labeling of `acted` speech
in target task domains; use of generated syntactic, semantic and discourse
annotation to drive prosodic control modules; investigation of the role of
prosody in computer initiative, e.g. in clarification or error correction
subdialogs; and development of evaluation protocols for assessing speech
generation quality and its impact on human-computer interaction. The research
will benefit existing spoken language interfaces by providing higher quality
speech output and more flexibility for response generation, but it will also
open up applications for human-computer interaction where a visual display is
not available, e.g. in small devices, in telephone-based computer access or for
persons who are visually impaired.
