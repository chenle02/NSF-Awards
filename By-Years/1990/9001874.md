An investigation of quantum effects in very thin metal films and metal clusters
prepared by vapor-deposition on to substrates held at liquid He temperatures.
Secondly, a study of the electric and magnetic properties of selected
superconducting (sc) wire network and wire proximity array geometries as models
for aspects of percolation, localization, and the (sc) glass.
