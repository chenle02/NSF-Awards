The award provides participant support for the next three Georgia Topology
Conference. The 2019 edition will be held in Athens, GA from May 22-26, 2019.
The focus of the conference is three dimensional geometric topology. The spaces
that arise are, locally, the same as the space we live in, and can be studied by
analyzing the one and two dimensional structures that live within them. The
conference website is https://research.franklin.uga.edu/topology/2019-georgia-
topology-conference.

The 2019 conference will be focused on 3-dimensional topology, and in
particular, codimension-1 foliations. Speakers at the conference will be chosen
to emphasize the richness of this topic as indicated by its connections to
Heegaard Floer homology, contact topology, Heegaard splittings, group
orderability, and Dehn surgery.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
