Climate is an important factor in determining why plants and animals live where
they do. When climate shifts, we anticipate that plants and animals may be
forced to track their preferred climates across the landscape. Identifying the
extent to which plants and animals will respond to changing climate is one of
the most pressing questions in ecology and conservation biology today. To meet
this challenge, this project will examine past responses to environmental change
on both the continental scale and at the site level. The core of the outreach
activities will bring the fossil discovery experience to students and the public
while demonstrating the effects of climate change on ecological systems. These
opportunities will reach people from across the broader Atlanta community, in
addition to East African undergraduate students who participate in workshops
facilitated by the Conservation Paleobiology in Africa program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will estimate the ‘climate fidelity’ that
individual mammal and plant biomes have exhibited since the last glaciation. It
will calculate the extent to which observed changes in the climates that plants
and animals occupy correspond with the climates of urban and agricultural
regions, creating a ‘human tolerance index.’ Using these methods, it will
demonstrate how much climate drives range determination across trophic levels by
comparing the relative fidelity of plants versus animals. By examining ecosystem
responses to a major drought at Natural Trap Cave, Wyoming, researchers can test
hypotheses about long-term ecosystem responses to precipitation while validating
predicted species-level climate responses. By understanding how species respond
to changing climate, we can identify which species and strategies to prioritize
in order to conserve biodiversity going forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
