Cosmology has made tremendous advances in the past decade, with many fundamental
questions approaching resolution. We now have a highly predictive theory for the
emergence of large-scale structure in the Universe. As is often the case, this
theory raises new questions, and several crucial issues still remain to be
understood. First, the nature of most of the matter in the Universe remains
mysterious. Second, while we have known for some time that earthly matter
doesn't dominate the energy in the Universe, we now believe that not even exotic
`dark' matter plays that role. At present the Universe appears to be
accelerating, driven by a mysterious component dubbed "dark energy''. Luckily we
are in a "golden era'' of cosmological observations. Upcoming observations will
soon constrain the initial conditions for structure formation and many
cosmological parameters, allowing us to address the next frontier: the era of
structure formation. A thorough understanding of structure formation is
instrumental in determining both the consequences of the developing 'cosmic web'
paradigm and the constraints on variations within this paradigm. The key to this
understanding is clusters of galaxies. These are the largest known objects. They
exhibit remarkable regularity, but our understanding of their structure is
sensitive to our modeling assumptions. This project will construct computer
models of galaxy clusters to develop and refine methods which will relate the
properties of these clusters to the distribution and nature of the dark matter
and the dark energy and thus to sharpen our tests of this dominant paradigm. ***
