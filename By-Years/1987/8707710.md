This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
electrochemistry. During the twelve month period beginning 1 July 1987,
Professor Fitch will conduct a literature survey and carry out preliminary
experiments that will lead to the development of a major research proposal in
the area of clay modified electrodes. Recent indications from several leading
research laboratories in electrochemistry indicate that the incorporation of
clay materials at electrode surfaces could lead to unique and useful
electrocatalytic processes whereby desired electrochemical conversions could be
achieved economically and efficiently. Professor Fitch plans to utilize her
strong background in soil science and electrochemistry to initiate the
development of a competitive research program in her laboratory at Loyola
University during the tenure of this Research Planning Grant award.
