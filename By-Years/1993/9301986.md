9301986 Gokhale The objective of this research is to develop general, unbiased,
efficient and practical stereological procedures for the quantitative
characterization of fracture surfaces and microstructural features in three
dimensional space from measurements performed on l=lane sections or projected
images. This research involves analytical theoretical work, computer
simulations, computer-aided sampling experiments, software development and
experimental measurements. Emphasis is on: (1) local topographic features on
fracture profiles directly from digitized profile coordinate data; (2)
topographic features related to crack closure in metal alloys experiencing
fatigue loading; (3) quantitative analysis of microcrack fatigue damage in
metal-matrix composites; (4) sampling tests on digitized fracture profile data
to develop efficient sampling schemes. %%% This effort has practical
applications in the description and analysis of topographic surfaces in several
fields including materials science, biology, and botany. ***
