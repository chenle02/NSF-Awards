This award supports cooperative research in photochemistry between J. Kerry
Thomas of Notre Dame University and Andres Olea of the University of Chile in
Santiago. The work will involve the photolabelling of organic (biological)
compounds with pyrene. Such photoreactions have been studied at both
universities with this specific work having its start at Notre Dame. The
approach will include the location of the pyrene, whether in the choline region,
or close to the glycerol or to the alkane chain region and also the production
of derivatives of pyrene for probing other systems such as micelles, vesicles,
simple alkanes and polyelectrolytes. Techniques already in use are fast pulse
kinetics at Notre Dame and steady state kinetics in Chile. These will complement
each other to establish the mechanisms by which the probe molecules: pyrene,
azopyrene and azidopyrene form the addition products with the host medium.
Chile's strength is in product analysis and that of Notre Dame is in fast pulse
analysis of earlier events. This cooperation will lead to the development of
photochemical mechanisms of great use to the photochemical and colloid
community.
