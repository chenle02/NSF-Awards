This study is of the way in which magnetic mineralogy and petrology vary across
metamophic aureoles in basic and ultrabasic rocks in Washington State and on
Vancouver Island. It will test models predicting the appearance and
disappearance of magnetic phases during prograde metamorphic reactions, to
characterize the induced and remanent magnetic properties associated with these
phases, and to extrapolate the results to deeper crustal levels.
