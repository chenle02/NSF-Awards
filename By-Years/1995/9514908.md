9514908 Easley This project studies the following important question: What does
an individual do when confronted with a new potentially complex, stochastic
decision problem? According to standard expected utility theory, before making
any choices the individual determines all possible stochastic processes that
could be driving the states of the world and accesses a prior over these
processes. As appealing as this theory is in relatively simple settings in which
no further learning need occur, it is difficult to accept in complex settings.
This project develops an alternative evolutionary foundation for static expected
utility maximization. Within this alternative framework individuals do not
access beliefs over all possible stochastic processes. They do not even attempt
to determine the set of possible processes. Instead, they act and learn from
their experience. Here an individual begins with a set of candidate decision
rules, starts with weights on these rules, and selects an initial rule using
these weights as probabilities. She/he then acts according to the recommendation
made by the selected rule. After observing the state and the payoff that is
achieved, the individual updates the weights on rules using an evolutionary
dynamic. He/she selects the rule to use at the next date based on these updated
weights, and so on. Based on the work completed so far, it is known that with
three natural axioms on the dynamic: symmetry, monotonicity, and independence,
the individual eventually chooses a rule that is a subjective expected utility
maximizer with correct expectations. One part of the project is to determine if
these axioms are minimal for this conclusion. This project extends the process
oriented model of choice to richer settings and an analysis of interaction
between multiple evolutionary individuals.
