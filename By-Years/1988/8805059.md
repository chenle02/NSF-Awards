This year-long program will measure soil gas Rn and Hg at sites over the active
silicic Rabaul Caldera in Papua New Guinea, in order to test a model developed
at Long Valley, California and the Phlegrean Fields, Italy. Rabaul has erupted
catastrophically several times in the last 3,500 years, and seismic evidence
strongly suggested a major eruption in 1983. This did not take place but the
potential is still there and the volcano remains a serious threat. Preliminary
data, collected by the PIs just before the crisis of 1983, indicated that
substantial anomalous concentrations of both gases were related to the center of
uplift and caldera boundary faults. Detectors will be placed over the margins of
the caldera, as well as under water in Rabaul harbor (inside the caldera). These
should provide baseline measurements necessary to establish the usefulness of Rn
and Hg emissions as eruption precursers. The local volcano observatory personnel
are also very interested in them as an additional tool to be used in their
efforts to monitor this specific volcano.
