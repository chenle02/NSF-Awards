9300445 Isserman This award provides funds to the Regional Research Institute at
West Virginia University for an REU Site which offers students a research
experience in geography and regional science. The program brings students from
colleges with limited research opportunities to the university for their junior
years. Each student works closely with a faculty mentor from the Regional
Research Institute and experiences the entire research process from defining a
topic to presenting results. Women and underrepresented minorities have
priority. The program was developed and refined during a successful three-year
pilot project. In the Fall semester, the students become familiar with their
substantive areas, learn research skills, begin to understand the nature of
inquiry and scholarly research, and prepare a research proposal. In the Spring
semester, they work actively on their research projects and prepare a draft
report. The Summer stage varies; some students opt to work fulltime on ambitious
extensions of their research, while otheres revise their draft reports. The
overall goal is to prepare a manuscript suitable for conference presentation and
journal publication. A group seminar and numerous other activities prepare the
students to conduct research, provide the opportunity for scholarly interaction,
and encourage the students to attend graduate school. As Undergraduate Research
Fellows, they are part of the University Honors Program, live in the Honors
dormitory, and participate in Honors classes and activities. This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences. ***
