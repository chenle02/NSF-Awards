The primary objective of this project is to develop adequate communication tools
within mathematics courses delivered by web-based distance learning
technologies. Web-environments for distance learning college courses do not
provide basic communication tools for math courses. Also in face-to-face math
courses, commuter students especially, need to collaborate outside of class.
Assessment of distance math instructors indicates they wish to create/edit math
notation, conceptual diagrams and graphs directly in online postings. The goals
of this project are: 1) Provide math instructors and students with direct
creation/editing of math notation, conceptual drawings and graphs in online
postings. 2) Adapt existing web-based and face-to-face college math courses to
include basic communication tools for math. 3) Provide faculty
development/support for re-design of distance ed. math courses. 4) Research more
natural/diagrammatic math communication and math learning. 5) Spread basic math
distance ed. communication tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
