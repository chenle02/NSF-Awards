ABSTRACT for Award DMS-0401056 of Pop

The present research project concerns modern Galois Theory, more specifically
birational Anabelian Geometry. The main problem I will be investigating is
trying to recover the birational class of a variety (over an algebraically
closed base field) from the pro-l Galois theory of its function field. Related
to this, there are several other questions, like the one by Ihara/Oda-Matsumoto
concerning a geometric/combinatoric description of the Galois group of the field
of rational numbers. The above question is also related to describing rational
points of varieties via the so called Section Conjecture. This kind of questions
were initiated -in the arithmetic situation- in some remarkable (unpublished)
manuscripts by Grothendieck. But it appears that in higher dimensions, one has
such "anabelian phenomena" even in the total absence of arithmetic, i.e., over
an algebraically closed base field.

The Galois Theory makes a bridge between two very different mathematical
aspects, namely some basic algebraic objects, like fields, or more general
spaces (varieties) on the one side, and the way one solves algebraic equations,
or constructs covers of the spaces in discussion, on the other side. Now the
(birational) Anabelian Geometry asserts that in the case the field one works
over is "primitive enough", respectively the geometry of the space one
constructs covers of, is "complicated enough", the totality of the "recipes" of
solving all the algebraic equations, respectively of constructing all the
covers, encodes the field, respectively the space under discussion. This opens a
completely new perspective in approaching some very fundamental mathematical
questions. The present research project addresses some of the basic problems in
this mathematical field of research.
