Synapsid ("mammal-like") reptiles and fossil mammals of Mesozoic age are the
fossils that record the evolutionary transition from reptiles to mammals. Dr.
James Hopson has been a leading investigator into the anatomy and functional
capabilities of these intensely studied groups. He now proposes to incorporate
important new fossil representatives into an analysis of evolutionary
relationships within and among these critical groups. These new anatomical data
come from museum collections in Europe and South Africa, and from new
collections in Mexico and Argentina. Despite decades of focused study, the
evolution from reptiles to mammals is not understood in detail. The proposed
research will illuminate important anatomical details from relevant groups,
thereby establishing the evolutionary affinities among early mammals and their
most likely point of divergence from their reptilian progenitors. The results of
this research will find a wide audience among zoologists and evolutionary
biologists in general.
