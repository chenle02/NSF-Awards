9405490 McGill This research collaboration is to test the hypothesis that
geomorphic features offset the same amount formed in the same number of
earthquakes, and that features offset different amounts along the same segment
of the fault were offset in different numbers of earthquakes. The area of study
will be the Garlock Fault in southern California. Previously, these hypotheses
were used to estimate the number of earthquakes associated with features offset
different amounts along the Garlock fault. However, lessons learned from the
1992 Landers, California earthquake show violations of these hypotheses. A more
detailed study of offsets and dating of features along the Garlock fault should
provide new evidence relating to the idea of "characteristic earthquakes" which
has in the past been a cornerstone of seismic hazard estimation. This research
is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
