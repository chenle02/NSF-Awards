This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site in plant biotechnology at Cook College, the land-grant arm of Rutgers
University. The program will focus on reduction of stress and enhancement of
stress resistance in plants via cellular and molecular techniques. This emphasis
parallels the principal research theme of the Center for Agricultural Molecular
Biology (AGBIOTECH) at Cook College, which will coordinate and administer the
program. Eight students (including women and minorities) will be recruited
through professional networks in New Jersey and nearby states to participate in
an intensive three-month summer program centered around student research
projects and including weekly seminar and journal club meetings; Up to nine
credits for the program may be earned through independent study options. The
program will culminate in a one-day conference showcasing student presentation,
to which appropriate graduate program directors and industry representatives
from the region will be invited.
