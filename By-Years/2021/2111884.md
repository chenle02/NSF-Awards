The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve diagnosis of specific
disorders with metabolic measurement of whole blood. It will be used at the
point of care as a rapid diagnostic for newborn screening (~3.9 million babies
born annually in the U.S.) and as a daily monitoring system for people living
with specific diseases (~600,000 people in the U.S.). This will improve clinical
outcomes at reduced cost of care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address specific technical
challenges in the device design to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, expected
to increase by a factor of 10. The systems engineering and quality control will
also be explored to prepare for translation at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
