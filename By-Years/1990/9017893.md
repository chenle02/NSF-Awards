This work covers a wide range of problems whose solution is required in order
that current paradigms of melt migration (percolation, crack propagation,
diapirism) can be placed on a firm foundation. This theoretical effort is
complementary to existing and expected experimental efforts and geophysical data
and has components of microphysics (behavior of partial melts at the lengthscale
of individual grains), mesophysics (behavior at intermediate lengthscales) and
macrophysics (behavior of geological systems, e.g., mid-ocean ridges, subduction
zone volcanism, seamounts).
