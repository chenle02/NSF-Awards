In designing structures or mechanical systems subject to variable dynamic loads,
such as wind gusts or earth tremors, the theoretical results for the optimal
shapes exhibit a pattern of discontinuous solutions. These theoretical
predictions are not supported by numerical results. In addition, when a
structural shape is designed to meet a worst-case, the resulting design has a
new worst-case. If the design is modified to meet the new worst-case, the worst-
case again shifts. There is no guarantee that this process will converge to an
optimal design. A method of simultaneous optimization and control is developed
in contrast to the iterative method described above. Such a procedure would lead
to more robust designs and would free the designer from fruitless iterations
during the design process.
