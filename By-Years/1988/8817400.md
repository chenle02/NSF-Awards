This proposal is concerned with the computational complexity of some basic and
important problems in the number theory. These problems lie on the border
between computer science and number theory. The proposal has both theoretical
and practical aspects. The proposal is divided into three sections. The first
section concerned with practical and theoretical aspects of methods for integer
factoring. The second section discusses reducibility among number- theoretic
problems, a field in which the principal investigstor has been particularly
active. The third section is concerned with the interaction between number
theory and automata theory, an area which has experienced a renaissancein the
past few years.
