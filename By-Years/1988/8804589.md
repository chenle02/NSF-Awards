This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be used in the
following research projects: (1) The development of finite-generation methods
for solving large-scale problems in extended linear- quadratic programming; (2)
The development of robust algorithms for constrained optimization problems; (3)
The development of algorithms for the minimization of functions with errors and
global Newton methods; (4) The development of numerical methods for the solution
of geophysical inverse problems.
