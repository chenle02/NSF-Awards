Our program supports Native American Students who declare themselves forestry
majors at Northern Arizona University. Enrichment activities support retention.
We will address family and community participation, cultural dissonance, and the
cause of low student self-esteem. Central to the effort will be a full-time
Native American professional counselor/advisor. The program will fund visits and
communication between family members and School of Forestry faculty and
students. Native American professionals will become involved as role
model/mentors and advisors. Inclusion of Native American professionals will
become involvement as role model/mentors and advisors. Inclusion of Native
American values, tradition, and knowledge in the undergraduate curriculum will
be a priority. The first year student research program will focus on the content
of the junior year curriculum; a faculty member with primary responsibility for
that curriculum will supervise the summer research work, which will be conducted
by the Native Americans who have completed the junior year course work. In
future years, the research agenda will continue to relate to the curriculum,
with additional effort motivated by problems defined in consultation with tribal
forestry departments. Our measures of success are increased in (1) graduation
rates of Native Americans and (2) numbers of Native Americans pursuing advanced
degrees in science.
