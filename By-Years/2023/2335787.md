The U.S. Research Data Summit held by the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) will convene representatives
of approximately 40 key research data organizations across all sectors for a
discussion of strategies to: a) increase coherence of interests and activities
among the various organizations, b) to increase communication and collaboration,
and c) to reduce duplication of effort. The summit will also explore how
participating organizations can work together to position the United States to
be appropriately represented in and benefit from international discussions on
research data. The summit planning committee will bring together a diverse group
of invitees and will include individuals from research institutions, industry,
U.S. federal agencies, scholarly societies, disciplinary and basic and applied
data science professional societies and those that nucleate underserved
populations, research libraries, higher education associations, and U.S.-based
project funders. The summit will be held October 10-11, 2023 in Washington, DC.
