This project lies in an area of algebra that is being developed with a view to
applications in mathematical and theoretical physics. The emphasis is on a type
of structure called "cluster algebras" invented in 2001 that have since proven
to be useful in a wide and still expanding range of mathematical subjects
including combinatorics, geometry, and high energy physics. This project will
naturally lead to the development of courses and research projects on both
undergraduate and graduate levels. Planned activities will develop new inter-
institutional and cross-disciplinary collaborations include conferences,
workshops and seminar series. Particular attention will be paid to recruitment
of graduate students from underrepresented groups and with diverse educational
backgrounds, and, through community outreach, to attracting high school students
to mathematical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will continue their work
on applications of Poisson Geometry to the theory of cluster algebras. The main
goals of the project include construction and study of (i) exotic generalized
cluster structures on simple Lie groups compatible with Poisson-Lie brackets
described by the Belavin-Drinfeld classification; (ii) generalized cluster
structures on the Drinfeld double and the Poisson-Lie dual of a simple Poisson-
Lie group; (iii) discrete integrable systems arising as sequences of cluster
transformations and elementary transformations of higher genus nets; and (iv)
quivers of finite mutation type.
