The principal theoretical methodology proposed here is Brownian dynamics (BD).
The basic idea in Brownian dynamics simulations is to model the complexation of
two proteins undergoing relative motion according to Brownian motion under the
influence of interprotein forces. The forces are often electrostatic in origin
and continuum approaches such as the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) method have been
employed. In most BD calculations, the associating proteins have been described
by simple models and while this has yielded qualitatively correct results, it
has been difficult to predict absolute association rate constants. Also, only
simple models of hydrodynamic interactions have been considered. We propose here
to a) develop a detailed residue-level model for substrate/target and b)
incorporate more accurate hydrodynamic effects into the method. It is
increasingly recognized that simulations would serve as a valuable companion to
experimental investigations and we want to establish the validity of Brownian
dynamics as a useful method for studying kinetics of macromolecular association.
