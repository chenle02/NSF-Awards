The conceptual framework for international macroeconomic policy analysis has
evolved little over the past decade. The aggregative sticky-price model is still
the dominant paradigm in policy circles world wide. It underpins the
international macro- econometric models used by government agencies and
international institutions. But even more importantly, the basic lessons of
these models permeate all levels of policy discussion. While the shortcomings of
these models have long been recognized, academic research has remained largely
dormant. There have been significant advances in the study of flexible-price
international macro models over this period, but thus far these models have had
virtually no policy impact. It is understandable that policy makers are
reluctant to ignore the familiar sticky-price models simply because they are out
of fashion among theorists. The goal of this project is to incorporate new
models of price rigidities into an explicitly intertemporal framework that can
adequately account for the long and short run effects of current account
imbalances, government fiscal deficits, and their impacts on other macroeconomic
variables. The resulting analytical framework offers a fresh perspective on a
broad range of international economic issues, including exchange rate
overshooting, optimum currency areas, the fiscal-monetary mix, and strategic
aspects of policy interdependence.
