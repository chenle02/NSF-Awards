In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professors P. Kleiber and K. Sando of the University of Iowa will
continue their investigations of state-resolved molecular dynamics using `half-
collision` methods. They pioneered the application of the technique known as
scattering state spectroscopy in order to study inelastic (including chemically
reactive) collisions. In this project they will extend these experiments to
collisions of metal atoms with the molecules H2 and CH4. Another, new technique
involves `fractional collisions,` in which scattering resonances in a metal-
ion/molecule collision complex are detected using orbital-following models.
These are somewhat complementary techniques which help describe different
aspects of the collision process. %%% Theoretical models exist for the
photodissociation of alkali diatomic molecules, but such theories are often not
amenable to simple physical interpretation and can not easily be applied to
complex dissociation processes. In some cases of current interest, such as
collisions between ultra-cold atoms, the underlying physics is not understood
well enough to allow application of theoretical methods with confidence. The
results of these experiments on reactions between excited metal atoms and
molecules in relatively simple systems will allow theoretical dynamical models
to be tested before applying them to more complicated problems in the domain of
collision and photodissociation dynamics. Practical applications include a
better understanding of chemical vapor deposition processes
