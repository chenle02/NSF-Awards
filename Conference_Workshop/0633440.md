The proposal is to partially support a five-day workshop on ``Higher Structures
in Geometry and Physics'', to be held at the Institut Henri Poincare, Paris,
France, from Jan 15 to Jan 19, 2007. The workshop is organized by PI with
Alberto Cattaneo from Zurich University, Switzerland. It is part of the IHP
trimester program on ``Groupoids and stacks in Physics and Geometry", where many
graduate courses are offered to students and young researchers. Higher
structures, in particular homotopy algebras, have appeared in many branches of
mathematics and particularly in mathematical physics ranging from deformation
quantization, mirror symmetry, Poisson geometry and integrable systems. The
workshop aims to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists and
groups working on related areas from different aspects. It brings together
leading experts and young researchers in these subjects to address the important
questions.

There are many bright young people working in these subjects around the world
and this workshop will be a great opportunity to bring US researchers especially
young people to exchange their ideas with their international colleagues and to
broaden their perspective. PI anticipates inviting many mathematicians at the
postdoctoral and graduate student level (mainly from the United States, and
Europe) to the workshop.
