The importance of teaching simulation to Computer Science majors has become
increasingly apparent in recent years, as discussed at a number of professional
meetings. For this reason, there is a growing need for well-trained faculty to
teach simulation. The purpose of this project is to design, organize and hold a
workshop and follow-up meeting that will enhance skills for teaching simulation
for undergraduate computer science majors, produce resources and modules for
teaching computer simulation, and facilitate and promote interaction among
simulation educators. The workshop is an outgrowth of materials developed from
an NSF-CCD grant, "Simulation for Computer Science Majors."
