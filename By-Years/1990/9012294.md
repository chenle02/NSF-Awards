This group of investigators will study theoretical models of ionic movement in
biological channels. The theoretical models will be used in conjunction with
data, to suggest new experiments, and to modify the existing model. The goal of
these models is to better understand the biology. Many functions of many cells
are determined by individual channel proteins, which control the movement of
substances and signals across otherwise quite impermeable membranes. This group
will use the theory of Brownian motion of ions in solution to analyze the
experimentally known properties of ion movement in channels. The group hopes to
understand and predict the large mass of experimental data describing
conductance, current-voltage relations, and selectivity of single open channels
of various types.
