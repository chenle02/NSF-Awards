This award supports travel for participants in the symposium Advances in
Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Observational and Experimental Data,
held July 13, 2013 on the North Carolina State University campus in Raleigh,
North Carolina. The past several decades have seen numerous significant advances
in statistical theory and methodology for the analysis of data from experimental
and observational studies. These developments have had a profound impact on
statistical practice. The conference features presentations by leaders in the
development of statistical theory and methods in areas such as censored time-to-
event data, missing data, longitudinal data, and causal inference.

The conference will serve as a forum for discussion of developments in
statistical methodology and theory that have propelled advances in research in
the health, biological, epidemiological, social, and economic sciences. The
conference offers a perfect opportunity for junior researchers to gain a
valuable perspective on emerging trends and the opportunity to interact with
senior and mid-career level leaders responsible for past and present advances.
