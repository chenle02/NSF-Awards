This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to evaluate
the use of One Cell Systems' microencapsulation technology in the assessment of
transfected cells. The current commercial importance of genetically modified or
transfected cells in the development of vaccines, diagnostics or drug delivery
systems as well as the treatment of malignant, infectious and genetic diseases
is well recognized. Obtaining and characterizing a pure population of
transfected cells or evaluating the efficacy of different transfection methods
usually requires including a drug-resistance gene and clone selection. The
ability to encapsulate single cells into agarose microdrops would allow the
expression of the desired protein to be measured in individual cells using
automated methods such as flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting. This proposal is designed to determine the feasibility of using the
encapsulation system to evaluate transfected cells. These initial studies will
utilize two different transfected cell lines; a Chinese hamster ovary cell line
(CHO l-l5500. ATCC CRL 9609) which secretes tissue plasminogen activator and a
mouse mammary line (CSM a b lH, ATCC CRL 8401) secreting human chorionic
gonadotropin. Successful completion of these phase I studies would provide the
basis for the development of a new and potentially more efficient technology for
the evaluation and selection of transfected cells.
