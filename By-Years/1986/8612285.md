This project, which involves both international collaboration and industrial
cooperation, is a continuation of a research program on the measurement of
vapor-liquid equilibrium at low and high pressures. The mixtures to be studied
are ones that are of both industrial interest and important for the further
development of molecular thermodynamic modeling. Specifically, at low pressures,
the vapor-liquid equilibrium of cyclic ethers (1, 4 dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and
furfural), esters, ethanoatesa and formates, each with alkanes, will be
measured. At high pressures the thermodynamic hehavior of nitrogen and carbon
dioxide will be measured, bothe individually and together, with paraffinic
hydrocarbons. All measurements will be at above ambient temperatures.
