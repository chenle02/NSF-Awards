This project is to implement a high spectral resolution fluorescence lidar
system capable of simultaneous measurement of the sodium density and temperature
in the upper mesopause and lower thermosphere. This will be a unique system that
leads to an easily operated stable system and will become the only Lidar system
in the US capable of such temperature measurements and only the second such
system in the world. The system is planned to be used to investigate the
structure and dynamics of the mesopause region.
