The region around the earth extending, above approximately 400km, out to many
earth radii is called the exosphere. In this region hydrogen is the predominant
specie and it has long been thought of as a region where collisions are rare and
neutral atoms can travel in ballistic trajectories. This view has been changed
recently through observations of the exospheres on both Venus and Earth. The
distribution of hydrogen is now thought to be noticeably influenced by resonant
scatter of solar Lyman alpha, by charge exchange interactions between H,O and
hot H+ as well as neutral-neutral collisions. This theoretical study will
attempt to insert many of these processes into the existing model of exospheric
dynamics using new high speed computer facilities at the University of Texas.
The approach will be to use the monte carlo technique to develop a model that
will give a global picture of the concentrations, mean velocity, temperature and
velocity distributions under the various input conditions.
