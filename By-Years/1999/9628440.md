9628440 Carmichael This grant provides $124,800 as partial support of the costs
of acquiring an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer with wavelength dispersive
(WDS) detection to increase both the range of elements detectable and to provide
lower detection limits for major, minor and trace elemental analyses of
geological samples over the present analytical capabilities of their XRF
equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) which is suffering from
prolonged use and for which replacement parts are no longer kept in stock. This
new XRF will allow this group to continue their high quality active research
program in a wide range of interdisciplinary areas including igneous petrology,
economic geology, crystallography and archaeology. Specific research projects
will include the geochemical characterization of erupted lavas within the
Jalisco Block of Western Mexico as petrogenetic indicators in this tectonically
independent segment of continental crust, pedogenic and surficial geochemical
studies as indicators of paleoclimates and for characterization of the major,
minor and trace element geochemistry of intrusive and extrusive igneous samples
for which isotopic analyses will also be conducted. ***
