Tendon is a dense, fibrous tissue that connects muscle to bone. It plays a host
of biomechanical roles, is architecturally complex, and virtually impossible to
repair if damaged. This symposium will address a fundamental shortcoming of
current research into the biology of tendon. Organismic biologists have little
or no appreciation for clinical, developmental, or molecular aspects of tendon
biology, while biomedical researchers are largely unaware of the comparative
physiology, evolutionary patterns, and diverse roles of tendon in vertebrates.
The goal of the symposium is to bring together researchers from a variety of
applied and basic research areas to synthesize the current state of our
knowledge of tendon. Participants will also point out new and innovative
directions for future research. Speakers will cover a broad range of scale, from
the molecular biology of tendon organization, through patterning at the cellular
level, and tissue interactions with muscle and bone, to the many roles of tendon
in the whole organism. In addition to serving as the basis for the first volume
ever devoted to the biology of tendon, this symposium will foster a synergy
between tendon researchers in such wide-ranging fields as molecular
developmental biology, biochemistry, functional morphology, and biomedicine.
