Nyang'i is a nearly extinct Kuliak language spoken in northeastern Uganda. The
Kuliak languages have attracted the attention of linguists since the 1970s due
to the light they shed on East African prehistory and to their typologically
unique features. Nevertheless, Nyang'i remains almost entirely undescribed and
undocumented. Nyang'i is no longer used as a language of everyday communication,
and was once believed to be extinct; however, a small number of semi-speakers of
Nyang'i have been located in recent years, only one of whom is able to fluently
produce narrative texts. These semi-speakers represent the last opportunity to
supplement our currently limited understanding of the Nyang'i language.

Primary data collected by this project will consist of a large transcribed and
annotated corpus of video and audio recorded speech in Nyang'i. This corpus will
be used to prepare descriptive materials including a grammar and an English-
Karamojong-Nyang'i dictionary. The descriptive materials will include particular
emphasis on typological features that remain understudied in East African
languages at large such as tone, vowel harmony, case marking, and the
grammatical indication of motion, location, and direction. This project will
support the scientific training of a rising early-career scholar.
