This Research for Undergraduate Eduation award will permit the Principal
Investigator (PI) to continue studies of the pulsations of stars in their
terminal stages of evolution, white dwarfs and pre-white dwarfs. Using portable
instrumentation constructed from a previous NSF award, the PI will spend 75
nights per year with one of two undergraduate students monitoring the light
variations of candidate white dwarf pulsators. Many of the current sample of
pulsating white dwarfs were discovered by this PI. The PI will continue these
searches, and will also search for pulsating stars that have previously ejected
most of their masses to become white dwarfs (planetary nebulae) and will also
compare the pulsation periods of a selected star to determine whether the star's
ageing can be followed in "real time" from its shortening pulsation periods.
