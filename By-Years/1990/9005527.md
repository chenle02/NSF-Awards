Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and more on computers
that are capable of handling sophisticated simulations, data analysis and
graphics software. The need to accomodate multiple users on the single
laboratory computer and multiple users on a single chemistry department facility
can be met by a single solution: individual work stations for the majority of
user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to other types of work stations
and, ultimately, to a mini supercomputer. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the North
Dakota State University to acquire, maintain and operate a graphics computer
system. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition
include: 1. Theoretical and experimental studies of Lewis acid chelated
intermediates. 2. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding, energetics and dynamics of
main group organometallic reactions. 3. Total synthesis of natural products.
