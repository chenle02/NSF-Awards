9219151 Clements The research addresses the difficult problem of optimizing
generation scheduling with full network transmission constraints. The problem is
intractable as stated. The approach taken here is to decompose the large problem
into three related subproblems. One is the familiar optimal power flow problem.
Another incorporates minimum up-time and down-time constraints; it is a
relatively simple dynamic programming problem. The third, a quadratic
programming problem, is subject to "ramping" and energy constraints. Efficient
iterative solution of these three subproblems requires the development of
specially tailored interior point algorithms and the use of innovative new ideas
for adjusting the augmented Lagragian penalty parameter. ***
