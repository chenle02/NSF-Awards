Description: This project is to support U.S. participation in the International
Conference on Language and National Development to be held in Hyderabad, India,
January 5-11, 1988. The collaborating institutes are Osmania University and the
University of Hyderabad, India. The focus of the conference is the case of
India, namely: to assess the legislative and administrative changes brought
about in the roles of modern Indian languages and English since independence;
estimate the level and extent of use of major regional languages; the work of
various agencies involved in language development, compare the mechanisms and
processes underlying the evolution of new registers and styles in major
languages, evaluate the issues related to language conflicts and to compare
cross-cultural and cross-linguistic models of languages and national development
from other parts of the world. The conference proceedings will be published.
Scope: The conference has the potential of making a contribution to the
infrastructure of the science of linguistics, and to the furtherance of the
field of sociolinguistic studies related to India. It is likely to be of benefit
to both developed and developing countries with multi-lingual populations.
