It is proposed to continue a program of high-precision measurements of the
thermodynamic properties of superfluid helium three. Four studies are envisaged:
1) Resolve the discrepancy between measurements of the magnetization
discontinuity at the A-B transition made by static (SQUID) and dynamic (NMR)
techniques. 2) Settle the issue of what is the microscopic order parameter of
the A phase. 3) Pursue study of the nature of the recently-discovered phenomenon
of superheating of the A-B phase transition. 4) Continue our effort to
numerically model our measurements of hydrodynamics in the A phase.
