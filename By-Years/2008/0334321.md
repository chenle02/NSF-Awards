The researchers will develop and test process-level models of the dry deposition
of particles, with diameters of 100 to 2000 nanometers, to a range of surface
types with focus on complex canopies. The relevant processes contributing to
deposition (for example, Brownian motion, impaction, surface resistance,
sedimentation) will be studied as a function of particle size, which is very
important since dominant processes change as a function of particle size. The
model will incorporate particle dynamics (for example, coagulation and growth)
along with deposition, and methods will be examined to best represent treatment
when the processes occur on similar time scales. A sensitivity analysis will be
conducted to determine the predominant parameters that control particle
deposition. The model will be compared to observations of particle deposition
determined using eddy covariance techniques provided by researchers from the
University of Helsinki. The improved model developed in this project will be
compared with other existing models of particle deposition. Broader impacts of
this project include the training and educating of graduate and undergraduate
students, and the enhancement of international collaborations.
