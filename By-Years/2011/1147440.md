People move. The world we move about in is filled with objects, animals, and
other people that also move. Perceiving patterns of visual motion provides
humans with information about where they are heading and how fast, and about the
kinds of objects, animals, and people in the environment. Scientists have
relatively detailed knowledge about how adults perceive motion and how their
brains respond to it. But, researchers know very little about how motion
perception develops in infancy and childhood, and we know even less about the
brain systems that detect and process motion. It appears that both perception
and brain activity take many years to mature. So, this project will measure
perception and brain activity in infants, school-age children, and adults to
describe the patterns of development in detail. This project will also create
computer-based models that mimic how the human brain develops. The goal is to
understand how motion perception and motion-related brain activity change as
humans mature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several feature of this project strengthen
its intellectual merit: Motion processing contributes to many aspects of
perception, cognition, and action; few studies focus on perceptual development
from infancy through adulthood; and, the combination of behavior, brain activity
and computer-based simulation, promises new insights into a fundamental
perceptual system. The project will have broader impacts by leveraging expertise
and resources from the existing NSF-funded Center of Excellence for Learning in
Education, Science and Technology (CELEST); by focusing on scientific questions
important for child safety and normal cognitive and motor development; and by
engaging young adults, especially women and individuals from underrepresented
groups, in scientific research.
