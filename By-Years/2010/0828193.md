This award supports an initiative by Professor Madeleine M. Joullie of the
University of Pennsylvania to provide vital information to the chemical
community on NSF-supported programs focussing on chemical research and
education. The Town Hall Meetings will be conducted during the next four
National American Chemical Society Meetings and thus will allow conference
participants from diverse geographic areas (New Orleans (Spring 2008),
Philadelphia (Fall 2008), Salt Lake City (Spring 2009), and Washington, DC (Fall
2009)) to participate. At the request of the organizer, NSF staff will be made
available to answer questions on specific NSF-wide and Divisional solicitations
as well as individual questions from current and potential investigators.
