The Metazoa includes all of the diverse groups of animals on Earth. An
understanding of the manner in which these groups have diversified in form and
habitat is hampered by the lack of information concerning their precise
relationships. The sequence of bases in the mitochondrial DNA molecule and the
arrangements of the genes encoded by it will be determined for a representative
of each major group included in this study. These data will be combined with
published sequence data for the mitochondrial DNAs of members of other groups,
and then analyzed with the goal of achieving a better understanding of the
genetic relationships among the various groups of animals. The use of data from,
two different molecular levels (DNA base sequence and gene arrangement),
provides an internal check for consistency and is appropriate and necessary when
studying such dissimilar and distantly related groups. The results of this study
will form the basis for the first clear analysis of trends in the form,
diversity, and ecology of the Metazoa.
