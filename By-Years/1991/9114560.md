This research is on pressure consolidation of powders into advanced ceramic,
metallic, and intermetallic composites. The goal of the research is to develop
an ability to predict densification that will enable the selection of optimal
temperatures and pressures for processing these advanced materials. Analytical
and numerical modeling will be carried out for both homogeneous and composite
materials. Related experiments will be conducted to provide insight into the
important physical processes of consolidation. Emphasis will be placed on
densification of powder around reinforcing fibers. Accordingly, experiments will
be done to investigate the incidence of fiber failure during consolidation.
Models will also be developed for fiber failure and for the effect of such
failure on the final mechanical properties of the consolidated composite
material. The science and technology developed in this project will make it
possible to process advanced composites with the desired densified net shape and
mechanical properties.
