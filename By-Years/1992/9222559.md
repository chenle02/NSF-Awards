This is an award to provide support for conduct of a symposium and workshop on
advanced oxidation technologies as applied to the treatment of water,
wastewater, exhaust gases and remediation of soil. The purpose of this symposium
is to critically review the current status of advanced oxidation processes being
used and considered for use in environmental engineering practice as a step
toward defining further research needs. Session topics will include ozonation,
photolysis and photocatalysis, non-thermal plasmas, electron beam radiation,
electrohydraulic cavitation and sonolysis, and supercritical oxidation. This
symposium is jointly supported by the Electric Power Research Institute. Results
are expected to provide guidance for current use of advanced oxidation
technologies in environmental engineering practice and to identify further
research needed to provide the basis for engineering design of systems utilizing
these processes for abatement of pollution and in remediation of contaminated
environmental resources.
