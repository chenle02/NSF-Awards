In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Stewart Novick of the Chemistry Department of Wesleyan University will
conduct a series of investigations on the structures of transient free radicals
by means of pulsed-jet Fabry-Perot Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy
using a new instrument constructed at Wesleyan University. Among the species to
be studied are those of chemical as well as astro-chemical interest. Some
radical-containing van der Waals complexes will also be investigated. A free
radical may defined as a reactive transient molecular species in the gas phase.
A more conventional definition is that of a molecule, or molecular fragment,
with one or more unpaired electrons. These species are highly reactive, elusive,
hard to produce, and usually difficult to study. However, these radicals are
extremely important, both as intermediates in chemical reactions and as a
species in their own right. Many of the interstellar molecules that have been
discovered by radio astronomy are, in fact, radicals. Other radicals which can
be produced under laboratory conditions play a role as intermediates in organic
chemical reactions or, for example, as intermediates in commercial deposition of
thin metallic films. The research conducted in this project will provide
information on the structure and ground state electronic properties of an
important group of radicals and thus provide better understanding for their
possible use in chemical processes.
