This research project explores the interaction of hormones and the immune
response in producing reproductive display behaviors and specialized morphology
such as the rooster's bright red comb. Testosterone suppresses the immune
response in many kinds of animals, and Dr. Zuk will examine how the immune
system is affected by both natural and artificially-induced changes in the
levels of this important hormone. After challenging male animals with a
parasitic disease, their immune response will be monitored in the context of the
degree of development of sexual characteristics and their effect on females. The
research has implications for the study of the evolution of reproductive
behavior because it may bring to light a new mechanism for that evolution.
