Recently there has been a rapid growing interest in developing underwater
acoustic sensor networks, which can be used in monitoring aquatic environments
for scientific exploration, commercial exploitation, and coastline protection.
The complexity of aquatic environments and the sophistication of the networking
scenarios demand new solutions for underwater networks, and require significant
research efforts at every level of the protocol suite. In this project, a novel
approach of using surface radios to help underwater acoustics is employed. An
integrated hybrid radio and acoustic distributed system for geometrydynamic
shallow water applications is developed. This system has numerous benefits such
as high energy efficiency, high reliability and low end-to-end delay.
Deliverables include solutions to three critical tasks, namely, distributed
gateway deployment algorithms to reduce computational complexity, joint
optimization with underwater sensor network to improve the whole network
performance, and dynamic gateway deployment for mobile network scenarios. A set
of protocols and algorithms are also a part of the deliverables. These solutions
and algorithms contribute toward the intellectual merit. Beyond the research
significance, this project has important impact on education on three fronts
including supporting graduate students in their advanced research, supporting
undergraduates, women and other under-represented groups, and promoting multi-
disciplinary collaborations among faculty and students across departments.
