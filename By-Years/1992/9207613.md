This is a travel grant in support of a research workshop in the area of
queueing networks with finite capacity. This will be the second international
workshop ever to be held on this important topic, and it will take place at IBM
Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, on May 28-29, 1992. The subject
matter of this workshop deals with performance modelling of finite resources as
used in computer systems, computer communication networks, and flexible
manufacturing systems. In recent years, there have been significant advances in
the state-of-the-art in this area. However, not enough time is allocated to this
topic at the regular meetings of the relevant professional societies. The
objectives of this workshop are: o to provide the opportunity to researchers who
work in this area to present their latest research o to foster cooperation
between researchers, minimize unnecessary duplication, and identify new long-
term research objectives o to educate or bring up-to-date other researchers who
work in the other areas of computer and communication performance modelling o to
provide a comprehensive set of proceedings (the second in this research area).
