This award is for the development of four freshman/sophomore courses for
computer science majors and non-majors. The courses will teach multiple
programming paradigms, introduce formal reasoning early in the curriculum, and
exploit computational problems that arise in other disciplines. Course material
will be made available to other academic institutions and results of the
educational effort will be presented at professional meetings and conferences.
Cornell University plans to develop four introductory/ sophomore level courses
for computer science majors and non- majors. One course, targeted at students
with no previous programming experience, will focus on developing the students'
general problem-solving skills as well as their ability to use notation and
abstract thinking. The other three courses are alternative courses for audiences
with some background in computer science. These courses will provide a formal
introduction to functional programming and formal reasoning, as well as
continued instruction in imperative programming. Course materials will be
disseminated to other academic institutions and presentations will be made at
professional meetings and conferences.
