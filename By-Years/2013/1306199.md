The next generation of neutrino-less Double Beta Decay (NDBD) experiments may
provide an intriguing direction for extensions of the Standard Model, including
lepton number violation by two units and a new Majorana mass term in quantum
field theory unlike that of the Standard Model Higgs mass. If the neutrino is a
Majorana particle, it would be the only known fermion whose anti-particle is
itself. The absolute scale of neutrino masses can also be uniquely determined
via such experiments. These are fundamental questions of modern physics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable the UCLA group to continue their
research program in the CUORE NDBD experiment at the Gran Sasso underground
laboratory. The experiment is currently in the construction phase and is
expected to start data-taking by the end of 2014. The UCLA research effort will
focus on the quality assurance of the CUORE electronics system and on the
understanding of background sources. They will be responsible for testing,
installation and commissioning of the CUORE electronics system in collaboration
with the University of South Carolina and Milan groups. They will continue to
work on the Monte Carlo simulations of the CUORE-0/CUORE background sources.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;The NDBD experiments address
fundamental physics issues that have a scientific impact much beyond particle
and nuclear physics. The CUORE bolometer detector represents a major advance of
detector technology in neutrino sciences and is probably the best alpha detector
with a FWHM resolution of a few kiloelectronvolt (keV), which may have
applications in nuclear radiation measurements for physics and other applied
sciences. They will continue to involve their undergraduate students and NSF-REU
students in the research programs and provide them with research experiences in
neutrino physics and modern detector technology.
