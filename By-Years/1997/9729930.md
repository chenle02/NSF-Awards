Pell 9729930 The 12th Annual Penn State Symposium in Plant Physiology, titled
"Phosphorus in plant biology: regulatory roles in molecular, cellular,
organismic, and ecosystem processes" will be held May 28- 30, 1998 in State
College, Pennsylvania. The theme of this symposium addresses issues surrounding
phosphorus limitation, a moor concern in agricultural and natural ecosystems
worldwide. In this symposium international group of scientists will convene to
provide critical overviews of issue, challenges, and opportunities in a range of
topics in cell, and molecular biology, physiology, and ecology, with emphasis on
the roles of phosphorus in regulating plant process. There will be 23 invited
speakers; their presentations will be published as a proceedings by the American
Society of Plant Physiologist. There will also be approximately 50 contributed
posters which summarize current research by scientist, postdoctoral researchers,
and graduate students. Several focused discussion sessions have been organized
to allow for integration in the thinking amongst scientist conducting research
at molecular, whole plant, and ecological levels.
