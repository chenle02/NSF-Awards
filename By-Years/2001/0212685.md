The project will advance the understanding and modeling of Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJO) variability in the tropics from numerical experiments with a
regional model and coordinated diagnostic studies. The experiments are designed
to test various hypotheses for MJO genesis, particularly those related to
internal mechanisms and specific boundary forcing. The focus will be on
initiation and development of intra-seasonal convection over the equatorial
Indian and western Pacific ocean basins. Drs. Weare and Chen (University of
California, Davis) will conduct a suite of numerical experiments with regional
models (MM5, WRF) in which boundary conditions can be manipulated to selectively
suppress one or more of the hypothesized mechanisms. The PIs expect comparisons
of "control" and "perturbed" simulations of 20-70 day variability to reveal the
dominant mechanism of MJO development in both normal and ENSO climate
conditions. Simulation of MJO variability poses a great challenge: The state-of-
the-art atmospheric GCMs and coupled climate models (e.g., NCAR's Community
Atmospheric Model and Community Climate System Model) are presently unable to
simulate this phenomenon and its tropical and midlatitude impacts. The project
will thus lead to greater understanding and, potentially, more accurate modeling
of MJO variability, and its influence on long-term weather and seasonal-to-
interannual climate variability.
