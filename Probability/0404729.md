0404729 Khoshnevisan One of the primary concerns of this project is to develop a
systematic geometrical analysis of random fields. Special emphasis is placed on
investigating some of the random fields that arise in pure and applied
mathematics, statistics, mathematical oceanography, mathematical hydrology, and
mathematical physics. This research is to gather and develop probabilistic,
analytic, algebraic, and geometric tools that lead to a deeper understanding of
the geometry of random fields. It is expected that the contributions of this
proposal may help solve a number of long-standing open problems in the theories
of Levy processes and Brownian sheet, and promote applications of such random
fields in the aforementioned areas.
