This research explores the role that spread-spectrum signaling can have in the
factory. The researchers have developed a new characterization of the
interference in a direct-sequence spread- spectrum system with random coding
sequences, and have used the characterization to examine the performance of
coherent receivers. This exploratory investigation should lay the groundwork for
further research on direct-sequence spread- spectrum signaling for factory
applications.
