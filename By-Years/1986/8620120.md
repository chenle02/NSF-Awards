Mechanical devices to assist the heart after an heart attack have provided a
very important tool to the physician in the stabilization of the patients
condition. However the physiological interaction between the heart and the
assist device is not well understood. This proposal will contribute to the basic
knowledge of the mechanism for the device- heart response by quantifying this
response in terms of engineering terms. Quantitative knowledge of this
interaction will certainly lead to a more reasoned approach in the utilization
of such devices by medical practitioners.
