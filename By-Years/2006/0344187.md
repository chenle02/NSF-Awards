This project will explore a multidisciplinary collection of related problems
in&lt;br/&gt;which the theory of computing plays a fundamental role. The
problems involve&lt;br/&gt;a variety of topics in computational complexity,
algorithmic information theory,&lt;br/&gt;stochastic processes, statistical
inference, arti.cial intelligence, fractal geometry,&lt;br/&gt;dynamical
systems, game theory, and other areas, but they have several
crucial&lt;br/&gt;commonalities: The problems are ones that involve
computability and/or complexity theory&lt;br/&gt;in fundamental conceptual
respects. The problems are stochastic in the sense that they or their solutions
involve some sort of randomness. The problems are dynamic in the sense that they
or their solutions involve analyticor topological methods in addition to the
discrete and algebraic methods that more typically arise in the theory of
computing. The problems are strategic in the sense that they or their solutions
involve the design and analysis of algorithmic strategies for betting,
prediction, learning, game-playing, or some other task that is carried out in an
environment&lt;br/&gt;containing adversity.
