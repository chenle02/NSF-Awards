A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic
capabilities. the vessel is owned by NSF and operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University under a cooperative agreement. The Langseth
is different than other vessels in the Academic Fleet in that it is a designated
National Facility. It provides a unique combination of capabilities for imaging
the oceans, the seafloor and the solid earth beneath the sea. It is the only
vessel in the word dedicated to academic research that is capable of conducting
3D seismic surveys as well as extended offset 2D surveys. The tuned, linear
source array, consisting of up to 36 airguns, with a total capacity of 6,600 cu
in is also unique asset of this vessel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts
&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two
of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists
to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-
funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate
review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance
and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from
any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
