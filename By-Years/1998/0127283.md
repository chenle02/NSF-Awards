Mathematical Sciences (21). This proof-of-concept project is creating a Web-
based set of instructional materials consisting of a database of interactive
mathematical curves, a "National Curve Bank," together with exercises related to
the characteristics of these curves. Three mathematical areas are under
development: Precalculus, Calculus, and the History of Mathematics; and within
each of these areas, links to specific topics allow students to access and make
use of a wide variety of curves. Accompanying exercises ask the student to
manipulate the curves or investigate their attributes. A prototype for this
project has been investigated, featuring animation and interactive components.
Such a "National Curve Bank" expects to provide students with immediate feedback
and permit faculty to add an active learning component to various courses.
