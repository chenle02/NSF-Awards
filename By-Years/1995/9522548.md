The goal of this project is to describe and analyze the grammar of San Miguel
Chimalapa Zoque (MIG Zoque). This is a Mixe-Zoquean language spoken in
southwestern Oaxaca, Mexico. The project will be the first detailed
documentation of MIG Zoque and the first study of the syntax of any of the
Oaxacan Zoque dialects. Project work involves twelve months of study in Mexico,
working with native speaker consultants to determine the grammatical structure
of the language. Samples of naturally-occurring speech and narrative texts of
various kinds will be recorded, translated, and analyzed in order to study the
discourse structure of MIG Zoque and to enhance and guide the direct elicitation
process. The result of the project will be the student investigator's doctoral
dissertation. The project is expected to have significance for (a) the
documentation and description of Mixe-Zoquean languages, which are rapidly being
replaced by Spanish in all communities; (b) historical work in reconstructing
epi-Olmec, an ancestor of the modern Zoquean languages; (c) theoretical work in
morphosyntax and syntax, by providing current and usable data on a language with
many interesting phenomena at these levels of the grammar; and (d) the promotion
(via the foregoing) of research on a wide range of languages, especially those
studied in the 'field' and faced with imminent extinction.
