DMS-0204576&lt;br/&gt;Kevin M. Whyte&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
concerned with several aspects of large &lt;br/&gt;scale geometry and topology.
One of the main points of &lt;br/&gt;study is the problem of producing actions
from quasi-actions, &lt;br/&gt;along the lines of the classical theorems of
Sullivan and&lt;br/&gt;Tukia. Such results have significant implications in the
quasi-isometric classification of groups, especially for &lt;br/&gt;groups with
natural splittings as a complex of groups. A &lt;br/&gt;second area of study is
large scale versions of rigidity&lt;br/&gt;phenomena in the geometry of
symmetric spaces, and &lt;br/&gt;specifically the classification of quasi-
isometric embeddings &lt;br/&gt;between symmetric spaces, giving a geometric
analogue of &lt;br/&gt;superrigidity. A third and independant project involves
&lt;br/&gt;coarse versions of topological rigidity, including the coarse
&lt;br/&gt;Borel, Novikov, and Baum-Connes conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Roughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is &lt;br/&gt;the study of
geometric properties of objects "seen from far &lt;br/&gt;away". From this
perspective, any bounded object is &lt;br/&gt;indistinguishable from a point,
and a line of dots is &lt;br/&gt;indistinguishable from a solid line. This sort
of geometry &lt;br/&gt;has been influencial recently in many areas of
mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;notably group theory, topology, and geometric analysis.
This&lt;br/&gt;research will explore the large scale geometry of several
&lt;br/&gt;classes of mathematical objects, both classical geometric
&lt;br/&gt;spaces and objects only now being viewed in a geometric
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
