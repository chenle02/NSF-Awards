This research aims to bring recent and anticipated advances in supercomputing,
parallel architectures, multivariate graphics, simulation and stochastic
processes to bear on developing new and improved methods for solving large-scale
statistical problems. An example of such is finding efficient solutions to
large-scale least squares problems. This award is to support the collection and
dissemination of scientific findings on the interface between the fields of
statistics and computer science. Activity at the interface between these two
fields is not new. But because of the rapid advances in both fields, the nature
of this activity has evolved rapidly and is constantly changing. Dissemination
of these scientific findings will help stimulate the development of statistical
methods to meet the new requirements of modern modes of scientific
experimentation.
