This project will investigate and develop optoelectronic logic devices that
operate in the visible spectrum. These devices will be fabricated from
combinations of InGaP, InGaAlP and GaAs; materials that have not previously been
used for optoelectronic logic applications. The device structures will be
fabricate from epitaxial layers grown by gas source molecular beam epitaxy. The
primary objective of this project is to determine if the above materials are
suitable for the development of visible spectrum optoelectronic devices since
there are presently no reported optical logic gates that operate in this
wavelength range. The potential impact of the development of visible spectrum
optical logic devices fabricated from the InGaP/InGaAlP/GaAs material system is
great. Not only could it open up new research in the area of visible spectrum
optoelectronic devices, which will provide smaller, more sensitive pixels, but
these materials are also a possible replacement for heterojunction bipolar
transistor and the p channel MODFET which are presently fabricated from
AlGaAs/GaAs.
