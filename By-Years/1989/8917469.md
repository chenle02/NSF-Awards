The proposed research is to isolate sequences from the human genome which are
involved in commitment to fat cell differentiation. The primary structure of
such sequences will be determined and their genetic regulation and molecular
interactions during adipogenesis and cell growth will be explored. To accomplish
this, high molecular weight DNA from human fat tissue biopsies will be used in
transfection assays to transfer the commitment genes to uncommitted mouse
fibroblasts. After an additional round of transfection to reduce human
complexity in the recipient mouse cells, the DNA from the secondary transfectant
clones which fat-convert under appropriate conditions will be used to construct
libraries. Committing sequences will be isolated from such libraries by
hybridization to human specific probes. The isolated genes will be sequenced and
used to define structural DNA changes in uncommitted, committed, and fully
differentiated adipocyte cells. Molecular interactions of the isolated sequences
with upstream regulatory elements of adipocyte specific proteins will be defined
by biochemical means. The gene(s) will be mapped in the human and murine
genomes. %%% The findings from such a study will bring us close to an
understanding of the genetic regulation of fat cell differentiation. A cloned
sequence involved in commitment to fat cell differentiation will help in a broad
range of studies dealing with the molecular basis of human diseases such as
obesity and heart disease, where the normal processes of cellular growth
control, hormonal regulation and differentiation may have been subverted.
