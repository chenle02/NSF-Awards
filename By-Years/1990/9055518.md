This proposal provides a plan for enhancing the scientific skills of middle
school and secondary school teachers by combining field research experiences for
teachers with a collaborative, professionally-guided approach to the
development, evaluation, and assessment of curriculum based on the teachers' own
research experience. Eighty teachers will participate in project activities. The
curriculum will stress scientific process skills, participatory learning,
classroom research activities, and an interdisciplinary approach to scientific
issues. Cost sharing is equivalent to 27% of the NSF award.
