This action funds an NSF - Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Molecular Evolution. The genes coding for proteases and/or beta
galactosidases from Antarctic bacteria which are enzymatically active at
temperatures below 10C will be compared with homologous enzymes from closely
related bacteria (based on 16S-rRNA gene sequences) found at "normal"
temperatures. Changes in the amino acid sequence of the enzymes that confer low
temperature activity can then be inferred, leading to a greater understanding of
the strategies and mechanisms of adaption to cold environments at the molecular
level.
