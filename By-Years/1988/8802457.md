Successful solutions of problems in robotics, computer vision, image
processing, and computer graphics are frequently intertwined with efficient
representations of spatial data. Hierarchical representations of spatial data
focus the work on the area in which the information has the greatest density. It
is proposed to find solutions to spatial problems that make use of hierarchical
data structures; hierarchical solutions to path planning and polygon expansion
will be attempted. The concept of neighbor-finding will be generalized, and the
use of the active- border paradigm in octree construction will be explored. The
surface spatial data type will be investigated. We will examine the question of
whether spatial queries can be processed inteligently by the construction of an
expert system interface that uses the representation of the spatial elements to
which the query refers. Theoretical investigation of Delaunay triangulations
will be continued. We will explore the relationship between hierarchical
solutions to geometric problems, and those used in computational geometry based
on the plane-sweep method. The feasibility of parallel solutions will be
considered when possible.
