Johnson 9724800 Biological nitrogen fixation is a key segment of the nitrogen
cycle. The ability to carry out this reaction is limited to a very small number
of prokaryotes. A sub-set of these have the capacity to form symbiotic
relationships with higher plants to facilitate the process. Bacteria in the
genus Rhizobia, gram-negative rods, are the most prominent member of this group
of organisms. The genetics and biochemistry of nodulation and nitrogen fixation
have been intensively investigated in Rhizobia. This is largely because of the
plethora of genetic tools applicable to this group of organisms as well as their
relationships with many important crop plants. Frankia are the other major
bacterial contributor to symbiotic nitrogen fixation. These organisms are gram
positive, filamentous bacteria that nodulate a wide variety of woody plants and
shrubs. Superficially, the two types of bacteria have similar modes of
operation. However, there are numerous fundamental differences which have been
identified between the two systems. Because the Frankia are very slow growing
and do not form symbioses with commercially important plants, our knowledge of
their genetics and biochemistry is extremely meager. The lack of a vector-
transformation system for these bacteria has seriously hampered attempts to
understand their molecular biology. Now, the availability of Frankia promoters
and the development of electroporation technology as well as highly sensitive,
fluorescent DNA and protein probes makes feasible a systematic analysis of the
many individual steps in both vector development and transformation that need to
be done in order to allow genetic analysis of this important group of ntirogen-
fixing bacteria.
