OCE-0241871&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subsurface Counter
Currents (SSCs) are narrow currents that flow eastward along the poleward edges
of equatorial thermocline waters in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Recent
theoretical studies have suggested several different mechanisms to describe
their dynamics. The project will use numerical investigations to explore these
different hypotheses and to explore how sensitive the currents are to mixing
parameterizations within general circulation models of the ocean. SSCs are major
components of the tropical ocean circulation and may form a branch of the
meridional overturning circulation. Therefore, an understanding of their
dynamics and their variability will aid our understanding of climate
variability. An exploration of how best to simulate them in ocean circulation
models will aid in climate prediction.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
