Very little is known about the evolution of Arctic ringed seals, in particular,
ecological constraints on social organization and foraging strategies. These
most northern ice-adapted seals live and breed in the fast ice, an environment
that usually restricts learning about their ecology and behavior. But, because
of their habitat, ringed seals are also constrained to forage within the range
of their breath-hold from a fixed breathing hold. Dr. Wartzok proposes to
investigate aspects of social organization, diving behavior and foraging
patterns of these seals. Dr. Wartzok who recently developed a electronic
tracking system will follow the movements of ringed seals as they interact and
forage under the ice. Seals, captured at their breathing holes using a triggered
pursing net, will have acoustic pingers and radio frequency transmitters glued
to their fur and then released. Continuous data will be recorded on their under-
ice movements and their use of breathing holes and lairs. The data will be used
to evaluate hypotheses concerning territoriality, territory size, sharing of
breathing holes, role of vocalizations in territory maintenance, diving
patterns, and presumed foraging activities including depths and diurnal
patterns. This study should contribute significantly to our understanding of the
social organization and foraging strategies of ringed seals.
