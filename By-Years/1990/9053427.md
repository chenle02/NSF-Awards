College and pre-college faculty are learning how to use computer algebra systems
in the teaching of calculus. Strong emphasis is placed on using these systems in
such a way that the calculus curriculum is improved by introducing numerical and
graphical experimentation and by focusing on problem solving and understanding
of concepts.
