0334863&lt;br/&gt;Kanade&lt;br/&gt;A workshop, Medical Robotics at the Cutting
Edge, organized and hosted by Carnegie Mellon's Medical Robotics Technology
Center on behalf of the International Advanced Robotics Project (IARP) is to be
held at The Conference Center, Hidden Valley, PA, near Pittsburgh, November 5-8,
2003. The objectives of the workshop are multi-fold: 1) assess and benchmark the
present state-of-art and state-of-practice, 2) forecast the future, 3) identify
technological barriers and gaps between present and future, and 4) capture and
summarize workshop findings for the benefit of IARP member organizations and
other stakeholders. In meeting the objectives of the workshop the technical
program gives special emphasis to the following topics: 1) Surgical Robots
(telesurgery; active surgical robots; semi-active surgical robots), 2) Computer-
Assisted and Image-Guided Surgery (surgical navigation technologies; image
guidance technologies, and 3) Rehabilitation Robotics and Robotic Prosthetics
(robotic exercisers; motion assist devices;
prosthetics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop proceedings includes a final
report, presentation slides and movies, talk abstracts, selected background
materials, and other media suggested by the participants. Dissemination of the
proceedings is to be via the Web (http://www.ri.cmu.edu), hardcopy, CD's, and.
Each attendee will receive both a hard copy of the report and a CD version; each
IARP country representative will receive 50 copies of the CD and a master copy
of the printed report.
