novel Engineering Materials and Applications, Design, Quality Control and
Construction Practice on "Grouting, Soil Improvement and Geosynthetics." The
Symposium will be an extension of the ASCE Specialty Conference on "Gouting and
Soil Improvement, GSI-92" being organized by ASCE in New Orleans, Louisiana,
