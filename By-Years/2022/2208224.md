This travel grant will be used for offsetting the cost of attendees
participating at the 13th Annual Power and Energy Conference at Illinois (PECI).
Beginning in 2010, PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international
conference about power and energy technology. The conference is organized by the
IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign and is advised by faculty in the Power and Energy area of
the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign. The conference will take place on March 10-11th, 2022 at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. PECI has become a perfect place
in the Midwest for industry, academic researchers, and students to discuss
future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, machines for electric
transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber physical systems, and
power electronics for emerging technologies. The travel funding for PECI will
support underrepresented students such as those from primarily undergraduate or
minority institutions, and the expected number of sponsored students is
approximately 20-30. Students who apply for funding will be encouraged to
present either a poster or paper and will compete for Best Paper and Best Poster
Awards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel funding for PECI 2022 will help
introduce students to innovative power-focused technologies in both the academic
and industry sectors, in fields such as machines, power systems, power
electronics and entrepreneurship. This will advance the power engineering
community by fostering discussion between the leaders of tomorrow and current
academic and industry professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
