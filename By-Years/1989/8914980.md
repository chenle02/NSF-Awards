The study will develop a self-adaptive method to control the consumptive use of
irrigation water. The mathematical model will allow an initial stream of
arbitrary size to adjust its magnitude and time distribution depending on real-
time identification of field parameters and the desired distribution of
subsurface moisture. The self-adaptive control will be the result of the
optimization algorithm based on the Zero-inertia model for free-surface flow on
porous bed. The process will be observed and analyzed, the radii of convergence
will be measured, and the controllability of the inflow rate will be verified.
The numerical code will be developed for microcomputer so that integration with
field sensors will be possible for real-time control. The model will permit
optimum application of irrigation water in real time and efficiency will
increase thus, improving the allocation of water resources among competing uses
especially under drought conditions.
