CTS-0114109&lt;br/&gt;Jean Hertzberg, University of
Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, funding is requested to purchase
a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system to enhance the research capabilities
of the PI and four Co-PI's. They are actively engaged in a number of interesting
research problems in fluid mechanics. These include real time simulation and
control of a two-dimensional jet, evaluation of micro-electro-mechanical systems
(MEMS) fluidic devices, cardiovascular fluid dynamics, and infectious aerosol
generation.
