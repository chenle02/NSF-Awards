Student participants in the Marquette University (MU) Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site, "Computation Across the Disciplines," form a research
cohort for a 10-week summer program designed to tackle a variety of
interdisciplinary, open research questions. Each student works closely with a
faculty mentor in MU's Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (MSCS)
department to design research goals and milestones matched to their shared
interests and aspirations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MU's REU site focuses on
recruiting talented undergraduates who are uncertain about future graduate
studies, with little or no research opportunity at their home institution.
Working on different problems with diverse backgrounds, participants
nevertheless can witness firsthand the commonalities of foundational research
techniques across a wide spectrum of computational areas. MSCS REU participants
may develop tools for managing high-performance computing infrastructure, model
oceanographic and volcanic fluid flows, build novel embedded computer systems,
analyze the impact of species loss in a complex ecological food web, discover
biologically important pathways for gene regulation, or help predict natural gas
flow through commercial distribution networks to reduce everyone's utility
bills. Throughout, participants build essential research skills, such as problem
solving, technical reading and writing, tool support, research poster
construction, and oral presentation. MSCS faculty mentor expertise spans high
performance computing, mathematical models and simulations, data assimilation,
and embedded, mobile and ubiquitous systems, as well as math and computer
science education. For more information on this ongoing program, see
