A fundamental goal of much ongoing research in Appalachian tectonics is to
determine the history of terrane accretion in the central and eastern parts of
the orogen. The recent discovery of Acado-Baltic trilobites in the Carolina
slate belt in central South Carolina clearly indicates that this part of the
Piedmont is an exotic terrane that was accreted to North America subsequent to
the Middle Cambrian. Recent studies have indicated major differences in
stratigraphy, paleomagnetism, and tectonothermal history between the Ablemarle
area in south-central North Carolina and the Columbia area in central South
Carolina, suggesting the presence of an important terrane boundary between
Ablemarle and Columbia. The purpose of this project is to accurately locate and
determine the nature of the boundary between the North and South Carolina
sequences. This will be accomplished by a program of geologic mapping, map
compilation, and petrological studies in the area between the two well studied
sequences. This study should substantially improve our knowledge of the history
of terrane accretion in the southern Appalachians as well as facilitate the
correlation of exotic terranes in the circum-Atlantic region. This study will
provide a model for subsequent studies in other older orogenic belts.
