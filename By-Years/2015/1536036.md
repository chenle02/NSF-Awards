This award supports participation of students and early-career scientists at the
Triennial Earth-Sun Summit (TESS), a joint meeting of the Space Physics and
Aeronomy Section of the American Geophysical Union and the Solar Physics
Division of the American Astronomical Society. TESS is intended to be a
gathering of the entire Heliophysics community, including distinct sub-
disciplines devoted to studies of the Sun, the near-Earth space environment, and
their interactions with the Earth's atmosphere. The goal of this conference is
to promote greater interaction and unity within this community. This
increasingly interdisciplinary effort is necessary to understand, predict, and
mitigate the effects of "space weather".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will
be administered by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), the principal
professional organization for US astronomers. They have very successfully and
economically administered similar programs in the past, and the proposed
procedures ensure that these funds will provide the maximum benefit to the
astronomical and geospace communities at minimal administrative cost.
