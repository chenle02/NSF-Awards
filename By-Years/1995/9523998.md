This award will continue the operation of the Alaska-Canada meridian chain of
magnetomers and riometers as a tool for the continued investigation of high
latitude geomagnetic phenomena and as a remote sensing facilty for the space
physics community. The chain has provided a virtually continuous data base for
study since the 1950's. Data from the various sites are returned in near real
time to the NOAA Space Environment Laboratory where it is available for public
use and distribution. The data are used to study magnetospheric processes,
including substorms, convection patterns, ionospheric currents, geomagnetic
pulsations and the polar cusp. The data are also used to support rocket and
satellite experiments that require information about the overall conditions in
the space environment. The investigators will continue to operate the chain,
provide data to the data center, and conduct scientific studies of geomagnetic
processes. Three GOES radio transmitters will be purchased to allow real-time
transmission of data from the remote sites to the Space Environment Center in
Boulder, Colorado.
