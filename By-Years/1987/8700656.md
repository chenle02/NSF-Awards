The goal of this research is to formulate and analyze progressively more
realistic location theory problems in which the behavior of the customers, the
nature of service, per unit price versus supply and per unit cost versus
production level, immunity against the loss of service, and competition among
the providers of service are considered. More specifically, three classes of
location type research problems in which some or all of these issues are
accounted for are to be studied.
