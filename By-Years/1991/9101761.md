This proposal involves collaborative research with Chinese scientists from Jilin
University on the saddle point method and applies the complex coordinate
approach to compute resonance widths in atoms. Of particular interest are
branching ratios between optical and Auger channels, highly excited four and
five electron systems, core excited Auger states spin dependent processes and
the interpretation of experimental data of highly states. This project combines
the expertise of the Chinese scientist in multi-channel quantum defect methods
with the experience of Dr. Chung in addressing this useful niche in atomic
theory.
