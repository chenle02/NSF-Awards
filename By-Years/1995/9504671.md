Dr.Wenbin Lin has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Lin received his doctoral degree from the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Professor Gregory Girolami. Dr. Lin
will continue research at Northwestern Univesity under the sponsorship of
Professor Tobin Marks. His postdoctoral research will target the synthesis and
characterization of novel organic second-order nonlinear optical materials. The
work seeks a fundamental understanding of the microscopic structures of the
acentric chromophoric multilayers which are prepared using siloxane self-
assembly technology, as well as the interrelationships between microscopic
structures, bulk nonlinearities, and thermal and temporal stabilities of these
self-assembled films. Better understanding of these interrelationships is
crucial to the development of novel second-order nonlinear optical materials for
application in practical devices. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
