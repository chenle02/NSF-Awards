The PI will investigate areas of harmonic analysis concerned with multi-
dimensional wavelet and wave packet expansions. In particular, he will study
when collections of dilations, translations and modulations can be used to
decompose square integrable functions into discrete data sets with perfect
reconstruction; both with and without good time-frequency localization. This
proposal relates the existence of functions useful for decomposing functions
into discrete data sets to concrete geometric and algebraic questions that are
of independent interest; in particular, tiling questions and the approximation
of irrational numbers by rationals. Moreover, the proposer wishes to study the
following phenomenon: to date, the most popular systems of the type being
studied are the wavelet system (dilations and translations) and the Gabor system
(dilations and modulations).

Wavelets and wave packet expansions have been useful both in pure mathematics
and in engineering. Wavelets are used, for example, in the FBI fingerprint
compression scheme and in JPEG 2000. Wave packets have been used, for example,
to give elegant proofs of the almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series.
The research in this proposal will provide a better understanding of the theory
behind these applications (both to math and signal processing) of wavelets and
wave packets, and will potentially impact other signal processing applications
and mathematics.
