This award provides partial funding for the support of a research technician
for a period of three year. The technician will be working in the laser Raman
microprobe facility in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at
Washington University in St. Louis. The technician will maintain the optical,
electronic, and computer components of the Raman microprobe, and perform
analyses for research projects that include Raman microspectroscopy of graphite
samples from the Earth's mantle and fluid inclusions trapped in mineral grains
of rocks of deep-seated origin.
