Modelling of the South American upwelling coastal ecosystem must consider the
impact of ancient El Nino events (Middle and Early Holocene, Pleistocene, and
Tertiary). Such events may have varied in average frequency of occurrence and/or
strength, or may have been absent altogether. Documentation of ancient El Ninos
is of paramount significance because of the role such events may have played in
(1) the cultural development of Andean and coastal maritime civilizations, (2)
the biogeographic development of Quaternary littoral faunas, and (3) the
evolution of the pelagic ecosystem. The published geological support for ancient
El Nino events fails to simultaneously satisfy two requisite criteria: (1)
evidence of discrete El Nino-associated events and (2) evidence of oceanic
warming along the west coast of South America. It is proposed to satisfy both
criteria by application of growth increment and geochemical analyses to the
extensive molluscan record of coastal Peru. The 1982-1983 El Nino event was
encoded in morphologic, isotopic, and trace elemental patterns of bivalve shell
growth and we will apply these techniques to the study of ancient mollusks
obtained form the following sources along the coast of Peru: (1) post-Columbian
dump sites, (2) pre-Columbian shell middens, (3) transgressive shelf shell lags,
(4) raised marine terraces, and (5) marine sedimentary rocks. This will provide
a temporal span from historical times back to the Pliocene.
