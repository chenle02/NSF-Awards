9500316 Mohamed This is a fundamental investigation of superplastic flow and
cavitation in fine-grained materials. The main objective is to assess if the
characteristics of superplastic flow at low stresses are a consequence of
impurity atom segregation at boundaries and to address several issues regarding
the substructure details and origin of superplastic deformation and cavitation
at intermediate stresses. The experimental approach involves: (a) an in-depth
study of impurity type and level on the cavitation processes; (b) a
characterization of impurity distribution at boundaries before and after
deformation; (c) an investigation of microstructural details associated with
superplastic deformation (boundary sliding and migration, grain shape, grain
rotation, ligaments, and lattice dislocations) as a function of impurity level
and type, strain, and deformation, mode (tension and double shear); and (d) an
examination of the effects on creep behavior and microstructure of introducing
oxide dispersoids into a superplastic alloy using the new process of Reactive
Atomization and Deposition. Three different model materials, Zn-22%Al, Pb-62%Sn,
and Al-33%Cu, are used with controlled amounts of impurities. %%% This project
will not only enhance the understanding of the role of impurity atoms in the
deformation and fracture of superplastic alloys, but also provide new insights
into the origin of deformation processes controlling superplastic flow. ***
