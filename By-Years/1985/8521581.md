This research is to establish a general validity of in situ calibration
technique and compare the predicted and measured soil response. The research
will be completed in three phases. The first phase evaluates the theoretical
feasibility of the approach for in situ calibration of selected soil
constitutive models, taking into account the variations in soil parameters. The
followup phases will construct a laboratory model of the in situ calibration
device and carry out field verification tests to verify the performance of the
models under in situ conditions.
