This proposal is concerned with the study of a class of nonlinear differential
equations arising in such diverse areas as fluid dynamics, cosmology,
topological quantum field theory as well as theory of automorphic functions.
These equations admit a large family of solutions in terms of modular forms and
exhibit novel singularites in the form of movable natural boundaries in the
complex domain. The main objective of this project is to characterize the
complex dynamics of these nonlinear systems by analyzing their general
solutions, symmetries and singularity structures in the complex plane. Various
algebraic and geometric methods akin to the theory of completely integrable
systems will be employed to carry out the proposed studies.

Nonlinear differential equations are well known to have important applications
in the modeling of complex physical phenomena arising in many areas of science
and technology. This proposal is aimed to investigate the general solutions to a
class of nonlinear differential equations, thereby shedding more light on the
properties of the underlying physical systems described by these equations. The
project will also explore the connection between these nonlinear equations and
the theory of automorphic functions which traditionally arises in areas of pure
mathematics such as number theory. The proposed research activities will be
carried out in a primarily undergraduate institution. It is strongly anticipated
that the proposed research will lead to undergraduate projects in several areas
including nonlinear waves, dynamical systems, special functions and conformal
mapping, all of which have wide ranging physical applications.
