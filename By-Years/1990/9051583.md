When computers are used as a tool in teaching, rather than as the major object
of instruction, their use should be driven by the specific pedagogical aims of
the course, and should require very little instructional overhead. This is not
the case for many of the software systems available for use in introductory
computer science and mathematics courses. "Principles of Computer Science," a
course taught on a limited basis for the first time in the Fall of 1989, is
designed to teach some of the foundational ideas of computer science at an
introductory level. It does not teach computer programming or computer literacy.
An important part of this course is a series of microcomputer experiments that
are designed to illustrate principles being taught in the course while requiring
no class time for instruction on the programs used in the laboratory. Twenty one
IBM microcomputers are necessary for the full implementation of this project.
Future efforts will expand and refine the scope of the material coverage. The
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
