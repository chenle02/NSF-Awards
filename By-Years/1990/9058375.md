With this Presidential Young Investigator Award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
and Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Rinaldo Poli of the University of
Maryland will synthesize and characterize new compounds of transition metals.
The research will emphasize new compounds of molybdenum with odd numbers of
electrons, with the catalytic activity of these being of especial interest. The
class of 17-electron compounds of the formula MoCpX2L2, where X=anionic ligand
and L=neutral ligand such as phosphine, will be investigated. The effects of the
nature of the ligands X and L on the electronic structure, bonding, redox
properties and reactivity toward ligand substitution will be determined, with
emphasis on derivatives where X is H, alkyl or aryl. The activation of small
molecules, including carbon monoxide, dinitrogen, carbon dioxide and ethylene,
by odd-electron systems will be investigated also.
