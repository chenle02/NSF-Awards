Deep learning has recently emerged as a major advance in machine learning and
AI. This technology for learning from data has provided field-changing
performance improvements in image classification and speech recognition, it has
displayed impressive performance across a large variety of areas (including
natural language processing, robotics, audio processing, and computational
chemistry), and it has become a central ingredient in AI systems. But despite
these successes, our understanding of these methods is incomplete. The broad
goal of this research project is to address this grand challenge: to develop
analysis techniques that enable us to understand when and why deep learning
methods will be successful, and to design effective methods with explicit
performance guarantees. Successful research outcomes have a significant
potential for practical impact in the large and growing set of application areas
where these methods are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to
understand the performance of deep learning methods - in particular to elucidate
what aspects are essential for their success - and hence to develop principled
design techniques and performance guarantees. The objectives are: to
characterize the performance impacts of the critical features of current neural
network architectures: scale, depth, nonlinearities, and regularization; to
develop analysis techniques that facilitate our understanding of the
approximation and estimation properties of deep architectures; to identify the
boundary between easy and hard learning problems for deep networks; and to
develop methods with explicit performance guarantees for optimization in deep
neural networks. Successful research outcomes are likely to increase our
understanding of deep learning methods, to provide performance guarantees for
these methods, and to facilitate the principled design of novel deep learning
methods.
