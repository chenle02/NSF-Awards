There are cases in behavior and ecology of animals or plants repelling
predators by chemical defense systems, sometimes by affecting the chemosensory
reception of predators. Not much is known about the neural mechanisms by which
such defenses work, and in particular how a single prey species may defend
itself against more than one predatory species with divergent sensory systems
and behaviors. The sea hare Aplysia is a shell-less marine mollusk related to
snails, and apparently has two chemical defense systems that work against three
kinds of predators, which are lobsters, sea anemones, and teleost fish. This
project uses an innovative combination of biochemical, electrophysiological,
behavioral and ecological approaches, and the animal is well known enough that
molecular approaches are possible in the future. The defensive compounds will be
isolated, and experiments will test among alternative mechanisms how these
defensive compounds exert their effects on the three very different potential
predators. Results will help understand an important mechanism of defensive
behavior in the context of sensory neurobiology.&lt;br/&gt; The impact of this
work extends beyond neuroscience to marine ecology, comparative physiology and
biochemistry. In addition, the broader impacts include substantial undergraduate
training in a lab with an excellent history of integrating education and
training with research, and of including members of under-served
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
