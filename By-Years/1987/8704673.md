Dr. Hess is investigating the way in which the proteins that consititute the
channels in cell membranes function as they recognize a signal in the
environment and open or close to control the passage of ions. The movement of
the ions then produces a signal that leads to a further event (muscle
contraction, nerve conduction, hormone secretion, etc.). The investigator has
developed techniques for the measurement of the very fast reactions that occur
when an outside signal binds the membrane receptor, the channel opens, and ions
flow. The specific system to be investigated with the current grant involves
those that utilize acetyl choline as the external signal and in particular how
phosphorylation of the membrane receptor affects its properties.
