Propagating interfaces and related problems in wave propagation appear in a vast
collection of scientific, engineering, and industrial problems. These include
problems in breaking water waves, seismic wave propagation through the Earth,
semiconductor fabrication, the design of ink jet plotters, and biological
aspects of tumor growth and cell membrane boundaries.

Under previous NSF-funded work, we have built robust algorithms in everyday use
to tackle these problems; two of these include Level Set Methods and Fast
Marching Methods. They are used throughout the semiconductor industry to analyze
how to make chips smaller and more efficient, in the ink jet process to simulate
industrial printing on ever smaller scales, and in the petroleum industry to
help locate oil reserves.

We propose in this work to extend these computational techniques to
significantly more difficult problems, again with a focus on applying them
directly to challenging industrial and scientific problems. Here, our focus will
go beyond ''first arrival'' solutions which characterize the above problems, and
will aim to design interface techniques that will produce the far more complex
multiple arrivals solutions to intricate seismic and wave imaging problems,
derivative-dependent control theory problems that appear in aircraft avoidance
and control problems, and highly refined multiple scale problems in robotics and
etching and deposition in semiconductor devices.
