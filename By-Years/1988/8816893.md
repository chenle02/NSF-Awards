The use of thin films to perform separations is an emerging technology which
can be a key in the economic competitiveness of the chemical process and
biotechnology industries. The separation step is often the major factor in
determining the cost of a product. Industry has indicated an interest in
supporting a cooperative research center in separations using thin films. The
co-principal investigators are highly qualified to direct a study of the
viability and feasibility of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Separations Using Thin Films. The study would determine if the Center has
the potential to become self-sufficient with industrial funding in a five-year
period as NSF funding is phased out. The objective of such a Center would be to
address the generic research needs of industry, especially in polymeric
membranes, thin film processes, fiber coatings, advanced ceramic materials,
biosensors, surface science and catalysis, liquid crystals, and chemical
complexation. An I/UCR Center at the University of Colorado appears to be a
promising approach to satisfy the noted need. Alternative organizations,
operations, and policies would be studied as well as industry's interests and
specific needs in research. The Program Manager recommends that the University
of Colorado be awarded $25,000 for one year to fund such a study. All future
funding will be on the basis of a new proposal. This recommendation has been
coordinated with Dr. Jeffrey H. Harwell, Program Director of the Separation and
Purification Processes Program.
