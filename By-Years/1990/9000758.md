This REU site is focussed on engineering research in the realm of hydroscience.
Research, education, in the gamut of component processed and engineering
activities associated with water movement in the hydrologic cycle and behavior
of water in its three phased is conducted. The REU site will support ten REU
students throughout summer months, with some students continuing their research
experience during the academic year. Working within a frame work for
participation in research, REU students would choose from a range of projects
dealing with fluid mechanics, hydraulics, hydrology/hydrometeorology, and ice
(solid water) engineering. The particular aim, and challenge set for each
student would be for him/her to undertake a self-contained piece of research
within the scope of each project.
