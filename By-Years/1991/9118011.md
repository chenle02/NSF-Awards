Interpretation of the biochemistry of fossil systems based on the stable
isotope composition of bulk organic matter assumes that intramolecular
diagenetic reactions and interactions with the preserving environment have a
minimal effect on the isotopic integrity of these systems. A realistic
assessment of biogenic signals from fossils requires an appraisal of the limits
of isotopic fractionation that can occur during diagenesis and the development
of independent criteria for evaluating the possible exchange of components with
the surrounding environment. This project will begin to quantify the effects of
hydrolysis and secondary diagenetic reactions (e.g. humification) on the stable
carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of amino acid constituents of peptides
and proteins in fossils. Our recent development of a combined gas
chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) methods for the direct
stable carbon isotope analysis of nanomole concentrations of amino acid
enantiomers permits, for the first time, an opportunity to monitor the effects
of diagenetic reactions on most of the protein amino acids. We will continue to
test the possibility of using the stable isotope compositions of the D- and
L-enantiomers of individual amino acid constituents of fossils as an independent
check on the indigeneity of these components. At present, the GC/IRMS method is
limited to the analysis of stable carbon isotopes; however we propose to modify
the system for the analysis of stable nitrogen isotopes. The ability to monitor
both 13C and 15N compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers affords a
powerful, independent check on the indigeneity of these components. Finally,
experiments are also planned to develop GC/IRMS methods for the 13C analysis of
carbohydrate constituents of fossil shells.
