The many uses of electromagnetic (EM) energy have produced an environment in
which humans are subjected to exposure to a wide band of frequencies. The
interaction of environmental EM energy with the human body is the rationale
behind this program. The purpose is to be able, with theoretical predictions and
experimental measurements, to express the EM field induced on the body surface
and fields within the tissue.
