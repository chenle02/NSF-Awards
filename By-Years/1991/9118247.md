This project focuses on the transport pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to
the lysosomal membrane. A family of recently characterized lysosomal membrane
glycoproteins ("lgp's") and their cDNAs will be used to study the molecular
requirements for transport to, and maintenance in, the limiting membranes of
these terminal degradative compartments. Site-directed mutagenesis and
expression of the cDNAs in cultured cells will be used to define targeting
features of lgp's, while antisense RNA expression will be used to explore
functions. The apparent mistargeting of overexpressed lgp's will be studied to
further elucidate the regulation of this pathway. Additional components of the
lysosomal membrane will be characterized to search for common targeting
features, as well as to further define and understand this dynamic organelle.
Membranes of eukaryotic cells define a diverse set of intracellular compartments
that are functionally and biochemically distinct. Proteins that span or cross
membranes are transported from their points of synthesis to their appropriate
sites of action, often traversing multiple organellar compartments along the
way. Proteins must therefore possess features that are not only essential for
their functions, but also essential for transport and targeting to their final
destinations. To date, few of the latter features have been defined. The results
of this project will increase our understanding in this fundamental area of cell
biology.
