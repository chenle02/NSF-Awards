The goal of this proposed infrastructure is to enable research towards the
creation of the first buildingwide, pervasive, life-long learning, multi-robot
intelligence that is situated within an existing building. This buildingwide
intelligence (BWI) infrastructure will be comprised of multiple robot
appendages, as well as a suite of static sensors and interactive displays. The
ultimate goal of the facilitated research is to enable BWI to interact naturally
with all of the buildings users, both learning about the patterns and
preferences of its long-term inhabitants, and aiding first-time visitors. In
addition, it will be robust to continual changes to the capabilities and
availability of its component robots and other sensing and actuation resources;
and it will consist of readily available components and open source software for
ease of replication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important broader impact of
this proposal will be the development and dissemination of a new, open
infrastructure suitable for cutting-edge research across the department and
university, including reusable components suitable for installation in buildings
everywhere. The concept of BWI will also provide impacts on education, including
a new curriculum for a project-based course, serving as a platform for graduate
and undergraduate research (including as a part of UTs novel Freshman Research
Initiative), as well as a very public facade, which will enable public
demonstrations at outreach events targeting underrepresented groups such as
women in CS and Hispanics.
