Drs. Beck and Jones will conduct systematic research to evaluate the potential
of the obsidian hydration technique to determine the ages of archaeological
artifacts from the Butte Valley, Nevada. Obsidian hydration dating rests on the
premise that the hydration rind which forms on this volcanic glass is time
dependent and that by measuring the depth of this rim, chronological information
can be obtained. While this relationship is known to hold true for buried
artifacts which undergo only moderate temperature change throughout the course
of the year, it is unclear how well hydration works for surface materials which
undergo large annual fluctuations. Drs. Beck and Jones will collect obsidian
artifacts associated with known cultures in the Butte Valley. They will then
determine chemical composition by using x-ray florescence and, by this means,
divide them by source of origin. Hydration analysis will be conducted on a large
sample and the results analyzed to determine the correlation with age as
determined by cultural affiliation. Temperature sensors planted at sites, both
above and below ground, will provide information on annual temperature
fluctuation. Across much of the U.S. Great Basin, archaeological materials which
document the early stages of human prehistory are found primarily on the desert
surface. These assemblages, while they have the potential to yield valuable
archaeological information, must often be ignored because they are so difficult
to date. If their research is successful, Drs. Beck and Jones will provide
archaeologists with a technique which may be used in a wide range of sites in
many parts of the world. It will also allow these two archaeologists to proceed
with their cultural reconstruction of the prehistory of the Western United
States and, thus, increase our understanding of native American cultural
development.
