Theoretical understanding of photon and electron collision processes with atoms
and ions is important to a broad range of scientific activities. The Multi-
Configuration Hartree-Fock technique has been developed to provide an economical
treatment of polarization and electron correlation for such processes. It will
be extended to more than one open channel and applied to the calculation of
valence and K shell photoionization, low energy electron scattering,
photodetachment of negative ions and photoionization of excited states.
Relativistic effects will be included using a Breit-Pauli treatment and some
attempt will be made to look at collisions in a laser field.
