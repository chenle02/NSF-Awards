In this project, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, the PI will pursue a broad program of research in State-to-
State Reaction Dynamics. The program consists of three main areas with several
subtopics. These are 1) Photofragmentation, including photodissociation and
photoionization dynamics; 2) Hydrogen atom + Hydrogen molecule reaction
dynamics. This includes the investigation of scattering resonances, the
development of improved apparatus, the investigation of the geometric phase in
chemical reactions, and the study of the effects of vibrational excitation and
angular momentum polarization; and 3) Using improved apparatus the impact of
vibrational excitation on chemical reactivity will be investigated on small
molecules, such as the reaction of chlorine atoms with methane and deuterated
methane molecules in mode selected excited states, and studies of the
vibrational control of larger molecules such as methyl alcohol and methyl amine
and their deuterated variants through their reactions with chlorine atoms. These
projects will be done with the participation of students and postdoctoral
research associates. They will thereby acquire skills and knowledge in a
forefront area of physical chemistry in preparation for advanced study or
employment in industry, government laboratories or academia.
