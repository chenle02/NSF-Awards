This project focuses on the broad question of why democracies rarely fight one
another or even escalate hostilities to the point of military confrontation. The
project adds three facets to an ongoing research program. First it extends the
time period for data collection from 1885 to 1992 rather than 1945 to 1992. This
allows the PIs to replicate their earlier work in different historical periods.
Second the project further develops an expected utility framework for modeling
when nations might go to war. Finally the PIs provide new analysis modeled with
simultaneous equations in order to tease out the impact of belonging to
international organizations.
