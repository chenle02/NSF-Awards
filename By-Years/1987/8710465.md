Understanding the variation in the chemical composition of sea-floor volcanic
rocks is important to understanding both the processes that produce the oceanic
crust and origin of sea-floor magmas in the mantle. Recent research has shown
that the major and trace element chemistry can be controlled by both source
differences as well as the extent of source melting and subsequent
crystallization of the magma during its ascent to the sea-floor. The isotopic
composition of lead, neodymium and strontium, however, apparently reflects the
original mantle source. By examining the complete chemistry of crustal rocks it
should be possible to determine the importance of various mantle sources in the
crustal genesis. The objective of the present project is to complete lead,
neodynium and strontium isotope measurements on spreading center basalts from
the boundaries of the Nazca Plate in the eastern Pacific. Major and trace
element analyses have already been completed on these samples. The major goal of
the study is to determine the role that mantle hotspots have played in the
break- up of major crustal plates in the region. This complex history of plate
fragmentation has led to a number of transient microplates during the last 30
million years. Samples to be studied are from the Easter and Juan Fernandez
Microplates and the Galapagos Spreading Center. The principal investigator on
this project is highly qualified to perform the research and is an authority on
the isotope composition of crustal rocks.
