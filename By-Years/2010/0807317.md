Olver&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807317&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The aim of this project is to
further develop and extend the&lt;br/&gt;range of applications of the
investigator's equivariant method of&lt;br/&gt;moving frames, for both finite-
dimensional and&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional group actions. The specific areas
of&lt;br/&gt;research in the proposal are as follows: Development
of&lt;br/&gt;computational algorithms for differential invariant
algebras,&lt;br/&gt;with particular emphasis on methods for determining
minimal&lt;br/&gt;generating sets; exploitation of the invariant
variational&lt;br/&gt;calculus based on moving frames to analyze minimizers
of&lt;br/&gt;invariant variational problems and the behavior of
invariant&lt;br/&gt;submanifold flows, focusing on the evolution of
differential&lt;br/&gt;invariants and their signatures; algorithms for analyzing
the&lt;br/&gt;structure of symmetry pseudo-groups, their use in classifying
and&lt;br/&gt;finding explicit solutions to nonlinear partial
differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, with applications in fluid mechanics, gauge
theories,&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems, and meteorological models;
further&lt;br/&gt;development of practical tools for object recognition
and&lt;br/&gt;symmetry detection in digital images based on
differential&lt;br/&gt;invariant and joint invariant signature methods; and
exploration&lt;br/&gt;and application of new invariant numerical algorithms
for&lt;br/&gt;integrating nonlinear differential equations and
approximating&lt;br/&gt;differential invariants such as curvatures, torsion,
etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Exploitation of symmetry, equivalence and
invariance&lt;br/&gt;properties remains one of the most important mathematical
methods&lt;br/&gt;for tackling the complex nonlinear systems that arise in a
wide&lt;br/&gt;variety of applications. The investigator's reformulation of
the&lt;br/&gt;geometrically-based method of moving frames has led to a
wide&lt;br/&gt;range of new and, as yet, underexploited computational tools,
as&lt;br/&gt;well as new and unexpected areas of application,
including&lt;br/&gt;computer vision, recognition and surveillance, materials
science&lt;br/&gt;and physical gauge theories, fluid mechanics, interface
flows,&lt;br/&gt;DNA mechanics, relativity, and elsewhere. The project
continues&lt;br/&gt;to develop this powerful new approach to analyzing very
general&lt;br/&gt;group actions and their invariants, directly driven by
current&lt;br/&gt;needs in these areas of application. &lt;br/&gt;
