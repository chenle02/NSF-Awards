Six higher education institutions in Missouri will cooperate, with the
assistance of Missouri's Department of Education and Coordinating Board for
Higher Education, in establishing statewide the successful and proven elementary
teacher inservice services in science and mathematics developed in southeast
Missouri by the National Science Foundation- supported KSAM Project (K-6 Science
and Mathematics Improvement, Southeast Missouri). Concurrently, a model
statewide network representing schools, colleges, educational agencies and
professional organizations will be established which will (1) contribute to the
success of the KSAM dissemination project, and (2) develop and implement
statewide consensus on educational needs and programs relating to K-12 science
and mathematics educational achievement in Missouri. Outcomes will be: (1)
establishment of five ongoing, self-supporting centers for providing KSAM-type
inservice in science and mathematics to local schools (Southeast Missouri State
University is the sixth); (2) training of a statewide cadre of 320 largely
school-based elementary science and mathematics inservice specialists; (3)
participation of 4500 K-6 elementary teachers in KSAM-type inservice offerings;
(4) establishing an ongoing model network of state educators and officials
working cooperatively in improving science and mathematics education; and (5)
development of specific recommendations for continuing improvement of science
and mathematics education in Missouri. Southeast Missouri, State University will
contribute in cost- sharing an amount equal to 18.9% of the NSF award.
