This research develops the theory underlying the aggregate production function
to show how labor market policies affect output and total factor productivity in
particular. Labor market policies affect output as a result of distorting how
individual production units react to the economic environment. In this context
two economies with access to the same level of technology can have two different
levels of total factor productivity. This research develops a formal explicit
theory of the nexus between labor market policies and macroeconomic performance,
and attempts to empirically verify the effects of such policies on measured
cross-country productivity differences.
