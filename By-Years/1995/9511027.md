Shors 9511027 The learning process can be influenced profoundly by other events
in an organism's life. For example, stress can either facilitate or impair the
learning process, depending upon the properties of the stressor and the type of
learning being considered. With this award, Dr. Tracey Shors will examine a
model-system in which mild stress facilitates acquisition of a learned response.
In particular, she will determine if this facilitation is dependent upon a
region of the brain, the hippocampus, where the neurotransmitter glutamate seems
to play a role in learning related processes. This work will provide insights
into some of the neurochemical and synaptic mechanisms of learning facilitation.
It will have impact on theories in biology and education about how "non-
learners" can be encouraged to become "learners". ***
