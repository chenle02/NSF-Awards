The Center for Telecommunications Research, an Engineering Research Center at
Columbia University conducts research and education programs in the domain of
advanced telecommunications networks. Major efforts are concentrated on two
systems projects, the MAGNET network testbed, and a Lightwave Network project,
which serve as focal points for a broad range of investigations and as testbeds
for new ideas. A prototype fiber-optic network has been developed and its
operation has been demonstrated at the unprecedented speed of 12.5 GHz. A
concept for a metropolitan area network is being explored with several industry
partners. Innovations are being pursued in semiconductor materials processing,
including advances in laser-assisted chemical etching. Exciting progress has
been made in implementing "micro-area networks" involving optical
interconnections among integrated circuit chips. These activities will continue
and will converge on the concept of intelligent distributed optical networks.
This action is a five-year renewal.
