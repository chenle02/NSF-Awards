Objects are programming abstractions that encapsulate mutable internal state and
provide operations to manipulate the state. Object-based computing is the
programming paradigm that uses objects to structure the state-manipulation
carried out in programs. The goal of this project is to develop formal methods
for specifying, conceptualizing, and reasoning about object- based programs.
These formal methods include: (1) Type systems: what kinds of semantic entities
are involved in object-based programs, and how does one capture them in type
systems for programming languages? (2) Denotational semantics: what mathematical
abstractions are involved in capturing the bahaviors of object-based programs?
(3) Specifications: How does one specify the behaviors of individual objects?
(4) Reasoning methods: what methods are appropriate and useful for proving
properties of object-based programs? The Direction being pursued is to build on
the several decades of research in functional programming so as ato achieve a
"tight integration" of programming concepts and mathmatical tools in working
with object-based programs. Of primary focus are algebraic specification and
equational reasoning techniques using lambda-calculus-based higher-order
language frameworks. ***
