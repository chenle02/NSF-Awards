Lay Abstract PI: Siwicki, Kathleen K. Proposal Number: IBN-9723920 From our own
sleep-wake cycle to the chirping of crickets on summer evenings, examples of
circadian (daily) rhythms in behavior are abundant in nature. These rhythms are
driven by internal biological clocks in the nervous system that are synchronized
with the daily cycles of light and temperature in the environment. In the past
decade, researchers have deciphered the basic mechanism by which biological
clocks keep time: the clock's central gears are genes that turn on and off every
day. While rhythmic behaviors and clock genes have been identified in a variety
of organisms, the cellular mechanisms by which clock genes produce their
behavioral effects are relatively obscure. This project examines the mechanisms
by which clock genes act within cells and tissues to produce circadian rhythms
of behavior. Experiments allow for direct studies of cells regulating rhythmic
behavior and how the properties of those cells are regulated by the clock genes
within them. These studies represent a significant step towards understanding
the physiological mechanisms by which clock genes and the cells that express
them can interact to generate circadian rhythms in behavior.
