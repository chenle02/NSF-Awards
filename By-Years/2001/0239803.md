Professor Lloyd Bumm of U. of Oklahoma is supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry program to study the electroluminescence of single molecules.
The approach is to integrate optical spectroscopy and scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) in a new way. STM will be used to image electrolumophores while
a photon counting scheme will be employed to correlate the effect of applied
voltage and tunneling current with the photon yield and associated spectrum.
Molecular dynamics will be studied, as well as electrooptic features of noble
metal nanoparticles. This CAREER plan is developed in collaboration with
Nomadics, an Oklahoma company that brings emerging technology into the
marketplace. The PI's education plan includes research experience for teachers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology has allowed us to think about molecules in
a fundamentally new way. The long-term benefit of molecular electronics will be
realized in the form of smaller, higher-speed electronics. Students trained in
these interdisciplinary technologies will be able to contribute to efforts in
improved communications and other photonic applications.
