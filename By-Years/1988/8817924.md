This research is based on mathematical analogy between vortex stretching and the
geometric properties of distorted volume elements in phase space. The latter can
be described by strange attractors and their exponential growth rates. These are
known to involve fractals. The research is to establish whether this analogy can
be used to show fractal descriptions of turbulent vorticity dynamics. The
investigator was able previously to establish a connection between fractals and
turbulent energy. The vorticity case is much more relevant to the physical
mechanisms of turbulence, thus a much more concise and compact description for
turbulence dynamics than presently available may result.
