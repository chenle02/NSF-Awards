This grant is being awarded under the Materials Chemistry Initiative. Work is
proposed in which organic materials classes known to have a large non-linear
optical response are incorporated into multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films.
For second harmonic generation, which requires a non-centrosymmetric structure,
LB superlattices are proposed as a scheme to break the inversion symmetry
usually found in LB films. The work is inherently interdisciplinary and combines
a chemist and three physicist. It incorporates unique LB growth instrumentation
(developed at Northwestern), strength in non-linear optical measurements, and
the chemical and materials expertise of a major midwest industrials research
laboratory (Amoco).
