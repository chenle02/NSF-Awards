The Unalakleet River corridor in Western Alaska presents unusual opportunities
for analyzing cultural adaptation and change. In spite of the influences of
Western culture, and the adoption of new technologies, cultural conservatism
among Native groups persisted, and could be a source of social conflict. This
dissertation examines how change is manifested in small groups (households) at
the time of Euro/American contact. A 19th century village is examined in detail
through excavation, artifact and architectural analysis. The data will
contribute to a clearer understanding of stability and change among Native
Americans in general and Native Alaskans in particular.
