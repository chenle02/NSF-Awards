With the goal of elucidating molecular mechanisms by which calmodulin-activated
enzymes aid transformation of CA2+-signals into biochemical responses, this
project addresses relationships between structure, function, and regulation of
the type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The major target is a
recombinant, monomeric form of the kinase which contains catalytic and
regulatory domains but lacks the association domain. Site-specific mutagenesis
will be used to produce additional forms of the kinase and calmodulin. How Mg2+,
calmodulin, substrates, and autophosphorylation regulate domain folding,
interactions, and topographical arrangements will be a major focus. Chemical
crosslinking and active site-directed reagents will be used to probe sequences
of events in kinase activation. Fluorescent probes will be attached to specific
sites of calmodulin and the kinase for fluorescence and energy transfer studies;
suitable metal ions and nucleotide analogs provide additional fluoroprobes.
Changes in circular dichroism and in the susceptibility of the protein to
proteolytic cleavage will be correlated with corresponding changes in kinase
activity and calmodulin- dependence. The X-ray structure of the truncated kinase
will be determined in a collaborative project. Current working models of the
structure and regulation of this prominent calmodulin-dependent enzyme will be
refined by computer modeling.
