The most commonly used methodology for validating the quality of software is
testing. Conceptually, testing is simple. In practice, however, testing has two
key limitations: it is expensive, often amounting to over a half of the
development cost, and ineffective, often failing to find crucial bugs that can
cause significant damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these
limitations by developing a novel test automation framework based on test
summaries -- abstract properties of desired tests. Developers write summaries as
logical constraints that define desired inputs and properties to check, and the
tools perform testing against dense suites that are likely to find many bugs.
The project develops: (1) core algorithms for effective systematic testing,
which generate high quality inputs, perform deep white-box checking, and
synthesize executable test oracles; (2) optimization strategies for efficient
systematic testing, which scale it to large applications; (3) incremental
techniques for supporting evolution, which provide efficient test updates with
respect to code changes; and (4) infrastructure support for enhancing usability,
which assists developers with writing test summaries. Case studies using a
variety of applications are used for evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systematic
testing using test summaries will substantially increase test coverage and
accuracy, which will significantly improve software quality. The PI's industrial
collaborations and participation in UT's Executive Masters program enable a
swift technology transfer to industry.&lt;br/&gt;
