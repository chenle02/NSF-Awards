The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) will conduct a series of three
annual Research Experiences for Undergraduate Faculty (REUF) workshops during
the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015, and additional activities for participants
afterwards to support continuation of research engagement sparked by the
workshop. At each REUF workshop four senior mathematicians (leaders) who have
experience doing research with undergraduate students will present problems in a
variety of areas, after which the participants and leaders will divide into
groups and work on the problems; the workshop will conclude with group
presentations of each project. Most of the time will be spent doing mathematics,
but there will also be whole group discussions about topics such as best
practices in undergraduate research led by the organizers. Since numerical
experiments and computational investigations are crucial to much of the research
done with undergraduates, the workshop will also include instruction in using
the free open-source mathematics software Sage. AIM directors will facilitate
the management of the workshop, and participants will receive full funding.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REUF workshop and ongoing activities will provide
faculty participants whose undergraduate institutions have limited research
activity with a research experience investigating open questions in the
mathematical sciences and equip them to engage in research with undergraduate
students at their home institutions. In addition, some participants will become
involved in long-term research collaborations with other faculty at the
workshop. The recruitment efforts for REUF will particularly focus on faculty at
minority-serving institutions as well as underrepresented minority faculty at
undergraduate colleges. The REUF project will lead to more and better
undergraduate research experiences for students of the faculty participants, and
greater engagement in mathematical research by the faculty participants, thus
expanding and diversifying the mathematical workforce.
