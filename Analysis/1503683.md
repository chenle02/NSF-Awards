SubRiemannian geometry and subelliptic Partial Differential Equations are used
to model real life systems where there is a constrained dynamics. Examples of
such systems include the motion of robot arms, structural functions of the first
layer of the mammalian visual cortex, the Black-Scholes model for financial
markets and quantum computing. Geometric and analytic properties of such spaces
are captured in a quantitative fashion by studying the behavior of certain
families of transformations of the space into itself. This project aims at
studying fine properties of such transformations. In particular, the proposed
research will provide a theoretical basis for implementing numerical simulations
of real-life systems. In terms of broader impacts, the PI will involve graduate
and undergraduate students in several aspects of the research and design
outreach activities to attract K12 students to mathematics.

The technical focus of the proposed research addresses the Liouville Theorem for
quasiconformal mappings with minimal distortion. The main goal is to prove
smoothness and rigidity of such mappings. The proposed approach is based on the
solution of longstanding open problems of regularity for a class of subelliptic
quasilinear PDE. The study of such PDE is important on its own and has broader
applications. This project encompasses regularity for subelliptic p-laplacian
beyond the Heisenberg group and construction of p-harmonic coordinates for
subRiemannian manifolds.
