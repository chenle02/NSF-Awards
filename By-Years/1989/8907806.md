Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the matrices
which determine the masses and mixings of the quarks and leptons. Various
possible mechanisms for generating quark and lepton masses will be explored. An
attempt will be made to understand these mechanisms better, and to find out
which of them are excluded by experimental data. The masses of the quarks and
leptons--the constituents of matter--are a very basic property of these objects,
and the research which will be carried out is aimed at shedding further light on
this property.
