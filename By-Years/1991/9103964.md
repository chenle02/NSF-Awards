Many structural geometries used to determine the sense of shear in deformation
zones are not well understood and cannot be used to obtain shear strain
magnitudes. A computer code will be developed to quantify the relative
importance of rigid objects and foliations to the development of shear zone
fabrics. The code will simulate shearing deformation using a range of kinematic
variables. At each stage of the project the model predictions will be compared
with naturally deformed sheared rocks from well-constrained sites. The results
will help clarify the relationships among many structures developed in shear
zones and identify practical criteria for estimating shear-strain magnitude in
rocks. These findings will be of practical value to structural geologists
working in a great numbers of different tectonic environments.
