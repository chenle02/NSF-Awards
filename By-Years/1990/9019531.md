There exists an urgent need to develop new and critical control methodologies
that will explicitly address the multiple performance requirements of controlled
mechanical systems, while deemphasizing absolute reliance on very accurate
process models. The problem can be stated as follows; given a process model with
mixed uncertainty, a set of performance specifications, and a high frequency
stability margin, develop a controller which will provide output performance
within the given tolerances and simultaneously maintain closed loop stability in
the presence of the uncertainties.This research uses the frequency response
method of quantitative feedback theory to investigate (1) the design of control
systems for complex mechanical systems whose models display low frequency
parametric uncertainty as well as high frequency flexibility effects, (2) the
development of control algorithms for high performance trackiing accuracy of
such systems, and (3) the experimental validation of the algorithms on an
electrohydraulic rig.
