The proposed study will provide the first comprehensive analysis of
evolutionary relationships in the genus Ambystoma, the mole salamanders.
Relationships will be determined by measuring genetic differences in
mitochondrial DNA. With a well supported phylogenetic tree, one can study the
biogeographical factors involved in the adaptive radiation of the group. This
part of the study will also provide information on the mechanisms of evolution
of mitochondrial DNA in amphibians, a group for which to be used in this study
may prove useful for determining genetic relationships in many other biological
systems. A good phylogeny will provide the context for the second part of this
study. The mole salamander genus includes several distinctive clonally
reproducing (unisexual) forms; these originated by hybridization between
different species of Ambystoma. In the second part of the proposed study,
mitochondrial DNA will be used to analyze genetic variation in the clonal
populations. This will provide information on the maternal ancestors of clonal
forms. It will also show whether there were many or few such origins, recent or
ancient. One will therefore be able to reconstruct a history of these lineages--
where did they come from, how, when, and to what extent did they spread. Such an
evolutionary history will provide the necessary background for more detailed
studies of the genetic mechanisms involved in producing clonal organisms.
