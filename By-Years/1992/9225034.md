This award provides funds to the Natural Science Division at Pepperdine to
continue a successful REU Site. The funds will enhance an already active program
of undergraduate research in biology. Students will be taught the common
elements of the research process and increase their appreciation for the
diversity of biological subdisciplines. In addition, the program provides
mechanisms for recruiting students from traditionally underrepresented groups in
science and from schools where students may not have opportunities to experience
biological research. Each summer the program will begin with a six-day research
orientation workshop at the Murchison Science Center during which students will
be introduced to the uses and limitations of specific research tools and
techniques and immersed in the research process (literature review, hypothesis
formulation, and hypothesis testing). After the orientation workshop, students
will pursue individual research projects under the direction of faculty in
either cellular biochemistry, behavioral ecology, plant physiological ecology or
ecophysiology of marine intertidal animals. All research projects will be
designed to provide students with insight into how scientists formulate research
questions, design experiments, collect and analyze data, and communicate their
results to the scientific community. Over the course of the summer, visiting
scientists will hold special research seminars in each research area, giving
students an opportunity to discuss their own data with other scientists. Each
research group will hold weekly literature seminars to discuss current journal
articles pertaining to their research interests. The program will conclude each
summer with a student research symposium in early August. Follow-through will
include student participation at local and regional undergraduate research
conferences. In cases of special merit, students will be encouraged to present
their results at national meetings and to prepare their results for publication
in a scientific journal.
