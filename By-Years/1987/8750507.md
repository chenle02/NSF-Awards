The use of nuclear magnetic resonance to study molecular structure and dynamics
is common in academic and industrial research programs and FT-NMR is the state-
of-the-art choice for such studies. A recently acquired 200 MHz FT-NMR
spectrometer is being used in a variety of upper level courses for chemistry and
biochemistry majors at Trinity College, allowing an existing Varian T-60 to be
used in the introductory organic chemistry laboratory.
