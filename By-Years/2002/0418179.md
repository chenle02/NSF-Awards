We spend nearly every waking moment searching with our eyes. Even a bored casual
glance around a room is, at heart, an attempt to look for something. In modern
life, visual search includes such important tasks as a doctor's inspection of
medical X-ray images, a homeland security check of luggage for anomalies, or a
pilot's quick glance across vital gauges on aircraft instrument panels. All
living things capable of movement search incessantly, whether simple one-celled
organisms or brainy hominids. In the laboratory, visual search has become a way
to study the mind, whether as part of an intelligence test, a neurological exam,
or in esoteric studies of attention, language, and social
perception.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Robert Rauschenberger and Dr. Mary A. Peterson will
use support from the National Science Foundation to study a hitherto
unrecognized fact about visual search: that the targets of search (the
proverbial "needle in the haystack") can become more similar to their
distractors (the "hay") as time goes on. That is, if you present the "needle and
haystack" for a 'long' time (1/4 of a second), search is paradoxically more
difficult than if you present the very same display for only a brief time (1/10
of a second). Common sense suggests the opposite outcome. The insights to be
gained from this research have the potential to alter our understanding of a
fundamental component of human behavior significantly. The broader impact of the
project may include innovations in the design of modern instruments, increases
in airport security, and better tests for medical problems. The funded project
also includes an educational component to fund training for Dr. Rauschenberger
in theory and methods of complex nonlinear systems. &lt;br/&gt;
