In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Timothy Deming of the University of
California at Los Angeles will study how to utilize different types of
initiation chemistries and polymerization catalysts in one reaction to generate
branched polypeptide architectures ranging from cylindrical brush to
hyperbranched. The approach is to employ different initiation chemistry,
different monomers (N-carboxyanhydrides and their sulfur derivatives), and
different nickel and cobalt polymerization catalysts to control the relative
initiation rates of the added free initiator versus ones that are tethered to
the side chain of the monomer. In this manner, a range of polymer architectures
can be prepared by controlling the amount of propagation that occurs from each
type of initiating site. The broader impacts involve advancing teaching,
training and learning in interdisciplinary bioengineering at UCLA as well as
participating in recruiting underrepresented minorities to pursue advanced STEM
degrees.

This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about how to easily prepare
polypeptides, the basic component of proteins, which have different types of
branched structures. The results of these studies could have many important long
term impacts on applications in which protein-based materials are important,
including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and other areas of biotechnology.
