This proposal will continue several lines of research in which the laboratory is
currently active, as follows: (1) Oxygen and silicon isotopes in primitive and
differentiated meteorites to study nebular and planetary processes. (2)
Experimental determination of oxygen isotope equilibrium constants using novel
silicate-carbonate exchange techniques. (3) Systematic re-evaluation of oxygen
isotope thermometry of igneous and metamorphic rocks, using new fractionation
factors. (4) Laboratory studies of anomalous isotope exchange in the reaction of
O3, using a wide range of isotopic compositions of oxygen. (5) Theoretical and
experimental study of oxygen in the Earth's upper atmosphere. (6) Oxygen isotope
studies of granulites and eclogites. Results over the past three years have been
gratifying. It is planned to continue work on some of the most rewarding of
these, as well as open some new lines of research, such as (4) above.
