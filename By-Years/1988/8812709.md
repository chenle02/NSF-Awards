This project in materials chemistry is sponsored jointly by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Polymers Program. The
research will apply reagents, reactions and components drawn from organometallic
chemistry to problems in surface and interfacial chemistry and materials
science. The research is expected to lead to new methods for making several
kinds of important materials, such as highly ordered thin films and polymers
which are stable at high temperatures. The research falls in four broad areas:
1) Catalytic C-H bond activation using homogeneous reactions; 2) Surface
organometallic chemistry, especially the chemistry of metal surface alkyls and
of coordination complexes on metal and metal oxide surfaces. Self-assembled,
oriented organic monolayer films prepared by coordination of appropriate organic
bases to metal and metal oxide surfaces are of particular interest. 3) New
functional and temperature-stable polymers, including all-carbon-backbone
condensation polymers and highly branched polymers, made using organometallic
processes; 4) The organic solid state, particularly hyper-crosslinked organic
solids and organometallic thin films prepared by sol-gel methods.
