9351969 Filer This project supports an economics undergraduate instructional
laboratory containing workstations linked to a file-server by a local area
network. In particular, the lab is being used to implement a revised curriculum
designed so that students are graduates comfortable with modern computing tools,
have adequate hands-on experience in empirical data analysis, can use
econometric tools to write at least one original research paper, and are
familiar with the use of computers in model building and simulation analysis. It
is expected that the project both provide our students with a better
understanding of modern economics and encourage significantly more of them to
continue on to graduate education. ***
