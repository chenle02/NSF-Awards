The inaugural Northeast Workshop in Geometric Analysis (NEWGA) will be hosted at
the University of Connecticut, November 5-6, 2022. The workshop will bring
together experts who work in various areas of geometric analysis and will
encourage the participation of graduate students and recent PhDs in the
Northeastern US to foster new developments in geometric analysis. The workshop
also aims to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in science. Ensuring that
members of underrepresented groups are well-represented among plenary speakers
is a priority. Special efforts will be made to recruit participants from women
and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Geometric analysis is a
rapidly developing area that has many interconnections to different branches of
mathematics. The workshop will connect experts in the topics of Complex Analysis
and Geometry, Fully Nonlinear PDEs, General Relativity, and Geometric Flows, and
it will enhance collaborations across these areas in the Northeastern US.
Besides plenary talks, an Emerging Leader Session is specifically designed to
increase the involvement of students and early-career researchers by presenting
their research. The workshop webpage is
