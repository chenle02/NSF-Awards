AST 9618704 Analysis of Near-Infrared ILS Spectroscopy for Planetological
Application. Drs. George Atkinson and Jonathan Lunine will use intracavity laser
spectroscopy (ILS) in the laboratory to detect and characterize weak absorption
features in the 1-3 micron wavelength range from molecules associated with
planetary atmospheres, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and methane. The ILS
technique presents a great advantage over other methods of characterizing
molecular line parameters: 1) it achieves very large effective pathlengths
without large physical pathlengths and/or volumes of gases; and 2) weak features
that are inaccessible to other techniques can now be studied. The experimental
conditions to be examined reproduce those under which astronomical observational
data were recorded. The opportunity to quantitatively mimic astronomical
observational data is derived from the extremely high detection sensitivity and
versatility with which ILS techniques can be used. =========================
