Using Chesapeake Bay as a study site, the proposed research will evaluate how
spatial/temporal heterogeneity in physical and biological habitats interact to
affect predator-prey interactions, fish growth rate and system production. Fish
growth rate potential is a new concept that will be incorporated into the models
for the first time. The research will develop the growth rate potential
mathematically, evaluate the sensitivity and spatial statistics of fish growth
rate potential relative to the underlying physical and biological structure of
habitat, compare properties of spatially-explicit fish growth rate among
different cohorts and species with respect to predator behavior, foraging
efficiency and spatial scale of observation, and develop a dynamic spatial model
that allows exchange between different segments of the model. The Chesapeake Bay
will be used as a study site because of the availability of an extensive
database well-suited for these analyses. The research will link biology and
physics within a spatially-explicit framework and has widespread application for
predicting how changes in the patterning or absolute scaling of the environment
might affect production dynamics of higher trophic levels.
