Quasars are brilliant but tiny emitters of light. Being so tiny, it is hard to
fathom how they work. Astronomers suspect the brilliance is caused by gas
flooding toward a massive black hole. Curiously, a few, rare quasars have
dramatically dimmed. These are the changing-look quasars (CLQs), and they offer
clues about how the floodgates can close. The team will use optical observations
to find more CLQs and study their details. Senior team members will train junior
team members from underrepresented groups. The team will convert their light-
based data to sound so that they can share their research with the blind or
visually impaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will (1) conduct archival and
directed searches in multi-epoch SDSS optical spectra, to produce a large and
well-defined statistical sample of new CLQs, (2) select new CLQ candidates for
spectroscopic follow-up based on dramatic variability observed in their
photometric light curves, and (3) investigate the spectroscopic and photometric
variability properties of this sample of at least about 80 CLQs, to characterize
and understand the phenomenon.
