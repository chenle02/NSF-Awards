This project funded by the NSF award is at the intersection of theoretical
physics and geometry. Its main goal is the investigation of mathematical
structures in various models of theoretical physics, ranging from string theory
to quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics. The use of novel
methods, arising from areas of mathematics such as arithmetic geometry,
topology, and homotopy theory, to approach questions in physics, will make it
possible to uncover hidden and deeper mathematical structures behind physical
models. The project will have a strong educational component, involving the
research training of several graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main research directions in this project
include: the use of non-archimedean methods and geometries in the investigation
of the AdS/CFT holographic correspondence of string theory; the development a
theory of noncommutative twistor spaces and associated constructions of
instantons; the construction of quantum statistical mechanical systems
associated to arithmetic objects such as dessins d'enfant, Kuga and Shimura
varieties, modular symbols and their generalizations, and their use in the
investigation of number theoretic properties; categorifications of quantum
statistical mechanical systems; motivic structures in quantum field theories
such as SYK models; higher categories generalizations of classical and
noncommutative motives; the use of noncommutative motives for the investigation
of Feynman integrals of massive field theories; Fermi-Pasta-Ulam dynamics and
KAM theorems on varieties over fields; height functions and Arakelov geometry in
noncommutative and categorical settings; random walks and heat kernel
computations on noncommutative geometries and on cubical sets models of
distributed computating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
