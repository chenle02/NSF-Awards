In many problems, information is available from many different sources.
Aggregating these diverse bits of information is important to good decision-
making but also leads to special statistical problems in developing models to
characterize the information. Prior research in this areas has relied primarily
on the use of historical data as a basis for modelling the information sources.
The proposed research develops a Bayesian framework that a decision maker can
use to encode his subjective knowledge about the information sources in order to
aggregate their information. This framework features a highly flexible
environment for modelling the probabilistic nature and interrelationships of the
information sources and requires straightforward and intuitive subjective
judgements using proven decision-analytic assessment techniques. Analysis of the
assessments to produce a posterior distribution for the event of interest is
accomplished through analytical, numerical or Monte Carlo techniques.
