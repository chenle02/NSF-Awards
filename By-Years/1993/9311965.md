9311965 Laub This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
advanced computer-aided design tools for robust control engineering between Alan
J. Laub of the University of California at Santa Barbara and Pascal Gahinet of
the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics (INRIA) at Rocquencourt. The objective of their research is to
develop efficient, reliable, easy to use software for the design of the next
generation of control systems. Specifically, the U.S. and French investigators
will combine their complementary expertise to develop state of the art
techniques and tools for robustness analysis and control design. Robust control
theory addresses practical control engineering concerns with powerful state-
space techniques and offers a variety of analysis and design tools. The current
lack of reliable, easy to use computer-aided design packages is an obstacle to
wider diffusion of robust control techniques in industry. The proposed research
addresses this issue and deals with problems of generic interest to control
engineers. The results will have widespread applications in aeronautical,
chemical, electrical, and optical systems, among others. ***
