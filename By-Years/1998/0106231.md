This is a study of scalar fluctuations in turbulent jet flames. Spatial and
temporal structures are studied in a simplified counterflow geometry. The
geometry is conducive to direct comparison between quantitative experimental
results and advanced turbulent combustion models such as large-eddy simulations.
A modular burner consisting of two opposed jets and providing a range of
turbulent flow conditions is used. Quantitative laser diagnostics are applied to
a series of flames in this burner to recover the time dependence of OH and CH
concentrations, temperature, and mixture fraction. Velocity measurements are
obtained on an identical burner at Technische Universitat Darmstadt. A set of
simultaneous velocity and concentration measurements are made at Wright-
Patterson Air Force Base. Using a simulation technique developed by the
investigators, relationships between spatial and temporal correlations are
examined quantitatively.

Time-series measurements of concentrations of minor species in turbulent jet
flames have been made recently. These single-point measurements permit study of
time-scale statistics and are analogous to spatial-scale imaging. However,
unknown mixing statistics in the jet flames complicate interpretation of these
data.
