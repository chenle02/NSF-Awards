This proposed research will construct a valuable data set of annual national
indicators of political democracy across nations; and using statistical modeling
methods considered 'state-of-the-art' in sociology, it will analyze the degree
to which systematic bias and random 'noise' are present in the various measures,
attempt to undercover the sources of systematic bias (e.g., political influence
of the country, or perhaps its size) and then correct the original data for such
bias. Advances toward a more adequate measurement of political democracy across
very different nations that are promised by this work would benefit
theoretically grounded studies of the relationship between democratization and
economic and social inequality, as well as economic growth and development. The
same advances would set important measurement standards and enhance the very
substance of human rights determinations currently mandated as a condition of
continuing or renewing both foreign aid and trade relationships. The PI is a
sociologist well known both for his previous contributions to work in this area
and for his statistical and methodological skills with the methods to be used.
