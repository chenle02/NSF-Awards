This RUI program will measure frequency shifts due to the effects of hyperfine
structure during low energy electron spin exchange collisions between ground
state hydrogen atoms in a cryogenic hydrogen maser operating near 11K with solid
neon storage surfaces. Monte Carlo techniques will be used to model all other
potential perturbations of the oscillation frequency of the hydrogen maser and
the cryogenic hydrogen maser being used at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics
to measure the hyperfine induced collision shifts near 0.5. The results will
probe the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in low energy atomic
collisions and the degree to which collisions between hydrogen atoms may limit
the potential stability of cryogenic hydrogen maser frequency standards.
