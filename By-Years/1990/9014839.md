The research proposes experiments on the electronic and optical properties of
high temperature superconducting compounds such as strontium- and zinc-doped
lanthanum cuprates. The insulating side of the metal-insulator transition will
be studied to ascertain the precursor properties ultimately leading to
superconductivity for large enough values of the doping. Experimental techniques
to be employed include photoconductivity and photoluminescence, Hall effect and
magnetoresistance measurements. The overall objective is to better characterize
the semiconductor-to-metal transition as the carrier density is increased.
