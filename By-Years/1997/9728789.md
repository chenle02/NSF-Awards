9728789 Arias The overall objective of this project is to understand how
specific plant TGA factors contribute to as-1 dependent gene expression in
plants. Towards this end, the investigator's laboratory developed transient and
stable transfection systems with tobacco protoplasts and cells to evaluate the
trans-activation of target reporter genes by endogenous or transiently-expressed
factors in response to defined stimuli. With one of these model systems they
found that two distinct as-1 binding proteins, termed TGA1a and VBP1, increase
transcription in response to auxins and xenobiotic stress through a mechanism
that does not involve a change in DNA-binding, dimerization, or nuclear
localization functions of their bZIP domains. The first goal is to identify by
in vivo gain-of-function assays the specific domains and residues that determine
basal and auxin-responsive activation by TGA1a. The second goal is to directly
test by in vivo labeling and phosphopeptide mapping, whether auxin induces a
change in the phosphorylation state of transiently-expressed TGA1a. The
importance of the phosphoacceptor site to trans-activation and other functions
will be evaluated with mutant forms of these factors in transient-expression
assays. The third goal is to use protein-binding assays to characterize a 120
kDA tobacco protein that selectively and stably associates with TGA1a. The
binding site for this protein will be mapped with transiently-expressed, mutant
forms of TGA1a in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The question of whether the
association of this protein with TGA1a is auxin-responsive will also be
investigated. Completion of these objectives will provide important new
information on how plant hormone and chemical-stress cues stimulate the activity
of a plant DNA-binding protein that regulates gene expression. The proposed
studies are likely to make significant contributions towards current efforts at
understanding how gene expression in eukaryotes, and especially in plants, is
regulated. Such knowledge may lead to the development of novel regulatory
systems for controlling the expression of economically-important genes in
plants.
