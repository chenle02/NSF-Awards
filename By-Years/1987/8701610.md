A group of two principal investigators, two research associates and six
graduate students will continue their experiments investigating electron-
positron interactions at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. These
experiments study the basic forces of nature - the electromagnetic weak and
strong interactions - among the basic building blocks of matter - leptons, quark
and gluons. Two programs are in progress: 1. The completion of experiments at
the electron-positron collider whose energy is 29 GeV. These experiments were
started about 10 years ago and have produced many illuminating results. 2.
Experiments with a newly upgraded particle detector (Mark II) at the Stanford
Linear Collider now under construction. Research will concentrate upon the
mediator of the neutral part of the weak force (known as the Zo boson). The
responsibilities of the Johns Hopkins group to the detector are the small angle
monitors and the silicon strip vertex detector.
