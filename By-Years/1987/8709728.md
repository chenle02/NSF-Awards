Operational numerical forecast models tend to underforecast the deepening rate
and the intensity of rapidly developing marine cyclones. Using the global
spectral model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the principal
investigator, Dr. S. L. Mullen, will conduct sensitivity experiments by varying
the physics included in the model, degrading the accuracy of the initial
conditions, and changing the model resolution. The results from this project
should inform on the statistical significance of the results from previous
studies of explosive cyclogenesis which mostly dealt with only one storm or one
particular aspect of the numerical simulation.
