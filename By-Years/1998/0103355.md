&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for NSF proposal DMS-0103355:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
project, the principal investigator investigates the geometry
of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds and mirror symmetry. First the PI plans to
describe the&lt;br/&gt;degeneration of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Calabi-Yau
manifolds near the&lt;br/&gt;large complex structure limit. Second the principal
investigator studies &lt;br/&gt;special Lagrangian submanifolds and deformed
Hermitian-Yang-Mills bundles &lt;br/&gt;on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Third, using
Fourier transformation, Legendre transformation &lt;br/&gt;and their variations,
the principal investigator explains the mirror duality of
complex&lt;br/&gt;geometry and symplectic geometry between mirror
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds
is an important subject in Mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;and also in Physics.
Originated in String theory, mirror symmetry conjecture&lt;br/&gt;gives a
duality transformation of this geometry. This project is
towards&lt;br/&gt;uncovering this amazing symmetry principle.&lt;br/&gt;
