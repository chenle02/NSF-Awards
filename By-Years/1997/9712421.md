The award will support a program of research on the emergence and support of
distributed collaborative communities, particularly those that are centered
around specific business or educational objectives. The key issues and questions
to be explored include: (a) How virtual communities differ from face-to-face
communities; (b) How individuals signal membership and what are the mechanisms
for and barriers to entry or exit (c) How particular technological
characteristics enable or obstruct group work and community building (d) How
virtual communities are forged across computer-based networks and across the
physical-virtual divide; and (e) What are the implications of breaking down
divisions between 'home' and 'work,' for individual 'lifescapes' and broader
community infrastructures. The methods to be used in this project include
ethnographic studies and joint analysis of videotape data.
