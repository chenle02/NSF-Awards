This research has as its objective the development of effective algorithms for
large-scale optimization models. The development includes both theoretical and
computational investigation of decomposition techniques which allow division of
the problem into more tractable subproblems. Of particular interest are models
of large systems in which congestion or other nonlinearities are important. The
methodology being investigated is applicable to many models that arise in
operations research such as transportation planning, routing and scheduling,
manufacturing, and logistics. It is also applicable to models of electrical and
physical systems developed in other engineering disciplines and in the sciences.
