This renewal award to Gerald J. Meyer at Johns Hopkins University is jointly
supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and
Physical Sciences. The focus of the research is charge separation at
semiconductor interfaces. Specifically, organometallic charge-transfer complexes
will be anchored to mesoporous titania and zirconia colloidal films prepared by
sol-gel techniques and the photochemistry and photophysics of charge and
electron transfer between the sensitizer and the semiconductor will be probed.
Studies of molecular precursors, colloids, gels, and nanocrystalline films will
allow the supramolecular nature of extended solids to be explored at the
molecular level. In situ time resolved spectroscopic and electrochemical
techniques will be used to quantify electron transfer dynamics and energetics.
This research will provide insights into the fates of molecular excited states
at semiconductor and insulator derived interfaces and will allow a wide variety
of novel materials to be systematically prepared. Applications of the research
exist in solar energy conversion, chemical sensing, environmental
detoxification, memory storage, catalysis and electro-optical switches.
