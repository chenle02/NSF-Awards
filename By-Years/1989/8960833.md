KMSF will develop a real-time display capable of holographically projecting a
3-dimensional image. During the Phase I effort, KMS will research and examine
the limitations of the state-of-the-art, analyze existing electronic holography
systems, design a mathematical model of a projected holographic display for
holographic sterograms and develop an optimized design for a holographic auto-
stereoscopic 3-D display. Real-time holographic displays have long been
considered impractical due to the extremely high bandwidth and resolution
requirements involved. These are based on past analyses of conventional
transmission holograms, which provide much more information than a human
observer can use. More recent studies have concluded the information content of
holograms can be drastically reduced without significant effect upon the visual
impact of the image. The required space-bandwidth product can be reduced to that
available with commercial spatial light modulators by progressively scanning a
smaller hologram to fill out a 3-D viewing space. By utilizing existing computer
graphics technology to quickly render perspective views of a three- dimensional
object, it should become easier to generate holographic sterograms in real time
rather than attempting the more difficult and unnecessary task of directly
computing a "real" hologram with diffraction-limited resolution.
