The ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of women faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy,
practice, culture, and organizational climate. The ADVANCE Institutional
Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative
organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to
enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML)
will implement a set of strategies designed to create an academic environment
that supports gender equity so all faculty can achieve their highest potential.
The UML project will focus on disrupting interpersonal and institutional
microaggressions (casual belittling of socially marginalized groups made by
individuals that intend no offense and are likely unaware of causing harm) that
undercut productivity and well-being. The project includes three related studies
of microaggressions at UML that will add to the knowledge base on the phenomenon
and effective interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of
microaggressions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to UNL, research suggests that
microaggressions have a powerful, cumulative negative impact on individuals who
experience them and impacts their access to support and advancement. The
ADVANCE-IT program at UML will implement strategies to: (1) disrupt
microaggressions, (2) promote alternative interactional patterns, and (3)
address targeted aspects of the organizational context that can breed bias.
These strategies address issues ranging from institutional procedures to
interpersonal interactions. Activities include an information campaign and
bystander training as well as comprehensive transparency and accountability
initiatives to establish detailed procedures for committee decision making,
workload distribution, and college and department-level self-assessment and
action planning. The research studies will also further develop the research
method of collecting journal data for studies of this nature.
