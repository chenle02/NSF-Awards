The objective of this research is to develop technology that allows for
dispersion and accurate control over assembly of nano-objects into polymeric
materials for the next generation of nanostructured materials and devices. The
approach is to integrate a team that has skills in synthetic chemistry,
characterization, theory, computer simulation and engineering skills who can
rapidly respond to recent discoveries made by the team which suggests unusual
thermodynamics at the nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader educational
and outreach aspects of the NIRT activities are considered critical to the
ultimate success of this program and will cross several disciplines: chemistry,
physics and engineering. To create a truly multidisciplinary environment in
which students can thrive, integration of synthetic organic/polymer chemistry
(Wooley, Hawker) with physics/theory of nanosystems (Tomanek, Frischknecht),
polymer science (Celina, Assink) and engineering (Mackay) will be accomplished
through a variety of mechanisms: exchange of students, an annual meeting,
regular teleconferences or cyber meetings and participation in national
meetings. Teaching modules in nanotechnology have already been developed by
members of this NIRTeam and other courses are under development in addition to
our previous successful outreach activities such as talks to elementary School
children by Mackay and Wooley and a trial presentation entitled, "Nanotech
Kids," is available on the web (www.nanoeverything.com). We propose to expand
the outreach to K-12 and the general public by teaming with the Science Theatre
located on the campus of Michigan State University to create stage shows for the
public. Finally, this NIRTeam consists of dedicated researchers who will also
make fundamental scientific discoveries and have the ability to translate this
knowledge to industrial reality.&lt;br/&gt;
