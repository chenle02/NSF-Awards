The pathways and fluxes for phosphoryl transfer to and from the guanine
nucleotide pools within mitochondrial matrix is being determined by tracer
experiments and kinetic modeling. Mitochondria will be isolated from tissues and
species which differ in the presence and absence of phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase and in the use of ATP/ADP vs. GTP/GDP by succinate thiokinase.
Matrix preparations from mitochondria are assayed for nucleoside diphosphate
kinase, nucleoside monophosphate kinases including adenylate kinase, GTP-AMP
phosphotransferase, and guanylate kinase, and GTP-utilizing enzymes such as
those which activate medium-chain fatty acids. In these assays, HPLC is used to
separate and quantitate all nucleotide substrates and products. The results will
be used to develop a kinetic model for nucleotide metabolism in mitochondrial
matrix which will take into account the activity of nucleoside diphosphate
kinase in the matrix space, the probability that the GTP:GDP and ATP:ADP ratios
are maintained at different values, and the sources and disposition of GTP in
mitochondrial matrix reactions. The mitochondrion is the subcellular organelle
of energy metabolism. This "energy factory" plays a crucial role in cell
metabolism by providing energy for all vital functions. It is surprising that
after several decades of intensive research, a key question still exists about
how one pool of metabolites is regulated. This research applies to new
technologies of measuring individual enzymes and reactants to answer the
remaining questions of regulation.
