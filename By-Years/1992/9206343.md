Awards resulting from earlier versions of this proposal dating back to July,
'88, were in large part for the development of a SRIMS technique for the
isotopic analysis of Os, using Lamont's new Isolab 54 mass spectrometer. But
after 1990 when the NTIMS was shown to be better, this is what has been used in
the PI's lab. Efforts during the proposed funding period will involve Re-Os
investigations of ancient crustal rocks, mantle-derived peridotites, and modern
mantle-derived volcanics. The goals are to: 1) investigate the extent to which
old cratonic rocks represent intracrustal "recycling" of even older continental
materials; 2) establish the present state of Os isotopic heterogeneity in the
modern mantle; and 3) characterize Re and Os distributions on mineralogical
scales in both crustal and mantle rocks.
