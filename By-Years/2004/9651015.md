The chemistry department has been using an aged single-beam dispersive infrared
(IR) spectrometer for routine analyses of organic compounds encountered in the
undergraduate laboratories, specifically in the organic chemistry course. The
instrument requires large sample sizes and inordinate amounts of time for
spectra acquisition; it is becoming difficult to furnish with parts and
supplies. To modernize the analytical holdings in the department, this project
provides a Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Such features as
computer control, saving of spectra into memory, spectra subtraction, the
availability of spectral library software, and solid-analysis capabilities were
not possible with the previous IR, but can be performed with this new
instrument. This spectrometer is being used primarily in the organic chemistry
laboratory for routine analysis, yet may also find use in inorganic, physical,
analytical, and biochemistry. A joint instrumentation course is also being
implemented for the departments of chemistry and biology and is introducing the
junior and senior science majors to some of the major instrumental methods of
both fields. The students served in the sciences would benefit directly by the
improved abilities, but also from the new experiments planned, which include the
study of various types of polymers, analysis of low-level concentrations in raw
materials, and the monitoring of a reaction's progress using FTIR. Ultimately,
the desired impact on the students is their improved preparation for entry into
the scientific workforce, having had adequate hands-on training using modern
instrumental techniques and computers. The time saved on routine operations
could be spent exploiting the instrument's numerous capabilities. The lessons
learned may be shared with others at local scientific meetings in order to
determine the best methods by which to incorporate the machine into the science
curriculum.
