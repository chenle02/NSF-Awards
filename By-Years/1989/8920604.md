The potential impacts of sea level rise on estuarine environments, especially
the threat of saline intrusion, will be examined by mathematically simulating
the time-varying tidal height, currents and salinity. With measurements from a
selected estuary parametric studies will be conducted on projected sea level
rise, stream flow, storm surge, channel roughness, and change in cross- section
profile in order to garner an in-depth understanding of estuarine processes. The
study will examine present conditions versus possible future sea levels, and
with and without some control measures. The results of this work will be
applicable to other estuaries and used in estuarine management and river basin
planning.
