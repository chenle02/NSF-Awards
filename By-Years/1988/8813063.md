Brachiopods and sclerosponges dominate the inner reaches of cryptic reef
habitats around the world, and probably cover more area than the reef surface
itself. Yet these organisms, which offer promise in the study of food-limited
population growth, have been very poorly studied. Dr. Thayer, one of the few
recognized authorities on the systematics, ecology, and paleobiology of these
organisms, will conduct a photocensus of undisturbed populations to record
community dynamics. This information will complement a continuing record of 5
years of pilot photocensus data and will be useful to the investigator in
achieving his long-range goal of understanding resource limitation in these
organisms.
