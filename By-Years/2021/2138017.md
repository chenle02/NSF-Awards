Juan Valdez-Moreira is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Ascending Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship to conduct a program
of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups
underrepresented in Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley. The
project being performed by Juan Valdez-Moreira, entitled Synthesis and Studies
of Single-Molecule Magnets Incorporating Strongly Coupled Two-Coordinate Metal
Building Units, is to be conducted under the guidance of mentoring scientist
Jeffrey R. Long. This project is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-molecule magnets are discrete
paramagnetic molecules that can behave as classical bulk magnets at low
temperature. This proposal seeks to design and synthesize new linear single-
molecule magnets that can serve as building blocks in the design of multinuclear
systems that are linked by ligands that enforce large magnetic coupling. A goal
is development of compounds that retain their magnetic properties at higher
(more practical) temperatures. This work has potential for broad scientific
impact because of its strong connections to areas such as data storage, quantum
computing and dark matter detection. In addition to proposed synthetic studies,
Dr. Valdez-Moreira will carry out outreach activities, with the aim of reaching
non-scientific communities, and the goal of educating and sparking interest in
topics related to the proposed research. He will work with local sections of the
American Chemical Society, the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and
Native Americans in Science, and other societies to help advance his broadening
participation goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
