The project is aimed at unifying three distinct matrix models (one quantum, the
other random/thermodynamic and the third purely algebraic) known today in
connection with planar elliptic growth, an interface dynamics covering a large
variety of natural and theoretical phenomena. The existence of exact solutions
to the equations governing such growth dynamics, their complete integrability,
at least in the case of a flat metric, and the impressive amount of converging
recent research on these topics make the project timely and unavoidable. As
mathematical tools, the proposal will rely on and develop new facets of complex
orthogonal polynomials, moment matrices and potential theoretic operators
arising in the study of planar or spatial shapes. Particular emphasis will be
put on the maximum entropy method for recovery of shade functions from indirect
measurements, such as partial geometric tomographic data and the asymptotics of
the spectra of random non-hermitian matrices.

Following a decade of intense and vibrant discoveries in fluid mechanics and
quantum physics, the present proposal addresses a series of mathematical
questions of high interest for these specific areas of modern science. The
tradition of encoding planar shapes and the geometry of volumes into numbers or
algebraic symbols goes back to the XVII-century landmark contributions of Rene
Descartes and his followers in what is today called ?analytic geometry?. Much
later development and applications of electricity, magnetism and atomic science
we all benefit today was possible by a second major step into the same
direction, that is the representation of complex physical entities as large
arrays of numbers or symbols called matrices. The proposed project focuses on
the study of matrix models arising in the current research of moving interfaces
of fluids or more sophisticated but similar media. Such moving boundaries
phenomena are illustrated by cancer growth, crystal formation, ice melting, oil
reserves, carbon monoxide sequestration and plasma dynamics. The PI is assisted
by a group of enthusiastic doctoral students and he is connected, via several
collaborative works, with experts in other fields of mathematics, physics or
engineering.
