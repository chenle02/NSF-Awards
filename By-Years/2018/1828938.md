This award provides travel support for student participation in the 2018 Quantum
Science Gordon Research Conference: Non-Equilibrium Quantum Matter and Scalable
Quantum Computing. The conference program includes many of the research topics
central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics, and also Quantum Information
Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial
contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who
graduate with a background in quantum information science acquire a broad range
of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas
of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be
held at Stonehill College in Easton, MA from July 29th to August 3rd 2018. It
offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to
interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the
broader international community. Support is provided only for US students
(students enrolled in US universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
