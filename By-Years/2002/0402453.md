Southwestern College, a Hispanic serving institution, is the only community
college that currently provides biotechnology training for southern San Diego
County. One focus of the BETSI Project is outreach to three feeder high schools
through faculty training and curricular support in the basics of biotechnology.
During summer workshops, high school biology teachers and selected students try
out the new curriculum designed for high school science courses. A mobile lab
provides biotechnology supplies and equipment. The Project Coordinator and
community college students trained through the Southwestern College
Biotechnology Program serve as mentors for high school students and provide
technical support as lab assistants to high school faculty during summer
workshops and for classes during the regular school year.

The BETSI Project also facilitates updating of the Southwestern College
biotechnology curriculum to address current topics that include the ethical,
legal and societal implications of the Human Genome Project. The community
college articulation partnerships with feeder high schools and 4-year transfer
institutions provide students with pathways to industry employment. The training
aspect of the BETSI Project concentrates on increasing the number of funded
student research internships and cultivating collaborative relationships with
the local biotechnology industry. Coordination of students' participation in
internships with industry and academia immerse them in the biotechnology
environment and provide them with employment opportunities.
