This award supports travel by the Principal Investigator to Colombia to initiate
a collaboration with Dr. Silvia Caro of the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogota,
Colombia, and Ms. Sara Alzate of Road Sciences Corporation in Los Angeles, CA.
The topic of the collaboration is to use stochastically generated material
properties in numerical simulations of advanced lab tests of asphalt concrete.
The numerical simulations will address the variability of material properties.
The use of stochastic modeling will allow consideration of the actual
characteristics of the microstructure and its impact on the response of the
material.

The meeting will also develop a framework for students to engage in
international research and exchanges. In addition to the academic studies,
benefits to industry are anticipated.
