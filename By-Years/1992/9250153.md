The department of Chemistry is acquiring a high-field nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer to improve undergraduate laboratory courses by providing each
chemistry student with experience in operating the spectrometer in several
laboratory courses. Among the experiments being conducted with the aid of this
instrument are: the synthesis of C60 (buckminsterfullerene) and the
identification of this molecule by 13C and 1H NMR in general chemistry; spin
dynamic studies incorporating the measurement of the 1H T1 time of water in
paramagnetic solution to obtain the magnetic moment of the paramagnetic species
in physical chemistry; and, determination of the rate of ring inversion in
cyclohexane using a chemical exchange technique. The instrument is also being
used extensively in undergraduate research projects.
