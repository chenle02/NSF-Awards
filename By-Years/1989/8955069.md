The Family Math program was developed to enable and encourage parents and
children to enjoy the learning and doing of mathematics together. The project
has been highly successful over the past eight years in a number of communities
throughout the United States. The current project is designed to improve access
to Matematica Para La Familia, the Spanish version of Family Math, for a large
number of Spanish speaking families in Florida, Arizona, and Texas who have not
yet had the opportunity to participate in this program. In addition, the project
will provide follow-up networking activities for participants in all sites and
will extend the evaluation of the project to focus on two communities where the
target families are made up predominantly of migrant workers. Cost-sharing in
the amount of $294,286 is 44% of the amount requested from NSF.//
