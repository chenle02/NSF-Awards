Henderson State University will purchase four microcomputer-based color graphics
workstations, a laser printer, and associated software. This equipment will be
used to improve instruction by integrating computational methods and computer
graphics into the undergraduate curriculum in physics. These techniques and
capabilities then will be applied to problems in classical mechanics, modern
physics, and quantum mechanics. Henderson State University will match the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
