This three-year project will provide teachers from three San Francisco high
schools with high minority enrollments with the tools with which to rebuild
their college-track mathematics classes. With the assistance of university
mathematicians, a total of approximately 25 high school mathematics teachers
will examine exemplary curricular materials in mathematics, incorporate them
into their classes, and adapt to the early high school setting a model of
collaborative learning that has proven successful with minority college
freshmen. Each summer, 12 high school teachers and 3 junior high school teachers
will participate in a six-week workshop that includes deepening their own
understanding of mathematics, studying and adapting exemplary materials, and
testing those materials in a "transition summer school." During the academic
year, each of the high school teachers will spend one hour per day in curricular
planning and the preparations of inservice workshops. Project staff will meet
weekly with participants in their individual schools and monthly with the
participants as a group. Dissemination of the project's impact beyond the three
participating schools will include a district-sponsored two-week summer
institute, the inclusion of project teachers in the district's mentor teacher
program, and the participation of project teachers on district and state
curriculum committees. The university and the school district are contributing
as cost- sharing an amount equal to 77% of the NSF award.
