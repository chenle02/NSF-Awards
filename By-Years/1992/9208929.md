This project is investigating the use of information about defect clustering on
wafers to make yield predictions for individual dies based on test results for
neighboring dies. The hypothesis is that defects on a wafer are clustered, thus
most good dies are close to other good ones and most defective dies are close to
others. Clustering information can then be used for targeting particular tests
to individual dies on the wafer. Simulations using wafer defect distribution
data from the published literature is being employed to assess the viability of
the approach. Accurate models to predict defect levels attainable are being
developed and strategies for testing dies on the wafer are being determined.
