Refinetti 9507452 Physiological variables such as body temperature are normally
buffered against changes by homeostatic regulatory responses. However, there is
a normal daily fluctuation in body temperature that is driven by a circadian
biological clock. It is presently unclear how the clock mechanism interacts with
the systems that normally keep body temperature constant in order to produce the
daily temperature fluctuations. With this CAREER award, Dr. Refinetti will lead
a research team of undergraduates to investigate the interactions between the
brain's circadian clock and the thermoregulatory system. He will also devote
time to the development of an integrated teaching program in biological
psychology. ***
