This proposal requests funds to purchase a spectrofluorometer, an
ultracentrifuge, and a fast protein liquid chromatography system to be housed in
a shared molecular biology and optical spectroscopy instrument facility in the
Chemistry Department at Washington University. The facility will be shared by
research groups in the Chemistry and Biology Departments. The shared instruments
will provide the primary functions of fluorescence spectroscopy, isolation and
purification of DNA and proteins, and isolation of biologically active enzyme
complexes for studies in bioenergetics. The investigators are productive, with
proven track records. Support is recommended.
