9509006 Holsinger Much progress has been made in understanding the evolution of
plant mating systems since Thomas Knight proposed in 1799 that "No plant
fertilizes itself for a perpetuity of generations.". In these two centuries,
however, most studies have shared one significant feature with Knight's work--an
emphasis on the fitness consequences of inbreeding. To botanists inbreeding
depression is an obstacle that must be overcome; to geneticists it is the only
force that can oppose the otherwise certain spread of a selfing allele. As a
result, experimental and theoretical analyses of inbreeding depression have
dominated the study of plant mating systems for many years. The mass-action
model recently developed by Dr. Holsinger shows that the dynamics of pollen
transfer may have an impact on the evolutionary dynamics of plant mating systems
as great as that of inbreeding depression, and it shows considerable promise as
a comprehensive framework for analyzing the impact of individual differences in
pollen transfer dynamics. It is also the only approach in which mixed mating
systems are evolutionarily stable for a broad range of parameter values, unless
the range of possible selfing rates is constrained. The work proposed here will
extend existing mass-action models in ways that allow determination of which
aspects of the reproductive process have the greatest impact on the evolutionary
dynamics of plant mating systems.
