Information Technology (IT) programs in two-year colleges have provided
personnel qualified for the IT workforce. Yet corporate hiring preferences favor
those with four-year degrees in almost any field combined with IT certificates
or courses at the two-year college or two-year college degrees and much
experience. Present articulated degree programs emphasize business fields such
as sales and personnel supervision rather than advanced standards-based
technical skills. This project investigates the extent to which industrial
support exists for four-year degrees in IT that are consistent with skill
standards. Upper division skill standards in IT are developed to codify those
technical and non-technical elements that are important in the selection,
placement and promotion of IT workers. The clusters of Enterprise System
Analysis and Integration, Programming, Technical Writing and Database
Development and Administration are emphasized. The project also investigates
best practices in the structure and use of conventional articulation models
between two-year and four-year colleges and the development of a framework for
offering standards-based upper division technology degrees.
