This project is a continuation, for the years 2004-2009, of the mathematics
programs of the Institute for Advanced Study/Park City Mathematics Institute
(PCMI).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Three programs, the Research Program, the Graduate
Summer School and the Undergraduate Summer School, are organized around a single
area of contemporary mathematical research, which varies from year to
year.&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical topics and organizers for 2004-08 are in place. All
programs take place for a three-week period each July in a conference center in
Park City, Utah. Led by world-renowned mathematicians as lecturers and lead
researchers, each of the three programs requested in this proposal has 30-70
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last 13 years, PCMI (with its
predecessor, the NSF-funded Regional Geometry Institute) has established itself
as the national summer school in advanced mathematics, uniquely integrating
undergraduate study, graduate study, and mathematical research activities via
concurrent and integrated programs of study and research.
