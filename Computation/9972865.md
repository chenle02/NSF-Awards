Majda 9972865 The investigator continues studies of the theory and applications
of partial differential equations to problems in turbulence and atmosphere/ocean
science. The project emphasizes problems in atmosphere/ocean science involving
four research areas: 1) Stratified Mixing, Instability and Turbulence; 2) Novel
Statistical Theories for Open Ocean Convection; 3) Nonlinear Waves in Tropical
Meteorology; 4) Nonlinear Stochastic Modelling for Geophysical Flows. The
approach to all of these issues involves a sophisticated combination of
asymptotic analysis, numerical computation, and theoretical mathematical
analysis to gain insight into these complex and important phenomena. Inherently
nonlinear or statistical methods are emphasized throughout. The project,
especially in the latter three topics, stresses multi-disciplinary collaboration
and exchange of ideas between applied mathematicians, atmospheric scientists,
and oceanographers. Behaviors of the atmosphere and ocean are complex and not
well understood. The project involves using novel and sophisticated mathematical
theories and techniques to improve our understanding of important features of
the climate, such as El Nino, and the poleward transport of heat in the North
Atlantic. Such an understanding could lead to improved predictions of weather,
climate, and environmental phenomena. The approach involves multi-disciplinary
collaboration and exchange of ideas between applied mathematicians, atmospheric
scientists, and oceanographers. The project is supported by the Applied
Mathematics and Computational Mathematics programs in the Division of
Mathematical Sciences, by the Physical Oceanography program in the Division of
Ocean Sciences, and by the Large-Scale Dynamic Meteorology program in the
Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
