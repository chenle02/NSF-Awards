This program involves the theoretical and experimental fluid-structure analysis
of very large floating structures (VLFSs). The primary objective of the program
is to improve the understanding of VLFS response and the capabilities to
predictit. A major aspect of the work involves wave tank model testing of six
scale model VLFSs. Data obtained from these tests will include not only basic
motion response, but a detailed description of the hydroelastic response. The
data will be use to validate numerical techniques and to identify and evaluate
phenomena not included in the numerical models. New and existing numerical
techniques to predict the hydroelastic response will be developed and refined,
with an emphasis placed on methodologies appropriate for large scale, flexible,
floating systems. The experimental data and numerical models will be used to
evaluate various configurations and to develop general guidelines for design. A
VLFS might have plan dimensions on the order of 1,000x 3,000 m, which is a
substantial increase in size compared to existing floaters. Because comparable
field data and experience is nonexistent, this research is required for the
better understanding of the hydroelastic response of VLFSs. It must be carried
out prior to the design and construction of a VLFS.
