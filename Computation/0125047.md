The investigator and his colleagues develop an interdisciplinary training
program that would give graduate students substantive training in both
mathematics and biology. The goal is to produce students competent in both
disciplines, with genuine expertise in applied mathematics and some specific
area of biology: biofluids, ecology and evolutionary biology, neuroscience, or
physiology. Training is built on the Special Interest Group, which includes
faculty members from both mathematics and biology, students and postdocs, and
industry-based researchers where appropriate. Modern biology is increasingly
mathematical and computational. Education and training in components of both
disciplines is needed to prepare people for the 21st century workforce, for
leading-edge research, and for teaching. This pilot project includes innovative
aspects in its thematic organization, flexible arrangement of both common and
area-specific content, interdisciplinary teaming, combination of theoretical and
experimental training, and involvement of industrial partners. The combination
is promising for fostering long-term changes by growing a generation of
scientists, mathematicians, and engineers who share language and skills well
enough to take up and solve key problems.
