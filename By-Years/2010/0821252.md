A grant has been awarded to Texas State University-San Marcos to enable the
purchase of a multiphoton-ready microscopy system consisting of a scanning
confocal system that can be converted to multiphoton capability by future
addition of an infra-red laser. Confocal microscopes revolutionized microscopy
by enabling scientists to see microscopic, fluorescing objects even when they
are very close together (e.g. &gt;1 ten-thousandth of a millimeter apart). This
feat is possible because confocal microscopes use optics to eliminate out-of-
focus light, creating very narrow planes of focus. They use digital imagery to
reconstruct three-dimensional images from two-dimensional images. In addition to
generating stunning micrographs, confocal microscopy enables scientists to
examine the relationships among various proteins and large molecules in
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new confocal microscope will promote teaching
and research at Texas State University for diverse scientists. Projects include
investigations of nerve regeneration and the interactions among proteins
involved in signaling relays in animals, plants and bacteria. Faculty and
students from nearby Texas Lutheran (~24% Hispanic) and Saint Mary?s
Universities(~51% Hispanic) will study evolution in bacteria and regulation of
the development of neurons. Texas State?s Materials Science group will use
confocal microscopy to better understand the structure of nanomaterials used in
coating rocket motors. Education is tightly interwoven with research at the
participating universities, and students will be performing most of the
research. More than 20 graduate students (currently 17% minority, 50% women)
will use the microscope at Texas State each year. Thus, this instrument will
have a significant impact on the career aspirations of the next generation of
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
