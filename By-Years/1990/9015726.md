This project provides support for a workshop on the topic of artificial neural
networks and their application in electric power engineering planned for July
24-25, 1991 at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. The workshop will be
the first international meeting of its kind devoted to power engineering
applications of this novel technology. A special emphasis is to be given for
participation from Pacific Rim countries -- and the second symposium, which will
be a follow-up to the present workshop, is expected to be held in Japan in 1993.
