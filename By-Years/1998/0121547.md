This research project is developing a new generation of formal verification
tools that can be integrated into design environments for the complex, high-
assurance embedded and autonomous systems of today and of the future. Such
systems are increasingly distributed, complex, and dynamic; they must operate
with a high degree of autonomy and survivability in diverse and unpredictable
environments. This project will focus on the development of new verification
methods and tools to provide a rigorous means for checking the integrity and
correctness of designs for these systems before they are deployed. The project
has two broad research thrusts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Verifying System
Integrity. System integrity refers to correctness with respect to the
interactions among the distributed software and hardware components. Systems
must satisfy synchronization, resource, and real-time constraints imposed by the
implementation architecture and application requirements. This project will
extend automated verification methods that have been successful in hardware and
protocol applications to their use with embedded and autonomous systems.
&lt;br/&gt;2. Modeling the Environment. Embedded and autonomous systems must
interact in complex ways with physical systems and adverse environments. It is
thus essential to capture correctly and effectively the continuous dynamics,
feedback loops, and unpredictable features of the environment in the models used
for formal verification. This project will draw on recent developments in hybrid
system verification to integrate continuous state dynamics with discrete-state
models used in formal verification. &lt;br/&gt;
