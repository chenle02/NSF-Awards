This project will create, pilot, field-test and disseminate standards-based
Professional Development materials that will support in-service needs of
practicing technology education teachers. The Standards for Technological
Literacy have been published, and this project will help teachers to implement
them in the classroom. A consortium of institutions will develop the materials.
The materials to be produced include two content primers in biotechnologies and
medical technologies, and a curriculum vision monograph that details what
technology teachers must know and do to be effective in teaching.
