The purpose of this research is to develop a new and powerful general
methodology for posing and answering basic questions about optimal policies
concerning the preservation of biological diversity. The theory will be broad
enough to integrate a wide range of related subjects into a coherent whole, yet
operational enough to be useful for addressing practical empirical questions.
The theory is centered on the diversity function, a basic dynamic programming
equation that measures the diversity of a set of n objects or species as a
function of n(n-1)/2 pair wise variables. This function can be interpreted as
determining the possible genetic distance or dissimilarity, or the probability
of species survival, depending on the context and intended application.
Theoretical applications will include the use of cost-benefit analysis in
analyzing conservation issues, classification theory, maximum likelihood
estimation of evolutionary trees, entropy measures of diversity for ecological
settings, the calculation of diversity maximizing policies, and relations with
portfolio diversification theory. Practical computer packages will be prepared
and applied to a series of actual conservation problems. For example, the
methodology will be applied to analyzing issues concerned with the preservation
of the 15 exiting species of cranes. With the growing world-wide threat to a
variety of plant and animal species and their habitats, this research is
particularly timely and important.
