The acquisition of this equipment adds a laboratory component to three computer
science courses: Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-
Computer Interaction. The primary purpose is to establish a connection between
the theory and practice of the discipline by giving students the opportunity and
assistance in establishing links between these typically compartmentalized
intellectual units. Most of the design activities are project oriented where
students take real systems with real users and explore the nature of computer
use in its context. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
