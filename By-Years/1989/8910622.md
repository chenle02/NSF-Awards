This is a two-year collaborative research project between Drs. Nejat Veziroglu
and Sadik Kakac, University of Miami and Professor Xuejun Chen, Jiaotong
University, China to study an engineering problem of the instabilities of two
phase flow. This is an important problem in engineering and has major
applications in a variety of industrial processes such as design of boiling
water reactors, steam power plants, refrigeration systems, and heat exchangers.
The U.S. group is among the best in this country in two-phase transport study
and the University of Miami is one of the top institutes in the U.S. engaged in
this research. Prior collaboration with chinese scientists on a similar topic by
this group was successful. The study can further the understanding of this
important engineering process.//
