This project is to develop an approximation methodology for Eulerian
probability-density-transport equations involving a large state-space dimension.
These equations include Liouville and Fokker-Planck equations which arise in
many applications involving statistical descriptions: from uncertainty
quantification and inverse problems to turbulent mixing, chemical reactions and
dispersion of particles. The focus is on those problems where the large number
of independent state-space variables makes classical approximation methods
unfeasible because of their large computation cost. The new technique is a
Rayleigh-Ritz global approximation method using analytical quadratures. The
global nature of the basis functions transforms an expensive computational
problem in state-space into a finite number of equations with the dimensionality
of the deterministic equations governing a single realization of the problem of
interest.

The methods developed in the project will indirectly help improve prediction of
the outcome in a number of physical problems where boundary conditions or
initial conditions are only available statistically. Such problems arise in
particulate flows, aerosols, sprays and droplet dynamics encountered in the
dispersion of contaminants, where only partial statistical knowledge of the
conditions is available. This project has direct bearing on high-performance
computing and modeling of physical systems involving flows carrying solid or
liquid particles.
