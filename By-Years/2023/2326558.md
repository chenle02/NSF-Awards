This travel award supports the participation of junior and senior US researchers
in the African School for Electronic Structure Methods and Applications (ASESMA)
school and workshop, to be held in Rwanda in June 2023. The researchers will
serve as both instructors and mentors, each teaching one lecture in the school
and giving one research project presentation during the workshop. School
attendees will be educated in fundamental and advanced aspects of electronic
structure theory and its numerical frameworks. The school and the workshop will
lay down the foundation for establishing long-lasting research collaborations
between US and African scientists. It will also provide junior US researchers
with a valuable international teaching experience and allow them to interact
closely with prominent senior scientists in electronic structure theory from
around the world.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
