9313794 Stephen Analysis of data from a Vertical Seismic Profile at Ocean
Drilling Project site 735B in the Indian Ocean indicates that attenuation in
crustal layer 3 may be much higher than previously thought. If this is true, it
may indicate that layer 3 is not composed dominantly of gabbros as is commonly
thought. The present project will analyze additional data from several different
locations in attempting to clarify the initial results from the Indian Ocean.
