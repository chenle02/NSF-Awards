A series of hands-on laboratory exercises are being developed for a triad of
upper-division physics courses based on the techniques of active optical
spectroscopy of gases and plasmas using a tunable dye laser as probing light
source. The laboratories give students hands-on experience in operating and
calibrating a dye laser system and teach various ways in which we can use
scanning, narrowband dye lasers in the spectroscopic study of matter. Four core
exercises are being developed initially, with gradual extensions and additional
exercises being added as independent research projects conducted by senior
physics majors. The following form the initial four core exercises: (1) An
Introduction to Dye Lasers and Calibration; (2) Investigation of Atomic
Structure by Laser Optogalvanic Spectroscopy; (3) Spectroscopic Study of
Molecular Structure by Laser Induced Fluorescence and by Laser Absorption; and
(4) Optical Diagnosis of Electrostatic Waves in Plasma. Emphasis is placed on
hands-on student participation and the full utilization of current state-of-the-
art active spectroscopy apparatus and procedures as provided by frequency
scanning, narrowband dye lasers and supporting optical components and
instrumentation for signal analysis.
