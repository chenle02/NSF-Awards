9522634 Zhao The potential for SiC is based upon its high breakdown field
strength, high temperature operation (due to its wide bandgap) and good thermal
conductivity. However, this potential will not be realized unless fundamental
studies are carried out on SiC surfaces and with ohmic constacts, especially to
p-type regions. The research is directed towards the realization of a Gate
Controlled Thyristor (GCT) which is an important device for SiC Power
Electronics. A Plasma-Etched (ECR) U-Groove vertical GCT structure fabricated in
6H-SiC is proposed which requires (1) high quality gate oxides over p-type
regions and (2) good ohmic to the p-type regions. ***
