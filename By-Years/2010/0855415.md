This award will support continued research into the nature of fundamental
theories of gravity, and their connection to cosmology. Topics to be
investigated include (1) the principles which determine the quantum state of the
universe and the generalizations of quantum mechanics necessary to understand
it, (2) the gravitational aspects of string theory, a promising candidate for a
quantum theory of gravity, and (3) the notion of locality in quantum gravity and
its application to quantum cosmology and the evaporation of black holes.

This work in centered in the ongoing quest of physics for a unified theory of
nature's fundamental forces and the origin of the universe. These are subjects
not only of great interest to scientists but also the general public. By
engaging the interest of students and public the investigators hope to encourage
the support of science generally. In addition, the project will develop human
resources for science and technology by training graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars in advanced techniques.
