9312242 Loferski Description: this project supports the participation of a U.S.
delegation to the Seventh Workshop on Physics of Semiconductors Devices to be
held in New Delhi, India from December 14 through 18, 1993. The chairman of the
workshop is Dr. Krishan Lal of the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi
which is organizing the workshop. Professor S.C. Jain was the organizer and
Chairman or co-chairman of the previous six workshops. The workshop topics will
include: Device physics of heterostrucures and quantum devices; advanced
discrete devices, characterization of semiconducting materials, unit processes
and devices including diagnostic tools; futuristic devices such as nanometer
scale devices, molecular electronics, and photonics. Scope: The planned workshop
is one of a series that is held every two to three years which have gained
excellent reputation because of the high quality of papers and presentations.
The workshop is attracting a large number of eminent scientists from the U.S.
and from major European countries, Japan, and Canada, in addition to India's top
scientists in the field. Previous workshop has resulted in well prepared,
published proceedings. ***
