This is a study of the Townsend movement which worked to secure pensions for
the aged in the Depression. The Townsend movement may have included as many as
one-fifth of the aged at the start of 1936. The study will examine how the
Townsend movement grew and spread throughout the United States, and it will
examine what effects this movement may have had on public spending for old
people. The study will use statistical methods to analyze data collected from
historical archives around the country and from polling data about the strengths
of the Townsend movement and other movements trying to gain support for pensions
for the aged. The study's focus on the outcomes of a popular social movement,
such as the Townsend movement, is one of the strengths of the study. Another
strength is its combination of good history with systematic quantitative
analysis.
