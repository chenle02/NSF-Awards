0221335 Duncan&lt;br/&gt;It has been observed that the rate of gas transfer
across the air-sea interface correlates well with the mean squared slope of the
high frequency surface waves. It has also been noted that the presence of
surfactants, at concentrations that have almost no effect on surface tension,
dramatically reduces the high frequency components of the wind wave spectrum.
Wave tank studies of wind waves, and wind waves plus mechanically generated
waves, with and without soluble surfactants, will seek to understand the
mechanisms for this reduction in mean squared slope in the presence of
surfactants, as well as the characteristics of high frequency waves. At low
concentrations, it is hypothesized that the effects may result from the
concentrating of surfactants at the wave crests, where capillary effects are
typically largest. A variety of laboratory measurement techniques will be used.
A cart carries measurement devices along the wave tank at speeds commensurate
with the wave phase. Second Harmonic Generation techniques allow dynamic
measurement of surfactant concentration. For these latter studies, the system
will be at a fixed location and randomly sample the wind
waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
