9400073 Wiens This award supports Professors John Wiens and Beatrice Van Horne,
together with postdoctoral associate Thomas Crist, all of Colorado State
University, to collaborate in ecological research with Nils Stenseth and his
group in the Department of Biology of the University of Oslo, Norway. They are
attempting to understand the relationship of the mosaic structure of landscapes
to the ecology of individuals, and to translate these effects to the population
and community levels. The Colorado State group has strengths in simulation
modeling while the Oslo group emphasizes analytical, mathematical models. They
will integrate these approaches to address common questions about how
environmental heterogeneity affects ecological systems and about how these
effects vary with spatial scale. Questions about the effects of scale and of
explicit spatial heterogeneity on ecological systems have become a centerpiece
of contemporary ecology. This collaboration will evaluate two methodological
approaches to these questions by applying them jointly to independently gathered
empirical data from the different systems being studied by the two groups. The
result should be a contribution to predictive theory that will have significant
applications in preserving biodiversity and threatened ecosystems. ***
