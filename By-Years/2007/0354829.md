&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is the development of a chiral carbene
based on the well-known binaphthalene unit that will be capable of assembling
target molecules with high levels of asymmetric induction. Further, a variety of
ring forming reactions based on carbene chemistry will be examined with a focus
on the preparation of seven-membered nitrogen heterocycles. Cascade processes
triggered by nucleophilic carbene additions will also be studied.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Dr. James H. Rigby of the Department of
Chemistry at the Wayne State University. Dr. Rigby will focus his work on the
development of the chemistry of nucleophilic carbenes and vinylisocyanates as
novel participants in the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles and alkaloids. The
project provides an excellent training ground for undergraduate students,
graduate students and postdoctoral associates and has potential broader impact
for the pharmaceutical industry and for the advancement of medical
science.&lt;br/&gt;
