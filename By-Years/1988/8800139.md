The XIIIth International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems
will be held in August 1988 in Madison, Wisconsin. The meeting will cover the
latest advances in the fields of NMR and ESR with emphasis on free radicals,
iron- sulfur proteins, photosynthesis, metalloproteins, contractile systems,
nucleic acids, protein-lipid interactions, enzyme mechanisms and NMR
spectroscopy of plants and animals. In addition nine proposed workshops are
planned to discuss the latest developments in techniques and methodology of
magnetic resonance. Previous conferences have played an important and
indispensable role in promoting the development and application of various
magnetic resonance theories and techniques to biology during the past two
decades. Both ESR and NMR have led to detailed knowledge about the dynamics,
structures and organizations of the various components of biological
systems.***//
