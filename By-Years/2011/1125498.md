The research team investigates the effect of news coverage on decisions of
public interest organizations. This project draws on data from newspaper
archives and from a survey of public interest organizations to document the
effect of news coverage on their structure, strategies and implementation.
Unlike prior single-organization studies, this study uses rare, representative
data from organizations across the ideological spectrum. These exceptional data
allow the investigator to test whether theories based on single-issue samples
generalize to other organizations, and to use powerful statistical analysis to
identify the different mechanisms for the effects.
