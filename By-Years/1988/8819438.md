The carbon-isotopic signal of the Southern Ocean surface waters near the polar
front is enriched in delta C-13 by 1.0 per mil. However, downcore the planktonic
forams in the polar front region show a greater variation in C-13 because of the
migrations of the front through time, linked to changes in carbon-isotopic
composition of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). In the tropics the delta
C-13 signal is small and its origin is debated. The objective of the proposed
research is to isolate global, transient, thermodynamic, and "Redfield" changes
in the tropical and polar surface water isotopic records. Funds are provided for
a two years' stable-isotopic study of cores from the topical to polar waters
spanning the past 250 k.yrs. to decipher the origin of the carbon-isotopic
signal. The study will help resolve the changes in the position and intensity of
the polar front. The analyses of Cd/Ca ratios of forams Cibicides sp. along with
their carbon-isotopic analyses may help determine if the decoupling of the two
systems can be used to identify the presence of AAIW.
