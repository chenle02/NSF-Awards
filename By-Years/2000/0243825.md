Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0243825 Date:
1-10-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Boyd Institution: Loyola University of
Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Loyola University of Chicago for
the summers of 2003-2005. Mary K Boyd is the program director. Faculty members
from the chemistry department will serve as REU mentors to nine students, who
will participate in a ten-week program. Students from two-year colleges, women
and underrepresented minorities will be targeted for participation in the
program. Research projects from across the department will be available to the
participants including analytical, biological, organic, bioorganic,
computational and physical chemistry. Weekly seminars will be held focusing on
research areas, their relevance to real world problems, career opportunities in
chemistry, and ethics. Each student will prepare a written report and give an
oral report of their work in a Student Symposium at the end of the summer
program.&lt;br/&gt;
