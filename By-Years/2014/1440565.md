The ability to transfer or share large amounts of data has become a significant
limiting factor across science and engineering disciplines. The project, "CC*IIE
Networking Infrastructure: Riverfront Campus Research Network," removes these
network impediments at the new Tulane Riverfront Center of Excellence (RFCOE),
enhancing researchers capabilities both within the borders of the campus and
beyond. Enhanced experimental freedom and increased technological capabilities
strengthen ongoing research and will inspire new collaborations and
investigations enabling the expansion of the university population that utilizes
computational resources. The projects that benefit from this increased
functionality have tremendous impacts on the interests of the greater community,
including an examination of sediment dynamics and quantitative stratigraphy in
the Mississippi River Delta and the Woods Hole Global Rivers Observatory project
to understand the ways climate change, deforestation, and other contemporary
environmental concerns impact river chemistry and land-ocean
linkages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends the Tulane dedicated high-
speed science network and the new Tulane HPC resource to the RFCOE, enabling
researchers' access to high performance computers, connecting them to local,
regional, and national resources. It addresses the "last meter" problem,
allowing researchers to provision a 10-gigabit connection from their
workstations, laboratories and instruments with a 40Gbps uplink to Tulane's new
HPC cluster, regional institutions through the Louisiana Optical Network
Initiative (LONI), and national centers that peer with Internet2 (I2) including
members of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)
consortium.
