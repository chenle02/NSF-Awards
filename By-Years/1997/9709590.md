In this project we study the use of auction mechanisms to provide a public
project for a soci ety with multiple individuals. We consider a public project
that can be consumed without rivalry by all agents but where exclusion of
individuals is pos sible. We adopt excludability as an instrument of economic
policy in order to ensure obtain voluntary participation by the individuals in
the project. While the infor mation about the cost of the project can generally
be assumed known to the planner, we allow the in formation about the agents'
preferences and endow ments to be private. In this framework, the issues become
whether or not to provide the excludable public good, whom to include, and how
the costs of provision are to be shared. We borrow from the theory of auctions
to charac terize two `auction-like` mechanisms for allocating excludable public
goods. The first is a mechanism based on the increasing-bid, English auction we
call the `English Auction-Like Mechanism.` The second is a mechanism based on
Vickrey's second-price, sealed bid auction we call the `Sealed Bid Auction-Like
Mechanism.` We show that, as in Vickrey (1961), the English Auction-Like
Mechanism and the Sealed Bid Auction-Like Mechanism are strategy proof, and that
they lead to equivalent outcomes. Moreover, the latter is closely related to the
serial cost sharing rule and the conser vative equal cost rule, proposed by
Moulin (1994). We extend his model by limiting the number of individuals who may
consume the good non-rivalrously; that is, by introducing congestion in
consumption. Prices play a dual role of in ducing truthful preference revelation
and of a ra tioning device to allocate the good. The contributions of the
project are two: to show that rules suggested by Moulin and Vickrey belong to
the same family of extended auction-like mechanisms, thereby unifying two
previously separate branches in the literature on mechanism design; and to
character ize two well-defined auction-like mechanisms which can be shown to be
easy to implement. This project constitutes the point of departure for a
systematic analysis of strategy-proof mechanisms for allocating and pricing
excludable public goods. This is an important direction which will ultimately
result in a better understanding of cost sharing rules, their performance
characteristics, and the ways in which they can be practically implemented. The
re sults from this investigation have the potential to affect meaningfully the
way private and public or ganizations allocate scarce resources to finance ac
tivities such as computer networks, telecommunica tions systems, political
parties, museums, libraries, schools, etc. These extensions will be the topic of
a future full NSF proposal.
