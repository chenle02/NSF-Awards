Lionel (Bill) Poirier of Texas Tech University and Brian Kendrick of Los Alamos
National Laboratory are supported by an award from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program to partially support the costs of holding a
Workshop on Quantum Trajectory Methods. This workshop, to be held July 28-30,
2008 at Los Alamos, will bring together investigators to discuss a very
controversial method, Bohmian Mechanics, that has stimulated a great deal of
research and a lot of strongly-held opinions. The workshop will likely be the
first place that supporters and detractors of this technique are brought
together to discuss this technique. The participant/speaker list is very diverse
and includes people from both sides of the controversy, so it is likely to be a
lively meeting. The support is primarily to ensure the participation of postdocs
and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
