The University of Southern Maine, the University of Maine at Fort Kent, and the
York County Community College are collaborating in a two-year project to pilot
and evaluate the feasibility of implementing an inter-institutional virtual
cyber security collaborative learning laboratory. In a traditional classroom or
laboratory, the student has the support of the faculty and or other students and
the physical immediacy positively impacts the students? learning, decisions and
outcomes. Cybersecurity virtual laboratories are shared resources that minimize
the cost of replicating cybersecurity educational programs and allow students
from several institutions to remotely use the hardware at the lead institution.
A student working in a virtual cyber security laboratory can work as part of a
group at great distances from the physical hardware and other students. This
project will develop procedures and practices to fill in the gaps between
virtual and physical laboratories in reliable and cost effective ways.

The research design allows for the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing
the inter-institutional laboratory in five, four-hour rounds of simulations over
three semesters. Evaluation research will utilize a mixed-method approach, with
an emphasis on interviews, surveys, observations, and usage data to assess
faculty and student attitudes toward and use of the virtual cybersecurity
laboratory, and the extent of cooperation among the three institutions in the
implementation of the laboratory. Quantitative analysis of student performance
data will allow for preliminary assessment of the promise of the virtual
laboratory for achieving the expected learning outcomes related to Protect and
Defend cyber security scenarios.
