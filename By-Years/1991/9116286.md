A program has been funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division to support a theoretical study by Simons in the area
of negative-ion chemistry. The research will investigate a variety of novel
molecular anions of immediate experimental interest or whose study presents new
experimental challenges. Goals include quantitative information (e.g.,
vibrational frequencies, dissociation energies, electron binding energies)
needed by experimental groups as well as conceptual information (e.g., rates of
vibration-to-electronic energy flow and bonding in small main group clusters) of
interest to theorists. Double-Rydberg anions will continue to be studied, but
the new work will also extend into investigation of main-group clusters of
polyvalent electron deficient species, ion-molecule reaction energetics, and
comparison of anion, neutral and cation reactive potential energy surfaces.%%%
The chemistry of negative ions has been a difficult frontier in theoretical
chemistry, presenting many methodological challenges to the investigator.
Nevertheless, it is currently an active experimental field in physical chemistry
and the work done with support from this grant will enable the predictive and
interpretive assistance which theory has given to experimenters in the chemistry
of neutral species to be extended to those working with negative ions.
