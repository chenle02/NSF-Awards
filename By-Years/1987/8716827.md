This proposal is a continuation of studies of rock samples from the Galapagos
and Axial Seamount hydrothermal areas. They wish to integrate petrologic and
geochemical studies of fresh glasses, hydrothermally altered lavas and
mineralized samples recovered by dredge, ALVIN and Pisces IV with fine scale
field studies including Sea Beam, deep-tow photography, magnetic and resistivity
measurements. The PI will act as project coordinator, will collaborate on all
phases of the work, and will perform many of the geochemical analyses on the
samples. Isotopic studies will be carried out by co-investigators. The PI will
also participate on an ALVIN dive to the Southern Juan de Fuca if it is funded
by NOAA. It is hoped that the data from a dead hydrothermal system (Galapagos)
and a very young one (Axial Seamount) will further constrain the models
developed by the PI that the ore deposits are associated with hydrothermal
systems that are driven by heat from small, highly fractionated magma bodies at
depths of < 2 km beneath the seafloor.
