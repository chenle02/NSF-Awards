Observational studies using secondary data sources, such as registry, claims,
and electronic health records, are primary research tools to assess treatment
effects and predict disease outcomes in real-world settings. Observational data,
however, often present many complexities, for which substantial methods
development is needed to obtain valid results. Particularly, semi-competing
risks data arise when a terminal event (e.g., death) can prevent the observation
of a non-terminal event (e.g., cancer recurrence), but not vice versa. The
analysis of such data is further complicated with clustered outcomes, time-
varying treatment effects, confounding, and dynamic prediction. This project
will develop novel dynamic modeling and risk prediction methods with complex
observational semi-competing risks data. The project is motivated by cancer
studies. The developed methods will also be broadly applicable in other health
conditions, reliability studies, and social science, where such data commonly
arise. The investigator will integrate research and education by training
graduate students, designing advanced topic courses, and engaging
underrepresented minority students. The investigator will also develop open-
source, user-friendly software packages in R to disseminate the
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three research aims. The first aim
is to develop a copula-based, time-varying coefficient, random-effect model for
multilevel semi-competing risks data. The second aim is to develop a propensity
score matching based method to control for confounding in multilevel
observational semi-competing risks data. The impact of omitting unmeasured
confounders will be studied. The third aim is to develop a novel dynamic risk
prediction tool for non-terminal and terminal events with such data. Unlike
traditional prediction models, the developed model will utilize data on
patientsâ€™ dynamic disease progression and characteristics. The investigator will
derive large sample properties of the new estimators, conduct simulations for
evaluation, and apply the methods to analyze real-world
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
