X-ray lithography (XRL) requires a mask membrane material which is strong,
stable, radiation resistant, and easy to use in XRL systems. In European and
Japanese programs, silicon carbide membranes and complete masks have been
prepared, tested, and shown to confirm the performance expectations for this
material. No U.S. company has a capability to manufacture SiC XRL masks; the
U.S. clearly lags behind Europe and Japan in this technology. In Europe and
Japan, ordinary chemical vapor deposition at a high and low pressures (CVD and
LPCVD) has been used but these processes are neither as convenient nor as
flexible as some others which may also be suitable. The proposed project will
produce Sic membranes by three different methods: rf sputtering; plasma
activated chemical vapor deposition (PACVD); and ion beam assisted deposition
(IBAD). Thickness, stress, strength, and preliminary radiation stability
measurements will be made during Phase I.
