The research is devoted to a study of algorithms and methodologies for a variety
of large, dense matrix eigenvalue problems. The techniques to be examined are
based on the QR and Jacobi algorithms. A major part of the project is
experimentation with parallel versions of these algorithms and their various
extensions and generalizations. The experimentation will be done on an NCUBE
multiprocessor
