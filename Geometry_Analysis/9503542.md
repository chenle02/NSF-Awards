9503542 Veech The proposed research lies in the area of complex dynamical
systems. The proposer wants to evaluate certain integrals over the Teichmuller
moduli space coming from an identification of the Teichmuller space with the
space of cone metrics. Techniques for the study of the billiard in a regular
polygon are expected to play an important role. The Teichmuller moduli space
corresponds to a family of pretzel-like surfaces known as compact Riemann
surfaces (of a fixed genus); these surfaces play an important role in studying
complex-valued functions. The proposed research aims to give a geometric
description of some of these surfaces.
