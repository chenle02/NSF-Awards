*** 9550063 Barnett This proposal is for a five-year project to develop and
implement school-site support programs for K-8 teachers of mathematics. The
program uses a case study approach to help 720 teachers gain deeper insights
into student thinking and mathematical concepts. The project will prepare 120
teachers in California and Arizona to become case discussion facilitators used
in those states in coordination with SSI and USI projects. Advanced leadership
preparation for 12 leaders will prepare them to prepare other facilitators.
Cost-sharing is reported at $755,126 or 49%. ***
