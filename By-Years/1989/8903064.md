In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in robotics
between Miomir Vukobratovic of the Pupin Institute in Belgrade, the University
of Novi Sad robotics research group, and Masayoshi Tomizuka at the University of
California at Berkeley, investigators will study decentralized, non-adaptive
control of robotic manipulators. Software packages will be developed and
implemented for performance evaluation of robots, adapative and non adaptive
control, cooperating robots (two robots working together) and new robotic
control mechanisms. The problems addressed are current and of industrial
importance. This proposal provides for unique experimentation with actual robots
in addition to computer simulations. The grant links a pioneering Yugoslav
research group in robotics to U.S. experts in adaptive controls and dynamics.
This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in
Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of
matching contributions from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.
The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF
funds are involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific institution in
Yugoslavia, but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and
for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
