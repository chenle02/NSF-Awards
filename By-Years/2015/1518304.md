The goal of this program is to determine limits for the rate of atmospheric
escape from the moon Europa into Jupiter's plasma sheet. The research will
constrain important properties of Europa's atmosphere, including the presence of
H2O vented from a subsurface ocean. To accomplish its goals, the project will
model the Europa plasma sheet to determine plasma diffusion probabilities,
lifetimes and mass loading rates.

Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate
students. The work could inform future decisions on whether a dedicated space
mission to Europa is warranted.
