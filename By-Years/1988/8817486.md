In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Dunbar will study the photodissociation spectroscopy of polyatomic gas-phase
ions by visible and ultraviolet light in a mass spectrometer. This research will
lead to information concerning the photochemistry and photophysics of ions in
the absence of solvation effects. The exceptional capabilities of the Ion
Cyclotron Resonance trap with Fourier transform detection will be exploited to
trap and detect ions. Several laser sources, including a system with high
single-pulse energy, will be used to carry out single-pulse, multiple-pulse and
continuous-irradiation experiments at a variety of wavelengths. The rate of
dissociation following the laser pulse; the kinetic energies of the fragment
ions; and the competition between different fragment channels will be studied.
