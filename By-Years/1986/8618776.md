It is proposed to test the hypothesis that physical descriptions of new devices
can be synthesised from knowledge about the physical and functional
characteristics of analogous devices. The approach builds upon concepts
developed in the area of machine learning. Research on learning to categorize
objects by knowing a physical description and inferring a functional definition
has provided the insight to use examples to learn a physical description from a
functional definition. This research will concentrate on generating solutions to
defined problems in the mechanical design domain. Progress in this area could
make a significant contribution to understanding conceptual design.
