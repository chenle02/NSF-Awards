Interfacing laboratory instruments with microcomputers has become a requirement
for successful scientific investigations. The introductory, sophomore course
teaches laboratory science students to use a commercially available computer-
based data acquisition and analysis system. The experimental system includes a
PC that is configured to be a stand-alone, digital oscilloscope, spectrum
analyzer and data logger. The course introduces the student to instrumentation,
principles of of measurement, data acquisition, data analysis and communication
of results. These are expected to be applicable for the forseeable future. This
also prepares the students to participate as a team member with engineers and
computer scientists. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an
equal match for the NSF award.
