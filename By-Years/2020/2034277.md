The genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is encoded in RNA. This
award funds studies by Dr. Victoria J. DeRose at the University of Oregon in
Eugene, OR to characterize the three-dimensional structure of the viral RNA. Dr.
DeRose uses platinum compounds that chemically attach to RNA bases to determine
distances separating different parts of the RNA. Combining the distance
information with computer predictions leads to a picture of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
genome. The impact of the project on society is to identify potential target
sites in the viral genome, which provides further leads for the development of
therapeutic interventions against the COVID-19 pandemic.Results from this
project may impact the ability to understand and develop therapeutics targeting
SARS-CoV2 by providing information required to accurately model its RNA
structures. Methods developed in this project may be applicable to the next
emergent virus. Importantly, this project will support PhD students in research
that applies chemical biology to fundamental science with immediate application
to a major global crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
enable three-dimensional modeling of SARS-CoV2 RNA structures by measuring
tertiary contacts through chemical crosslinking. Platinum (II) crosslinking
reagents are used to obtain a library of RNA-RNA interactions in and between
SARS-CoV2 RNA domains. The resulting long-range connectivity maps provide
distance constraints to complement computational and NMR spectroscopic studies
for the derivation of three-dimensional models of the viral RNAs. These models
are compared to the RNA in solution and in mammalian cells, helping to expedite
small molecule targeting of RNA processes that are critical to virus
function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
