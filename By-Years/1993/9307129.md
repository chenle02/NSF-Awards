9307129 Edwards The angular distribution of Auger electrons emitted by a
molecule is a probe of the anisotropy of the molecular field. For gaseous
targets it has not been possible to discern the orientation of the molecular
frame to study these distributions. A new coincidence experiment will be
performed which will remove this problem and will enable kinetic energy spectra
to be studied in coincidence with the Auger electron and allow measurement of
the angular distribution relative to the internuclear axis. N2 will be studied
as a prototypical system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the experimental
approach.
