Through this project, three portable seismometers and seismographs are purchased
to enhance the teaching program in geology and geophysics. The equipment is used
in three different undergraduate geophysics course: Field Geophysics, where
emphasis is on planning and executing a seismic experiment; Applied Geophysics,
where emphasis is on geotechnical applications of earthquake seismology; and
Geophysics and Tectonics, where the major application is seismotectonics. This
project involves 50-100 students per year from a wide variety of disciplines
(geology, geophysics, environmental studies, engineering, physics, archeology).
In addition, the equipment is used in classroom demonstrations and discussions
in the beginning introductory classes in geoscience, which currently enroll 3000
students per year.
