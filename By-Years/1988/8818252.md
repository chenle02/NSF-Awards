This proposal on "Electron Impact Cross Sections for Modelling Radiation Damage:
The Water Molecule" between Dr. Russell Bonham of the University of Indiana at
Bloomington and Ren-guang WANG of Chengdu University of Science and Technology
is jointly sponsored by NSF and the Chinese State Educational Commission (SEDC).
The investigators propose to carry out a series of measurements of the absolute
cross sections for electron electron impact of cross sections of the water
molecule. In addition to determining collision cross sections, the researchers
propose to identify dissociation products, and determine lifetimes of
dissociation products, especially OH radicals. If successful, this research
would generate an improved cross section database for such reactions, which is
essential for modeling radiation damage in solids and biological materials, as
well as in the design of high voltage and current switching devices for use in
fusion reactors, for understanding stellar and planetary atmospheres, and for
modeling low temperature plasmas used in the industrial production of computer
chips.
