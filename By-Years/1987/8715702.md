This award supports cooperative research on molecular collision cross-sections
between S. K. Srivastava of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech and G.G.B. de
Souza and A.C.A. de Souza at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)
and Ione Iga, Lee Mu Tao and Jose Carlos Nogueira at the Universidade Federal do
Sao Carlos (UFSC) in Brazil. Srivastava has collaborated with the two groups
since 1981. The work proposed will be carried out at all three institutions with
the participation of the Brazilians at JPL and the U.S. side in Brazil.
Measurements of the cross-sections for molecules containing silicon for
ionization, dissociative attachment and polar dissociation will be carried out
at JPL. At UFRJ, photo-absorption cross-sections for inner shell exitation will
be measured while the kinetic energy spectra of the dissociation products
(charged ions) will be measured at UFSC. This work is particularly timely with
regard to plasma chemistry of silanes used in semiconductor processing. Progress
should be rapid because the apparatus is already set up and in operation.
Essential parts of the experimental work exist at each of the participating
institutions so that the collaboration is essential for the research and clearly
of mutual benefit to all three.
