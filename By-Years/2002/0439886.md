Title: Collaborative Research: Virtual Networking - Enabling Innovation in
Networks and Services

Abstract:

The Internet is one of the great technology success stories of the twentieth
century, enabling greater access to information and providing new modes of
communication among people and organizations. Unfortunately, the Internet's very
success is now creating obstacles to innovation in the networking technology
that lies at its core. In order to free the global communications infrastructure
from stagnation, the nation must find ways to enable its continuing renewal.
This planning grant is developing a case for network virtualization as a means
to enable innovation in networks and services. Virtualization allows multiple
logically independent virtual networks to share a common physical infrastructure
or substrate. This program is developing a plan for a major new research
initiative in network virtualization that includes both basic research, the
development of key technology components and the creation of an experimental
testbed, to establish feasibility and provide a context in which networking
researchers can develop innovative new network architectures and services. The
program is articulating the case for network virtualization, soliciting input
from the network research community and working with the community to develop
recommendations to NSF for a major initiative in this area.
