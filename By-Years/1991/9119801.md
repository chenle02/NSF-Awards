The general objectives of this proposal are to relate the phylogenetic trees
derived from molecular sequences from extant taxa to the geological,
paleontological, and biochemical records; to changes in the atmosphere and
biota; and to the origin of present day life. Three specific objectives are: (1)
to test theories for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus and to seek to
identify its prokaryotic sister taxon; (2) to relate phylogenetic trees to the
origin of metabolic innovations, such as the beginnings of photosynthesis,
oxygen production, methanogenesis, and sulfur reduction and oxidation; and (3)
to relate the phylogenetic tree to the fossil and geological records, through
correlation with such factors as the time of appearance of oxygen in the
atmosphere, the isotopic abundances of sulfur and carbon, the appearance of
prokaryotic fossils, and with endosymbiotic events. Specific goals are to
sequence three molecules (EF-Tu, Ef-G, and the trp B gene) from a diverse group
of twelve taxa that exhibit metabolic innovations that are essential to
understanding early events in life. Phylogenetic trees will be inferred, paying
particular attention to artifacts of sequence alignment deriving unrooted
phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences. The EF-Tu and trp B genes are
particularly useful because they have low rates of nucleotide substitution and
because EF-Tu and EF-G arose through an early gene duplication so that the tree
can be rooted using these paralogous genes. Taxa have been chosen to assist in
identifying the sister taxon to the eukaryotic nucleus, and to be useful in
asking what were the earliest types of metabolisms.
