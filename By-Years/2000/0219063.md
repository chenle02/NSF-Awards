This proposal requests support for a collaborative effort between investigators
at MIT and Rice University to integrate access to the Grid computing model with
the existing ROOT software framework, which is the de-facto standard in high
energy and nuclear physics data analyses. To deal with the large amounts of data
to be collected by the high energy physics experiments at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland, CMS and the other LHC collaborations are
adopting the Grid paradigm that aims to provide consistent and efficient access
to geographically distributed computing resources. The goal of the project is to
make Grid services available to ROOT users. This will be based on the PROOF
extension of ROOT and will be implemented in close collaboration with the ROOT
authors at CERN. Phase I will involve the initial design, development and
prototyping cycle and a detailed benchmarking and evaluation period. In phase
II, production versions will be used on existing clusters for RHIC data and CMS
simulation data.
