To address questions of zooplankton dispersal in the ocean, especially
identification of sources of Calanus finmarchicus for recruitment to Georges
Bank, we are using an integrated analysis of the population genetic character of
the copepod and the hydrographic parameters of water mass and transport patterns
in the western N. Atlantic. Our goal is to document, using biological and
physical evidence, the sources and transport patterns that influence the annual
increase of copepods on Georges Bank. For the population genetics effort, we are
determining levels of genetic variation, evidence for sub-division into
genetically distinct populations, and quantitative estimates of gene flow and
dispersal across the sampling domain. For the hydrographic effort, we are using
historical observations to provide a climatological perspective of water mass
structure and variability. The primary archives are the Atlantic Fisheries
Adjustment Program (AFAP) hydrographic database. We will also have access to the
new NMFS data (not in NODC) for comparison with the climatological analyses we
are producing.
