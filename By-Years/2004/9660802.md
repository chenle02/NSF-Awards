*** 96-60802 Lombardi This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop novel, high efficiency superfinishing polishing platens
using extrusion solid free forming technology. These platens will be composed of
engineering themoplastics reinforced with chopped carbon fibers and/or diamond
abrasives. The platens will also have varying amounts of microchanneling
throughout their structures to collect polishing swarf more efficiently compared
to conventional polishing platens. These superfinishing platens are thought to
represent a major innovation in ultraprecision polishing technology and will
find extensive commercial application in the U.S. electronics industry. ***
