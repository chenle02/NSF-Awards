9722551 Sanchez This Americas Program award requests support for a workshop on
the modification, characterization, and modeling of surfaces, to be held in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 14-26, 1997. Organizers are Dr. Juan M.
Sanchez, University of Texas, Austin, and Jose R. Galvele, Universidad Nacional
San Martin, Argentina. Support is requested for travel and related expenses for
five senior scientists, two graduate students, and a post-doctoral research
scientist. The workshop aims to provide a forum for discussion of current
developments in an important area of science and technology. The subjects to be
discussed are modeling of surfaces and interfaces; processing and fabrication of
thin films; laser and ion beams processing of surfaces and interfaces; and
tribology. In addition to the participation of the US scientists, lectures will
be presented by experts on different aspects of surface science and engineering
from Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Switzerland. ***
