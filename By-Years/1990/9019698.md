This award supports cooperative research in applied mathematics to be conducted
by Jim Douglas of Purdue University and Paulo Jorge S. Paes Leme of the
Polytechnic Institute of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The objective of the project is
to mode., analyze and design numerical methods for the simulation of multiphase
flow in a naturally fractured porous medium. The introduction of an appropriate
system of differential equations with proper boundary conditions have recently
improved various aspects of such flow. For single and two-phase flow this will
lead to a better description of the interaction between fluids in fractures and
in porous rock. A further goal of this work is to extend this approach to other
flows where the effect of compressibility, as well and the interchange of mass
between phases is considered. Also, another objective is the study of
macroscopic properties of the parameters of these models from microstructural
analysis. This award will allow continuation of a productive U.S.-Brazil
collaboration.
