9451972 Stone Grinnell College is breaking down the barrier between lecture and
laboratory in four fundamental courses that affect mathematics, computer
science, and science majors: multivariable calculus, linear algebra,
introductory programming, and introductory statistics. Instead of fixed-length
labs in a separate laboratory room, they are weaving variable-length "mini-labs"
into the fabric of lectures and discussion in a blended laboratory/classroom.
This innovation makes it possible to integrate the laboratory experience more
thoroughly with the theoretical content of the course, to strengthen the impact
of this experience through in-class analysis and discussion immediately
following the laboratory, and to position labs more flexibly, providing the
experience just when the students need it. The hardware for such in-class
integrated laboratory experiences supports quick access to software by many
student users simultaneously, an easy-to-use graphic interface providing
multiple large windows, high-quality color graphics and animations, clear
display of large data sets and matrices, and access to large application
packages. In the design for evaluating and disseminating the mini-lab materials
that they are developing, they are building on their experiences as leaders and
contributors in several projects with national impact -- projects in which they
designed, evaluated, and disseminated innovative course materials.
