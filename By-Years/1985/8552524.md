Research efforts will concentrate on that arise at the interface between energy
and water resources planning, and on water system reliability. For the first
area of concern, mathematical programs will be developed to analyze water supply
for traditional and new energy uses, with modifications to simulate imperfect
water markets in which environmental, institutional, and political
considerations will be examined. The contamination of groundwater by the
disposal of oil and gas brines will also be studied together with risk-benefit
analysis of alternative disposal methods. The reliability of urban water supply
will be examined, taking into account the probability of equipment failure,
incidents of contamination, unexpected changes in demand, etc. The techniques
based on loss-of-load expectation and frequency-duration methods used by the
electric utility industry will be adapted to the water supply case.
