The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
(NSF/CHE) and the Atmospheric Chemistry program of the Division of Atmospheric
and Geospace sciences (AGS) will support the research project of Prof. Mitchio
Okumura of California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Prof. Okumura and his
students will employ Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (CRDS) to detect free radical
intermediates formed during photooxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
The project will contribute to our understanding of the chemical reactions that
lead to photochemical smog and aerosol formation. Specific data and mechanisms
will be provided for air quality models that form the scientific basis for
policy decisions regulating anthropogenic emissions related to air pollution and
climate change. The project will provide excellent training opportunities for
graduate students in a research area of great societal importance and at the
forefront of scientific research.
