Rapidly intensifying coastal storms develop along the Mid-Atlantic States during
fall, winter and spring months. These extratropical cyclones produce gale force
winds, heavy snow, ice, and coastal storm surges with intense beach erosion and
are responsible for severe property damage and often loss of lives along the
eastern seaboard. Previous studies have improved understanding of the east coast
winter storms, but have also raised several important questions on the role of
the surface processes related to the Gulf Stream and their eddies on the genesis
of these storms.

The main objective of this research is to investigate the influence of the Gulf
Stream and its warm core eddies on east coast winter storms. This will be
achieved (1) by investigating the relative roles of factors such as position and
shape of the Gulf Stream on the development of wintertime east coast storms, and
(2) by studying the interaction between the upper level and surface forcing.

Results from this research will improve the understanding of the surface
processes involved in the genesis or redevelopment of east coast winter
cyclones. A better understanding of theses processes in relation to the Gulf
Stream meander and warm core eddy will provide an additional tool to forecasters
and help in the mitigation of disasters associated with these storms in the
eastern corridor from South Carolina to Massachusetts and the population centers
of this region.

This study will involve research experience and learning opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate students at NCSU and the research findings will be
discussed in undergraduate and graduate classes. The Principal Investigator is
the State Climatologist for North Carolina and directs the State Climate Office
of North Carolina, a Public Service / Extension center. The findings will be
transmitted to the public and non -technical audience, and will also be
available for use by federal, state and local agencies for disaster mitigation
and emergency preparedness activities.
