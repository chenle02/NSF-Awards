Scientific approaches relying on big data and on large data transfers require
unique cyberinfrastructure, called Science DMZs, to support fast and easy data
transfers and access of data. Typically, the benefits of these complicated
Science DMZs have accrued to large, well-resourced “Research-Intensive”
institutions, which compounds an already growing disparity between large and
small institutions, especially often-lesser-resourced minority serving
institutions. This also makes it much more difficult for smaller institutions
with a primarily instructional mission to expand existing research and expose
students to scientific approaches or collaborations, including those that may
rely on big data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a partnership between Duke
University, North Carolina Central University, Davidson College, and MCNC (NC’s
regional research and education network provider), this project plans the
creation of a shared Science DMZ (sS-DMZ) as a service of the North Carolina
Research and Education Network so that lesser-resourced institutions do not have
to bear all setup and maintenance costs and can instead commit their resources
to local infrastructure, their scientific researchers and pursuit of new
research grants. This project works with regional higher-ed institutions to 1)
establish community trust and shared governance responsibility necessary to
expand participation in a sS DMZ program and 2) architect the approach to build
the technical solution of operating a sS-DMZ. The resulting proposal will also
inform the feasibility of a sSDMZ in other Research and Education Networks in
the United States as an approach to reduce overall costs while increasing access
to Big Data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
