The PI is proposing to study problems which relate to both differential geometry
and general relativity. The first project concerns the fundamental problems in
asymptotically flat manifolds, particularly center of mass and constant mean
curvature foliations. The PI has proved that the notion of Hamiltonian center of
mass is well-defined in the time-slice and has constructed the constant mean
curvature foliation whose geometric center is equal to the center of mass. The
PI is proposing to further investigate the properties of center of mass in
spacetime and the time evolution of center of mass and the foliation. The
existence of constant mean curvature foliation is important for understanding
the intrinsic geometry of asymptotically flat manifolds. The PI will continue to
study the existence of the foliation even when the Hamiltonian center of mass
might not be defined. In addition, a new density theorem previously developed by
the PI shows that the solutions with harmonic asymptotics are generic in the
space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations. She intends to use the
theorem to further study the physical quantities of the solutions, such as
angular momentum. The second project deals with compact manifolds with boundary
in various ambient spaces. The PI with Damin Wu developed the rigidity results
on hemispheres for hypersurfaces with boundary in either Euclidean space or
hyperbolic space. She plans to develop the analogous rigidity theorems for
hypersurfaces with boundary in the sphere and for submanifolds in Euclidean
space with higher codimensions under several different curvature
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's projects will lead to a better
understanding of the physical quantities and their connection to geometry in
asymptotically flat manifolds, which model the isolated systems in general
relativity. In particular, the constant mean curvature foliation provides an
intrinsic coordinate system for isolated systems. The foliation will be useful
to understand the interaction of black holes in the problem of binary black
holes which is fundamental in both theoretical and numerical physics. She also
believes that the canonical coordinate system is helpful for numerists from
different groups to compare their results established under different coordinate
systems. The remainder of the PI's proposed work about compact regions with
boundary naturally arises in general relativity and in various physical
situations. It is fundamental to characterize and to classify the model cases,
such as the flat regions and spheres. The rigidity results on these geometric
objects are essential for the classification.
