This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The proposal seeks funding to investigate quantitatively the
lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) using the ELF/VLF (~5 Hz?32 kHz)
observations on the Antarctic continent. A coordinated effort will fully
characterize individual lightning strokes occurring in the northern hemisphere
while simultaneously observing the associated ELF/VLF waveforms in the
Antarctic. In addition to advancing knowledge of the ELF/VLF wave studies in
general, these observations will be used to differentiate between lightning
energy that couples to the ionosphere/magnetosphere and that which couples to
the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Simultaneous observations of LEP will be
conducted in the northern and southern hemispheres in order to: (1)
quantitatively relate the upward-coupling lightning energy and LEP production,
and (2) evaluate the conditions under which LEP occurs in both hemispheres.
Rocket-triggered lightning in Florida allow for the direct measurement of
lightning currents and will contribute to both the lightning- and LEP-related
research efforts. The Antarctic research stations are ideally situated to
perform both the long-distance ELF/VLF lightning observations and the VLF
scattering observations for LEP detection in the conjugate region, necessary for
the success of this program. Continued reliance on graduate and undergraduate
students provides a broader impact to this proposed research and firmly grounds
this effort in its educational mission.
