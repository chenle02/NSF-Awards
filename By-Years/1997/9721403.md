This project consists of a set of experiments in atoms that will provide
information critical to atomic-physics-based tests of parity nonconservation.
Precise measurements of absorption and optical rotation of laser light by
thallium atoms will be carried out to test the results of theoretical
calculations. A new optical rotation scheme will also be explored as a possible
means of enhancing the accuracy of PNC measurements. The program includes a
strong undergraduate involvement at this undergraduate institution.
