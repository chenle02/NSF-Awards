This award will support a research workshop on algebraic K-theory, jointly
organized by Professor Keith Dennis of Cornell University and Professor Claudio
Pedrini of the University of Genova, Italy. The subject matter of the proposed
workshop is algebraic K-theory and connections with and impact upon commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. More specifically, the workshop will focus on
three areas: extending the ideas of the Riemann-Roch theorems to varieties with
isolated singularities, using in the process connections with commutative
algebra, O-cycles, and geometry; applications of K-theory to the study of
arithmetic surfaces; and the study of various cohomology complexes useful in the
interplay between K-theory and algebraic geometry. The proposed workshop is
timely and affords an opportunity for leading contributors from both countries
in the field to get together and exchange information on complementary
approaches to the problems to be discussed. Consequently, it should help to
advance and unify progress in an important subfield of mathematics.
