The Graduate Engineering Education program at Cornell University will be
associated with three nationally ranked, well equipped and well staffed graduate
fields: Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Materials Science and
Engineering. Their research activities encompass a complete spectrum of studies
from semiconductor and optical materials, to devices, to software and hardware,
and finally to system integration. These activities propel the rapid
developments of computers and communication systems. Persons with doctorates in
these fields will meet extremely urgent needs for engineering faculty and
research positions. This program will build on and further enhances the ongoing
efforts in identifying, attracting and training graduate students from targeted
groups. The goals are: development of candidates; timely support of application
process for admission and financial aids; provision of a rigorous, friendly, and
supportive education environment; guidance of career goals and placements.
