The Eastern Lau Spreading Center in the Lau Basin has been chosen an an
integrated studies site by the Ridge 2000 program to understand a back-arc
spreading center from mantle to microbe. This spreading center has a continuous
gradient in the subduction influence that is characteristic of back-arc basin
basalts, and the spreading rate changes by nearly a factor of two. Hydrothermal
discovery is the driving force behind the logistic plan of this project. Two
previous cruises to the spreading center will provide bathymetry and side-scan
data. This project will use the ROV ABE to survey six target regions for water
column properties at depths that traverse the neutrally buoyant plume. ABE dives
at a height above bottom of 50m will obtain high-resolution bathymetry as well
as water column measurements. ABE dives at a height of 5-10m will then provide
complete photo coverage of the discovered vent sites.&lt;br/&gt;
