This project is concerned with finding a unifying structure theory for serial
rings with arbitrary Krull dimension. Noncommutative localization will be used
to determine this structure. These results will then be used to study broader
classes of rings. This project is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is
an algebraic structure with an addition and a multiplication defined on it.
These objects are important in many areas of mathematics as well as physics.
This particular project is concerned with finding elements which have a
multicative inverse.
