The purpose of this research is to develop a new method to deal with packed-tube
reactors where the tube to particle diameter ratio is small. Such reactors are
widely used in industrial applications for difficult to control exothermic
reaction. The PI is developing a novel approach using the microscopic
conservation equations to model the interaction of the transport processes with
the rates of reaction. The technique involves formal solution of the overall
equation combined with experimental work to provide the needed parameters. In
the final analysis, a numerical technique emerges which can be adjusted for
accuracy by changing grid sizes. Coarse grids allow fast simulations even for
large packed beds - fine grids allow particulate resolution where this is
desired.
