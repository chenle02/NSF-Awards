This proposal develops a well-known case study, the Sacco-Vanzetti trial, as a
vehicle for introducing the use of statistical language and reasoning into the
analysis of historical and political events. The project is interesting from a
theoretical perspective because of its ability to offer insights about the
source of a disagreement and the use conflicting information concerning facts
and values. Very little is known about how to conduct decision analyses in the
face of conflicting interpretations of facts: this proposal should shed some
light on this important topic. The project also is interesting from an applied
perspective because of its ability to inform historians and legal scholars about
an innovative and rigorous approach to assessing probabilities and structuring
people's thinking about events. There has been very little use of structured
probability assessment procedures to settle important legal and historical
disputes: this proposal should provide information about the use of Bayesian
assessment procedures in this context. Both the qualifications of the
investigators and the importance of these topics suggest that the results of the
project should prove to be interesting and stimulating to researchers from a
diverse set of disciplines.
