In this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project, the investigators will
acquire a new shared, multi-user instrument at the University of Minnesota â€“
Twin Cities. This instrument will enable new observations of both concentrations
and fluxes of a wide variety of chemical compounds by the project team, which
will enhance their ability to study urban air pollution, nitrogen cycling,
indoor and outdoor air quality, plant-microbe interactions, and chemical
exchange between surfaces and the atmosphere. This instrument will be used to
train a new generation of scientists and experimentalists including graduate and
undergraduate students. Additionally, the instrument will enable research
projects that include a range of outreach activities including a partnership
with the University of Minnesota Urban Outreach-Engagement Center.

The instrument to be acquired is a dual-reagent chemical ionization mass
spectrometer with high-resolution time-of-flight detection, specifically an
Aerodyne Vocus 2R CI-TOF, which is unique in that it is the only instrument that
can take field measurements with both hydronium and iodine reagent ions. The CI-
TOF will enable a broad range of chemical observational coverage and will be
used by a multidisciplinary research team with a broad range of career levels
and research projects. There are four key issues that this instrument
acquisition will address: (1) the air quality effects of urban fluxes of
volatile organic compounds; (2) the cycling and fate of reactive nitrogen in the
atmosphere of the agricultural Midwest; (3) the indoor air quality impacts of
photocatalytic and ionization purification technologies; and (4) the volatile
organic compound mediation of plant-microbe interactions and plant growth.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
