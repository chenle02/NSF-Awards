The goal of this project is to provide travel support for students to attend the
International Conference on Smart Computing, sponsored by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), to be held June 18-19, 2018 in Hong
Kong. The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental
to the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program and the smart systems aspect of the
Partnership For Innovation: Broadening Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) program,
including smart and connected communities, pervasive computing, and social
computing. This project will fund 10-15 students to attend the conference. A
selection committee will be established and will make travel award decisions.
Selection criteria include the impact of attendance on future student research,
support for women and unrepresented minorities, as well as participation from
institutions that are frequently unable to attend these conferences.

The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important
networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in
conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have
strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and
cyber-physical system experts.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
