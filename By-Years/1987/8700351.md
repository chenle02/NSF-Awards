Ricefishes constitute a group of fresh and brackish water fishes that range
from the Indian subcontinent throughout coastal Southeast Asia into China,
Japan, and across the Indo-Malayan archipelago into Sulawesi (Celebes) and the
Philippines. There are approximately 20 species of ricefishes classified in four
genera. Despite the broad use of ricefishes in experimental biology, including
the fields of genetics and embryology, and their intriguing distribution pattern
that spans many traditional biogeographic boundaries in the Indo-Australian
region, little is known about the comparative anatomy and evolutionary
relationships among the species. This research project will focus on the goal of
reconstructing the evolutionary history of ricefishes using comparative
anatomical and developmental data. Freshwater fishes will be collected in
Sulawesi (pending final permission to collect) and Madang Province, Papua New
Guinea so that we have a better understanding of fish fauna of these
geologically complex islands. A hypothesis of the distributional history of
ricefishes and their close relatives will be used as a basis for understanding
the complex evolution and distribution of the Indo- Australian biota.
