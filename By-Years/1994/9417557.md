The Small Grants for Exploratory Research is a mechanism at the National
Science Foundation to provide support for small-scale, exploratory, high-risk
research in all fields of science. Dr. Silver has found the appearance of non-
neuronal cell types in the brain following specific behaviors associated with
reproduction. She has presented evidence to suggest that this new population of
cells are mast cells of the immune system. Dr. Silver and her students will now
examine the appearance of putative mast cells by determining whether they are
migrating into the brain in response to appropriate environmental and behavioral
stimuli, or whether these cells preexist in the CNS but remain undetectable. She
will also examine the influence of behavioral and endocrine state on this
population of non-neuronal cells. To accomplish this aim, Dr. Silver and her
students will determine whether there is a sexual dimorphism in the distribution
and number of putative mast cells and define the role played by gonadal and
pituitary hormones in this phenomenon. Finally, she will use state-of-the art
anatomical techniques to characterize this population of cells as mast cells and
determine whether they possess receptors for steroid and peptide hormones. This
research is appropriate for the SGER competition since it will provide strong
preliminary work on a novel and exciting idea which opens a completely new
direction in the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology. The results could
provide a new mechanism for peptide-hormone release in the brain as well as to
establish an interrelationship between the immune and neural systems during
normally occurring behaviors.
