Bull 9726902 Many viruses infect several host species. Yet the process by which
a virus adapts to multiple hosts as well as expands to new hosts is not known.
Viruses that infect multiple species often consist of strains that are
individually adapted to some hosts, with other strains adapted to other hosts.
Introduction of a virus into a new host species may result in infections that
are not propagated in that species (e.g., human infections by Ebola, hanta, and
rabies virus) or may cause devastating epidemics (HIV in humans, seal plague in
harbor seals, canine distemper virus in lions). Virologists have long exploited
differential adaptation among alternative hosts by creating vaccines for one
species either from viruses of a closely-related species or by growing viruses
in cultured cells of another species to attenuate virulence. This study will
develop a bacteriophage system to study adaptation to a pair of host species.
Preliminary work with the phage phi X174 has revealed a one-sided adaptation:
prolonged growth on one of the hosts results in changes that inhibit growth on
the other host, but growth on the other host does not have the corresponding
effect. The proposed work will explore this host-specific adaptation under a
wide range of long term and short term conditions, monitoring fitness and
genotype changes that accompany the adaptation. The study should establish a
framework for the larger realm of host-specific adaptation and attenuation in
viruses. More generally, the work is an experimental system of the genetic basis
of adaptation that offers a level of manipulation and thoroughness of genetic
and fitness assay that has not been achieved in other systems.
