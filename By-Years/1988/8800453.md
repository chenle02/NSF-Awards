The behavior of fluids confined between solid surfaces and in micropores is
studied in a comprehensive research program consisting of three closely
coordinated parts: (1) molecular dynamics, (2) molecular theory and (3)
experimentation. The availability of supercomputers allows the simulation of
interesting and realistic fluid-solid systems and enables the researchers to
handle the complicated nonlinear integral and integrodifferential equations
characteristic of modern density functional theories of structure, stress, flow
and transport in inhomogeneous fluids. A surface force apparatus is used to
measure solvation forces (normal stresses) and squeezing flows of
microscopically confined fluids. Pressure drop techniques are used to study
Poiseuille flow in uniform microscopes, and a pulsed field gradient spin echo
NMR technique is used to study self diffusion in microporous media. A special
aspect of the research program is the close coupling and coordination of
supercomputer-aided molecular simulation, theory and experimentation. Progress
in this research area will enable better design of: wetting and spreading
agents; lubricants; stable colloidal dispersions membranes; microporous solids
for heterogeneous catalysis and electrochemistry sol-gel ceramics; molecular
sieves; and coal gasification processes. The ultimate goal of the project is to
provide the understanding and models needed to engineer special purpose
materials and processes at a molecular level.
