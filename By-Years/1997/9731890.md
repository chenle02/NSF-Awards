This research is a continuation of a program in studies of electron scattering
on simple atoms. Electron-photon coincidence measurements will be carried out to
determine the electron impact differential cross sections for excitation of the
n=2 and n=3 states in atomic hydrogen at several electron energies. This
research at an RUI institution will involve a strong component of undergraduate
participation.
