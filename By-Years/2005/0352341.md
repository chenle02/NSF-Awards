This award provides renewed support of a project aimed at developing and
disseminating novel software to be used in the processing and analysis of
optical biosensor data. The software will be used with commercial biosensing
instruments that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR), typically to study
protein binding reactions. Previous work of the PI has led to development of
software tools that significantly improve SPR data quality and reduce analysis
time. The software has been made available through a website, and several
advanced user workshops have been held. The work supported by this award will
lead to further improvement of the software. In addition to its utility in
experiments, the software will serve as a training tool to teach new users the
details of SPR data analysis, and will aid users in improving the design and
execution of SPR-based biosensor experiments. An improved website and additional
workshops will be used to disseminate information about the new software.
