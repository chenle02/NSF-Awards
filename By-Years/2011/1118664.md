This collaborative project between Tufts University and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology is researching and developing a new version of the
Scratch programming language to be called ScratchJr, designed specifically for
early childhood education (K-2). The current version of Scratch, which is widely
implemented, is intended for ages 8-16 and is not developmentally appropriate
for young children. This work will provide research-based evidence regarding
young children's abilities to use an object-oriented programming language and to
study the impact this has on the children's learning of scientific concepts and
procedures. The team will develop ScratchJr in an iterative cycle, testing it in
both in the Devtech lab at Tufts and the Eliot Pearson lab school and with a
wider network of early childhood partners. At the end of the three-year project,
ScratchJr will have been tested with approximately 350 students in K-2, 40
parents, and 58 early childhood educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ScratchJr will
have three components: 1) a developmentally appropriate interface, with both
touch screen and keyboard/mouse options; 2) an embedded library of curricular
modules with STEM content to meet federal and state mandates in early childhood
education; and 3) an on-line resource and community for early childhood
educators and parents. The research questions focus on whether ScratchJr can
help these young children learn foundational knowledge structures such as
sequencing, causality, classification, composition, symbols, patterns,
estimation, and prediction; specific content knowledge; and problem solving
skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary proposal makes
contributions to the fields of learning technologies, early childhood education
and human computer interaction. ScratchJr has the potential for broad
implementation in both formal and informal settings.
