This award supports a workshop to promote partnerships between the Department
of Education and the NSFNET mid-level networks. The meeting was conducted on
July 29, 1992, in Washington, D.C. DoEd representatives at the meeting were from
the ten Regional Education Laboratories and from the DoEd Office of Educational
Research and Improvement (OERI), which funds the Laboratories. Participants from
FARNET represented the NSFNET mid-level networks. The meeting focussed on
cooperation between the Labs and the mid-levels, particularly regarding meeting
K-12 needs.
