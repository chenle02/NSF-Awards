This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Department of
Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara: Numerical
Investigations of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, directed by Bjorn
Birnir; Combinatorial Classification of Classical Knots and Links, directed by
Kenneth Millett; Numerical Experiments and the Theory of Viscosity Solutions of
Fully Nonlinear Equations, directed by Michael Crandall; Singularities in
Nonlinear Hyperbolic Systems, directed by Thomas Sideris; and Character
Varieties for Hyperbolic Manifolds, directed by Daryl Cooper.
