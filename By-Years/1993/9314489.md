9314489 FORSYTH An earthquake swarm located teleseismically in a small region
about 300 km west of the East Pacific Rise at 18 degrees south and 116 degrees
west prompted the deployment of ocean bottom seismo meters, the side scan sonar,
and the multibeam bathymetric data will be analyzed. A comparative event
analysis of the location and mechanism of the location and mechanism of the
teleseismically recorded events will be conducted, and the stresses that would
be expected for a variety of different mechanisms will be modeled to aid in
understanding the tectonci role of this earthquake sequence.
