*** 9500116 Westermo This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will design and install several prototype, earthquake damage instrumentation
systems (based on a new technology for non-destructive evaluation) into private
and commercial structures. Strain Monitor Systems, Inc. (SMS) is developing a
unique, patented technology for the safety and damage assessment of materials.
In Phase I, prototype sensors were constructed and tested in the laboratory for
their effectiveness at discerning seismically-induced peak strains and
deflections. The results have shown that the technology will provide a simple,
inexpensive approach for safety monitoring. Phase II will expand the research to
include the complete installation and operation of systems in several different
types of structures. Systems will be designed and installed into | 1) several
private residences, 2) the Marin County, California, Civic Center, Hall of !
Justice building, and 3) the Los Angeles I-10 to I-405 Interchange bridge. The
system will be able to monitor the sensors on-demand, either automatically or
manually, and they will be used as evaluation platforms from which to
demonstrate the technology. The technology provides a simple, reliable, and
inexpensive means of assessing earthquake damage. The ability to quickly and
quantitatively discern the level of damage (and the potential for failure during
an aftershock) within a structure has good commercial potential. Such
information will reduce repair costs to a damaged structure as well as provide a
means for the quick and accurate determination of a structure's safety. ***
