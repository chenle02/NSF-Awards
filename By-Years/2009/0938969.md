This award continues support for the maintenance and expansion of the Integrated
Primate Biomaterials and Information Resource (IPBIR). IPBIR was initially
established in order to assemble, characterize and distribute high-quality DNA
samples of known provenance from as many different primate taxa as possible. In
addition the IPBIR attempts to collect and make available demographic,
geographic, behavioral and other phenotypic data associated with the submitted
biomaterials in order to facilitate research in inter and intraspecific genetic
variability, biogeographic patterns of variation and genotype / phenotype
associations.

IPBIR presently has DNA and cell lines available for 52 primate species,
representing nine of the fifteen families within the order. IPBIR has provided
samples at scaled costs to academic, non-profit, government and industrial users
for research including evolutionary studies, cross-species comparisons of
genetic elements and single nucleotide polymorphism detection. This award will
ensure the continued availability of the facility to the scientific community
and will allow IPBIR to expand the number of samples available by increasing the
number of species offered and increasing the number of individuals available
from particularly interesting species.
