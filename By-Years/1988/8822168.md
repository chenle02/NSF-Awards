Professor Nordtvedt will complete development of a theoretical framework for
analysis of second post-Newtonian order gravitation experiments and
observations. This framework will be a natural extension of the successful
parameterized post- Newtonian (PPN) metric field framework developed by the
principal investigator and others, and which led to the complete empirical
mapping of the first post-Newtonian order gravity, and will develop further
those solar system observations which have already begun to require a second
post-Newtonian order framework for their full elucidation.
