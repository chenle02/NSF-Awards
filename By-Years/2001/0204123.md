The Infinity Scholars program at Iowa Lakes Community College provides
scholarship assistance to 32 academically talented, financially needy students
enrolled full-time in computer science, computer technology, engineering and
mathematics programs. The overarching goal of the program is to increase the
number of talented, low-income students enrolled and retained in these degree
programs enabling them to enter the high technology workforce. The program
establishes and maintains an infrastructure of support services for Infinity
Scholars that includes a one credit hour Infinity Scholars Course that concludes
with the completion of a capstone project. The Infinity Scholars program focuses
on delivering a menu of educational services and learning experiences that
retain students and support a seamless transition to job placement upon degree
attainment from the community college, or transfer of students to 4-year
institutions.
