This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research Training Group in
the Study of the Role of Transition Metals in Biology. The faculty group is a
mixture of outstanding senior and junior investigators who come from a variety
of disciplinary backgrounds, but share a common interest in the role of
transition metals in biological processes. The funds will provide stipends for
graduate students and will support research participation by undergraduate
students. Funds will also defray part of the cost of the trainees' research, and
will be used to purchase specialized research equipment to be used by trainees.
Funds for an annual workshop that will bring investigators from other research
and academic institutions to the Georgia campus. In recent years, the
combination of new genetic techniques with powerful biophysical and biochemical
approaches has led to significant new knowledge of the architecture and function
of enzymes and other proteins. An important aspect of this new knowledge is an
increased appreciation of the central role played by transition metal ions in a
large variety of biological processes. It is clear that continued progress in
this area will require the training of a new generation of researchers with an
understanding of modern genetics, biochemistry, molecular biophysics and
inorganic chemistry.
