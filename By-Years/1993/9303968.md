This award provides 62% of the funds required for the acquisition of equipment
to upgrade the computing facilities in the Department of Earth and Planetary
Sciences at the University of New Mexico. The University of New Mexico is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary. The upgraded computing
system will be distributed among faculty and student stations and is designed to
provide access to a large number of research students and faculty. In addition
to educational use the system will be used in active research projects in
structural geology, sedimentology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, mineralogy, and
meteoritics, as well as dedicated applications in the operation of the
Department's analytical facilities (electron microprobe, analytical-high-
resolution electron microscope, and X- ray diffractometer).
