AST 0206390 Young

The primary goal of Dr. Eliot Young's research project is to map Titan's
evolving haze and methane distributions, a task for which the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) observations of the past decade are well suited. A second goal
is to determine the separate methane and haze distributions in Titan's
atmosphere, for which Dr. Young will use a synergistic combination of CCD-
wavelength HST and near-IR ground-based images. This goal addresses the
questions of cloud formation and methane's apparent supersaturation in Titan's
troposphere. In a similar vein, Dr. Young will also use microphysical models of
ethane cloud formation to interpret the vertical haze and methane profiles that
will be extracted from HST and Keck adaptive optics images.

A long baseline of spatially resolved imaging will directly address the
questions of how Titan's atmosphere undergoes seasonal changes. The results of
this project will provide a valuable context for the upcoming Cassini and
Huygens spacecraft missions; observational tests for existing models of cloud
and haze formation and transport; and observational evidence for the evolving
conditions in Titan's troposphere, especially with respect to the
supersaturation of methane, the conditions for convection, and the conditions
for cloud formation. ***
