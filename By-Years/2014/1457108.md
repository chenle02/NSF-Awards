Understanding how the brain controls behavior is a major goal in neuroscience.
All behavioral actions, including those as different as walking, singing, even
tiny eye movements that allow one to focus on a page of text, ultimately depend
on the activation of muscles by motor neurons in the brain. The remarkable range
of actions that animals are capable of begs the question: how different are the
motor neurons underlying different behaviors? One strategy for answering this is
to compare neurons driving different behaviors. Modern bony fishes are champions
in the ability to generate vocalizations that exhibit rapid, precisely timed
sound pulses. The studies proposed here use fish as model systems to compare
vocal motor neuron populations to those that pattern non-vocal motor behaviors:
locomotion that depends on fin movement, and electric signaling generated by
modified muscle cells that are used by fish for communication and active sensing
of the aquatic environment. The project will determine the extent to which
molecular, genetic and physiological properties are shared in motor neurons
driving these behaviors that differ in their temporal patterning, for example,
fast (vocal and electric) vs. slow (fin movement). The Principal Investigator
will continue to recruit a talented population of men and women students from
diverse backgrounds, including underrepresented minorities, and train them in
behavioral, neural, and molecular levels of analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
specifically, molecular, genetic and neurophysiological methods in several model
systems among fishes will be used to address the following questions: 1) Can
similarities in the neurophysiological patterning of vocal motor behavior
between distantly related species be explained by a similar set of gene products
that underlies a shared set of vocal motor neuron characters (Aim 1)? 2) Do
vocal motor neurons employ a "molecular toolkit" distinct from that of non-vocal
motor neurons exhibiting lower degrees of synchrony and temporal precision, in
this case the pectoral motor system for locomotion (Aim 2)? 3) Do vocal motor
neurons employ a shared "molecular toolkit" with that of non-vocal motor neurons
exhibiting comparable degrees of synchronicity, temporal precision and rapid
firing, in this case the electromotor system that is used for active sensing of
objects in the aquatic environment (Aim 3)? By complementing large-scale gene
expression studies with neuro-pharmacological validation, these aims will
identify how patterns of gene expression determine neurobiological and
behavioral phenotypes, in this case those determining divergent motor functions.
