An Atomic Force Microscope with a Scanning Tunneling head and a Surface Force
Apparatus will be utilized to study polymer interfaces at Lehigh University's
new Polymer Interface Center. These instruments have the respective ability to
image surfaces on the nanometer scale and to measure the forces of interaction
between surfaces. They are essential complements to existing microscopic and
spectroscopic instrumentation in the ongoing and planned research at Lehigh on
well-defined model polymer/substrate systems. The polymer/substrate interface
will be characterized, and the adsorption/desorption of polymers on the
substrate and the relationship between polymer morphology and the physical and
chemical properties of the substrate surface will be studied. In addition, these
instruments will enable direct measurement of the force of interaction between
colloidal particles and enhance research in other multidisciplinary materials-
related areas such as bioseparation, catalysis, and microelectronic packaging.
Placing them in the Polymer Interface Center will ensure that they will be
utilized by a wide variety of research groups both at Lehigh and from industry.
