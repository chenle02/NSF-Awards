The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) proposes to organize and host
an international workshop entitled in "Directed Self-Assembly and Self-
Organization" on the UCSB campus January 12-14, 2004. Our organizational
sponsoring partner on the Japanese side is The Ministry of Education, Culture,
Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). The workshop co-chairs will be Professor
Masatsugu Shimomura of Hokkaido University and Professor Matthew Tirrell of the
University of California, Santa Barbara. This meeting is the second in a
workshop series on nanotechnology; the first, on in "Tools and Metrology for
Nanotechnology", was held at Cornell University January 23-24,
2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of key questions for debate and discussion for
this workshop is given in the body of the proposal. The overall objective is to
bring a sharp focus on the scientific and technological possibilities for self-
assembly as a route to realizable nanotechnologies. Self-assembly has thus far
produced many interesting structures in the laboratory and considerable promise
for manufacturing useful nanostructured products. However, this promise will
remain unfilled unless we learn to diversify, accelerate, control and scale-up
self-assembly processes.&lt;br/&gt;
