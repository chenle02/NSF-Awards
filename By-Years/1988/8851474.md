The Department of Biology is making IBM-compatible microcomputers available to
its students at all levels of the Ecology curriculum. The inadequate computer
hardware and software within the department previously available for student use
is being augmented by laptop microcomputers to collect and analysis data both in
the field and in the laboratory; external hard drives to provide storage space
for data; professional-level statistical software packages; dot-matrix printers;
a plotter; and a video projection system. The courses in which computers are
having the greatest immediate impact are "Computers in Biology" and "Ecology",
both of which are intermediate-level courses, and "Population Biology", an
advanced-level seminar course that includes an independent research project.
Other courses that benefit from the equipment include "Introductory Biology",
"Limnology", and advanced-level research oriented courses. The computer
expertise developing in the department, together with a strong university
commitment to computing, justify the development of a biology curriculum in
which computers play an important role. The grantee institution is matching the
NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
