This is a request for block international travel funds for the 30th IEEE
Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) to be held in Brighton, England from
December 11-13, 1991. The CDC is one of the world's largest and most important
conferences on control theory and applications. The Brighton location will be
only the second time the CDC has been held outside the United States. The funds
will be instrumental in improving the technical success of the conference by
enabling participation of sufficient numbers of key U.S. authors.
