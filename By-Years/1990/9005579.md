Dr. Anderson proposes to use X-ray crystallography to determine the three-
dimensional structure of the restriction endonuclease R-PvuII from two crystal
forms of the free enzyme already in hand that diffract X-rays to 2.5 A. He will
collect data, and then screen a number of heavy atom reagents to find several
isomorphous derivative crystals. Derivative data will be used in multiple
isomorphous replacement or with other published techniques to calculate phases
and produce an initial electron density map. Conventional methods will be used
to fit a model of R-PvuII into the map and to refine the structure. Cocrystals
of R-Pvull will be grown with oligodeoxynucleotides carrying its recognition
site, to solve the structure of the protein-DNA complex. Dr. Anderson will
crystallize and determine the structure of catalytic and binding mutants of
R-PvuII, provided by the collaborators, both in the presence and the absence of
DNA. The proposed work will permit a detailed study of the structure-function
relationship of R-PvuII, and will contribute significantly to the understanding
of R-PvuII, of restriction enzymes, and of protein-DNA interactions.
