and retain talented undergraduate students for careers in science and
engineering. This project will provide an environment for minority undergraduate
students to experience research in Applied Computer Science. Students will be
recruited from institutions that lack graduate programs in Computer Science. The
two major components of the project are a summer research project and a one day
seminar during the following academic year. During the summer, the participants
will engage in well-defined, ongoing research projects. By working in small
groups, they will have the opportunity to interact closely with experienced
faculty researchers and graduate students. The participants will be encouraged
to continue their studies and pursue research careers in Computer Science. Each
group will write a research paper describing the work completed during the
summer research project. These papers will be presented in a seminar during the
following academic year. u search experience is an effective method to attract
