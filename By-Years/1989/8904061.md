Solution transport processes-- including pressure solution and crack healing--
are important ways in which rocks may deform and change pore structure and
connectivity. However, despite clear field evidence that solution-transfer
deformation is widespread in the earth, major uncertainties remain in specifying
the driving forces, the models, and the appropriate material constants. A
detailed study will be made of the mechanisms and kinetics of pressure solution
and crack healing under load in simple aqueous/quartz and brine/halite
environments. Densification experiments on porous quartz aggregates will be
continued. The evolution of grain size will be measured during the experiments.
Permeability reduction experiments will be conducted on pre-cracked samples of
Sioux quartzite. Finally, the permeability of a suite of rocks containing
stylolites will be measured to begin an investigation of the correlation of
permeability with localization of deformation. This work should significantly
enhance our understanding of how permeability changes in the earth's crust.
