Abstract

Award: DMS-0603892 Principal Investigator: Eugene M. Lerman

Lerman proposes to carry out three interrelated projects on the interface of
geometry topology and category theory. The first project aims to classify
singular symplectic toric varieties. This necessitates a development of a
satisfactory set-up for such spaces. The second project studies periodic orbits
of Hamiltonian systems on orbifolds and on symplectic stratified spaces. The
third project studies infinite dimensional Lie 2-groups arising as symmetries of
orbifolds.

The projects contribute to the mathematics underpinning classical mechanics, the
science governing the motion of satellites and the like. They also have links
with important theoretical problems of high energy physics, higher gauge theory
in particular.
