9406971 Rodl This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research in Probabilistic
Combinatorics is between Drs. Vojtech Rodl and Dwight Duffus of Emory University
and Drs. Michal Karonski, Tomasz Luczak, and Andrzej Rucinski of the Institute
of the Department of Discrete Mathematics of Adam Mickiewicz University in
Poznan. The problems addressed in this research belong to probabilistic
combinatorics. They either deal with properties of random structures or are
expected to be solved by probabilistic means. The Polish investigators are
experts in the theory of random graphs, which, besides its own interest,
provides powerful tools for solving many hard problems. Specifically, the
researchers will examine: (1) extremal and Ramsey type properties of random
structures; (2) probabilistic approach to some extremal and Ramsey-type
problems; (3) matchings in random graphs and hypergraphs; (4) phase transition
in graph processes with bounded maximum degree; and (5) enumeration of order
preserving maps. This proposed research in mathematics and computer science
fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts
in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
