The research issues to be addressed include: study of mesh design
methodologies; recognition of geometric features of workpiece and tooling;
decomposition of two-dimensional domains into regions bounded by four curves;
suitability of the hierarchical refinement model of design for mesh design
tasks; research of geometric data structures for finite element systems; and
automated smoothing of evolving boundaries. As the outcome of this
investigation, a novel technology for automated two-dimensional metal forming
modeling should result. This technology will contribute to the transformation of
non-linear Lagrangian finite element analysis from a research analysis method to
an engineering design tool. Furthermore, the availability of automated finite
element analysis could enable the integration of process design and analysis
systems. Design could be readily evaluated through modeling, and modeling
results fed back to the design system for redesign. Finally, the study and
understanding of the way in which humans perceive and understand shape has
important implications in the automation of those design activities that, like
mechanical design, are dominated by geometric reasoning.
