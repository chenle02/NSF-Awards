The investigator will study several enumerative and combinatorial
problems&lt;br/&gt;in algebraic geometry. In particular, she will study Gromov-
Witten theory&lt;br/&gt;of Deligne-Mumford stacks with applications to classical
enumerative&lt;br/&gt;geometry, higher-dimensional analogues of the moduli space
of curves, and&lt;br/&gt;(equivariant) cohomology and (equivariant) Schubert
calculus of Hessenberg&lt;br/&gt;varieties and affine Grassmannians. These are
distinct projects, but are&lt;br/&gt;similar in that each of the spaces involved
has a rich combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;structure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a fundamental problem in algebraic
geometry to understand objects&lt;br/&gt;satisfying certain geometric criteria,
often naturally parametrized by an &lt;br/&gt;algebraic scheme or stack. Such
moduli and parameter spaces are at the &lt;br/&gt;forefront of mathematical and
scientific research. Enumerative and &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial problems which
arise are of particular excitement as part of&lt;br/&gt;a collision of the
fields of algebraic geometry, algebraic combinatorics, &lt;br/&gt;symplectic
geometry, and representation theory, as well as topology and
&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;
