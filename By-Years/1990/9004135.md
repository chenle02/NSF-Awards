This award provides one-half the funds required to acquire three Global
Positioning System (GPS) receivers whose use will be shared between scientists
at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University and the
University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO). Columbia will provide the remaining
funds needed for the purchase of the instruments and UNAVCO will provide
maintenance and repair services for the instrument packages. The GPS receivers
are capable of rapid and accurate geodetic measurements with errors of less than
a centimeter over baselines of hundreds of kilometers and will be used in a
variety of research projects related to plate tectonics and earthquake studies.
