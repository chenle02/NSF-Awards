This grant is to give partial support to convene the 2017 Week of the Arctic in
Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. This event will be a gathering of researchers, policy
makers, and stakeholders from around the Arctic and the world, to share their
observations and intentions, their understandings, and their challenges so that
we may make greater scientific advances, more informed decisions, and better use
limited research and planning resources. This event will occur at the time when
the chairmanship of the international Arctic Council changes from the US to
Finland and will provide an appropriate opportunity to profile the many products
and accomplishments attained under US chairmanship, while planning and engaging
in the coordination of future research efforts in this dynamic region of the
planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be dozens of activities associated with
this meeting, and each will advance some aspect of Arctic science, engineering,
technology and/or policy. The event is designed to optimize interpersonal
communications that are often the essential precursor to new collaborations, new
positions for students, and greater understanding for
all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic Council Ministerial draws ministerial level
officials, and consequently a very large press contingent. This effort will take
full advantage of this access to international journalists to maximize outreach
and promote science further that documents the importance of the Arctic
