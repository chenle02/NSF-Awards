9320559 YOUNG This project seeks to add to our understanding of regime
formation in international society by focusing on the prenegociation stages of
international relations in the Arctic. The prenegociation stage covers the
process through which issues initially find their way into international
political agendas, are considered in international forums, and rise to
prominence in international negociations. The project involves a detailed
analysis of four current cases: (1) The Arctic Environmental Protection
Strategy, (2) The Euro-Arctic Barents Region, (3) The Arctic Council, and (4)
the Bering Sea Region. The study will examine a series of hypotheses about the
forces at work in the prenegociation stages, including the influence of non-
state actors and the role of individual leaders. ***
