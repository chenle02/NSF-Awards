The objective of this research is to address intrinsic alignment systematics in
weak lensing studies, which are used along with galaxy surveys to assess the
large-scale mass distribution of the universe (including dark matter). The
results will be important in the future for studies by the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST). Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate
student, engaging in research projects that incorporate women in physics and
summer students from high schools, and workshop talks for high school teachers
and general public talks on cosmology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will
addresses systematic errors that arise from a variety of intrinsic alignments in
weak lensing studies. The aim is to develop and analyze 2-pt and 3-pt intrinsic
alignment measures from theory, simulations, and from actual measurements from
the CFHTLenS and VIPERS galaxy surveys.
