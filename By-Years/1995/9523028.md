9523028 Wu This project is to study the local heterogeneities in
polycrystalline materials and their effect on crack initiation. In particular,
certain non-equilibrium grain boundary structures and morphologies and their
associated nucleation stresses and resulting crack characteristics will be
investigated. There exists some evidence that these non-equilibrium grain
boundaries are found in submicron-grained and nanocrystalline materials. The
results will be generally applicable to metallic systems and to certain ceramic
materials. ***
