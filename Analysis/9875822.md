Abstract Ge

The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early development of
academic faculty as both educators and researchers. The Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that provides for the
support of junior faculty within the context of their overall career
development. It combines in a single program the support of quality research and
education in the broadest sense and the full participation of those
traditionally underrepresented in sciences and engineering. This program
enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development
of full, balanced academic careers.
