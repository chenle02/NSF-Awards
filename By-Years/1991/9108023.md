Control theories and techniques have been successfully applied in many areas
such as aerospace engineering, navigation, and manufacturing. However, only
recently their applications to civil engineering structures such as buildings
and bridges for their safety and confort design in seismic or wind conditions
have been seriously pursued. The potential and future research needs for such
applications were the focal points of discussion during a recent National
Workshop on Structural Control Research, held at the University of Southern
California (USC) in October, 1990. One essential component of the structural
control technology is that related to new sensors, actuators, and signal
processing which was not covered during the USC Workshop. These aspects hold the
key to the successful implementation of structural control from both
technological and practical considerations that represent a rapidly evolving
field of cross-disciplinary nature. This Workshop will bring together a number
of key academic and industry researchers active in structural control and
behavior, sensors and actuator technology, and signal processing to identify
those research directions which offer the greatest potential impact on
structural performance. This effort will provide a critical component of the
technical basis required for the development and implementation of control
technology in providing the design safety of new structures. It will also
provide valuable insights on the potential use of control technology in the
upgrading and rehabilitation of vulnerable existing structures which are exposed
to the threat of natural hazards.
