This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Richard G. Weiss at Georgetown University. The conversion of ordered
assemblies of liquid-crystalline and related molecules to gels and chiral hollow
cylinders will be studied. The structural and dynamic features of the component
molecules will be correlated with the behavior of their aggregates in order to
identify the salient properties responsible for the most efficient gelator
molecules and the most stable hollow cylinders. Stabilization of unusual
molecular assemblies will be attempted with metals and by polymerization. %%%
The ability of some molecules to form well defined ordered assemblies in
solution will be examined. The goal of the research is to identify the
requirements for transforming single molecules which form ordered assemblies
into devices which are capable of performing specific tasks on molecular and
macromolecular scales. The results from this study should be useful in a wide
range of applications.
