In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry Program, Stratt will develop an analytical statistical
mechanical method suitable for treating electronic-structure-in-condensed-phase
problems. Between the well-studied extremes of the electronic structure of small
molecules and the band structure of pure crystalline solids, lie a large number
of chemical systems for which the electronic properties can only be understood
in terms of the richness of behavior possible for a condensed phase. Examples of
this diversity range from solvent-induced spectral shifts to the phase
transitions observed in crystals of mixed-valence complexes; from the metal-
insulator transitions of simple expanded liquid metals to the wide variety of
liquid structures and electronic characteristics seen in liquid semiconductors.
With the aid of newly developed path integral methods and analytical liquid
theories, models for each of these highly quantum mechanical problems can be
formulated and solved as if they were exercises in classical statistical
mechanics. Theplan is to use the insights so derived to enable a rethinking of
current gas-phase-based attitudes towards intermolecular interactions and the
macroscopic phenomena they can lead to.
