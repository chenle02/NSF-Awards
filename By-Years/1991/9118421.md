The objective of the proposed analytical research is to develop a technical
basis for predicting the limit of dynamic stability of drill bits used in
various earth boring operations. The investigation will incorporate the combined
effects of axial, torsional and lateral modes in the analysis of bit motion and
in the determination of the limit of dynamic stability. A study of the effects
of mode coupling will show which modes of vibration are critical and lead to
practical methods of changing the structural stability of the drilling system.
The knowledge gained from this research will provide a technical guidance for
reducing drillstring failures and increasing penetration rate.
