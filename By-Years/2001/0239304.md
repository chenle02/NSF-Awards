The focus of this research involves a combination of experimental and
computational projects designed to give deeper understanding of basic organic
chemical reactions. The experimental projects include the synthesis of a
semibullvalene that is predicted to be bishomoaromatic, a study of the
stereochemistry of the ring opening of 1,2-dimethyl-3,3-(bistrimethylsilyl)
cyclopropane, and the matrix isolation and IR spectroscopy of
cyclopentanone-2,5-diyl. Among the proposed computational projects are
electronic structure calculations on the mechanism of the reaction of
hexafluorcyclopropane with halogens, the existence of cooperative and
competitive substituent effects in [1,5]sigmatropic shifts, and the effects that
determine whether reductive elimination of methane occurs with or without ligand
loss from a variety of transition metal complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Weston T. Borden of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Washington. Professor Borden will focus his work on three
experimental and eight computational projects in the areas of organic synthesis,
organic and inorganic reaction mechanisms and computational chemistry. In
addition to providing training for graduate students and postdoctorals, the
project will have the broader impact of resulting in exchanges of knowledge
between the Borden group and the research groups of many collaborators,
including those in the chemistry faculty at Seattle Pacific University (SPU).
The interaction at SPU will also enrich the research experience of
undergraduates at that institution.&lt;br/&gt;
