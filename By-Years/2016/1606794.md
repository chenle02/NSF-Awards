NSF has made an award in support of student, junior faculty and speaker travel
to the ASME 2016 NanoEngineering for Medicine and Biology Conference (NENB)
being held in Houston, TX, Feb. 21-24, 2016. The goal of the conference is to
bring together leading experts in bioengineering, nanomaterials, biology and
medicine to review recent advances in nanoengineering and nanomedicine,
including new experimental methods, synthetic approaches, modeling and
computational efforts, analyses and innovative methodologies for sensing,
quantifying, diagnosing and treating medical disorders using nanoengineering
approaches. The program is organized under 5 tracks: Nano-imaging, Nanoparticle-
based delivery, Nano and Microfluidics, Modeling of nano-phenomenon, and Nano-
materials design. The goal of the conference is well matched to programs
supported by Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems
(CBET) and Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI), which is
particularly focused on the development of new technologies.
