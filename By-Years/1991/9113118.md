In certain invertebrate model systems which contain large, recognizable nerve
cells, the individual nerve cells are known to control behavior by the release
of specific neurochemical transmitters. In one of these model systems, the brain
of the leech, the neurotransmitter serotonin directly activates the organs of
ingestion. These effector neurons which regulate feeding behavior are in turn
controlled by the activity of two classes of sensory cells. Sensory cells that
detect potential prey organisms excite the neurons to fire and release
serotonin. Sensory cells that respond to distension of the body resulting from a
meal both inhibit the feeding neurons from firing and terminate feeding. In this
award Dr. Charles Lent will investigate the relationship betwen feeding behavior
and neuronal firing patterns; his studies will also use specific nerve cell
staining and sensitive chemical assays to describe the anatomy and transmitters
of sensory cells that control the activity and serotonin levels in the large
nerve cells that are responsible for feeding. Because the behavioral states of
hunger and satiation are separable, these studies will be able to demonstrate
the way in which communication between nerve cells regulates the amount of
transmitter that expresses either one or the other of these two behavioral
states. This research will contribute fundamental knowledge about the
neurochemical organization and control of feeding behavior.
