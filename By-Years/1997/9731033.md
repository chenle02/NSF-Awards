9731033 Goldstein This proposal requests funds for a petrological and
geochemical study of a suite of basaltic samples collected from the Kolbeinsey
Ridge north of Iceland. The sample suite to be studied was obtained by dredging
at a very high spatial resolution. The primary purpose of this study will be to
determine the Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions of these samples, with He
isotopes determined for a subset of the samples. These data will be used to
investigate mantle flow and mixing processes that form the oceanic crust in this
region and to examine the nature of ridge-hotspot interactions.
