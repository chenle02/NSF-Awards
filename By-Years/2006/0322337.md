0322337&lt;br/&gt;Lopez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE), will take place in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, June 21-30,
2004, on the topic of micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS). Organized by Dr.
Daniel Lopez of Bell Labs, the institute will involve approximately 40 students,
10 Lecturers, and 30 researchers in the field from the U.S. and Latin America.
The main goal is to provide an opportunity to advance knowledge and
understanding in the MEMS area. The PASI will include tutorials, specialized
lectures, hands-on laboratory work, and poster sessions. PASI proceedings and
videotapes of the lectures will be made available to different organizations
participating in the event. It is expected that the activity will stimulate
future developments and collaborations in this important and promising field.
