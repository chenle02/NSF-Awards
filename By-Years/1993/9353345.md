This planning grant will lead to a full proposal from Illinois State University
to support systemic change in science education in the region. The planning
grant brings together representatives from the schools, universities,
Educational Service Centers, and others who have experience or interest in local
school change. This team makes on-site visits to successful schools and uses
consultants in school change and science education to help formulate a plan for
a broader project. A one-week summer symposium is used to design strategies to
support improvements in science education. The report generated by the symposium
is intended to be used as a basis of a full proposal and for local systems to
develop system change plans for their schools. The planning grant begins the
examination and compilation of strategies that will lead to a Teacher
Enhancement proposal. The cost sharing is estimated at 17%
