The objective of this program is to use the advanced preparation techniques of
aerogel catalysts to prepare different multicomponent catalytic systems for
partial oxidation of methane. The major advantages of this preparation procedure
are that metallic components can be combined in any proportions and that it
produces high surface area and highly porous materials. The experimental program
will be directed towards the preparation, characterization, and testing of these
aerogel catalysts during partial oxidation and oxidative decoupling of methane.
The information gathered will be used to design a catalytic system that would
optimize the partial oxidation of methane.
