Abigail Kopec is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education
at the University of California, San Diego. Kopec will lead searches for
signatures of particulate dark matter and neutrinos in the new XENONnT
experiment, and investigate the sensitivity of a single-phase liquid xenon time
projection chamber (TPC) to single-electron signals to enhance the detectorâ€™s
low-energy sensitivity. As a key part of the program, Kopec will mentor
undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed projects and participate in
department activities to promote a positive inclusive culture and plans to take
on leadership roles mentoring newer members within the XENON Collaboration.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particle nature of dark matter remains one of the
greatest mysteries in physics today. The study of neutrino properties has
provided clear evidence that the Standard Model is incomplete, and the first
confirmed particle dark matter detections would represent a signature of physics
beyond the Standard Model. The program to enhance the the XENONnT TPC low-energy
measurements holds the potential for significant impact in both of these areas,
including increased sensitivity to lower-mass weakly interacting massive-
particle dark matter, and harnessing solar neutrinos to provide the potential
first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nuclear scattering on xenon
atoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
