The Net Scout project is an Internet resource location and technology service
oriented primarily to the higher education community. It currently provides four
services that are used by thousands of faculty, staff, and students in higher
education: the Scout Report, Net Happenings, the Scout Toolkit, and the KIDS
Report. The Scout Report is a weekly electronic newsletter summarizing the best
new Internet resources of use to higher education. Net Happenings is an
electronic service that provides immediate notification of 50-70 Internet
announcements each day via a mailing list, a newsgroup, and a Web site. The
Scout Toolkit summarizes the best Internet search services and other tools
needed by researchers and educators to use the Internet effectively. The KIDS
Report is a biweekly newsletter written by students in elementary, middle, and
high school classrooms who select and describe the Web sites they find the most
interesting and useful. The Net Scout project will continue and expand these
services in two ways: First, to provide additional services, including
publication of three biweekly Scout Reports produced by specialists in the
specific areas of Science and Engineering, Social Sciences, and Business and
Economics, and, second, to implement new tools which aid in the location of
Internet resources in a specific subject area. A prototype service will be built
using as its initial base the three year archive of the highly selective
resources that have been included in the Scout Report. Specialized authenticated
collections of quality resources at higher education institutions will also be
identified and included in the prototype. http://wwwscout.cs.wisc.edu/
