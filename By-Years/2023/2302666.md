By combining the work of Indigenous communities, linguists, biologists, and
journalists, this project documents an Indigenous language, specifically as it
relates to local wild and cultivated plants, and the traditional and modern
knowledge related to their use. The project documents (1) local plant names,
descriptions, uses, and digital photos; (2) traditional and modern uses of the
local plants in cooking, decoration, construction, tool creation, rituals, and
medicine through videos and narratives; and (3) the current community-led eco-
friendly crop revitalization effort to repair damage stemming from the effects
of colonization on the land. The project is grounded in the knowledge of the
Indigenous people and the organization of labor and knowledge for collective
benefit. It also trains a number of student assistants, contributing to the
development of the next generation of language researchers.

Indigenous communities' knowledge is crucial to restoring the wellbeing of the
planet. Robust documentation of the wealth of multi-generational community
knowledge of local plants enriches existing understanding of this topic, as well
as continuing the documentation efforts an understudied language which serves as
the reservoir for such knowledge. Documentation of the language facilitates
comparative linguistic work, informing our theoretical understanding of
Indigenous languages and cross-linguistic studies. This project also develops a
comprehensive illustrated field guide and produces a video documentary for
general public and academic use on practices involving plant knowledge and
traditional uses. Furthermore, the project produces short videos for use in
teaching, a lesson plan for language workshops based on the plants and their
traditional use, and other pedagogical materials. This award is made as part of
a funding partnership between the National Science Foundation and the National
Endowment for the Humanities for the NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure â€“ NEH
Documenting Endangered Languages Program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
