An oceanography collection providing access to nearly 50 years of shipboard
data, integrating historical documents, samples, research publications, and maps
from global databases is being developed into a searchable digital library. This
project uses modern technologies to bridge the gap between content-related, but
disparate holdings within libraries, data archives, and historical archives to
create a digital library that facilitates both research and learning. The
digital library is being presented to the user as an in Ocean Exploration Center
supporting inquiry into the history of ocean exploration as well as
oceanographic databases. From a global map of approximately 3000 oceanographic
cruises, users are able to identify&lt;br/&gt;and retrieve relevant materials
appropriate to their interest and educational level, from photographs
and&lt;br/&gt;diaries to scientific papers and data. The maps and archival
images provide K-12 and college educators with content and tools to communicate
the excitement of oceanographic discovery. At the same time, students and
researchers are able to use the site to locate and download data for further
analysis and research.&lt;br/&gt;The project is serving as a model for other
fields by merging materials previously segregated and&lt;br/&gt;accessible only
to specialists and making them available to a broad audience.
