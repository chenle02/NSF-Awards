The objective of this proposal is to develop a modified class E switching-mode
radio frequency power amplifier to be utilized as the power invertor cell of
distributed power conversion systems. Equations describing class E invertor
operating parameters will be developed and solved using a computer symbolic
manipulation program to achieve class E invertor circuit configurations that
provide extremely high efficiency and output voltage independent of load without
inherently requiring feedback control. The determined circuit configurations
will be used to construct and evaluate prototype class E power invertor cells.
Measurements of input power, output power and voltage, efficiency and output
harmonic content will be made to determine the feasibility of utilizing this
radio frequency circuit design technique in practical power conversion systems
with reactive and/or utility interaction loads. Such invertor cells may be used
to realize distributed power conversion systems that are smaller, lighter, and
operate with increased overall efficiency and greater reliability at reduced
cost.
