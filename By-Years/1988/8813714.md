The objective of this project is to develop the methodology for determining the
overall distribution coefficients and the extent of extraction necessary for
supercritical extraction of a complex chemical mixture of environmental
pollutants from water. These parameters will be determined as a function of the
type of solvent, temperature, and pressure in terms of the toxicological indices
obtained via cell culture bioassays. The investigator plans to study the use of
carbon dioxide and other supercritical solvents with or without entrainers for
extraction of a complex mixture of toxic organic contaminants from water and
determine an overall distribution coefficient as well as the extent of
extraction necessary for treatment of water to achieve acceptably safe levels of
contaminants in water destined for human consumption, considering toxic indices
for genetoxicity and carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity and neurocarcinogenesis,
prenatal toxicity and birth defects. The investigator will base the research on
model mixture of water contaminated with a wood preservative (creosote). The
distribution coefficients and the extent of extraction will be determined as a
function of temperature and pressure in a single equilibrium stage extractor.
The research being conducted in this project is directed toward a promising new
technology to complement those currently available for treatment of water
contaminated by organic substances. It offers promise of reduction in the volume
of residual contaminated material that is produced during treatment of water by
conventional procedures and processes now used.
