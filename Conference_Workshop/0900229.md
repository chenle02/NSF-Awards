A Conference on Topology and Geometry of Knots will be held at Oklahoma State
University on March 20-21, 2009. Twelve speakers, including four established
researchers, will give presentations related to colored Jones polynomial,
sutured Floer homology, knot Floer homology, Heegaard Floer homology, and
Khovanov homology and applications of topological quantum field theory to low
dimensional topology.

The main goal of the conference is to explore deep connections among various
geometric and topological constructions from mathematics and physics. The
participants will be exposed to a wide range of methods and results from
different fields of investigation. The conference also will provide early career
researchers the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians.
