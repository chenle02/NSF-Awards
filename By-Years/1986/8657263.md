Picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses will be used to study ultrafast optical
and electronic processes in semiconductors. Three projects will be supported by
the PYI program. Nucleation processes and superheating of Si after illumination
with a ps high power laser pulse will be studied by time-resolved spectroscopy
techniques. Hot carrier relaxation in the extended states, carrier trapping
across the mobility edge and thermalization in the bandtail states will be
investigated by femtosecond spectroscopy in a-Si:H and related alloys.
Picosecond electrical pulses will be produced using the Auston switch
technology. The transient response of III-V semiconductor superlattices to these
pulses will be investigated theoretically. Emphasis will be put on the
variations of the optical properties.
