The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year for four years, thereby
increasing the number of individuals with associate degrees as well as
increasing the number of students who are transferring to upper division
institutions and/or directly entering the workforce. The project is being
implemented at five participating Miami Dade College campuses (Wolfson, North,
Inter American, Kendall, and Homestead) and is building on lessons learned from
previous CSEMS grants.

Faculty members are providing a key factor in helping the scholars achieve their
goals through a high-touch and high-tech mentoring and tutoring process. They
are meeting with the students at least twice a month where they are helping them
develop their individual Comprehensive Educational Plan, assessing their
academic progress that includes feedback from the students' instructors, and
helping the students implement more effective learning strategies. Alumni Club
members consisting of past CSEMS scholars are serving as role models and
providing assistance in motivating the students by sharing their experiences and
providing an opportunity for the scholars to network with industrial personnel.

The scholars are engaging in hands-on, practical experiences, which include
participating in the STEM Club; creating an Internet-based personal journal;
participating in conferences and meetings of professional and scientific
associations; internships; and field trips to industry and academic
institutions. A broad coalition of agencies and organizations are participating
in an effort to provide support for the scholars. The project is targeting women
and underrepresented classes of students.
