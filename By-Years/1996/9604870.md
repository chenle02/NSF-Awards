Chemosensory receptor cells detect molecules and ions in the environment as a
signal different from the background. There are two fundamental problems
olfactory systems face. First, when the environment changes rapidly, how does
the chemosensory system avoid breakdown in its detecting capability? Second, how
do olfactory membranes that detect these chemicals function over time when the
membranes themselves are constantly renewed? This project uses the antennae of
an intertidal crab as a novel model system to investigate both of these
important questions, using a combination of physiological and microscopic
techniques. Experiments are designed to determine how ion levels are regulated
in the fluid bathing the chemosensory membranes to maintain suitable conditions
for olfactory function. Morphological studies will define how these membranes
react by growth or regeneration to the challenge of exposure to very different
salinities. The environmental change can range between seawater and freshwater
in the tidal estuaries in which these crabs live, and this study helps to
understand how the chemosensory system can adapt to those rapid changes. Results
will be important beyond chemosensory neuroscience alone, for understanding the
maintenance of sensory membranes in general, for cell biology by understanding
membrane turnover and regeneration, and for ecology by understanding some of the
biological mechanisms useful for animals to adapt to rapid environmental change.
