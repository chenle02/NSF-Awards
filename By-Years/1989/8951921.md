This project introduces microprocessor controlled and computer interfaced
instrumentation and equipment into analytical, organic and general chemistry
laboratory courses at Trident Technical College. These courses benefit both the
Chemical Engineering and the Medical Laboratory Technology students as well as
the students enrolled in the Associate in Science degree program. Major
instrumentation purchased include a uv/visible scanning spectrophotometer, a gas
chromatograph, PH meters, an atomic absorption spectrometer, and a constant
temperature bath-circulator. This modern computer-based instrumentation is
essential for educating students embarking on careers in modern chemistry,
chemical engineering technology and related fields. This award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
