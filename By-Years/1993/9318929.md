ABSTRACT: 9318929, PI-Signer: Research into plant biology is hampered by the
lack of the technology necessary for site specific recombination. With that as
the ultimate goal, the specific aims of this proposal are to develop in vivo
genetic methodology to exploit: 1. Site specific double-strand break repair by
HO endonuclease, which should be of value in gene targeting, mosaic analysis,
and marker eviction. 2. Site specific genomic rearrangements by FLP recombinase,
which should generate deletions, inversions and translocations. Plant molecular
biology is currently limited by supporting genetic technology, particularly in
the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This project will develop in vivo genetic
methodology, initially for Arabidopsis but in forms suitable for other plant
species too. Experiments are planned to exploit expression in planta of two
yeast site specific enzymes, HO endonuclease and FLP recombinase. Areas to be
explored are gene targeting, marker eviction, mosaic analysis, and genomic
rearrangements (deletions, inversions, translocations). This technology will
allow the full range of modern recombinant DNA technology to be brought to bear
on plant systems, for both fundamental research and improved engineering of
agronomic crop species.
