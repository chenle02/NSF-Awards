In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic and Mechanism B
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven R Kass of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Minnesota will explore networks of hydrogen
bonds. The goal of this research is to learn about the consequences of multiple
hydrogen bonds and develop new environmentally friendly acids, bases, catalysts,
and sensors, as well as a better understanding of how enzymes work. This project
lies at the interface of organic, physical, analytical, and biochemistry, and as
such it is well suited for educating and training students from high school to
graduate and postgraduate studies. Large numbers of students are exposed to this
research in organic chemistry classes and the department's NSF-REU, Lando
(domestic and international) and Khorana/Bose (international) summer research
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio-inspired acids, bases, hydrogen bond
catalysts, and anion molecular receptors which make use of multiple
intramolecular hydrogen bonds will be prepared. Their properties (e.g., pKa's)
and reactivities will be explored, and new insights into hydrogen bond networks
will be obtained. By carrying out a variety of physical measurements including
those in the gas phase, and examining chiral reagents, the effect of different
types of hydrogen bonds will be determined. This should facilitate the design
and development of useful reagents and sensors, as well as providing insights
into naturally occurring biological processes such as enzyme-catalyzed
transformations, protein folding, and ion transport.
