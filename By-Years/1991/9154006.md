Little is known about how students and teachers can get high quality and
equitable access to the educational and scientific resources that are becoming
available on the Internet. With the proposal of a new NSF program that will
develop resources and virtual communities on Internet to support the widespread
implementation of advanced technologies and curricula in science, math and
engineering education, our lack of understanding of local communication
infrastructures becomes an urgent concern. This project will examine the
technological and pedagogical infrastructures that are required for teachers and
students to make optimal use of these resources. The exploratory research will
investigate1) the major issues schools and materials developers will face in
implementing programs making use of the Internet,2) models that are currently
available for providing access 3) the current resources, capabilities and
mechanisms of the Internet and 4) new developments and approaches that are most
likely to provide maximum leverage in obtaining educational advantages from
Internet resources.
