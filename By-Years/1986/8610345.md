Anchored earth-retaining walls are in widespread use, and often fail during
earthquakes, resulting in serious infrastructure disfunction and major long-term
economic impact. However, studies of the limit (failure) behavior of tied-back
walls on which to base a seismic design have not been made and this is the
objective of this study. Specifically, the aim is to verify experimentally on a
shaking table whether a sliding-block model is valid for predicting the limit
behavior of tied-back retaining walls under earthquake loading. The principal
investigators have the expertise and institutional facilities available to
complete the research proposed, which is expected to advance significantly the
seismic design of retaining walls.
