Science Networks is a three-year project which will enlarge the scientific
competence of rural elementary teachers. Through a series of workshops during
three academic years and two summer institutes of five weeks each, Pittsburg
State University (KS.) scientists and science educators will instruct teachers
in order to increase their knowledge of natural science, to serve as leaders for
the in-service training of an additional 75 teachers, and to equip them to
motivate their students toward careers in science. Throughout the project,
highly regarded curricular materials will form the basis of the workshops and
institutes, and the utilization of nature centers, environmental studies areas,
and ecological systems will provide opportunities for engaging students in
experiential science instruction. Pittsburg State University is contributing in
cost-sharing an amount that is equal to 77% of the NSF award.
