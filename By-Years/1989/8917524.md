This project will address the dynamics and relationship of the western boundary
current and zonal currents near the equator using numerical models of ocean
circulation in an idealized configuration. A nonlinear, equatorial version of
Gill's dam break experiment will be performed in a hierarchy of three different
numerical models: a single layer reduced gravity shalow water model, a
hydrostatic primitive equation model, and a nonhydrostatic model that includes
the horizonal component of earth's rotation vector. The results are compared and
analyzed to assess: 1. the fate of the water transported across the equator in
an inertial boundary current; 2. realizability and stability of a cross-
equatorial inertial boundary current, its meander and retroflections; and 3. the
effect of the horizontal component of earth's rotation vector on the cross-
equatorial flow.
