This award provides partial support for a mini-symposium June 3-5, 2002 to
commemorate the numerous contributions of Dr. Egon Balas on the occasion of his
80th birthday. Dr. Balas is a long time NSF grantee in the Operations Research
program and one of the World's leading contributors to the field of
combinatorial optimization. He has made many fundamental advances and has won
most of the prestigious awards for distinguished achievement in mathematical
programming and operations research. The meeting will include talks at Dr.
Balas' Carnegie-Mellon University from numerous distinguished speakers in the
area of combinatorial optimization. NSF funding will help support participation
by doctoral and postdoctoral students, and selected invited speakers.
