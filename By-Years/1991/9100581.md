This project will support investigation of three problems concerning elliptic
partial differential equations. The first problem is to obtain sharp estimates
and exact expressions for eigenvalues and bifurcation points. The second problem
is to establish existence theorems for smooth hypersurfaces with prescribed mean
curvature in general Riemann spaces, and the third problem is to establish
existence theorems for hypersurfaces with prescribed elementary symmetric
function of the principal normal curvatures. These problems come from questions
in Continuum Mechanics and Differential Geometry. Results from this project have
potential applications in areas such as the development of new materials and the
computation of stresses in static structures.
