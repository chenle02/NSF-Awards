9628956 Gorchov This Americas Program award will support a dissertation
enhancement project by Mr. Evan M. Notman, Miami University, on the
investigation of the influence of seed characters on seed predation in a
Peruvian lowland tropical forest. He will work under the direction of Dr. David
L. Gorchov. This study will investigate levels of post-dispersal seed predation
for a variety of tropical rain forest tree species, and relate observed
differences in seed predation among species to seed characteristics. Because
other factors such as abiotic conditions and predator abundances may also affect
seed predation, Notman will do comparisons on the influence of seed characters
on levels of seed predation across forests of three different ages and between
invertebrate and vertebrate seed predators. It is important to understand this
influence in order to understand how interactions between plants, animals, and
abiotic conditions affect forest regeneration. The results obtained will be
useful for forest management by improving predictions about the impact of seed
predation on regeneration under diverse conditions. ***
