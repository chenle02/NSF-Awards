This ROW Career Advancement Award will support sophisticated studies of the
mechanism of sporulation in yeast, a model system for genetic studies. The
research is directed toward determining how the mating type locus controls
sporulation. Preliminary analyses of mutants are encouraging and will be
extended, focusing on a particular gene through which the mating type locus
acts. This gene is implicated as the central activator of meiosis in diploid
cells, and the planned work will attempt to define the effectors of the
expression of this gene. This research should help unravel the genetic control
of sporulation and meiosis, an important biological process.
