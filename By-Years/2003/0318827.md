This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a self-
sensing piezoelectric actuator. The piezoelectric actuator will act at the same
time as the sensor that will provide information to the actuators and as its own
actuator. No separate sensor is needed. The self-sensing piezoelectric actuator
uses an unconventional impedance approach for both dynamic (AC) and static (DC)
force measurements By using &lt;br/&gt;piezoelectric materials, the load sensor
will have a much wider dynamic range than those of conventional strain gage
sensor. The simplicity in structure and electronic circuitry have made this
design inexpensive, when compared to crystal resonator pressure sensors, and
feasible for a wide range of applications in both sensing and control
industries. During Phase I, a pre-prototype self-sensing and actuating unit will
be developed for the proof of concept. A variety of targeted tests will be
carried out in this phase to test and examine the accuracy and limitations of
the innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications include machine
components; intelligent structures, intelligent self-acting machine components
including bearings and seals, high-precision positioning devices, advanced
electronic &lt;br/&gt;consumers goods, toys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
