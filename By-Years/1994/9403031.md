9403031 Archdeacon The Sixth Vermont Summer Workshops on Combinatorics and graph
theory will be held at the University of Vermont this summer. Its purpose is to
provide a productive setting for the interchange of ideas, to support
collaborative research, and to help in the dissemination of new results and
techniques. Combinatorics and Graph Theory involve the systematic study of the
simplest mathematical objects. At its heart, Combinatorics involves counting,
but counting objects that are too numerous or complicated to list. Graphs are
simple diagrams where points are connected by lines. It is the very simplicity
of the basic ideas of Combinatorics and Graph Theory that make them so important
to all sorts of scientists from chemists to electrical engineers.
