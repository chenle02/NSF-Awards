Checking attendance in scenarios such as classrooms commonly needs an instructor
to recognize each student one by one by reading the names on a roster or ask
students to sign up the attendance sheet. However, this traditional method faces
two problems: reading students' names may occupy minutes of lecture time when
the number of students is large and letting students to sign up an attendance
sheet is prone to be cheated since they can sign their own names and their
classmates' names who are absent in the class; it is not a desirable task for
instructors to calculate the total attendance of every student in a semester by
going through every attendance sheet manually. This I-Corps team proposes an
efficient and accurate way to accomplish this task. By taking videos of student
faces in classrooms using Smartphone cameras, the team proposes a unified
framework of visual face detection, tracking and recognition algorithms to
recognize multi-faces in the video simultaneously.

The proposed system has the following steps: instructors install the proposed
App on their own Smartphones; in the first class, instructors use the Smartphone
cameras to take a short-period video of student faces in the classroom. The
application will automatically build a face dataset for the course and the
instructor only needs to identify them for the first class; in the remaining
classes, instructors take videos of each class and the application will do
automated attendance check. The proposed Smartphone App will perform multi-
object tracking to associate detected faces (including false positives) into
face tracklets (each tracklet contains multiple instances of the same individual
with variations in pose, illumination etc.) and then the face instances in each
face tracklet are clustered into a small number of clusters, achieving sparse
face representation with less redundancy.
