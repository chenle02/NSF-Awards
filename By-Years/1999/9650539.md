After several years of planning, the Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics
Department is conducting a project for enhancing physics laboratories with
microcomputers. The project can dramatically change the way physics laboratories
are taught at the college. Currently, the students work through a series of lab
assignments by carefully following detailed sets of procedures. The students
find the assignments to be tedious at times and, as a result, they often lose
track of the objective by focusing on the procedure. The collection of data is
slow, and the results are often inaccurate. With the acquisition of
microcomputer stations for data collection and data analysis, students can work
on lab assignments in ways that are more similar to how scientists work in their
laboratories. Each assignment has an explicit written objective without an
explicit procedure. Students are shown how the new equipment works and how to
navigate through the software, but it is incumbent on them to find ways to
attain the written objective. The collection of data is fast, and measurements
are accurate. Many trials can be performed in one lab period. Once the basic
equipment and software are understood and mastered, students are adequately
prepared to begin a slew of lab assignments without the need for continual
guidance from an instructor. The change is intended for the biology, chemistry,
and engineering majors in Introductory General Physics I and II; the sports
medicine majors in Basic Physics; and the engineering and computer science
majors in Computers in the Laboratory.
