It is well known that behavior is affected by environmental events. Recently it
has become possible to write mathematical equations that describe the
relationship between behavior and environmental events. Certain properties of
behavior (such as how often it occurs) and certain properties of environmental
events (such as how often positive consequences for behavior occur) appear in
the equations. Equations that describe behavior-environment relationships are
usually generated by mathematical theories. A number of different mathematical
theories are currently being studied, but not all of them can be right. The
purpose of Dr. McDowell's research project is to study one of these theories,
known as linear-system theory, and to compare it to another theory, known as
matching theory. Matching theory is an older account that has been very
successful, but which seems to have some limitations. Linear-system theory is a
newer theory that appears promising and has the potential to be more
comprehensive than matching theory. Dr. McDowell's research project includes
mathematical work and empirical work. The purpose of the mathematical work is to
further develop the linear-system theory. The empirical work involves standard
laboratory preparations that require an organism (a human, a pigeon, or a rat,
depending on the experiment) to execute a simple behavior (a lever-press or a
key- peck) in a controlled environment where occasional consequences (delivery
of money, brief access to grain, or brief access to water) are arranged for the
behavior. Many results obtained from this type of laboratory preparation have
been shown to generalize to naturally occurring human behavior. The purpose of
the empirical work is to test the linear-system theory, and to determine if it
is more comprehensive than matching theory. The results of the mathematical and
the empirical work will tell us how good the linear-system theory is, and so
will take us further toward the goal of understanding, in a precise and
quantitative way, how the environment regulates behavior.
