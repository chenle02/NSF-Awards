The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a new tool to safely and nondestructively
deliver genes and other compounds to individual cells in a laboratory petri dish
(in vitro) setting. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable
diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the
laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these
cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells
resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid
delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation,
requiring an engineering alternative. A safe, turnkey, and scalable technology
would be transformative for research and life sciences companies, and represents
a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR
Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce
reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity.
This project will examine how the structure and application of the nanomaterial
platform dictates the resulting immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize
the process to achieve &gt;50% transfection efficiency with primary immune
cells. Achieving this transfection efficiency would be transformative to
researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The protocol for using
these nanomaterials is simple, and turnkey to use for life science researchers.
Device costs will be reduced through improved manufacturing techniques to be
competitive with currently available methods.
