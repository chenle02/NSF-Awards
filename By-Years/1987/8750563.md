This project will improve the quality of instruction in electromechanical device
application, control and design. Seven Hampden machine stations will be added to
the laboratory which presently supports three machine oriented courses. Included
will be AC and DC variable powers sources, dynamometers, instrumentation and
three phase and single phase machines which represent the basic machine types in
general use today. This laboratory will form the basis of future control systems
and special motor experiments.
