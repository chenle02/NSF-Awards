9706126 Reed The Inorganic Geochemistry Gordon Research Conference, which
addresses the geochemistry of metal ore-forming systems, has been held every
three to four years over the past 28 years. This meeting serves as one of the
principal conferences of international researchers that focus on the chemistry
of ore metal transport and deposition. It is anticipated that participants from
academia , mining industry and various government laboratories will be present
again this year. This proposal requests funds to pay on-site costs for students,
assistant professors and other junior scientists to attend the Gordon Research
Conference on Geochemistry of Metal Ore-forming Systems. Support would be
provided on a matching basis to those people who can substantially cover their
own travel expenses from other sources.
