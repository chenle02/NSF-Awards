The study of ultracold atoms and molecules, and their interactions is one of the
most active areas of physics research. However, these studies have been limited
by the techniques used to cool the atoms and molecules. This SGER project will
develop a new method for slowing paramagnetic atoms and molecules using rapidly
switched pulsed magnetic fields. The specific goal of this project is to slow
and stop beams of atomic hydrogen and deuterium ad to trap them in a magnetic
quadrupole trap. Initial optimization of the experiment will be done with
metastable neon, which is easier to detect. The broader impact of this work is
the development of a magnetic slower that will enable trapping of any
paramagnetic atom or molecule. The research project will directly support two
graduate students. Additional undergraduate students will work on the project.
