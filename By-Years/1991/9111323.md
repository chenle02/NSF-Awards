This project addresses the issues in providing communication support for
building collaborative, distributed applications that involve a geographically
dispersed group of users communicating through multiple media (voice, video,
text and image). Development of such applications requires support for
coordination and temporal synchronization of traffic over related streams. The
investigator posits that the transport layer must provide communication
abstractions so that a programmer can specify and achieve the necessary
concurrency control and temporal synchronization among related data streams. The
research involves four components: 1) a token-based mechanism for concurrency
control among participants of a multipoint connection. 2) a novel communication
abstraction called a multi-flow conversation to allow temporal synchronization
among traffic over multiple, independent streams. A conversation may consist of
one or more (two-party or multipoint) connections, and enforced temporal
synchronization in delivery of traffic over participant connections. 3)
incorporation of these abstractions in a transport level protocol called Multi-
flow Conversation Protocol (MCP). Additional features of MCP include an out-of-
band signaling channel for exchanging control information and an asynchronous
interface that allows an application to specify event-triggered actions. 4)
demonstration of the viability of the ideas by extending an existing, object-
based, distributed group editor to support interactive collaboration using
multiple media.
