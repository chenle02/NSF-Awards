9602190 Hughes The long term goal of this proposal is to thoroughly understand
the regulatory mechanisms controlling the biosynthesis of the essential amino
acid, methionine, in plants, especially soybean that has a low methionine
content. This knowledge may enable us to determine how to alter these regulatory
mechanisms to develop nutritionally improved plants that produce increased
levels of methionine. The major goals are focussed on an important enzyme
involved in methionine biosynthesis, cystationine gamma-synthase (CS), and its
gene and/or gene family in soybean. CS is the branch point enzyme leading to
methionine production from aspartate. In order, to understand the molecular and
metabolic mechanisms that regulate methionine systhesis, the following specific
aims will be addressed: I. What is the role of cystathionine gamma-synthase in
methionine systhesis? II. What regulates the expression of the gene encoding
cystathionine gamma-synthase? Plants are the major source of dietary proteins
for umans and livestock. The essential amino acid content of these dietary
proteins is very important because these amino acids are necessary to ensure
proper growth in humans and livestock that are unable to synthesize them.
Therefore, these amino acids are usually supplemented into their diets.
