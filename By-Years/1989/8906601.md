A new type of semiconductor switching device appears to have great potential for
power system applications. It is called the photoconductive circuit element or
PCE. It can be switched rapidly, will conduct large currents and hold off very
high voltages. It is also a bilateral device, and the power rating of a single
unit can be easily scaled to meet the application. The main objective of the
proposed research is to investigate the feasibility of this device for circuit
interruption in ac power systems. The project will conduct research along three
basic fronts: (1) semiconductor design concepts, (2) device fabrication and
testing, and (3) system simulation studies. In the first area, basic research
will be conducted to develop more accurate transient and steady-state
photoconductive device models. A finite difference approach will be used to
develop a precise reference model for the device, from which simpler reduced
models will be formulated as equivalent circuits. These will be useful in future
system simulation studies for improved evaluation of the proposed power
applications. In the fabrication area, low-voltage, scaled-down prototype
devices will be fabricated and tested for verification of theoretical design
concepts, as well as for validation of transient and steady-state device models.
In addition, these devices will be used in scaled-down (but accurate) replicas
of power circuit applications, for direct experimental verification of full-
scale simulation results. The equipment requested in this proposal represents a
key ingredient for the necessary experimental testing of this new power
switching concept.
