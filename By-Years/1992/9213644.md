Joints play an important role in analysis and design of automotive structures.
The objective of this faculty internship is to develop a physical, design
oriented joint model that estimates the static performance of a joint in terms
of physical design parameters, such as dimensions, and pitch of spot welds. The
key idea is to develop and use a simple finite element joint model consisting of
intersecting box-shaped beams that accounts for all the important deformation
mechanisms in a joint. The theory of thin-walled structures and regress on
results obtained by finite element analysis of joint models in order to derive a
set of simple equations relating the dimensions of a joint and other physical
design parameters with the behavior of the joint will be used. The study will
provide designers of automotive structures with a useful tool for preliminary
design of new car models. This design tool will allow them to apply structural
optimization to improve the design of a joint and also of the overall car
structure.
