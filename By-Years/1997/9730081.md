This project will use data and modeling to develop a quantified description of
the relationship between the diagenesis of redox-sensitive trace metals (Fe, Mn,
Mo, V, U, Re, Cd) and sediment oxidation state. Sediment solid- phase and pore-
water data will be generated for a suite of sediment cores from the Chile margin
that experience a range of oxidation states, and the data will be used to assess
a diagenetic model. The model will then be applied to a global database of
bottom-water oxygen, organic carbon flux and sedimentation rate to determine
authigenic fluxes of the metals. Key goals are (1) to develop a quantitative
capability to predict bottom-water oxygen levels and organic carbon flux from
sediment metal data and (2) to derive estimates of global metal fluxes between
sediments and bottom waters in the present and recent geologic past. ***
