This project will develop a working prototype of a federated and community-
enabled approach to data sharing, discovery, and enhancement. It will be
implemented based on several new and evolving open source technologies that
allow discovery across multiple search protocols and conventions and continually
inform users of relevant changes in data availability and data and service
enhancements. This work will help lower barriers to data publishing, annotation,
and enhancement while maintaining the authority and heritage information
provided by formal archives. The cutting edge technologies to be prototyped by
this program for the polar sciences - data and service casts, OpenSearch
services, and Wave-enabled metadata - should work synergistically to provide an
overall solution that is greater than the sum of its parts. Interactive (Wave)
technologies that can significantly increase responsiveness to user queries and
decrease the barriers to provider participation in data set accession and
distribution will be employed. In terms of broader impacts, this prototype has
the potential to be transformative and not just evolutionary, changing the
mindset of the data provider, data center, and user. The aggregation server,
data and service casting, along with wave technologies represent new trends in
collaborative technologies enabling both users and distributors of information
to more easily share their work with less concern over loss of control of their
data. Through connections to the Polar Information Commons, this project has the
potential to globally distribute the concepts demonstrated and to inform ICSU's
development of a World Data System.
