The objective of this Phase I proposal is to gain sufficient information about
the ultrasonic response as a function of surface roughness so that an instrument
to measure surface roughness can be developed in the future. The basic concept
of the ultrasonic technique is that the backscattered energy from an impinging
ultrasonic wave decreases as the surface roughness increases. At the same time,
the energy in the scattered radiation component increases. Both of these
approaches will be investigated in an attempt to maximize the ultrasonic
response to surface roughness. These results will lead to an improved
understanding and a model that should provide insight for the development of an
ultrasonic instrument for dynamic, in-process surface roughness measurement. If
successful, a Phase II proposal is planned.
