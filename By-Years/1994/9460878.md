9460878 Nardi This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project deals with
development of novel neural algorithms for adaptive demodulation of spread
spectrum communications. Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum Multiple-Access
(DS/SSMA) has long been the technology of choiae in a wid evariety of satellite
and military radio networks where multiple-access capabilities, anti-jamming,
low probability of interceptm, and dynamic topologies are important. DS/SSMA
technology is emerging as a likely modulation choice in emerging space and
third-generation commercial mobile radio networks (e.g. personal communication
systems) and in indoor wireless communications. The performance degradation
casused by the dissimilarity of the received powers of a set of users who
transmit simultaneously through the same channel. Multiuser detection promises
substantial gains in bit-error-rate, which in turn afford the possibility of
eliminating the need for power control and a significant reduciton in the number
of chips- per-symbol (spreading ratio) necessary to sustain a desired level of
multiuser capability. Neural algorithms are naturally suited to the training and
adaptation of multiuser detection algorithms to realize those gains in practice.
The proposed project will develop neural-network-based adaptive signal
processing architectures for near-far-resistant demodulation of spread- spectrum
multiple-access signals. This approach will lead to significant advances in the
ability to use direct-sequence spread- spectrum formats in emerging radio
networks ***
