In the post-sequencing era of Arabidopsis research, the effort to understand the
function of each and every one of the 26,000 genes is expanding rapidly on a
global scale, involving many more countries and laboratories that were not
originally part of the more focused sequencing efforts. In order to foster
coordination of all of these worldwide functional genomics efforts, scientists
have called for strengthening the Multinational Science Steering Committee
(MSSC) that was established in 1990 for the purpose of coordinating the
Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis thaliana Genome Research Project. As a
means to accomplish this goal, the North American Science Steering Committee for
the Arabidopsis genome research project will employ and supervise a fulltime
coordinator who would act as a reliable conduit for communications between the
MSSC and the research community. Some of the specific duties of this person
include: (1) functioning as the executive secretary for the MSSC, (2) together
with TAIR (the Arabidopsis Information Resource), develop, maintain and update a
website to inform the research community about various large-scale Arabidopsis
functional genomics research activities, and (3) being the production editor of
an annual progress report and other documents that the MSSC produces. This
coordinator is expected to visit major project sites worldwide and communicate
the findings to the MSSC. This award will provide two years of funding to test
the effectiveness of such a person in coordinating the global Arabidopsis
functional genomics activities. Two members of the North American committee
serves on the MSSC and will be responsible for monitoring the activities of the
coordinator.
