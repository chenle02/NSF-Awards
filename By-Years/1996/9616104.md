9616104 Ort Funding if for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend
a Gordon Research Conference on "Temperature Stress in Plants", to be held
January 26-31, 1997, at Ventura, California. The program will bring together
researchers who work on different sides of the temperature optimum for most
higher plants, freezing stress and heat shock. The objective of this conference
is to bring together these two groups which have usually been separated although
it has become obvious that there is common ground in the effects of temperature
on biochemical and molecular processes. The conference derives its main
rationale from the conviction that the fields can profit which communication is
improved.
