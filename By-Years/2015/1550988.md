The human brain is remarkably adept at integrating information from the
different senses to create rich representations of the world. For example,
understanding what a dog is can involve information not only about how the dog
looks and acts, but also about how it sounds, feels, and even smells.
Consequently, one sense, such as hearing, can exert an influence on processing
in another, such as vision. There has been some suggestion from prior research
that this is why deaf children often struggle to process some types of visual
information. However, this may not be due to a direct effect of lack of hearing
on vision. Deaf children often have delayed exposure to language, which may also
influence how children's visual processing develops. The effects of language
exposure and auditory deprivation can be disentangled by studying deaf children
who are exposed to a natural visual language - American Sign Language. This
project will provide information about how hearing and language influence vision
during development, and will also provide information about how deaf children
come to learn about the world around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred and
fifty deaf children aged 6-13 years, who vary in both their hearing loss and
their exposure to American Sign Language, will be followed longitudinally for
2-3 years. During the first wave of data collection, each child's audiological
profile, ASL skills and language background, and nonverbal IQ will be assessed.
At each of four waves of data collection, their ability to process sequential
streams of visual information will be measured. Moderation analyses will be used
to determine the effects of hearing loss and natural language exposure and skill
on the development of this visual processing ability. In doing so, the
researchers will be able to test competing hypotheses about the basis for visual
sequence processing deficits in deaf children.
