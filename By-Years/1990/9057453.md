This Presidential Young Investigator Award concentrates on research on wide
bandgap semiconductor materials, such as diamond, silicon carbide, and boron
nitride. THe materials are being synthesized using microwave plasma enhanced
chemical vapor deposition, oxyacetylene flame deposition, and heated filament
deposition. The emphasis in the synthesis studies is film surface morphology and
film adhesion to the substrate. Adhesion studies involve surface
characterization and interface modification by ion beam damage and in-situ
cleaning. Characterization techniques include Auger spectroscopy, x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission and inverse photoemission
spectroscopy, and electron diffraction.
