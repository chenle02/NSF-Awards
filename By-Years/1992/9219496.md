This award provides funds which will allow the University of Southern
California to host a scientific workshop in Wellington, New Zealand in
preparation to submit to the NSF a complete scientific proposal to study the
Southern Alps plate boundary of New Zealand. This workshop will have two primary
objectives: (A) to review the scientific objectives of the proposed research and
(B) to review the logistical and technical considerations of the proposed field
experiments. Results of the workshop will be twofold: (1) a report summarizing
the results of the workshop and (2) an updated scientific plan for the proposed
project.
