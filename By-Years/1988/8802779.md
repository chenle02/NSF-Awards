This research will concentrate on the ideas surrounding Faltings definition of
certain volume forms on cohomology groups, which were used in his proof of the
Riemann-Roch theorem for Arakelov surfaces. The Principal Investigator has
discovered a new approach to these volume forms, obtaining them from certain
metrics on the cohomology groups. He has a rather direct geometric construction
of these metrics which shows them to be in analogy with the non-archimedean
metrics induced at the finite places by the choice of a model. He will apply
this construction to the study of Faltings' delta invariant for Riemann
surfaces, to the definition and study of the non-archimedean analog of this
invariant , and to the study of Arakelov's zeta functions. This research is in
the area of applying geometric methods to solve equations in integers
(Diophantine equations). Faltings recent fundamental work in this area is the
jumping off point for the work of this researcher.
