This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Meritorious research to
be supported through access to the vBNS includes work in high-energy physics,
astronomy, geological sciences, and the computational sciences. Collaborations
are expected, through the network, with colleagues at SLAC, Yale, MIT,
Washington, Columbia, Florida, Stanford, and others. Work is also expected to
involve access to federal laboratories (e.g., Fermilab, Rutherford Lab) and
researchers on interconnected NGI networks, including ESnet and DARPA networks.
