This project will respond to the needs of agricultural and green industries for
more precision technicians. Precision technologies are employed by growers
across the U.S. to increase crop yield, reduce production costs and minimize
negative impacts to the environment. Precision technologies are used not only in
production agriculture but by a vast number of agricultural and green industries
including organic farming, nurseries and sports turf management. With the
increasing use of technology, there is a need for more technicians to install,
repair and maintain the new technological equipment. Through the Precision
Agriculture Program, Clark State Community College will partner with leaders in
the precision agriculture industry and educational institutions to increase the
number of students pursuing degrees in precision agriculture and in turn will
support the needs of farmers and other green industries utilizing this emerging
technology.

Clark State Community College will integrate precision agriculture and the geo-
sciences by working with leaders in the precision agriculture industry and other
educational institutions to (1) grow the pipeline of Precision Agriculture
students through targeted recruitment; (2) increase retention by expanding
career and transfer options for precision agriculture students and (3) address
the rapidly changing applications of precision technologies and prepare faculty
to respond to ongoing changes in industry needs. The curriculum and knowledge
developed through this proposal will be shared with other community colleges and
universities through the NSF ATE National GEOTech Center website; through
presentations at regional and national conferences; and through in-person
faculty exchanges.
