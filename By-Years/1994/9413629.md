This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project will
develop a parts-per-billion (ppb) moisture concentration sensing instrument
based on a ring down cavity (RDC) spectroscopy technique. Commercial application
includes characterizing the purity of a variety of gases used in the manufacture
of semiconductors.
