To understand the causes and importance of the changes occurring in our
atmosphere due to a variety of natural and man made influences requires
observations of these changes at different altitudes on a global basis. One
technique being investigated is the observation during twilight of optical
emissions produced by solar radiation. The inversion of these observations with
changing solar depression angle gives the height variation of the particular
emission being observed. This project is for a collaborative program of
observations and modeling to attempt to obtain height profiles of the O, O2 and
N2 concentrations as well as temperature and the integrated solar flux. The data
base will also provide valuable information on the conjugate photoelectron flux
and interhemispheric transport processes. *** //
