The purpose of this project is to develop tools and techniques for performing
computer assisted analyses of parallel programs and to use these analyses to
gain insight into the design of optimally efficient parallel programs. The
primary focus of the project is on the microanalysis of programs executing on
families of massively parallel MIMD and SIMD computers (e.g., multi-dimensional
mesh connected computers) with special attention given to frequently-used,
automatically analyzable classes of programs (e.g., divide and conquer). The
research has both theoretical and experimental components.
