ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expose a broad community of high
school students and teachers, undergraduate students and the public to the
nanoscale "World of the Small" as well as the rules that govern the physical
world at the nanoscale level. These rules are very different from what we
generally experience in our everyday lives. The tools, know-how, and environment
to explore at the nanoscale have been generally out of reach of typical
Makerspaces. Institutions with such capabilities often limit facilities to
graduate students and research scientists. While this supports excellent
research, it does not support the Maker environment of informal, process-
oriented approaches to self-discovery of interests and skills.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will provide the tools, environment,
and the knowledge to "Makers" to explore the "World of the Small" by applying
the principles of Making. Three research questions will be addressed in the
course of the project: (i) What is the impact of the Nano-Maker space / mobile
Nano lab exposure on students' ability to grasp "nano" and "quantum concepts"
(ii) What is the impact across different student populations of introducing
Nano-Makerspaces?, and (iii) How can the findings from the project be applied to
positively impact traditional educational approaches?
