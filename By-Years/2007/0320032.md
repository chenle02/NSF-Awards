This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
improve the bioavailability of astaxanthin from the green algae, Haematococcus
pluvialis, through molecular genetic manipulation of the organism. Natural
astaxanthin is a potent bioactive antioxidant and offers tremendous potential
for use in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, aquaculture, and poultry industries.
The green alga, Haematococcus pluvialis, is the richest known natural source of
astaxanthin. One major constraint in the Haematococcus production system,
however, is that astaxanthin-rich cells (cysts) possess thick cell walls that
hinder astaxanthin extraction and subsequent bioavailability for humans and
cultured animals. Chemical and physical cell disruption processes account for a
major cost of the production, yet introduce the risk of oxidation of
astaxanthin. In this Phase I project, certain features of Haematococcus will be
genetically altered so as to facilitate fast and efficient extraction and
digestion of cell-bound astaxanthin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
immediate commercial application of this project will be in the nutraceutical
and aquaculture markets. &lt;br/&gt;
