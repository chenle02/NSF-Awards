The research concerns singularities of solutions of partial differential
equations on manifolds. Implicit in this work are heat-equation analysis and
topology of singular spaces. From this one can study Hilbert/Fredhom complexes
and related cohomology theories. This leads to certain generalizations of the
classical Riemann-Roch theorem.
