A grant has been awarded to Dr. Richard Olmstead and Ms. Susan Grose at the
University of Washington to study the evolution of a mammal dispersed fruit in
Central America. The study group is the three genera in the Crescentieae, a
tribe in the family Bignoniaceae (Trumpet creeper family). The closest relative
of these plants is a group of trees in the genus Tabebuia, a tree with dry
fruits similar to those of Trumpet creeper. The goals of the research are first
to determine the evolutionary relationships of the species under study, and
second to analyse the changes that have taken place to produce a fruit palatable
to animals from one that is dry and woody. Samples will be collected on an
expedition to Mexico and Guatemala. DNA sequence analysis will be used to
determine the relationships among the species of Crescentieae and Tabebuia. This
work will take place at the University of Washington. The changes that have
taken place in the fruit tissues will be studied at the University of Zurich
using light and electron microscopy techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study
will enhance our understanding of the relationship between flower and fruit
development and the evolution of functionally important traits in a lineage of
flowering plants. The Crescentieae are thought to have been eaten by now extinct
ice-age mammals, which dispersed the undigested seeds. It is not known which, if
any, animals in modern times are eating and dispersing the fruits. Today,
Crescentieae are very rare and the species have very localised distributions.
They are constantly facing threats of extinction due to deforestation.
Understanding how these plants evolved is one step in determining appropriate
courses of action for conservation of plant species whose seed dispersers have
gone extinct. &lt;br/&gt;
