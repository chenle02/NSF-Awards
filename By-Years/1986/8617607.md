The central question which motivates Professor Goodman's study is what is the
nature of mathematical reality. Professor Goodman is seeking in his research to
develop a philosophy of mathematics which embodies the central insights of both
the classical and the constructive traditions. Such a philosophy would be
"Platonistic" in its ontology but constructivist in its epistemology. He found a
way to accomplish this goal by using Lewis' "S4" semantics as the underlying
logic which allowed for a reconciliation of the classical and intuitionistic
positions. Under this grant, Professor Goodman will fill in his argument for the
classical mathematical realism from the "hardness" and objectivity of
mathematical statements and the empirical verifiability of their consequences.
He will argue that experience with these features of mathematics allows us to
move from assertability conditions to truth conditions, but that assertability
conditions still play an indispensable role in the semantics of irreducibly
intentional parts of mathematics. Using epistemic theories which Professor
Goodman interprets as combining truth and assertability conditions, he will
attempt a systematic account of actual mathematical discourse. This research
project combines Professor Goodman's deep understanding of mathematics with
subtle philosophical analysis. His prior work clearly demonstrates his ability
to present clear, well-organized and provocative arguments for his positions.
His study promises to make a significant contribution to our understanding of
the nature of mathematical realism and its implication in ordinary mathematical
language as it is found in textbooks, monographs and journals.
