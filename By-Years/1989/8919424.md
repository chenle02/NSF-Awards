Dr. Horace Smith will use this grant to study variable stars in a specific area
of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). One hundred and one previously known
variables and two hundred and five newly discovered, suspected variables will be
included in this survey. This will not only be one of the most extensive studies
of SMC variables to date in terms of the number of stars studied, but it will
extend fainter than almost all other investigations of SMC field variable stars.
For the first time the period-luminosity relations and period-frequency
histogram of the faintest SMC Cepheid stars will be established. Questions
relating to the nature and distribution of SMC RR Lyrae stars will also be
explored. Cepheid stars in the Magellanic Clouds played a significant role in
the discovery of the period-luminosity relation. They also helped outline the
structure of the Magellanic Clouds, and they have served to test both stellar
pulsation theory and stellar evolution theory. For these reasons the Magellanic
Cloud Cepheids have been favorite targets of observers. Dr. Smith's study will
expand the data base on SMC Cepheids and RR Lyraes to better understand their
nature, evolution, and distribution.
