The role of coherency strains in phase formation is examined using
sophisticated X-ray scattering techniques. The initial stages of phase formation
involve formation of locally ordered regions or clusters. Coherency strains can
affect the compositions of these clusters and modify the phase diagram. Lattice
parameters are measured in the nickel-vanadium alloy system to monitor matrix
composition and precipitate composition as a function of bulk composition and
temperature. Coherency strains are expected to have a role in determining
surface segregation. Local order near crystallographic surfaces is examined in
copper-gold, Cu3Au, and compared to the bulk. %%% This research provides greater
understanding of the factors that influence the surface and bulk microstructure
and properties of materials.
