9411138 Rivera This project is on research to develop a general on-line
optimization method to improve ion-exchange chromatographic separations. Two
optimization methodologies, the Doehlert design and the simplex method, are
compared in their ability to maximize productivity and resolve constituent
peaks. Operating parameters such as pH, mobile phase flow rate and composition,
sample size, and gradient length will be investigated for their influence on
separation performance for mixtures of commercially available proteins. Also, an
on-line peak tracking procedure based on neural networks will be investigated.
