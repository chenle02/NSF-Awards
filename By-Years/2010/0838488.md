We are using continuous and survey-mode Global Positioning System (GPS) and
other relevant geological and geophysical information to clarify the special and
temporal character of active deformation, and the forces driving this
deformation, in the E. Mediterranean/Caucasus/Middle East region where the
African, Arabian, and Eurasian plates interact. We place special emphasis on
understanding the relationship between active deformation and geologic
structures, and interactions between mantle dynamics and crustal tectonics. Our
previous studies now provide an accurate (&#8804;1mm/yr) description of regional
deformation that is helping to define the basic principles that control
continental deformation in this zone of plate interaction. These regional
deformation patterns provide the framework for the more detailed studies we are
now pursuing, including, (1) characterizing deformation (strain accumulation)
along the main faults that control the large majority of deformation in this
region (i.e., plate and block boundaries), (2) constraining better deformation
in the S.E. Aegean (Greece and Turkey) that is closely related to active
subduction and associated earthquake and tsunami hazards along the Hellenic
trench, (3) quantifying deformation around unstable, continental triple
junctions, including the Karliova and Karaman-Maras triple junctions in E
Turkey, 4) determining the spatial character of strain accumulation as a
function of the time in the earthquake cycle along the North Anatolian Fault, 5)
monitoring and modeling postseismic deformation associated with the 1999,
Izmit/Duzce earthquake sequence, and 6) working with collaborating partners to
develop and apply realistic, dynamic models for active deformation of the
continental lithosphere.

This project involves quantifying fault behavior (rates of strain accumulation
and fault locking depths), and as such provides a physical basis for earthquake
forecasting (estimates of earthquake repeat times, locations, and magnitudes)
and hazard mitigation. We work closely with, and provide technology transfer
(GPS, deformation modeling) to, academic and government scientific research
institutions in Turkey, Greece, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, and
Ukraine, including many international students who participate in all aspects of
the research. The geodetic infrastructure we are developing in this region is
being used to constrain GPS satellite orbits, thereby contributing to other GPS
research studies (geodynamics, atmospheric water vapor, LIDAR, ionospheric
studies).
