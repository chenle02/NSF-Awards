The dormant life-history stages of many organisms, including most terrestrial
plants, many terrestrial and freshwater invertebrate animals, and even a few
vertebrates, represent a storage of species and genetic diversity. When
environments change through time, these resistent stages (typically though not
always seeds and eggs) prevent extinction of those types of organisms that could
not withstand the change in their active states. This research explores a series
of questions about how dormant stages affect survival and maintenance of
variation in the presence of a changing environment. The work combines
development of new mathematical theory with the use of a species of lake-
inhabiting crustacean copepods (ca. 1 mm long) as a model system. It is one for
which considerable information is already known. Four major questions will be
addressed: (1) What is the environmental and physiological basis for the long-
term dormancy, (2) Does a temporally-fluctuating environment combined with long-
term dormancy provide a mechanism for maintaining greater variation than would
otherwise occur, (3) How do sediment processes (mixing, settling, mortality of
dormant stages) affect the distribution of variable stages, and (4) Can
observations already made on the copepod population in question be explained
through an understanding of storage of dormant stages? The research involves a
combination of field sampling of lake sediments, rearing of copepods in the
laboratory, and a careful matching of mathematical theory with known processes.
Theory will be generalized after its application to the copepod system is
established. Current predictions are for climates to become both drier in the
northeastern US and to become more variable. Understanding how species with
dormant stages are likely to respond to these changes will help guide
predictions of changes in plant and animal abundance and distribution.
