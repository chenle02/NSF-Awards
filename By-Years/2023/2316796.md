Data are often collected with measurement errors in many areas such as household
income from economic surveys, self-reported daily fiber intake, and the exposure
dose to radiation in epidemiological studies. This project aims to develop
efficient and robust statistical tools for various model settings involving
measurement errors. The research will improve the estimation accuracy in
regression models and fill the void in model-checking procedures for the time
series analysis. The application of the proposed methods will advance the
understanding of precise relationships in a wide variety of fields such as the
relationship between dietary fiber intake and the gut microbiome in
epidemiology. The project will also promote research engagement of both
undergraduate and graduate students, especially students from underrepresented
groups, in mathematics and statistics.

In statistical modeling, ignoring the measurement error in predictors often
causes estimation bias and lower hypothesis testing power. This project will
develop efficient estimation and powerful testing procedures with measurement
error in a broad class of models including linear and nonlinear models,
generalized linear models in case-control studies, and autoregressive models for
time series data. The proposed estimation and model-checking methods are rooted
in the robustness of the minimum distance estimation based on the weighted
empirical residual processes, the efficiency of the nonparametric estimation
techniques, and the power of information extraction from external validation
studies on predictors. This research will not only establish the theory of the
proposed methodologies but also apply these statistical tools to real-world
datasets to help practitioners understand the underlying relationships more
accurately and draw more precise conclusions.
