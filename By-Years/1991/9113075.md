The Math/Science Network is a non-profit membership organization of educators,
scientists, engineers, mathematicians, parents, community leaders, and
government and corporate representatives whose mission is to promote the
continuing development in mathematics and science of all people, with particular
emphasis on the needs of women and girls. The Network is holding a two-day
Workshop for Expanding Your Horizons (EYH), day long conferences for girls,
coordinators. The objectives of the Workshop are: establish direct communication
between coordinators throughout the country; to encourage each coordinator to
act as mentor to a new conference site; to teach coordinators how to develop
broad-based community support; to identify the kinds of help EYH coordinators
need; and to strengthen EYH coordinators' planning skills.
