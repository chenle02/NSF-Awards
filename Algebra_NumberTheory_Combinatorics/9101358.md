This project is concerned with research on algebraic groups. The principal
investigator will study the action of a reductive complex algebraic group on
complex n-space in an effort to classify those actions which cannot be
linearized. He will also investigate the conjecture that the algebra of
differential operators on quotient spaces of a complex affine variety is
finitely generated. The research supported involves invariant theory and
algebraic groups. In general, invariant theory involves the actions of linear
algebraic groups on manifolds or linear spaces and the determination of the
mathematical invariants of the space under these group actions.
