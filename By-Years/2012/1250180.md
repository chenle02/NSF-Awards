Modern smartphones are notorious for consuming energy far too quickly,
especially for access to the Internet through wireless
radios.&lt;br/&gt;Although certain advances have been made on the hardware side
such as better batteries, this research is focused on improving energy
management software to make better use of existing
batteries.&lt;br/&gt;Considering that the frequency of use of these radios is
spurred by the popularity of smartphone applications, the wide availability of
applications, for instance the Android Market has over 500,000 registered
applications, shows that the need to save smartphone radio energy is highly
relevant and urgent today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different from existing
research, this high-risk high-reward research takes a network traffic aware
approach to save smartphone radio energy. The main intellectual merits include:
(1) Solutions for determining low priority delay tolerant smartphone
applications without assistant from application developers. (2) Solutions for
determining delay tolerant traffic periods within high priority real-time
smartphone applications. (3) Solutions for tracking low priority delay tolerant
applications, and delay tolerant traffic periods in high priority real-time
applications through the system to optimize radio energy
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will extend smartphone battery
lifetime with the potential to benefit over one billion smartphone users
worldwide. User experience of smartphone usage will be enhanced. Industry
smartphone practice will also be improved. This research will be integrated into
three courses, and also benefit research of female graduate students and
undergraduate students. Special distribution efforts are also planned to
increase the number of women and girls in computing.
