This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research by Professor Bruce E. Bowler at the University of Denver to
investigate fundamental aspects of gated electron transfer reactions in
proteins, which regulate electron flow in metabolic pathways. The research
capitalizes on variants of the electron transport protein, iso-1-cytochrome c
which are used to vary the reduction potential of the iron site. Electron
transfer rates in the modified proteins will be measured by pH jump stopped-flow
methods. The thermodynamics and temperature-dependent kinetics of the gating
reaction will be measured for all variants. Temperature-dependent kinetics for
the electron transfer reactions of the iso-1-cytochrome c variants with small
inorganic complexes will be monitored by stopped-flow methods under pseudo first
order conditions. By increasing the concentration of the inorganic redox
reagent, the observed electron transfer rates will be varied smoothly from non-
gating to gating conditions. By comparing the activation parameters and rate
constants for ET under gating conditions with those for the gating process,
direct correlation of gated ET with a conformational gating reaction will be
accomplished. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protein conformational changes linked to
changes in the oxidation state of the protein play key roles in gating electron
transfer properties in a wide range of important proteins, such as those in the
ATP-producing electron transfer chain. Results learned in this study can also be
applied to gating currents in biotechnological electronic devices. This research
will also train students at various levels, with an emphasis on undergraduate
women and underrepresented minority students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
