Bruce P. University of Alaska Title: Paleohydrology Across Central Alaska: A
Multiproxy Approach to Lake-Level Records The primary objective of this project
is to produce new multi-proxy paleoclimate records from Central Alaska to test
hypotheses concerning the cause of shifts in the precipitation-evaporation
balance from 18 ka to present. The award supports research to: (i) expand the
network of sites with decadal to century-scale lake- level data to identify the
spatial and temporal pattern of changes in the precipitation-evaporation balance
and (ii) identify fluctuations in the moisture balance for the past 2000 years
at annual to decadal-scale from closed basin Dune Lake. These records are needed
to understand the long-term atmospheric dynamics of the Arctic and to assess the
significance of shifts in the precipitation-evaporation balance. The Holocene
climate history of the region will be reconstructed with a series of studies
analyzing the sedimentology, geochemistry, magnetic properties, pollen content,
stable isotopic composition, and for the first time in the Arctic, biomarker
compounds. The lake cores will be dated at high- resolution by 137Cs, 210Pb and
AMS 14C measurements on macrofossils and pollen.
