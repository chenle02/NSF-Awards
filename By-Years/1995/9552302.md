Small class size and extensive laboratory experience are integral to the newly
developed Environmental Science program. The current interest in environmental
issues by students provides an excellent opportunity to develop their interests
in science through lab experiences that address key environmental problems. This
laboratory experience is enhanced through the acquisition of equipment to assess
air quality. This will enrich the current curricula and enable students to
participate in a genuine research experience under the direction of faculty. The
project also incorporates experimental laboratories into introductory courses in
environmental science and chemistry. Students in the upper-division courses
collaborate with scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency on
environmentally related projects. They also share their expertise with students
from local inner-city schools. To accomplish this, the project funds the
purchase of a high-volume sampler for measuring atmospheric particulate matter,
a mass flow meter and vacuum pump for sampling nitric acid vapor, and a nitrogen
oxide analyzer. In addition, the project provides a computer system for data
acquisition and analysis. This equipment permits the expansion of laboratory
offerings and provides students with a unique opportunity to participate in
environmental research.
