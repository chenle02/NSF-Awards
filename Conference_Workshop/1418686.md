This award provides funds to support a conference on algebraic graph theory,
which will be held at Villanova University during June 2-5, 2014. The organizers
planned a wide array of topics; some of them have diverse links to other fields.
There is an impressive list of invited participants, including some well-known
experts in this area of discrete mathematics, as well as many graduate students,
post-docs, and researchers from under-represented groups.

The subject of Algebraic Graph Theory belongs to the broader field of Discrete
Mathematics. Just as one regards Calculus as the mathematical language designed
to investigate functional behavior over infinite domain space, Discrete
Mathematics applies mainly to finite sets. The subject was initiated in the
study of Probability and Statistics in the 17th Century, but its main growth
took place in the 20th Century due to the advent of computers and theoretical
computer science. These days Discrete Mathematics plays an essential and
compulsory role in modern society, providing tools and framework for such areas
as digital communication, error-correcting codes, internet and social network
structure, data mining in large databases, genome sequencing, experimental
design, and many others.
