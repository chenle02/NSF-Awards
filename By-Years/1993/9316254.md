9316254 Carey The objective of this study is to explore the behavior of flows
that enter the sea by using observations on submarine pyroclastic flow deposits
from the 1883 eruption of Krakatau volcano and laboratory experiments designed
to examine certain aspects of pyroclastic flow/water interactions. Previous work
on the submarine deposits of Krakatau have demonstrated the deposition of hot
pyroclastic flows in shallow water (&lt;40 m). New studies will examine the
deposits that were laid down in deep water (&gt;100 m depth). Samples from these
deposits will be used to construct a depositional facies model for the
transition from shallow to deep water, and to assess the temperature of
emplacement. Laboratory experiments will examine 1) the behavior of particle-
laden gravity currents discharged into a tank of ambient fluid of contrasting
density and 2) the interactions of hot volcanic particles and water. These
experiments should provide insights into the different types of mixing behavior
that are likely to take place when hot flows enter the ocean.
