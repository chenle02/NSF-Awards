Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric shapes which can be defined by
algebraic equations in several variables. These shapes can be assembled from
certain basic building blocks of three types: Fano, Calabi-Yau, and general
type. Fano shapes are positively curved like the surface of a ball. They have
been classified completely in dimensions one, two, and three by delicate
geometric arguments and case-by-case analysis. According to the mirror symmetry
phenomenon from theoretical physics, Calabi-Yau shapes come in pairs X and Y
such that geometric properties of X correspond in a precise way to different
geometric properties of Y, and vice versa. There is a version of mirror symmetry
for Fano shapes as well: if X is a Fano shape of dimension n then its mirror
partner is a union of Calabi-Yau shapes of dimension n-1. This project will use
mirror symmetry to develop an approach to classification of Fano shapes which is
amenable to computation, and to investigate new viewpoints on Fano shapes
provided by the mirror correspondence. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Fano manifolds are
positively curved spaces that play a central role in algebraic and complex
geometry. There are finitely many topological types of Fano manifold in each
dimension. Fano manifolds of dimension at most three have been classified by
hand, but due to the scale of the problem a computational approach to
classification is needed in higher dimensions. There is a version of the mirror
symmetry phenomenon that applies to Fano manifolds: the mirror partner of a Fano
manifold X of dimension n is the total space Y of a one parameter family of
Calabi-Yau manifolds of dimension n-1. This project will use the mirror
correspondence to describe a computational approach to the classification of
Fano manifolds and to develop new perspectives on the geometry of Fano
manifolds, using tools from toric geometry, birational geometry, deformation
theory and moduli, Hodge theory, and enumerative
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
