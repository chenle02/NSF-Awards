ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Novik, Isabella Proposal Number: DMS - 0801152
Institution: University of Washington Title: Around the theory of f-vectors

The PI will continue studying the face numbers of various classes of cell
complexes. Specifically, she proposes to work on centrally symmetric polytopes,
simplicial complexes and posets whose geometric realization is a manifold, and
cubical complexes. As previous works suggest, this will require applying
existing and developing new combinatorial, algebraic, topological, and possibly
analytical techniques, thus strengthening connections between different parts of
Mathematics.

Cell complexes provide a convenient way to build various shapes from smaller and
simpler blocks, such as for example pyramids or cubes. A natural question then
is what restrictions on the number of building blocks are imposed by specific
shapes. Variations of this question (e.g., what is the minimal number of blocks
required) have practical importance when one wants to represent/store such a
structure in a computer.
