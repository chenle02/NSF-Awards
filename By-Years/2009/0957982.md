This project investigates why collaboration may not occur among group members
even when the conditions for collaboration are present such as common interests
and shared identities. The investigators contend that affective ties of people
to the group are critical, and these develop from jointly solving tasks that
give people a sense of shared responsibility. They hypothesize that in a
cooperative group setting, people with common interests and common identities
develop affective group ties only if they are involved in joint tasks that give
them a sense of shared responsibility. When this occurs, people are more willing
to act in the collective interests. The hypothesis is tested in two lab
experiments that combine interactions around a task (low or high in jointness)
with (a) common interests (experiment 1) or (b) common identities (experiment
2). In the experiment, groups of four people engage in individual and joint
tasks that involve well-known survival scenarios, such as "lost on the moon,"
where participants rank the importance of several items to their survival.

BROADER IMPACTS: The project addresses an important and pervasive problem, that
is, how to create and sustain social order (cooperation, collaboration, etc.).
The issue takes on new relevance in the contemporary world given globalization
and associated economic and political changes. People interact with more people
at greater distance, all of which make group ties even more important as a
source of collaboration and cooperation. This research develops a way to produce
and sustain such ties and, thereby, promote individual sacrifices for the group
or collective benefit. It has broad implications for how social divides can be
crossed or bridged to create new group affiliations.
