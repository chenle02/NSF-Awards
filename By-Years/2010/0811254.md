The recently developed fast sweeping method has been proved to be an efficient
iterative method for a class of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. In this project, a
continuing study and analysis of the fast sweeping method will be carried
out.&lt;br/&gt;Applications of the method to other problems will be
pursued.&lt;br/&gt;In particular the following work will be done:&lt;br/&gt;(1)
Understand the connection to control/game theory.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Study the
contraction property of the fast sweeping algorithm in the general framework of
iterative method.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Error analysis for the numerical solution and
its derivative.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Develop fast sweeping method for other type of
hyperbolic partial differential equations, such as hyperbolic conservation laws
and radiative transport equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamilton-Jacobi equations
are nonlinear partial differential equations that have many applications in
classical mechanics, optimal control, geophysics, geometric optics and image
processing. The nonlinearity of this type of problem poses great challenges for
mathematical analysis and for developing efficient numerical algorithms. The
fast sweeping method is a simple iterative method. It can work efficiently for a
class of difficult nonlinear problem, which is quite remarkable and worth
further understanding and development.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
project is not only to provide efficient numerical methods for real applications
in science and engineering but also to shed insight for constructing iterative
methods for other nonlinear problems.&lt;br/&gt;In addition integration with
education at different levels will also be designed.&lt;br/&gt;
