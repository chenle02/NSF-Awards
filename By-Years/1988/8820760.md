This proposal describes computational research in the area of biophysical
chemistry to be carried out by the six participating co-investigators. Funding
is requested to purchase a CPU upgrade for the computational facilities for
biophysical chemistry. The projects for which the requested equipment will be
used include: Computer Simulations of Biopolymer Structure and Dynamics, Base
Sequence Effects in Double Helical DNA, Molecular Orbital Studies of
Metalloorganic Complexes, Electronic Reaction Mechanisms in Metalloenzymes,
Crystallographic Studies of Viruses, and NMR Studies of proteins. The need for
the CPU upgrade and graphics superworkstation is based on the computationally
intensive nature of these projects, and the need for visualization of the
computed results concerning complex molecular systems in real time. The addition
of this equipment will maintain the state-of-the-art computational facilities
for biophysical chemistry at Rutgers which have been built up over the past
several years.
