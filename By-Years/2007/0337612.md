Li&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0337612&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermodynamics and kinetics of
melting in the Fe-light element-alloy systems are important for understanding
the thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth's core. The goal of this
proposal is to investigate phase relations near the solid-liquid boundary in the
Fe-O-S ternary system under high pressures. This goal will be achieved through
multi-anvil experiments combined with analyses of the quenched run products and
in situ synchrotron measurements. Experiments will be conducted 1) to establish
and understand the pressure dependence of the eutectic temperature in the Fe-O-S
ternary system, 2) to determine the eutectic composition in the Fe-O-S system as
a function of pressure, 3) to test the closure of the miscibility gap in the Fe-
rich portion of the Fe-O-S ternary system above 25 GPa, and 4) to explore a
synchrotron-based method for in situ determination of temperature and
composition of eutectic point in the Fe-O-S system. The results will be used to
test whether or not the Fe-O-S system is an adequate model for the core
composition, and to provide further constraints on the composition and
temperature of the Earth's core. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support
the early-career female PI in developing the infrastructure for high-pressure
research at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. The project will
involve the training of graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
