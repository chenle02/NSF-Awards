This small grant will provide urgently needed access to remote climate- and
lake-monitoring equipment currently installed in southern Alaska in order to
maintain a continuous stream of data and samples for climate-change research.
The stations were installed as part of previous NSF-sponsored research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will allow continued collection of time-series
data from a set of three remote Alaskan lakes. Sediment trap, temperature
logger, and precipitation records will be collected from stations already in
place, and annual photographs of glacier retreat will be updated. The lakes
exhibit annual layering in varves which can be accurately correlated with
meteorological records - this opportunity is extremely rare in Alaska, and would
be compromised if the data collection were interrupted. Constraining how known
weather is recorded in young lake sediments will allow a more accurate
interpretation of deep layers of older sediments, and allow better
reconstructions of older climate conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit: A primary goal of paleoclimate research is to reduce the uncertainties in
reconstructing quantitative paleoclimate records based on lake-sediment proxies
by combining limnological/meteorological time series with paleolimnological time
series. Access to three climate- and lake-monitoring sites in summer 2008 is
critically needed to extend the time series to improve understanding of the
rapid environmental changes occurring in the region today. As the time-series
grows, so does the potential of a transformative advance in using lacustrine
sedimentary records to reconstruct past climatic
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: All of the data obtained through
this study will be made available on the "Climatic Records from Alaska in
Southern Alaska" website (http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~dsk5/S_AK/).
