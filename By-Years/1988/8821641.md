Volcanic aerosols, both fine silicate dust and gas-derived acid droplets, are
thought to be important in affecting climate by reducing the amount of solar
radiation reaching the earth's surface. Polar ice cores provide the only medium
in which both the soluble gas-derived impurities and the insoluble silicate
particles from volcanic eruptions are preserved. These volcanic layers of high
acidity can be identified in the ice cores by a method of d.c. electrical
conductivity. Petrologic studies of the sulfur and chlorine content of glass
inclusions in phenocrysts of tephra will be used to estimate the total mass of
volatiles released in volcanic eruptions. The main objective of the study is to
determine the chemical composition of ice in layers of high electrical
conductivity (acidity) in a Greenland ice core due to fallout from certain well-
known volcanic eruptions and to identify the chemical compounds (acids)
responsible for the acidity. Petrologic estimates of the volatiles associated
with these eruptions will also be made in order to compare with the ice core
work.
