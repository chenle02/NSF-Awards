9703167 Morris The project will be conducted as part of the NSF CAREER Program.
The goal of this research is to study competing mechanisms and product
distributions of carbonaceous aerosol particles and NO2 under simulated
nighttime conditions for urban atmospheres. The experimental studies will
involve laser spectroscopy, pump-probe, and matrix isolation techniques to
investigate the heterogeneous chemistry of airborne aerosols. Theoretical
studies using ab initio molecular orbital techniques will be conducted as a
parallel effort to the experimental studies of aerosol carbonaceous particles.
For the educational plan, the investigator will develop and implement research
opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The PI is
particularly interested in teaching experimental laboratory techniques to
students that will familiarize them with state-of-the-art instrumentation and
modeling techniques for atmospheric chemical research. The PI intends to promote
science instruction in the Washington, D.C. metro area public schools,
especially in the areas of atmospheric and space sciences. The goal of this
outreach program is to enhance and to reinforce science education at an early
stage in order to increase the number of minority students engaged in science
careers.
