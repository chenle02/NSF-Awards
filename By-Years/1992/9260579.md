Ocean ambient sound is known to depend on wind speed, and ambient sound
measurements alone are known to produce accurate wind speed estimates up to
speeds of around 15m/s. Ambient sound is not often used to obtain wind data,
however, because most investigators need wind velocity, not just speed alone.
This effort will combine ambient sound with ADCP (acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler). The ADCP data will provide wind direction with data from surface
depth cell. The ADCP will also estimate near- surface bubble concentrations
which will provide a basis for extending accurate wind speed measurements beyond
15 m/s. The same instrument will work for measuring precipitation rates and, as
a stand-alone sensor, for general research in ocean ambient sound.
