Although typically appealing to different groups of researchers, the areas of
queueing networks and interacting particle systems both deal with large systems
of objects, such as customers or particles, which are connected together by some
interaction rule. The techniques that are applicable to the two areas are often
related. Professor Bramson intends to study stability questions and the behavior
under diffusive scaling for the first class of models; the use of fluid models
is an important tool in such analysis. The second class includes models such as
the voter model, and two-type particle systems with the annihilation and
creation of mass. The equilibria and the limiting concentrations are the objects
of investigation for such models.

Queueing networks and interacting particle systems are two subjects within the
field of probability theory. The goal in both areas is to understand the long-
term behavior of large systems of objects, such as customers or particles, for
which there is randomness in the system. Here, "customers" need not denote just
individuals, but also products or some task to be performed, such as in the
manufacture of semiconductor wafers. In queueing theory, one analyzes the
efficiency and stability of such systems. The proposal concentrates on the
latter topic, and on the statistical fluctuations that are inherent in such
systems. In interacting particle systems, one studies complex random systems
that occur in the context of physics, chemistry and biology, whose components
represent, for example, particles, cells, or various organisms. For instance,
one studies models for the outcome of a chemical reaction, or the genetic
diversity of a population. The proposal investigates the nature of the long-term
equilibria of such systems.
