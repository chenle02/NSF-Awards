9531721 Ramesh The PI proposes an integrated solution to the problem of
dispatching electric power in the most economical manner while meeting security
and environmental constraints, where the term security refers to the ability of
the power network to sustain normal operations in the event of contingencies.
This problem, which is referred to in the proposal as the SECOPE problem, is an
extension of the On-line Optimal Power Flow problem. The primary objectives of
the research are: 1) to find a decomposition for the SECOPE problem that
explicitly models the uncertainties in the input data, and that filters and
prioritizes suggested control actions; 2) to determine an appropriate global
optimization technique for solving the above decomposition with the addition of
discrete control actions; and, 3) to study the convergence characteristics of
the synchronous and asynchronous parallel implementations of this decomposition
for realistic power systems. The primary objectives of the proposed education
activities are: 1) to use the multimedia resources of the Internet and the World
Wide Web to teach students to "learn to learn", 2) to motivate students
(especially undergraduates) to pursue a career in power engineering. ***
