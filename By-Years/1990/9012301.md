The research of Prof. Isenberg involves primarily two areas of study: (1) The
dynamics of gravitational fields and their behavior near singularities in
spacetimes satisfying Einstein's equations; and (2) The convergence and
nonconvergence of Ricci flows of Reimannian metrics on three- dimensional
manifolds. While the interest in the first area comes from physics and that in
the second area is mathematical, in both areas the analysis focuses on
geometrically-based systems of partial differential equations. Moreover, in
both, the most pressing (and difficult) issues involve the long-time behavior of
the solutions, and the behavior of the fields as they become singular. Therefore
it is not surprising that the progress achieved in the two areas has been often
based on the use of somewhat similar tools. Also not surprising is the
considerable cross-fertilization which has occurred between the physically-
motivated ideas and mathematically-based concepts which are used in studying
both problems.
