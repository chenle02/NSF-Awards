This award provides 50% funding for the development of chromatography and
vacuum systems that will be installed and operated in the Institute of Arctic
and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. The University is committed
to providing the remaining funding required. The equipment will allow specific
organic components such as humic acids, lipids, and amino acids to be isolated
from small (50- 300 microgram) samples for 14C dating using accelerator mass
spectrometry.
