A new petrologic and chronologic approach developed by the principal
investigator for high-grade rocks in the Langtang region (east-central Nepal)
demonstrates that thrust fault movement rates since about 20 million years ago
are generally consistent with convergence of the Indian subcontinent at about 2
cm/yr (equivalent to modern rates), but that thrust rates were variable, with
emplacement of one thrust sheet at a rate 2-3 times the average rate. These data
also highlight the importance of rapid erosion (5-10 mm/yr) in exhuming
metamorphic rocks over the last 3-4 million years. The purpose of the proposed
research is to test whether these patterns are also found in two other areas -
the Annapurna region to the west, and the Arun region in far eastern Nepal - and
to test whether the Greater Himalayan Sequence experienced high-pressure or
ultra-high-pressure metamorphism. The following methods are being used: (1)
Chemical mapping and quantitative microanalysis of monazite grains, and dating
of chemically distinct domains via ion microprobe. These ages are documenting
the timing of cooling, which for many structural levels is a direct result of
thrust movement. (2) Determination of pressure-temperature conditions and
conversion to paleoposition via published thermal models for the Himalaya. The
amount of displacement, and timing of cooling and thrust movement for each sheet
is being converted to estimates of thrust rate. (3) Determination of ages and
P-T conditions of eclogites in the Arun region to determine whether these are
related to early Himalayan deformation. This work has major broad implications
for tectonics research and its interrelationship with erosion and Earth's
chemical evolution. This work will also support the education of one graduate
student in geochemistry/tectonics.
