0111183&lt;br/&gt;Rutherford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will supply funding
which will be used along with cost-sharing funds from Brown University to
purchase a new Electron Microprobe. This instrument, with its state of the art
analytical and surface imaging capability, will be an analytical centerpiece for
a large number of research projects carried out by faculty, post-docs, graduate
students, and undergraduates at Brown and as well as from the nearby University
of Rhode Island. Research projects which will make use of the Microprobe include
the following: (1) studies of minerals and glasses in volcanic rocks collected
from recently active centers around the world directed at determining the nature
and timing of processes involved in volcanic eruptions. (2) basic studies of
diffusion and reaction kinetics in both naturally occurring and synthetic
geological materials, (3) studies of deformation of geological materials in both
the brittle and ductile regimes with application to understanding earthquakes
fracturing processes in rocks, (4) studies of plate tectonic processes as
revealed in the ages of minerals and rocks, and (5) studies of rocks and
volcanic processes as they occur on other planetary bodies such as the Earth's
moon and Mars. This research involves approximately ten faculty at Brown, three
at nearby URI, and as many as twenty graduate students, five post-doctoral
fellows, and five to ten undergraduates each year. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
