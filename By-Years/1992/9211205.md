ABSTRACT This award will allow the publication of Africanisms in Afro- American
Language Varieties, a book which contains revisions of papers presented at the
International Round Table on Africanisms in Afro-American Language Varieties
held at the University of Georgia in 1988, sponsored by the NSF. The
contributions are organized thematically, so that the book may be used more
efficiently as a standard reference on the genesis of Atlantic creoles than as
simple conference proceedings. Despite its title, Africanisms fosters a dialogue
between the African Substrate Hypothesis, the Language Bioprogram Hypothesis
(now improved into the Lexical Learning Hypothesis), and the Superstrate
Hypothesis. The book is a turning point for the Substrate Hypothesis,
highlighting the enormous complexity of the subject matter of creole genesis,
and suggesting for future research analyses that are much more eclectic and
sophisticated than those in the literature. The book will contribute to a wider
dissemination of new research avenues and conceptual adjustments.
