Nonlinear wave equations give a mathematical description for many phenomena in
optics, fluid dynamics, and a variety of other physical systems. This research
is aimed at the mathematical study of special and very important "solitary-wave"
solutions that represent a single wave or a train of single waves traveling
through the medium. Solutions of this mathematical nature are instrumental for
predicting behavior and designing engineering devices for the wide range of
physically unrelated phenomena, such as water wave dynamics, in particular,
gigantic ocean waves ("rogue" waves), magnetization of materials, propagation of
light in optical fibers and other optical media, or some quantum mechanical
dynamics. Even when it is not possible to completely determine the solutions to
such equations, the evolution of the corresponding physical system can often be
understood satisfactorily by considering a computational or approximate
solution. This is feasible, provided the behavior of solutions does not change
qualitatively when unavoidable computational errors or uncertainty in the
parameters are introduced. In mathematics this insensitivity to small
perturbations is termed "stability." The principal goal of this research project
is developing new mathematical tools for study nonlinear dispersive waves and
stability of their solitary-wave solutions. In particular, the Principal
Investigator (PI) aims at obtaining precise, quantitative information about the
long time (asymptotic) behavior. Graduate students will be trained and mentored
through their participation in this project.

The PI will consider the questions of stability of solitons, such as traveling
waves, standing waves, traveling kinks, for various models arising in physical
applications. Of particular concern will be the close-to-soliton behavior of the
Dirac equations, the Ostrovsky and the short pulse equations, as well as various
water wave equations. In addition, the PI will address several outstanding
problems in the theory of spatially discrete dispersive systems, of the type of
the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation and the granular chain model with
Hertzian interactions. These are the models, where new paradigms are expected to
emerge. More precisely, the models present obstacles to their investigation that
are either not present in the corresponding "standard" continuous limits or
else, the solutions behave in a substantially different ways than the respective
continuous analogues. Thus, new mathematical methods need to be developed to
address the challenges associated with the study of evolution of these discrete
models.
