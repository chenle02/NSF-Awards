This proposal seeks to extend the PARINT software package for parallel
integration, furnishing it with the characteristics of a Problem Solving
Environment. The main goals of the project are to offer a complete set of tools
for composing problem secifications, compiling and running applications, while
providing state-of-the-art problem solving power to the end user. To this end,
we propose adding new techniques for extending the PARINT problem domain, e.g.,
to allow for a variety of integration regions, high dimensions, and singular
integrated behavior. These include a transformation interface, new distributed
Quasi-Monte Carlo strategies and extapolation methods. Specific contributions
are in the development of numerical techniques and evaluation of parallel
integration algorithms. Important issues in parallel and distributed
computations such as load balancing are addressed, with an emphasis on loosely
coupled and heterogeneous systems. Other contributions are in the areas of user
interfaces, visualization and web computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
