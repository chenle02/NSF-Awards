This award, a Research Planning Grant, supports the work of Dr. Helen Grundman
of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Hilbert modular varieties of
dimension three. Dr. Grundman will make use of the award to broaden her
knowledge of number theory and algebraic geometry, and will familiarize herself
thoroughly with the existing work on Hilbert modular surfaces in preparation for
extending and generalizing this work to three-dimensional spaces. Non-Euclidean
plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical
curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many
objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The
detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several
branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic
forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with
questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it
retains connection to its historical roots.
