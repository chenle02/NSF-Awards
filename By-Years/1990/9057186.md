Techniques will be developed to prepare and understand the properties of a new
class of molecules: Fragments of simple inorganic semiconducting solids
comprised of tens to tens of thousands of atoms, and ranging from 20 to 200
Angstroms in diameter. Experimental investigations of the energies and densities
of electronic states, vibrational frequencies, electron-vibration coupling,
surface reconstruction and surface tension will be undertaken, and the
foundation for a theory of large clusters will be provided.
