The singularities and numerical invariants defined via the Frobenius
endomorphism are important to Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry in
prime characteristic. Since the introduction of tight closure theory and the
discovery of the connection between singularities in prime characteristic and
those arising from the Minimal Model Program, there has been an extensive
theoretical study of these invariants; however, explicit computational examples
of these invariants are rare. During this workshop, there will be introductory
lecture series on tight closure, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, and test ideals,
given by leading experts. Additionally, there will be a number of research talks
on relevant existing computations of these and other topics. There also will be
a session on using the computer algebra system Macaulay2 in the computation of
these invariants, as well as a moderated open problem session during the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop aims at bringing experts together
to compute new and interesting classes of examples; identifying new connections
between the measures arising in different contexts, especially numerical
relations and bounds; and exposing graduate students, young researchers and even
some undergraduate students to simple yet fundamentally important research
questions that they can easily get their hands on.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
take place at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, May 29th--June 1st, 2012.
The organizing committee consists of: Karl Schwede (Pennsylvania State
University), Kevin Tucker (Princeton University), and Wenliang Zhang (University
of Michigan). More information can be found on the conference website:
