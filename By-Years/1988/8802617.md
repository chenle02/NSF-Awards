With the increasing complexity of microwave and millimeter wave integrated
circuits, the understanding and modeling of proximity coupled passive components
and microstrip junctions play an important role in accurately predicting the
circuit performance. In the research proposed in this document, a dynamic
dispersive rigorous approach based on solving integral equations with numerical
methods will be applied to a class of important microstrip junctions and
transitions frequently encountered in integrated circuit structures. The
research will also investigate theoretically and experimentally the issue of
interconnects with emphasis on microwave and millimeter wave integrated circuit
applications. It will focus initially on microstrip interconnects; the modelling
and experimentation of multilevel collinear and transversely coupled
interconnects in a substrate-super-strate configuration with the intent of
optimizing the power coupled from one circuit level to another. Subsequently,
multi- level cross-over interconnects will be studied with the intent of
minimizing cross-talk as for VLSI applications, or maximizing coupling of power
for certain integrated circuit microstrip antenna array applications. This will
be subsequently expanded to deal with multiple or arrays of multi-level
microstrip inter-connects in collinear, transverse as well as cross-over
configurations. The issue of optical interconnects will also be addressed for
dielectric waveguiding structures in a similar way as for microwave and
millimeter wave circuits.
