The goal of this research is to better understand the nonlinear dynamics and
evolution of atmospheric disturbances embedded in a zonally varying basic flow.
The research will be done using a two-layer baroclinic model on the beta-plane
and a spherical coordinate barotropic model. The two-layer model will allow the
PIs to examine baroclinic, barotropic and topographic processes and to assess
their combined role in determining the regional character and time variability
of the zonal flow and wave disturbances. The research with the barotropic model
will assess the impact of using spherical geometry in simulating these types of
flows. In cases of weak nonlinearity, model solutions will be obtained
analytically using asymptotic expansions and multiple space and time scales.
Outside this limit, spectral transform methods will be used to obtain solutions
numerically. These investigations may provide further insight into such observed
atmospheric features as regional cyclogenesis, blocking, and low frequency
variability. This project is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Arthur
Loesch, SUNY-Albany, under NSF grant ATM-8813621.
