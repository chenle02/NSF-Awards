The award to SUNY Stony Brook is for the acquisition of a MIMD computer to
support research in a number of different application areas. These include:
parallel algorithms for computational fluid dynamics, volume visualization
architecture and algorithms, visualization tools, and combinatorial search
algorithms. The computer will be used primarily to develop software that is
useful for computing in a MIMD environment although some codes for computational
fluid dynamics will be developed and run as compute intensive programs. Large
parallel processing computers are becoming inexpensive enough that university
groups can afford to purchase and maintain them as a shared resource. SUNY Stony
Brook is funded to purchase a MIMD architecture computer to be used for computer
science, computational science, and graphics and visualization research. The
group performing the research have a long history of using parallel machines for
their research and the results of previous experiences with parallel computers
will be invaluable in fully utilizing the new computer.
