This proposal seeks funding for a workshop to bring together some 20 leading
scholars and industry leaders to discuss needed research and theory development
ininnovation and organization change. Organized by the editors of Organization
Science, a leading journal of organization studies, workshop participants will
collaborate to write white papers to set a research agenda for organization
studies and management for the coming years. Currently managers face enormously
changed circumstances from those of most of the last century, during which much
organization theory was generated. The accumulated changes in the nature of
work, organixations, and the external environment, including science and
technology, cry out urgently for new theory based on sound empirical work. The
workshop will be convened at NSF in Arlington in June 2002, with knowledge
dissemination via the web, a sepcial issue of the journal Organization Science,
and a research monograph to be published (tentatively) by Stanford University
Press.
