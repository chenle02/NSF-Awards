Proteins carry out a vast range of critical activities including signaling, DNA
replication, gene regulation, immune response, etc. Tandem mass spectrometry is
the only high-throughput way to characterize these proteins in complex
biological mixtures. This project will produce algorithms with the potential to
dramatically improve the ability of proteomics scientists around the world to
interpret their tandem mass spectrometry data, thereby providing critical
insights into these fundamental biological processes. Because proteins are the
primary functional molecules in the cell, such insights are foundational to our
scientific understanding of life.

The key intellectual contributions in this proposal lie in the development of
novel machine learning methods for proteomics. Specifically, the project will
develop novel methods for spectrum feature extraction, including deep neural
network autoencoding and low-dimensional representation learning, learning deep
similarity metrics that allow efficient spatial data access methods,
applications of autoencoding for spectrum and experiment compression, submodular
summarization methods on proteomic data, and classification and ranking
methodologies that take advantage of network effects via a data embedding. These
tools will then be used for proteomic metadata inference, cloud-based peptide
and protein identification, and retrieval and ranking of similar proteomic
experiments. The research will hence yield a profoundly more powerful, data-
driven approach to jointly interpreting massive mass spectrometry data sets,
thereby giving scientists valuable new tools to glean insights into protein
function.
