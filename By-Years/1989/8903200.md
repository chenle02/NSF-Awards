The objective of this research is to investigate the diffusion and trapping of
small atom impurities, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon in metals, such as
nickel, which have been exposed to high energy inert gas ions. This research is
being done in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory scientists and
facilities and with the University of Illinois. Trapping studies involve nuclear
reactor techniques, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and transmission electron
microscopy. This basic research is directly related to the behavior of materials
in nuclear fusion environments.
