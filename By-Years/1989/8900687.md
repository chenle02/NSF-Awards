This award was made to Professor Newman at the University of California, Irvine
as part of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. It will support
undergraduates working with research scientists on research projects of mutual
interest. This program is designed to encourage further study in the sciences by
undergraduates. It is a response to the growing need for trained scientists and
engineers.
