ABSTRACT CTS-9313829 LUCHT Uniform diamond deposition has recently been
demonstrated in rich H2/C2H2/O2 flat flames stabilized in the stagnation region
of a deposition substrate. Diagnostics on these diamond forming flames have in
general involved either emission or absorption spectroscopy with the usual
drawbacks of line-of sight averaging or difficulty in relating intensity to
total concentrations. The PI plans to investigate the gas phase chemistry near
the deposition surface (molybdenum) using laser diagnostics to measure
temperatures, and major and selected minor gas phase species concentrations. He
hopes to achieve spatial resolution normal to the surface of 25 - 50 m. CARS
will be used to measure major species such as H2 and CO, and temperatures. H
atoms will be measured using two photon Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and or
Degenerate Four Wave Mixing (DFWM). C2H2 will be measured using either CARS or
DFWM and attempts to measure CH3 with DFWM in the ultraviolet or infrared will
be made. He plans a close collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories with
both their theoretical and experimental programs currently underway to
investigate these stagnation point flames.
