The NLANR Distributed Applications Support Team is focused on supporting
researchers and research communities in the use of resources embedded within
high-performance networks and the middleware-based Grid environments that depend
on those networks. This proposal sets forth a plan for the next stage for this
leading edge team, building on previous efforts and assisting in the maturing of
user communities in the use of distributed resources connected by advanced
networks. This includes the development and extension of end-user and network
engineer oriented tools for both high-bandwidth optical networks and low-
bandwidth wireless networks, which will be the critical network components for
advanced applications in the next several decades. Support functions will evolve
from a focus on specific projects to being a community support organization
fostering the development, support, and growth of a global community of network
engineers and network support staff working to advance networking in support of
global science. Outreach efforts will be expanded in raising awareness in new
and emerging communities, such as those associated with major NSF MRE funding,
of the dependencies these projects have with respect to networking technologies.
