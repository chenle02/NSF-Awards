The objective of this program is to create a new and transformative class of
lateral-flow bioanalytical microsystems based on inkjet fabrication and paper-
based surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (P-SERS) for multi-analyte detection.
While paper-based sensors have recently emerged for simplistic assays, the
proposed approach of fabricating bio-functionalized surfaces and optofluidic
SERS detection elements using inkjet printing enables sensitive and
sophisticated assays that are extraordinarily low in cost and simple to
perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort is the
establishment of the fundamental components that enable the emergence of new
methodologies in sophisticated paper-based assays. These components include: (i)
inkjet-based functionalization of cellulose paper with biomolecules
and&lt;br/&gt;plasmonic nanostructures, (ii) Raman reporter molecules that are
highly reactive with metal nanostructures, and (iii) a quantitative
understanding of the mass transport advantages of paper-based fluidic
biosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are
centered around the transformative approach to bioanalytics enabled by the
P-SERS paradigm. The incredibly low cost of the proposed
P-SERS&lt;br/&gt;microsystems combined with the unprecedented ease of use will
lead to a broad range of new applications that require highly sensitive, low-
cost disposable analytical devices, including applications in disaster response,
at-home health care, and infectious disease screening. In addition, the unique
properties of the P-SERS technology enable it to be incorporated as an
educational tool at all stages of learning and in any environment. Research
opportunities and engineering design projects built around inkjet fabrication
and paper-based analytics will be created for underrepresented high school
students and for undergraduate engineering students.
