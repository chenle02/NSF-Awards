This project is a pilot study to test the idea that sub-Milankovitch variability
results from non-linear response of the climate system to periodic Milankovitch-
band forcing. In other words the hypothesis is that non-linear response of the
climate system transfers Milankovitch-band forcing to a different frequency. The
hypothesis will be tested by performing bispectral analyses on a record of
faunal variation and a benthic carbon isotope record from 0 - 1 Ma obtained from
ODP Site 927. &lt;br/&gt;
