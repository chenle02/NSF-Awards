Much current research is directed toward understanding the behavior of trace
metals in anoxic aquatic environments. These studies create a need for accurate
data on the stoichiometry and stability of metal complexes containing reduced
sulfur ligands. Many existing stability constants are uncertain at the order of
magnitude level and thus are far less accurate than the field data to which they
are applied. In some cases, especially for polysulfide or thiol ligands, no data
exist. When data are available, it is often uncertain whether the species
described are mononuclear or polynuclear. This is an insidious problem that can
introduce large, unsuspected errors into predictions of metal behavior. We have
completed investigations of copper speciation in solutions equilibrated with
reduced Cu-S assemblages, chalcocite+djurleite and anilite+covellite. This has
included EXAFS studies which demonstrate that multinuclear complexes exist in
this system. We have also completed studies of zinc and cadmium speciation under
conditions appropriate for anoxic marine waters. We will continue this line of
research, focusing in the next two years on mercury and molybdenum. Specific
objectives are as follows: 1) Mercury. Measure the solubility of cinnabar under
conditions approaching those in anoxic marine waters and compare with
metacinnabar solubility to determine if polynuclear complexes exist. Determine
if Hg-polysulfide complexes will be important in nature. Investigation the
solubility of cinnabar over its solid solution range, and 2) Molybdenum.
Characterize Fe-Mo-S precipitates formed under conditions representative of
anoxic marine waters by elemental analysis, EXAFS and solubility. Investigate
the possible importance of thiomolybdates as ligands for Cu, Zn, Cd and Fe.
Extend preliminary EXAFS work on Mo in black shales and seeks links between the
products produced in the laboratory and those preserved in shales from ancient
sulfidic marine basins.
