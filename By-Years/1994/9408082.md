9408082 Webers This award supports a workshop of the geology of the Ellsworth
Mountains, Antarctica. The Ellsworth Mountains are part of a continental block
that was part of East Antarctica prior to the breakup of Gondwana. This block
occupies a key position in the tectonic micro-plates of West Antarctica and so
it is especially important to understand its full geologic development. This
region is particularly important to the overall objectives of the ANTALITH
program (an integrated geophysical and geological traverse across West
Antarctica to East Antarctica) which are to understanding the structure of the
continental crust across the boundary between West Antarctica and East
Antarctica. This workshop will allow scientists to review recently completed
work in light of the new hypothesis that North America and Antarctica were part
of a pre-Gondwana supercontinent and will allow discussion, debate, and
definition, of future research objectives in the Ellsworth Mountains region. ***
