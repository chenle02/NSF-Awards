Elliptic curves (and their generalizations called abelian varieties) are
fundamental mathematical objects that are also of great importance in other
fields such as cryptography and error correcting codes. There are naturally
occurring geometric spaces, called Shimura varieties, whose points classify
different elliptic curves (and abelian varieties). Inside these spaces are
orbits, called Hecke orbits. These orbits are not like the regular periodic
orbits of the planets around the sun, but are highly unpredictable and chaotic.
Indeed, each orbit is conjectured to be distributed equally throughout the
Shimura variety. The principal investigator and his collaborators will use
techniques from various areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebraic
geometry and representation theory to study several aspects of these Hecke
orbits. As part of this award the PI plans to introduce undergraduates to
research in mathematics and to train graduate students on topics related to the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this project are to
understand the characteristic zero and characteristic p interplay of isogenies
and Hecke orbits, keeping in mind applications to the long standing question of
finding abelian varieties not isogenous to Jacobians. The PI also plans to study
just-likely and unlikely intersections in Shimura varieties within the context
of Hecke orbits, and to finally make progress towards understanding the dynamics
of Hecke operators on mod p Shimura varieties, in the context of the Hecke Orbit
conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
