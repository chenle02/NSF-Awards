9317795 Lang This award continues a cooperative research program using the VLA
and the RATAN 600 radio telescopes to study the sun. It involves collaborative
research, lectures and student involvement that contribute to the education and
development of young scientists in the US and Russia. The coordinated
observations which will be made using three instruments will provide new
information to study large-scale coronal magnetic structures. The observations
will be made at a time of decreased solar activity when the compact, intense
active regions will no longer dominate radio or soft X-ray images, and the large
collecting area of the radio telescopes can be used to delineate the fainter,
large-scale structures. Solar observations taken on the same day by the VLA and
the RATAN 600 will be compared during two one-week visits per year for
scientists to the host country. These visits will also include lectures and
student involvement. ***
