This curriculum project focuses on six courses: Introductory Anatomy &
Physiology, Microanatomy, Developmental Biology, Statistics, Mathematical
Modeling, and Math Seminar. The project addresses the dual problems of: 1)
encouraging biology students to approach their discipline in terms of
quantitative problem solving and; 2) engaging applied mathematics students in
devising and solving mathematical problems which interface with the sciences.
The courses selected are populated by a wide range of students: lower division,
upper division, science major, and non- science major. Through digital
interfaces with microscopes and physiological transducers, the selected biology
courses yield large interactive databases which are compliant to statistical
analysis. These data bases are incorporated into inquiry-based undergraduate
biology laboratory exercises which emphasize statistical methods of analysis. In
addition a mathematics mentoring program is being established. The resultant
exercises and experiences are being disseminated to a large audience through
presentations, the Internet, publications, and commercial distribution. Through
this curriculum development project undergraduate students learn why they need
numerical data and how to generate the necessary data.
