This project will develop and test predictive mathematical models of the
chemical reactions (metabolism) by which maize (corn) transforms the sugars
produced during photosynthesis into compounds such as starch that are stored in
the seeds. The goal is to understand starch metabolism better and provide the
means for enhancing food production. This study will reveal fundamental
principles of metabolic function and dynamics, and provide interdisciplinary
training (in mathematical modeling, genetic engineering and metabolic
biochemistry) to students engaged in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starchy
endosperm (SE) is the major site of carbohydrate and protein storage in cereals,
but atypical constraints complicate detailed resolution of the system. These
include a steady state carbon dioxide level of essentially zero, coincident with
energy-expensive breakdown and re-synthesis of building blocks prior to storage
polymer formation. A major question in SE metabolism is how ATP is generated to
support starch and protein synthesis, and how the photo-assimilate is divided
between catabolic and anabolic pathways. This project will expand upon existing
flux models to account for bio-energetic parameters, and probe the system by
directed genetic modifications that impair specific metabolic nodes. Metabolite
levels and flux maps will be compared between SE from unaltered and mutant
lines. These data will be applied to refine the mathematical models and test
hypotheses of how the system diverts chemical resources for storage compound
accumulation.
