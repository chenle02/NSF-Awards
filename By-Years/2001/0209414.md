&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number
CTS-0209414&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator Shinbrot, Glasser, and
Storm&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation Rutgers U&lt;br/&gt;Title Gordon Research Conference
on Granular and Granular-Fluid Flows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Proposal is seeking support for the first Gordon Research Conference on Granular
and Granular-Fluid Flows, planned for June 30 - July 5, 2002. Granular flow is
an integral part of many industrial and technological processes including
composites and pharmaceuticals to materials processing and semiconductor
manufacturing. The conference is organized to focus on recent developments and
emerging areas of research as well as discussion of the open questions in the
field. Also, the conference promotes collaborations between various disciplines
which overlap with the subject area of the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
