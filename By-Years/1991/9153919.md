The Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education has requested
support for a two-year project to expand a pilot project designed in 1988 into a
systematic and replicable mechanism nationally that advances institutional
change locally through a collaboratively planned and implemented volunteer
program in science, mathematics, and technology. They propose a two-stage
expansion: Phase I involving 20 - 30 project sites, perfecting pilot training
procedures and materials. Phase II involving an additional 100 sites using the
procedures and materials developed in Phase I. The Foundation's support
represent less than 10% of the anticipated project costs, with the private
sector contributions estimated to be on the order of several million dollars.
