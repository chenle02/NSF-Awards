The foundations of computing science need rethinking. This group will convene a
working group at the Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer
Science (ITiCSE) in 2009 in Paris, France to articulate the fundamental
properties of computing and computational thinking, and to explain what
computing curricula built around this way of thinking might look like. Although
much of the previous work in this area has focused on undergraduate majors, this
project is equally important to pre-college, post-baccalaureate, and non-majors
programs. As such, the program will directly address those creating high school
sequences, new PhD programs, concentrations for non-majors who want or need to
continue beyond CS 101 and those who are trying to reach students traditionally
underrepresented in computing. Prior to the meeting, a group using electronic
collaboration tools will draft a rough document describing the motivations for
curricular change and the idea at its heart. We will use electronic
collaboration tools for this phase. Each workshop member will circulate a
description of at least one curriculum and the ways in which it supports or is
supported by the model. At the meeting itself, members will discuss and refine
the draft document. During part of the working group meeting, structured
brainstorming techniques and facilitated discussions will aid in envisioning
alternative curricula at all levels that might build on this idea. These
visions, together with existing case studies will be part of the report. The
working group is made of international scholars and members of industry as well
as academics from the United States from a variety of institutions.
