Bats are one of the best examples of vertebrate evolutionary diversification and
ecological specialization. Furthermore, bat reproductive physiology is extremely
diverse and includes reproductive delays, interruptions in the sequence of
events leading from insemination to birth. Due to their diverse reproductive
physiologies, bats are an excellent system for asking questions about genital
evolution. The hypothesis that bat genital morphology is influenced by sexual
selection will be evaluated by performing an interspecific anatomical
comparative study. The Fellow will determine if reproductive delays facilitate
sexual selection, and examine the nearly undescribed female reproductive
morphology in the context of male morphology. This study will make substantial
contributions to our understanding of genital evolution and the role of delays
in facilitating post-copulatory sexual selection, advancing knowledge of how
sexual selection interacts with physiology and ecology.

Bat reproduction and ecology are linked. If, as predicted, climate change
results in non-linear changes in cues previously used for timing reproduction,
bats may mistime reproduction. This is particularly true for long-lived species
with disjointed reproductive periods such as those with reproductive delays.
Understanding the role of delays in reproduction will help us to predict high
risk species. This project will include several undergraduates from diversity
programs who will be trained in all of the project's methods and mentored for
professional development. The Fellow will maintain her blog aimed at educating
the public about science and bats and will encourage undergraduate researchers
to maintain pages documenting their experiences.
