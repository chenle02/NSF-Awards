TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;While computational modelling can transform the way we
understand, and ultimately design and manufacture materials, such methods have
not yet become pervasive. Modelling of materials requires a diversity of
methods, each tailored according to the problem, and ranging from atomistic
methods requiring "chemical accuracy" (i.e. sub kT per atom), through
approximate quantum methods, MD, mesoscale and continuum. Handshaking across
scales is necessary so that, for example, atomistic calculations quantitatively
inform methods at the mesoscale. Experimental and computational data are needed
to validate codes, to data-mine for high throughput property prediction, and for
top-down model discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are international efforts
in all these areas, and there are already many collaborations in particular
topical areas. However, there are opportunities for larger partnerships that
support methods development, validation and verification, training, data
management, as well as other areas, which will benefit from bringing together
distinct strengths in the EU and US. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will
address three application areas with different needs in simulation tools, often
determined by the length- and time-scales of the relevant science. Energy
Materials and Critical materials often require quantum methods at the nanoscale;
Soft and Bio-Materials require atomistic, molecular, or coarse-grained dynamics;
and Structural Materials often focusses from mesoscale through the
continuum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;The US-EU Materials
Theory and Computation Workshop will explore and report on potential areas of
collaboration between the EU and US scientific communities on topics relevant to
the US Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). Advancing the MGI vision by decreasing
the time to market of important materials discoveries and technologies would be
an economic benefit to the US, EU and world.
