The principal investigator will study the singularities in low dimensional non-
linear real analytic partial differential equations. A key feature of his
approach will be the use of multivalued solutions and a geometric approach to
the study of singularities. A general objective of the research will be to
identify geometric invariants of partial differential equations which control
singularities of solutions. This award will support research in the general area
of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study
of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts
defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
