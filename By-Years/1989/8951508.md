Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras are presently playing a major role in the
collection of astronomical data by professional astronomers. The CCD camera
allows more rapid collection of data with higher quantum efficiency, larger
dynamic range, and a better linear response than traditional photographic
methods. Astronomy departments which intend to train their astronomy majors in
modern techniques must include the collection, analysis, and interpretation of
CCD data. This grant provides funds for a CCD system (Photometrics Star I
system, Photometrics software and IEEE- 488 interface, Photometrics optional
ultraviolet response- enhancement coating, filter wheel, and computer with
Ethernet card) for the University of Texas at Austin undergraduate astronomy
major program. The CCD system will be used on the 16-inch telescope, located on
the Austin campus, for projects which include CCD photometry and astronomy. The
activities developed for it will be published in a new edition of the currently
used laboratory manual. This system will provide astronomy students with tools
to prepare them for the pursuit of careers in modern observational astronomy.
The University of Texas is providing one half of the required funds.
