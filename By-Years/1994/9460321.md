New in situ soil treatments are needed to remediate soil contaminated with toxic
metals. Electrokinetics is an in situ soil remediation technique that involves
the transport of contaminants by applying an electric field between electrodes
inserted in soil. The method involves no excavation or off-site transportation
of contaminated material, and, should be very acceptable to the public in
adjacent communities as a remediation method. However, there are considerable
technical problems to be overcome before this technique can be considered as an
effective means of soil decontamination. The first problem is that during
electrokinetic processing the soil pH around the negative electrode (i.e.,
cathode) rises causing the transport of contaminants to drop and the energy
required to drive the process to increase. A second problem is how to achieve
efficient contaminant migration through the soil. This proposal describes
research to demonstrate the feasibility of two electrochemical innovations that
when applied together will eliminate important technical barriers preventing the
efficient use of electrokinetic processing for soil remediation. These
innovations will prevent high pH at the cathode and will provide a fundamentally
new mechanism for achieving rapid contaminant migration in soil. Phase I
experiments will be carried out using bench scale systems with natural soils
contaminated with heavy metals.
