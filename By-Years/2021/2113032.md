The use of radar in polar science has significantly increased over the past two
decades. This workshop will assess: 1) current and future science and logistical
drivers for radar-data collection, 2) current commercial, modified, and user-
specific radar systems, 3) ongoing radar technology research and development, 4)
equipment and software community access models, 5) radar education and training
needs and options, and 6) approaches to facilitating radar usage in the science
and logistics community. The workshop will deliver a white paper summarizing
critical polar-science questions that drive radar needs as well as community
interest and need in radar hardware, software, expertise, training, and
education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground-penetrating radar and related radar
technologies are commonly used in polar environments for scientific research and
logistical operations. Technical hardware and software research and development
has broadened use of radar over the past few decades. Radar applications in
polar regions include those in glaciology, permafrost and periglacial
environments, near-surface geology and geomorphology, fluvial environments, and
more. The wide applicability of radar and regular development of new
applications has resulted in a high demand for these systems. Unfortunately,
radar systems are often expensive or cost-prohibitive for individual scientists.
And it is challenging for a broad swath of potential end-users to gain access to
radar instrumentation or software for research; to develop the in-house
expertise to collect, analyze, and quantitatively interpret radar results; and
to stay up to date in these methodologies, particularly if radar is used only as
a tool to address a specific science question. These trends underpin the need to
assess the future options for radar within the polar science
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
