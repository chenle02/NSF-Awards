Stellar opacity is the fundamental quantity in stellar models. In recent years
an inexplicable solar abundances anomaly has emerged, between light element
abundances derived spectroscopically and from the most sophisticated atmospheres
models, on the one hand, and interior models consistent with extremely accurate
helioseismological observations, on the other hand. An increase in opacity of
10-20% could perhaps reconcile the currently divergent models, and the primary
aim of this project is to investigate the accuracy of the models and test this
suggestion, focusing on a detailed quantitative re-assessment of opacities. The
work entails more accurate and extensive atomic calculations, including
relativistic effects, an improved equation of state in the "chemical picture",
and high-resolution computation of monochromatic and mean opacities, and
radiative accelerations. The new opacities codes will be interfaced with an
electronic data server for efficient distribution.

The calculation of opacities and radiative accelerations is a symbiotic exercise
in atomic physics, plasma physics, and astrophysics. Although the results will
be generally useful in many stellar studies, the impact will be much wider.
Large-scale high-accuracy atomic data are useful in spectral analysis of
nebulae, active galactic nuclei, supernovae, and other astronomical objects, and
also very helpful in nuclear fusion plasma diagnostics, laser-atom interactions,
and photoionization studies on synchrotron based light sources. Even more
generally, these advanced methods in atomic physics cover important science from
atmospheric research to energy technology.
