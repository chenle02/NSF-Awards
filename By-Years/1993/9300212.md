9300212 Pollock To exploit the fine-grain parallelism in pipelined, superscalar,
and superpipelined machines, various strategies for carefully scheduling
instructions at compile time must be developed. Until recently, instruction
scheduling and register allocation were treated separately. Conflicts in
ordering these two phases reduced the efficiency of the final generated code.
Although several efforts have been made to provide communication between
instruction scheduling and register allocation, these schemes suffer several
significant drawbacks. This research will address the following principal
research problems. Strategies will be developed for communication between
register allocation and instruction scheduling techniques that schedule across
basic block boundaries, in particular, region scheduling and software
pipelining. The impact of integrating register allocation of scalars and
subscripted variables on instruction scheduling will be investigated to develop
cooperative allocation/scheduling schemes. Register allocation and basic block
instruction scheduling will be integrated without sacrificing code efficiency.
The strategies developed will be compared to other existing strategies for code
generation across various architecture configurations and program structures.
