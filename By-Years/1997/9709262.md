The purpose of this project is to conduct fieldwork on Czech language use among
third, fourth, and fifth generation Texas Czechs in order to explore its
significance for ethnic identity. This research will contribute to our
understanding of the place of language change and language loss in the process
of redefining what it means to be a Texas Czech. It aims to reassess
historically motivated perceptions of Czechness among the descendants of
Moravian immigrants, and provide insight into their reasoning about discontinued
language transmission and shifting definitions of Czech speakers. Such
ethnolinguistic study is especially timely because the current--and perhaps
last- -adult generations of Texas Czech speakers experienced the most concerted
attempts at purposeful public language revival, allowing the researcher to
examine its impact on their self- and other-perceived identity, as well as their
language skills and attitudes. In order to retrieve community members' own
views, participant observation will combine discourse-centered and
sociolinguistic methods, using audiotaping of naturally occurring and elicited
speech, and ethnographic notes. This project will contribute a new linguistic-
anthropological perspective to the study of the place of immigrant languages in
American ethnic communities.
