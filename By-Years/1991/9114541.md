This project will continue the time series study of the vent fluids at the
hydrothermal site located a 21 degrees north on the East Pacific Rise. Since
this hydrothermal site was discovery in 1979 three expeditions to this location
have established that the exit temperatures and distinct interfield differences
in fluid composition have remained constant with time at the four vent fields.
This project will allow the principal investigator to document any changes in
chemistry and temperature at each site and will extend the study of this
hydrothermal system to over a decade. The results will improve understanding of
the evolution of seafloor hydrothermal systems and will further constrain the
processes that control the hydrothermal fluxes of elements into the oceans.
