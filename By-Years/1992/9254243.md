Initial work is being conducted toward the goal of instituting a Mathematics
Across the Curriculum program to affect all students at the University of
Nevada, Reno by facilitating the use of mathematics in all core curriculum
classes. A total of 16 faculty from a variety of disciplines as well as
mathematics are engaged in determining specific places where mathematics can be
introduced into the curriculum of core courses. After the original development,
these approaches are being added to the courses. In addition, student Math
Mentors are being trained and employed to assist faculty and students in the
effective application of mathematics in non-mathematics courses. Matching
support is being provided through a Hughes Foundation grant to support the
salary of a director of a Mathematics Center. The long term goal is to translate
success with a similarly-focused Writing Center into a Center devoted to
promoting Mathematics Across the Curriculum.
