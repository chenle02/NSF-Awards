9311451 Jeffries This project will use sub-millimeter solar observations,
including occultation curves of the extreme solar limb obtained during total
eclipses in 1981, 1988, and 1991, to model the solar chromosphere taking account
of inhomogeneous structure and departures from hydrostatic equilibrium. The
eclipse observations cover the wavelength range from 30 to 1300 microns and were
obtained on the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (1981, 1988) and at the James Clark
Maxwell Telescope on July 11, 1991. The analysis will be carried out using
theoretical techniques which we have developed over the past few years, and
which will allow the project to apply the power of LTE diagnostics (offered by
the continuum at these wavelengths) to highly structured, inhomogeneous
chromospheric models. The objective is to obtain the simplest multicomponent
model which can satisfy the eclipse data and the center-to-limb measurements at
these sub-millimeter wavelengths, while remaining consistent with the observed
central disk intensities at other wavelengths and with the morphology shown in
images of the different layers of the solar atmosphere. ***
