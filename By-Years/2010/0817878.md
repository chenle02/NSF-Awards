Recent years have seen a barrage of reports that link the neuropeptides
vasopressin and oxytocin to the control of various social behaviors and a
variety of other functions. For most of these functions, it is unknown
specifically which neurons secrete the neuropeptides that influence them. This
project aims to systematically trace vasopressin and oxytocin innervation of the
brain, using a variety of endocrine, genetic, and neuroanatomical methods. This
will provide a map of vasopressin and oxytocin innervation useful for anybody
that studies these peptides. The project will also develop a strategy to test
the function of specific sets of neuropeptide neurons, by manipulating
vasopressin production in select projections to test the hypothesis that the
sexually dimorphic vasopressin innervation of the brain controls social
recognition memory. Neuropeptides such as vasopressin and oxytocin are often
characterized as modulators of synaptic transmission. In that respect, they are
in a very good position to serve as "gatekeepers," i.e., as substances that
control the flow of information in the brain, thereby influencing the likelihood
that certain behaviors or homeostatic events take place. Although neuropeptides
have been implicated in many different functions, the effects of neuropeptides
are typically better known than the underlying anatomy. In other words, it is
unclear where the gates are that are being kept and also which neurons control
these gates. By addressing this issue for vasopressin, this project will provide
a roadmap for studying the function of neuropeptides in general. Typically,
about five undergraduates work in the PI's laboratory. In addition,
undergraduate students from colleges with traditionally large proportions of
minority students have spent the summer months doing research in the laboratory
and will continue to do so. These students will participate in this project, as
will at least one graduate student and one postdoctoral trainee.
