Sednterp is a computer program designed to enhance the interpretation of
analytical ultracentrifugaton data. The program was first developed as a
collaboration between the University of New Hampshire and Amgen researchers over
ten years ago. Currently, Sednterp exists as a VisualBasic program and it has
enjoyed wide use by the analytical ultracentrifuge community. Now in use for
more than eight years, Sednterp has proven to be a popular and useful tool. It
is, however, becoming dated in its functions, and there have been numerous
requests for additional functionality. A new Web-based version of Sednterp could
enable users around the world to share information, and would provide a good
opportunity to incorporate many of the additional features requested by users.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and programming work will be conducted for
the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Bimolecular Interaction
Technology at the University of New Hampshire. &lt;br/&gt;
