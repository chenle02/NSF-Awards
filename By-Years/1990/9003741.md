Yetter will explore several aspects of the recently discovered interactions
between low-dimensional topology, statistical mechanics, quantum field theory,
Hopf algebra and monoidal category theory. In particular, he will use Hopf
algebra and category theoretic techniques to construct and, if possible,
classify 1) solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and 2) topological and
conformal quantum field theories. Even partial results would shed light on the
meaning and interrelations of the newly discovered polynomial invariants of
classical knots and links.
