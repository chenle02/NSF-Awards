Radio noise generated by "incidental" transmitters such as light switches,
computers, radio and television receivers, and by non- licensed low power radio
devices, e.g. cordless telephones, garage door openers, etc. create serious
interference problems for other users of the radio spectrum. Knowledge of the
noise level generated by incidental and non-licensed radiators is important, for
example for the planning of interference reduction strategies, the design and
siting of radio observatories and other communication systems as well.
Measurements of the noise level generated by different communities are almost
non-existent, however. The P.I has proposed to obtain such measurements from
aircraft, within the 30 to 600 MHz frequency range, approximately. The present
proposal is for a one year extension of the work proposed last year. The
extension will enable the P.I. to study seasonal and cyclical variations of the
noise level, identify some of the main contributors to the noise, and determine
if aggregate effects can be predicted from the knowledge of individual sources.
