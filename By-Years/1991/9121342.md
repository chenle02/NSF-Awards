The 1975 Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act of 1988, requires that all Federal agencies conduct their
business using the metric system of measurement by September 1992, with the
intent of increasing the nation's competitiveness in the world marketplace and
reducing the cost of the government's own operations. Pursuant to this Act, the
National Institute of Building Sciences is providing technical and
administrative support to the Construction Subcommittee of the Metric Operating
Committee of the U.S. Interagency Council on Metric Policy in its efforts to
implement the metric system of measurement in Federal construction. PI proposed
to promote and monitor the metric conversion of design and construction
practices in the U.S., to disseminate information, to develop awareness program
and to support U.S. activities in international standards.
