The Chautauqua Program is providing an annual series of workshops in which
scholars at the frontiers of various sciences and engineering meet intensively
for several days with undergraduate college science and engineering faculty.
These workshops are providing an opportunity for invited scholars to communicate
new knowledge, concepts, and techniques directly to college faculty in ways
which are immediately beneficial to their teaching. The primary aim is to enable
undergraduate faculty in the sciences and engineering to keep their teaching
current and relevant. The program is national in scope and is benefiting large
numbers of undergraduate faculty (1900 participants in the first year, 2125 in
the second year, and 2,375 in the third year). This national program is helping
in attracting and maintaining an adequate supply of graduates in science,
mathematics and engineering. The participants and the various universities
involved in the program are funding the majority of the costs of the program.
NSF is providing decreasing funds over the three year period to cover
recruitment, development, and the Advisory Committee.
