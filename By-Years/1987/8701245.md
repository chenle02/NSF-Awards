Hospital services are needed in earthquake disasters, yet hospitals themselves
are vulnerable institutions which are easily damaged in a major quake. Despite
the importance of hospitals in the post-disaster recovery process, very little
attention has been given in recent years to the unique problems which health
care institutions face in earthquakes. Information on hospital recovery is
limited by the paucity of data about the impacts of urban earthquakes on
hospital structures, on functions of various hospital departments, and on staff,
patients, and visitors in hospitals. This project will fill in the gaps of our
present knowledge about hospital response and recovery by documenting the
impacts, immediate response, interim recovery actions, and long-term recovery
programs at hospitals in the September 19, 1985 Mexico earthquake disaster. The
overall effects of the quake on the multi-tiered health sector in Mexico City
will be examined then a sample of individual hospitals will be analyzed. The
study will examine the structural and nonstructural damage inflicted by the 8.1
M earthquake, particularly on hospitals in Mexico City, and will track and
evaluate the recovery process over an 18-month period, carefully screening the
data gathered and lessons learned for their applicability to the U.S. context.
Descriptive and analytical techniques will be used, based on interviews with key
health sector decision-makers, hospital administrators, department heads,
patients, and staff. The results will provide specific information for specific
groups in the hospital setting and the health care system as a whole about what
they can do to reduce the impacts of an earthquake and restore essential
services.//
