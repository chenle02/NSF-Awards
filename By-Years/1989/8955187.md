Teachers and administrators are ready to integrate more science-related reading
and writing into the curriculum but they lack direction. This project will help
teachers make connections between hands-on scientific inquiry and science
related reading and writing. Year one of the three year project will focus on
the thought processes employed by expert teachers as they attend a summer
program on science related children's literature and inquiry science, read
professional publications, plan for instruction, and evaluate their own
practice. During the second summer the teachers will use information gathered
from scientists, authors of children's science books, librarians, museum staff,
and project personnel to create an in-service program which focuses on one
existing inquiry unit which they have modified to incorporate science reading
and writing. These in-service programs, which will seek to teach the process of
integration as well as the content of hands-on science and science-related
reading and writing, will be field-tested during the 1991-2 academic year.
During the third summer, the master teachers will conduct a five-week institute
to train a second generation of teacher-consultants on integrating science
across the curriculum. Materials from the project which support this type of
inservice and which are based on the experiences of the master teachers will be
then be edited and published by the project staff. This should provide others
with an excellent resource which could be used in every inservice program
designed to encourage teachers to use integrated inquiry based hands-on science
with young children. The cost sharing for the project is 52% of the NSF portion
of the award.
