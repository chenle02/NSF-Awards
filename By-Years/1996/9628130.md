Fornaess 9628130 Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan will
purchase sophisticated graphics equipment, namely, Silicon Graphics Indigo2 with
the extreme graphics package and the Extreme Graphics System for Power
Challenge, which will be dedicated to the research in the mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: Visualization of two dimensional complex dynamics -- J.E. Fornaess
and E. Gavosto; Simulation, singular-value decomposition, and visualization in
investigation of multiple-pinhole emission tomographs -- J. Aarsvold;
Computational study of vortex sheet motion -- R. Krasny; Visualization of
function theoretic objects -- D. E. Barrett; Interface problems using level set
methods -- P. Smereka. The equipment will be placed in a Visualization
Laboratory, where it will also be available for use by graduate students and
postdoctoral appointees working on these and related projects.
