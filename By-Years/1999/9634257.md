A medical risk factor is a condition that increases the likelihood that a person
will contract a disease. The term pervades current writing and discussion about
health, with physicians incorporating the idea in their daily practice, members
of the public altering behaviors in way intended to reduce risk, insurers
setting rates in accordance with their assessments of risk, and Congress
enacting laws and spending funds to alter public exposure to risk factors. In
short, the idea of a risk factor has become a real influence in current thinking
about health and social behavior. Yet we know little about the origins of this
concept, which was formed at the intersection of probability and statistics,
public health, and the insurance industry. We also know little about how it
became accepted, then relied upon, by various members of society. To address
these gaps in our knowledge, this project will examine the history and current
status of the medical risk factor, with specific attention to its application in
coronary heart disease, using as source material life insurance archives,
specialized journals, popular publications, and other secondary sources.
