Distribution and Biosynthesis of Plant Lectins. The proposed research extends
Dr. Etzler's work on the biosynthesis, distribution and regulation of a family
of lectin proteins from the legume, Dolichos biflorus that have recently been
characterized. It addresses such questions as what are the biosynthetic steps
leading to the different subcellular distributions of these proteins and how is
the biosynthesis regulated. Lectins are proteins, originally identified in
plants, that bind certain sugar moieties in a highly specific manner. The
physiological role(s) of lectins is still unknown but their widespread
occurrence implies their importance. It has been suggested that they act as
recognition molecules. The results of this study should contribute to an
eventual understanding of the physiological role of plant lectins as well as
provide basic information on the spatial and temporal regulation of the
production of closely related proteins.
