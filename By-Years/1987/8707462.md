The objective of this research is to determine the frequency, associations, and
phase relationships of proxy indicators of wind stress and upwelling and Pacific
storm cyclogenesis as well as associated changes in carbon and oxygen isotopes.
These variations will be fixed in time with the air of varves and accelerator
mass spectroscopy 14-C dating. Newly discovered varved sediments on the
continental slope off California contain evidence of climatic variation across a
frequency spectrum ranging from one to several thousand years. There are few
paleoclimatic records that can provide information as to changes occurring on
the 2 to 10 year timescale of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation. Such a record
may exist in the laminated sediments that occur on the California-Oregon
continental margin. Anderson and Gardner will use these sediments to reconstruct
the late Pleistocene and Holocene history of climate variability on these short
timescales, an effort of direct interest to the Climate Dynamics Program and the
Abrupt Climate Change initiative.
