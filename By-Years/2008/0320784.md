The use of graphite fiber composites to fabricate mirrors and telescope
structures promises to make available, in the near term, a versatile and cost-
effective tool for optical astronomy, including the economical fabrication and
operation of telescopes ranging from small (&lt;1 m) aperture for education and
research to extremely large (30 m+) segmented telescopes (ELTs) for cutting-edge
research. The focus of this research is a three-year program to develop, test,
and decisively demonstrate the astronomical capabilities of this technology. A
1m-class research telescope will be designed, tested, and operated at Mt. Laguna
Observatory, a dark and remote observing site 50 miles east of San Diego.
Progress in this field will allow greater access to affordable, state-of-the-art
telescopes for educational and public institutions at all levels.
