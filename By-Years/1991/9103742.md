Proposed Mechanisms for the production of chlorine vapor from sea-salt aerosol
in the marine boundary layer have important implications for tropospheric
chemistry, but are as yet poorly understood. Acid-base desorption generates
relatively unreactive HCl, whereas reactions involving non-acidic N gases and
ozone and other selected reactive species produce highly reactive chlorine
compounds which will initiate photochemical reactions in an analogous manner to
OH. In addition, such reactions may represent and important tropospheric sink
for ozone and other selected reactive species. This research is aimed at
developing new measurement capabilities for assessing interactions of reactive
chlorine with ozone and other selected reactive species, in the marine
troposphere. The specific research objectives include: 1. Assessing sampling
artifacts for species of interest and 2. Measuring major hypothesized product
and reactant species involved in chlorine phase change as a function of phase
and particle size.
