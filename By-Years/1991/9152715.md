The goal of this project is to increase understanding and awareness of
recombinant DNA technology so that non-science majors are better prepared to
make relevant connections between science and their everyday experience. Gel
electrophoresis equipment and computer workstations provide undergraduate women
served by this institution with experience in DNA analysis and a practical
working knowledge of genetic engineering, and allow students to visualize the
laboratory techniques and to experience more complex laboratories without the
expense of additional equipment or knowledge of more difficult laboratory
methods.
