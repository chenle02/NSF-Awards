Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) requests funding
to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The
instruments will be used aboard the research vessels ISELIN, a 170 foot vessel,
and CALANUS, a 64 foot vessel. Both vessels are owned and operated by RSMAS. All
of the instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of scientists. The PI
will purchase computer upgrades, improvements to the MOCNESS system, a new
rosette pylon, a CTD altimeter, and a piston corer.
