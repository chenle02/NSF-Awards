The goal of this research is to understand the economic factors producing
different policy outcomes in open economies, and to evaluate in a quantitative
fashion the implications for global welfare of the increasing integration of
world financial markets. To further the first component of this plan, the
project studies game-theoretic models of discretionary policymaking, assuming
that the private sector has rational expectations. Central issues include the
possibility of default on public debt and the role of currency devaluation in
financial crises. The second component of the work calculates measures of the
gains to countries from the ability to pool country-specific risks
internationally, and to borrow and lend. Linkages between international capital
mobility and long-run economic growth rates will also be studied. This project
has the potential to explain certain empirical features of international capital
markets. In addition, the findings are relevant for judging the likely benefits
of measure to integrate capital markets further - such as the current
initiatives within the European Community - or the costs of measures to restrict
capital movements, which sometimes are proposed on macroeconomic grounds.
