0309242 Jovanelly This award will support a U.S. graduate student to conduct
research in East Asia. The primary goals of the East Asia Summer Institute
program are to expose students to East Asia science and engineering in the
context of a research laboratory, and to initiate personal relationships that
will foster research collaborations with foreign counterparts in the future.
This project will provide the student with first-hand research experience, an
introduction to science and science policy infrastructure, and orientation to
culture and language in East Asia.
