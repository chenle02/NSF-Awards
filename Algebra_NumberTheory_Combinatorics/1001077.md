This project is in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, and is concerned
with the study of moduli spaces of abelian varieties and p-divisible groups, and
in particular with that of Shimura varieties and their local models. Questions
about the geometry and cohomology of these arithmetic spaces arise naturally
within the framework of the Langlands program. The proposed investigation
focuses on two distinct but interralated problems. The first one is global and
pursues the study of the Galois representations contributing to the cohomology
of Shimura varieties focusing on ramified primes. T o do so, the PI proposes to
extend the integral theory for Shimura varieties and their arithmetical
compactifications to include primes of bad reduction, building on work of Kisin
for Shimura varieties of Hodge type and on work of Chai, Faltings and Pink for
arithmetical compactification of PEL type. The second problem is local and aims
to identifying which reprensetations of a given p-adic group contribute to the
cohomology of local models of Shimura varieties. In particular, the PI plans to
purse new instances of a conjecture of Harris by a combination of local and
global methods. Langlands' conjectures explore the interrelation between
seemingly unrelated objects in two distinct fields: automorphic forms in
harmonic analysis and Galois representations in number theory. An automorphic
form is an analytic function of several complex variables, possessing many self-
similarities. A Galois representation is a realizations of the symmetries
existing among the solutions to a polynomial equation in one variable as
matrices. Langlands' original idea was to pursue a connection between these two
theories by the medium of some other functions, called L-functions. On one hand,
the prospected correspondences are a way of organizing the analytic objects in
terms of the number theoretic ones. On the other, their existence would provide
answers to many open questions in number theory. This project is aimed to study
those arithmetical spaces which are expected to encoded in their geometry
instances of these correspondences.
