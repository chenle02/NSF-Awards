Despite the important role that earthquakes and seismology play in the Earth
sciences, there has been up until now no good way to visualize the process by
which an earthquake generates waves that propagate throughout the Earth. These
seismic waves are important because they cause destruction in many parts of the
world, are used to determine the location and size of the earthquakes, and are
the means by which geologists have mapped out the interior of the Earth. Without
a way to visualize the process of seismic waves spreading throughout the Earth
after an earthquake, it has been very hard to explain this phenomenon and for
students to understand it. The difficultly lies in the fact that the production
of such an animation requires advanced geophysical algorithms, high-speed
computational capabilities, and a strong dedication to use these research
capabilities for an educational purpose. This project meets this need by
producing a computer-graphics color animation that accurately represents the
propagation of seismic waves from an earthquake, available to educators in both
VHS-video and computer formats. The project is based on a prototype of such a
video-animation recently made by the PI. The production of a realistic
visualization of earthquake wave propagation through the Earth is computation
ally intensive. The prototype took 5 months of computation on a Sun Sparcstation
10/41. The animation will not only give viewers an intuitive feel for the
internal structure and layering of our planet, but also teach the principle of
wave physics applied to the Earth, showing waves reflecting, refracting, and
diffracting along the different layers within our planet. The computer animation
will be narrated, presenting an educational discussion of earthquakes, their
destructive capabilities, their relation to plate tectonics, and their role in
mapping the details of the interior of the Earth.
