0915503 CSR:Small:Efficient and Predictable Memory Hierarchies for High-
Performance Embedded Systems

Abstract

High-end embedded systems are increasingly used for complex computation, such
as advanced image processing and speech processing. Such complex tasks often
involve irregular data structures such as linked data structures, or exhibit
irregular access patterns even with regular data structures. Managing scratchpad
memory for such tasks becomes increasingly challenging due to the difficulty of
determining addresses that will be accessed in the future. For such complex
applications, hardware-managed storage (caches) can perform relatively well
without much programming effort. However,caches do not offer predictability
required to derive a tight worst case execution time (WCET) bound in real-time
systems, due to their dynamic behavior that is difficult to predict at compile
time.

The goal of the project is to explore a new intelligent real-time cache, which
offers ease of storage management as well as allows programs to control caching
behavior with low overheads, providing predictability that supports real time
analysis. The work consists of: (1) Instruction and architecture support that
provides primitives to control cache behavior with low overheads, (2)Development
compile-time analysis and run-time support to support the new cache, and
(3)Proof-of-concept of the proposed system.

Improved memory performance and predictability will be to make computer systems
more efficient, enable more challenging problems to be solved, and improve
energy-efficiency of existing applications. This project will also extend
outreach to undergraduate and high-school students about the value of
engineering to society and attract more students into the field. It will also
benefit the public by disseminating research results through publications and
tool releases.
