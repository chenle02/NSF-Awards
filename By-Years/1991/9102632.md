This research involves the following principle: imposing large loading on
asymmetric systems results in highly oscillatory behavior. The greater the
asymmetry, the larger the number of oscillatory solutions. This research applies
this principle in one form or another to nonlinear boundary value problems of
elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic type as well as with ordinary differential
equations and Hamiltonian systems. In the periodic case, there is a considerable
body of information which suggests that some of these solutions are
asymptotically stable and commonly occurring. This work has led to new insights
into nonlinear periodic oscillations in suspended masses, rods and beams, and in
floating beams. This research is in the general area of applied mathematics. The
project involves a mixture of analytic theory, functional analysis, numerical
and computational analysis, and an extension of these results to concrete
engineering problems such as the structure of bridges and ships.
