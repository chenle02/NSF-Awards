Mass Spectrometric Tracer Pulse Chromatography will be used to investigate
phase-distribution equilibria in a variety of systems, including 1) a study of
the basic retention mechanisms in supercritical fluid chromatography, 2)
surface-coverage programming strategies for gas-solid chromatography, 3) a
fundamental investigation of "excess" and "absolute" adsorption of supercritical
fluid mixtures, and 4) a thorough exploration of the effect of supercritical
carbon dioxide on the phase transitions and sorption properties of polymers. The
common theme of all these projects is the investigations of weak molecular
interactions. The phase-distribution isotherm data will be valuable for the
development of fundamental adsorption and solution theoretical models, and
information on supercritical fluid chromatographic mechanisms will aid in the
development of new separation schemes. %%% Fundamental studies of the phenomena
which will be investigated in this project are crucial for better understanding
of a wide variety of physical and chemical processes, such as chromatography,
catalysis, polymer processing and extraction schemes.
