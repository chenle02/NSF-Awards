SGER: Interfacial Mechanics of Carbon Nanotube-Polymer Composites &lt;br/&gt;M.
A. Haque, the Pennsylvania State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though the
superior electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes opens
up possibilities of novel composite materials, superiority of the nanotubes
alone does not guarantee superior composites because the composite properties
strongly depend on the strength of the nanotube-matrix interfaces. Existing
studies on polymer-nanotube interfaces are indirect and/or qualitative, which
motivates this exploratory research to develop a novel experimental setup that
will allow, for the first time, simultaneously qualitative and quantitative
nanotube pull-out testing in-situ in the Transmission Electron Microscope. The
PI will design and fabricate a MEMS device with pico-Newton force and nanometer
displacement resolutions. Physical processes of polymer-nanotube interfacial
deformation and failure will be identified and quantified to model the
interfacial mechanics at the nanoscale without relying on simple scaling down
approach. The findings will also advance our understanding of two closely
related interface effects, adhesion and friction, in context of the
nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
