Fully nonlinear and higher order equations in geometry

Abstract. The work described in this proposal lies at the intersection of three
fields: higher order elliptic partial differential equations, fully nonlinear
equations, and differential geometry. The equations we study are geometric in
origin, and given by elementary symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues of the
Weyl-Schouten tensor, specifically under conformal deformations of the metric.
There is a strong structural analogy between this problem and the more classical
problem of prescribing the curvature(s) of a surface in three-dimensional space.
To analyze our equations we use techniques from the field of fully nonlinear and
higher order elliptic equations. The geometric consequences are most interesting
in low dimensions: for example, we have developed a technique for constructing
large families of conformal manifolds which admit metrics with positive Ricci
curvature,

The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back to at least the eighteenth
century, and yet continues to be an important and highly active field of
mathematical research. The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire
to understand certain properties of the physical world, and differential
geometry was developed to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example,
the curvature of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space by matter
predicted by general relativity. In the same way that Descartes realized that
plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be
studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations. This
research in this proposal involves several such problems from Riemmanian and
conformal geometry, whose analysis requires techniques from various fields
within mathematical analysis.
