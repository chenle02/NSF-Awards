The PI proposes to work on a series of projects that incorporate techniques
from algebra, geometry, and topology, with a view to applications in all three
of these fields. More precisely, the PI proposes to work on the following four
circles of ideas: (1) Answering various classical questions in topology (such as
the Novikov conjecture, the Borel conjecture, computation of the algebraic
K-theory) under suitable geometric hypotheses on the spaces. (2) Working on
problems related to the quasi-isometric classification of finitely generated
groups. (3) Exploring the boundary between the space of CAT(-1) metrics and the
space of negatively curved Riemannian metrics on a fixed manifold. (4) Studying
the topology (cohomology, bounded cohomology, submanifolds) of locally symmetric
spaces. These projects are intended to exhibit the interdependence of methods
and results between the three fields of algebra (primarily group theory),
geometry (negatively curved spaces) and topology (both geometric and algebraic).

Groups are sets equipped with a "multiplication", and classically arose as
symmetries of underlying geometric objects. Geometry is the study of properties
of spaces equipped with some additional structure, usually of a metric nature
(i.e. allowing one to measure distances in the space). In the field of topology,
one forgets about the underlying distance, and only retain the notion of points
in the space being "close together". While these three fields have always had
some overlap, research from the last twenty years have led to an increasingly
fertile exchange of ideas and applications amongst them. The PI's research is
intended to further develop the links between these three fields.
