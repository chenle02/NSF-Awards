Crystal growth from high temperature solutions is used to create new oxide
materials with complex structures and desirable luminescent properties. Several
approaches to the crystal growth from high temperature solutions are being
pursued to create different classes of luminescent materials for solid-state
lighting applications, including the use of high temperature solutions to grow
new complex rare earth containing oxides for solid state lighting and
upconversion applications; and the use of fluxes stable under highly reducing
conditions for the crystal growth of complex Eu2+ containing phosphors. In
addition, this research investigates the process of crystal growth in fluxes
using in-situ at the Diamond beam line in the UK, aiming to reveal the
materialization of intermediates that are typically neither observed nor
isolated, and the formation of the final product. In the short term, the
information gained from the in-situ work is used to optimize the crystal growth
experiments, while in the long run this understanding transforms flux crystal
growth from an empirical method to a more deliberate
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of solid state lighting materials is
focused on the development of energetically more efficient and visually more
pleasing light emitting phosphors. To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates,
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting-edge
techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of
the art instrumentation. This project provides education and research training
to students (including women and underrepresented minorities) and helps to
prepare a skilled workforce for academia and industry.
