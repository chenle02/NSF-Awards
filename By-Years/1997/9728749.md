9728749 Silver This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a
geodetic global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver system and five mobile
computers for use in active tectonic field research. This proposal is the
Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) counterpart of a companion research proposal
submitted to the Geophysics (PH) program (EAR-9725792) which has recently been
recommended for award. The research focus is to determine, via GPS field
campaigns, the distribution of strain across the convergent margin in Papua New
Guinea. The PI, together with Papua New Guinean collaborators from UNITECH, will
establish a GPS network in Papua New Guinea in June 1998 and again in June 2000
to measure baselines. This instrumentation proposal will provide a single GPS
receiver system that will be monumented and left in Papua New Guinea so that
scientists from UNITECH can re- measure baselines between field campaigns
conducted by UC-Santa Cruz scientists. Thus, this collaboration provides not
only additional valuable baseline data in an area of rapid deformation and
potential earthquake hazards, but also serves as a fruitful technology transfer
to scientists within Papua New Guinea and their students. ***
