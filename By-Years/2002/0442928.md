Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing a robust
framework for integrating visualizations such as control structure diagrams, UML
class diagrams, and dynamic data structure views that are recognized mechanisms
for teaching fundamental programming concepts. The framework is based on jGRASP,
a lightweight prototype environment that has been extremely well received by
students, educators, and publishers. It includes a comprehensive object viewer
API and interactive view builder, and is determining the impact of jGRASP with
respect to its use and effect in CS1, CS2, algorithms, and object-oriented
design courses. Static and dynamic visualizations are generated directly from a
student's program before, during, and after its execution. Baseline object
viewers for Java collections classes will be provided, and a view builder and
API facilitate Plug-in object viewers to provide additional visualizations for
specialized data structures. These integrated object viewers produce "live"
visualizations of the student's program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit. Recent research on scalable visualizations for complex and algorithm
animation suggests the need for a creative and original pedagogical teaching
technique based on tightly integrated visualizations. This project is
integrating research results from these and other research efforts into the
jGRASP framework. This is providing an important new tool that exploits the
power of visualizations to enhance computer science and software engineering
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This project includes the
participation of faculty and students from diverse institutions, including high
schools, two-year and four-year colleges, and HBCUs. The full-scale jGRASP being
developed in this project is being downloaded and used by these as well as other
institutions around the world.
