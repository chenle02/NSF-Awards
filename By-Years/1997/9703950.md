This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build on the
successful imaging Raman instrument demonstrated in Phase I, and produce second-
generation instruments and software which fully exploit the potential of this
new technique. In Phase I, chemical species were imaged using a narrowband
liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and CCD camera integrated into a Raman
microscope. Diffraction-limited spatial images were obtained with complete (and
spatially independent) Raman spectra at each pixel in the image, yielding an
image cube with two spatial axes and one spectral axis. The novel LCTF approach
renders high-definition Raman imaging feasible for the first time, and brings
the power and specificity inherent in Raman spectral analysis to the imaging of
chemical species. In Phase II, key improvements will be made: transmission will
be doubled (or more) based on a high-efficiency design identified in Phase I,
and the longwavelength limit will be extended from the present 700 nm to 1050
nm. Such an LCTF appears to offer near-revolutionary benefits in certain
applications including semiconductor analysis, biomedical imaging, and
pharmaceutical research. Performance in these areas will assessed experimentally
in Phase II. Finally, data analysis methods will be developed to extract
chemical species information from the large, spatially resolved datasets
involved. Commercial sales of LCTF Raman imaging systems are estimated at $21M
over the next 5 years, for research, semiconductor, diamond, pharmaceutical, and
power generation industries.
