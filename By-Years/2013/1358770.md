This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas Christian
University provides seven undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to
participate in research on topics in atomic, molecular, bio, chemical, and
statistical physics, as well as astronomy and planetary science. In addition to
participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will
engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on
track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the
end of the program, every student will have given a formal presentation about
their work; prepared a conference poster and a 10-page report.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts. The
site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups
underrepresented in physics and astronomy and has at its goal to recruit
students from non-research focused institutions. The project plans to be
informed by both short term and long term evaluations and is guided by an
advisory committee.
