The southeastern US is a hotspot of biological diversity and hosts some of the
more unique coastal ecosystems in North America. The natural resources of the
southeast region also face increased threats from a fast-growing population and
abrupt changes in climate. The Mentoring and Research Opportunities for Careers
in Coastal Science (MROC2S) program will study how organisms and ecosystems
respond to changes in climate conditions that are expected to result in
community shifts and impacts to ecosystem services in this region. The MROC2S
program brings together a network of scientists, educators, and experts from
various sectors to provide training for participants from groups traditionally
underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) and those
with limited research experience in a cohort setting, with the intent of
developing the next generation of natural resource professionals. The main goal
of the program is to provide year-round mentoring, professional development, and
diverse research training opportunities in natural resource science for
postbaccalaureate participants. By doing so, MROC2S aims to develop a strong and
inclusive research and technical skills program that produces a more diverse
STEM workforce. Program participants are integrated into a broad network of
natural resource professionals in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Gulf Coast
regions, with the goal of exposing them to careers and opportunities in this
field. Network partners contribute to a common scientific theme that centers on
the restoration, conservation, and management of natural resources of the
southeastern US. As participants, program fellows contribute to the rich history
of collaborative work and long-term data collection that helps guide and inform
research efforts in this ecologically resource-rich and diverse region of the
US. Using long-term data from core sites coupled with skill training and
mentoring resources to guide the research, the collaborative network will lead
to professional development of participants, enabling them to pursue careers in
coastal and natural resource science. Furthermore, the activities and
experiences provided by the program are guided by a theoretical framework that
leads to scientific integration and a sense of belonging to the scientific
community among participants. This framework incorporates critical environmental
agency to further develop participantsâ€™ science self-efficacy, identity, and
sense of belonging.
