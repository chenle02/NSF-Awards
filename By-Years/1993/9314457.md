Cavanaugh 9314457 This project will study the biogeography of chemoautotrophic
symbioses in marine oligochaetes. The objectives are to answer the following
questions: Are the symbionts species-specific? What are their phylogenetic
relationships among each other, to symbionts from other marine phyla, and to
free-living bacteria? Are the symbionts within a monophyletic host group
themselves monophyletic? If they did not co-evolve with their host, is the
symbiont distribution paralleled by its ecological or geographic distribution?
These questions can be addressed with a technically straightforward approach by
analyzing the ribosomal RNA sequences of the prokaryotic symbionts in hosts from
four geographically distant locations (Bermuda, Belize, Australia and the New
England coast). The significance of the project lies in its ability to
characterize for the first time the taxonomy, phylogeny, and biogeography of
chemoautotrophic symbionts in a phylum previously not investigated. The results
will show how wide spread the symbioses are and contribute to a better
understanding of the biodiversity of chemoautotrophic symbioses in marine
habitats. ***
