Understanding of the structure of the four-dimensional universe in which we live
is a key topic of investigation in modern mathematics and physics. Gauge theory
is a crucial tool for the study of the mathematical structures that provide the
context for standard models of the physical world. The research supported by
this project will develop new mathematical tools and theories that will help
test such models and advance our understanding of four-dimensional spaces. A key
mathematical idea is the interaction between three-dimensional theories known as
Floer theories and the study of invariants of four-dimensional spaces. In
addition the project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and extend invariants
including abelian gauge theoretic models, cobordism invariants arising from the
critical values of Morse like functions such as Daemi's Gamma invariant,
equivariant extensions such as equivariant singular instanton knot homology, and
new parameterized invariants that combine Konno adjunction-style complexes with
homotopy invariants of families. It will also translate structures uncovered in
some gauge theory packages to other packages, for example translating L-space
notions from Heegaard Floer theory to analogues in the instanton case, or
equivariant structures from the Seiberg-Witten Floer theory to the Heegaard
Floer theory. Topological applications will include new insights into knot
concordance, homology cobordism, diffeomorphism groups of 4-manifolds, and SU(2)
representations of 3-manifold groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
