The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines for
conditions such as COVID-19. The ability to accurately determine if cells are
infected with virus is crucial for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccine
candidates. Currently, determining if a virus is infectious is done by infecting
cells and waiting for them to die, which can take many days. The proposed
technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of cells for
signs of virus. This can be done within hours of infection instead of days,
which can greatly accelerate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. In
addition, it is simpler because the AI analysis is automated and does not need
special probes or dyes to detect viruses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project will collect images of cells infected with various viruses imaged with
automated microscopes. AIs will be trained to distinguish healthy and sick cells
at various times after infection. The project will study many different viruses
and the changes they induce in cells. The trained AIs will be used to process
infectivity assays. The software will run on remote data centers and thus images
will be uploaded for analysis and reporting. An AI can be trained using images
from the common 96-well plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
