This project is enhancing the learning opportunities for low income,
academically talented students by offering forty (40) scholarships annually
through the &lt;br/&gt;Computer Science, Mathematics, and Technology (CMT)
Academic Rewards Program. Objectives include increasing the number of members of
under-represented groups majoring in CMT, increasing retention to degree
completion, encouraging academic success through developing a learning community
cohort with tutoring and mentoring, and enhancing partnerships with area
industry and institutions of higher education to ensure increased transfer rates
and employment opportunities for Scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit. A CMT Project Advisory Team comprised of faculty, staff, and industry
representatives is responsible for recruiting eligible applicants, selecting
scholars, ensuring their success through mentoring and access to support
services, and providing guidance on maintaining and enhancing program
activities. College support provided to the scholars includes recruitment,
advising, an array of student support services and career placement. The
scholars are part of an active learning community cohort designed to help them
succeed as students and later as professionals.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts. The program is resulting in an overall increase in retention,
graduation, and transfer rates of CMT students and increasing the numbers of
students and graduates from underrepresented populations entering CMT careers.
The project has a long-term benefit to society by filling jobs in high demand
areas and increasing the successful entry of women and minorities into these
fields. &lt;br/&gt;
