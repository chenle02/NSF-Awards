Professor Bernstein is analyzing major issues involving scientists (mostly
physicists) and nuclear-weapons policy. These issues include radiological
weapons, 1941-54; the development of tactical nuclear weapons, 1943-54; and the
quest for the H-bomb, 1942-54, including the establishment of Livermore Lab and
the 1952 and 1954 efforts to secure a test-ban. In this study, Professor
Bernstein is examining the roles of leading scientists in weapons and defense
policy: their thinking about the development, deployment, and use of weapons;
their efforts to slow, redirect, or propel the buildup of the nuclear arsenal;
their actual influence on weapons policy; their relationship to the military and
AEC funding; and these scientists' beliefs about the ethical responsibilities of
scientists. This research is partly an effort to understand the rise of the
defense scientists by studying their activities, in depth, in the development of
these weapons. This research has grown out of Professor Bernstein's earlier work
on World War II and postwar policy. The study is based heavily on archival
research in over 45 collections, and also on use of oral histories and on
interviews or correspondence with over 20 scientists.
