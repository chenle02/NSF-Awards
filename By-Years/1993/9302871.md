9302871 Brass This project will examine the clay minerals in cores collected
from the Cariaco Basin off Venezuela. Variations in clay mineralogy will be used
to infer the history of river drainage from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers and
how it was affected by rising sea level at the end of the last glacial period.
The results will have implications for understanding weathering patterns in
South America under differ climate conditions. ***
