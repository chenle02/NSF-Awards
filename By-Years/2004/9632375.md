Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE) will conduct a
workshop in December 1996 and a series of meetings on the FUture of MArine
GEoSciences (FUMAGES). The workshop's main objective is to initiate a dialogue
within the marine geoscience community and between the community and NSF to
determine what steps might be taken to maintain the health of Marine
Geosciences. The prospect of declining, or flat funding levels, as well as the
elimination, drastic cuts, and changes in other agencies' focus in marine
geoscience programs have major implications for the ocean science community. The
task of workshop participants will be to help identify the fundamental science
questions in various subdisciplines of marine geosciences to establish a sound
intellectual basis for future discussions and program development.
