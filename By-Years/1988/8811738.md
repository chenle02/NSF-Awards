By means of a law of large numbers and central limit theorem, the author wishes
to compare stochastic and deterministic models of a chemical reaction with
diffusion. The proposed methods will exploit the smoothing properties of the
relevant contraction semigroup more fully than previous work and reflect
underlying large deviation behavior. The methods developed can be used for
proving regularity results for stochastic evolution equations having a
discontinuous and non Gaussian martingale term. The stochastic model is to be
reformulated as a measure valued diffusion. This investigator works in the field
of probability, in the area of stochastic processes. He is working on models of
chemical reactions which have been actively investigated by other researchers
for the last 15 years. His results will not only significantly aid in the
understanding of these reactions but will also contribute to the set of tools
mathematicians employ in attacking certain problems.
