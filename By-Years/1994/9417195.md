Mathieu 9417195 This is a two part project to study pre-main sequence binaries
with orbital periods of a few years or less. The first is a high precision
radial velocity survey of about 400 of these stars using the new Wisconsin-
Indiana-Yale-NOAO (WIYN) 3.5m telescope and multi-object spectrograph. It is
expected that about 50 binaries with periods of less than 1000 days, triple the
present number, will be found. The second is an enlargement of a previous
successful survey for submillimeter continuum emission from protostellar disks
associated with these binary stars using the new submillimeter array detector at
the JC Maxwell Telescope. The results will be accurate enough to resolve whether
the reduced continuum emission from 5-50 AU separation binaries, those embedded
in disks, are due to the binary formation processes or from dynamical torques
later clearing gaps in the disks. ***
