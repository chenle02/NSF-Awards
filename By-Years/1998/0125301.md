The project combines field and experimental approaches to investigate the
sources,&lt;br/&gt;transformations, transport, and fates of dissolved,
particulate and sedimentary organic matter in the&lt;br/&gt;Beaufort and Chukchi
Seas. This project will take advantage of the specificity that molecular
organic&lt;br/&gt;markers of organisms and their processes can provide to
understand how the Western Arctic shelves&lt;br/&gt;produce, metabolize and
sequester carbon, a question central for the SBI program. The proposed
studies&lt;br/&gt;are closely linked with proposed research in other SBI phase
II projects as well as international programs to&lt;br/&gt;give an integrated,
pan-Arctic view of C and N cycling. The proposed research is directed by
the&lt;br/&gt;following central hypotheses: 1) On time scales of physical
transport across the shelf-basin boundary and interior ocean (years to decades),
terrestrial organic matter contains specific, conservative biomarkers that trace
riverine discharge; 2) Biological processing in shelf waters dictates the
molecular signatures of organic matter deposited in sediments and exported to
the Basin; 3) Episodic marine primary production fuels benthic
production.&lt;br/&gt;
