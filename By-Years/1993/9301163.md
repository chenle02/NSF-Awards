The investigation concerns the generation of nonlinear sloshing waves which run
cross-wise to a rectangular channel as opposed to along it. The research
involves components of experimentation, mathematical analysis and numerical
computation. Also required is the construction and installation of a wavemaker
instrumental in generating the sloshing waves. A mathematical model will be
developed to analyse the observations and provide a basis for the pertinent
numerical methods and solutions.
