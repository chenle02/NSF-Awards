This grant will support continued work on the mechanics of sedimentary wedges.
The PIs have developed a kinematic and thermal model of an eroding critically
tapered fold-and-thrust belt, using the steady-state fold-and-thrust belt in
western Taiwan as the center piece of modelling efforts. The principal new
project is to extend mechanical and thermal models to the extensional
counterparts of compressive wedge, namely the normally faulted wedges of
material that overly shallow angle detachment faults. The PIs have developed a
critical taper model of these structures which (like the model of a
compressional wedge) requires good structural and especially pore-fluid pressure
data to be tested. They have recently acquired an extensive set of industrial
seismic and drilling data from the Brazos Ridge extensional wedge in the Gulf of
Mexico for this purpose. They will develop a complete mechanical, kinematic and
thermal model of an extensional wedge, using the Brazos wedge as the main
example.
