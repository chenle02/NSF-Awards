The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is significant
from both economic and societal standpoints. There are 8 million people in the
US who are Visually Impaired (VI). A large percent of adults with VI are
unemployed. This platform helps to address these challenges by allowing VI
individuals to be physically and socially mobile. The platform reads characters
and identifies objects and communicates this information to the user. When the
VI user needs immediate help, the system can stream a video feed to friends or
family members to provide immediate support. This platform creates value through
reducing the demands placed on VI caregivers. It is also expected to reduce
insurance premiums by minimizing accidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project combines AI (Artificial Intelligence) and community based peer-to-peer
support. This technology uses well tested AI features such as character and
object recognition. By eliminating the high end features of AI, both uncertainty
and costs are reduced. The other technology, the peer-to-peer support system,
typically uses either paid or unpaid helpers. For peer-to-peer support, this
system includes helpers identified by the users. By blending proven features of
two technologies and allowing the users to use their own helpers, this system
represents a new innovative and customized technology. The Visually Impaired
(VI) population can potentially use the platform with ease and
comfort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
