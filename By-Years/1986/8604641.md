Composites are fast becoming important engineering materials for variouus
application. Dynamic mechanical equipment will be purchased for conducting
polymer processing research. Using this equipment, research will be conducted on
on-line, real-time monitoring and control of composity curing. This technique
will represent a versatile and reliable methodology in quality assurance,
process control, and automation of composity production.
