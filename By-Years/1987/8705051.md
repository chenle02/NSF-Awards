Many in situ tests require that a device be pushed, at a fairly slow rate,
vertically into the ground. This is commonly achieved with a hydraulic ram
assembly mounted on a large vehicle. A multi-purpose research vehicle will be
outfitted for in situ geotechnical testing. The equipment will allow for better
characterization, analysis, and understanding of the behavior of porous (soft)
soils in their natural setting. In addition, the research will provide new
instrumentation and calibration procedures needed for studies on penetration
mechanisms in soft soils.
