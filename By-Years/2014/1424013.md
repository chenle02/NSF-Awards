The state courts of last resort are significant final decisionmakers in many
areas states govern, including family, many business disputes, and criminal law.
Second, it has long been a matter of common scholarly wisdom that courts do not
tend to go against dominant political coalitions or major public policy
initiatives of executives who are in power. We have little understanding of the
mechanisms, and whether judicial selection methods matter or whether public
opinion seems to influence decisions. We also have little systematic evidence
over time about what these state courts of last resort do, or how decisions are
influenced by public opinion or methods of judicial selection. While some
databases have been assembled, they have been coded by hand. Advances in machine
learning allow coding of cases for subject matter and date of a much larger
number of cases than we currently have available. The database of cases this
project will generate will be useful to many scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
development of web-scraping software tools for state court of last resort
decisions is a significant innovation in the field, allowing coding of a much
broader range of cases than have currently been available to scholars. The plan
to check machine coding with human coders will allow assessment of these new
tools. This project will allow assessing change over time in courts and
influences on judicial decisions in a way that relies on the most current
methodologies regarding measuring public opinion and judicial decisions.
