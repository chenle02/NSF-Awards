Alluvial terrace and valley deposits are important sources of information about
environmental changes, but the complex ways in which processes operate within
river valleys and also in upstream and downstream areas makes interpretation of
sediments difficult. Also troublesome are problems in assuring that the dating
of sediments is accurate. Radiocarbon-dating methods have somewhat alleviated
the latter difficulties, but comprehensive analyses of the dynamics of valley
sedimentation based on more accurate chronologies have not been undertaken in
many settings. This doctoral dissertation research project will develop a
detailed chronology of alluvial change over the last 25,000 for the lower
Colorado River valley of the Texas coastal plain. The chronology and analyses
will be based on field mapping, on radiocarbon dating of important stratigraphic
sections, and on reconstruction of depositional environments and sedimentary
provenance for all stratigraphic units. The lower Colorado alluvial record will
be compared with radiocarbon-controlled sequences from the upper Colorado River
drainage basin and with records of sea-level rise and shoreline change along the
Gulf of Mexico to address the relative roles of upstream, downstream, and
internal factors as influences on the development of fluvial landforms in the
lower Colorado valley. This project will provide valuable information about the
timing and processes of landscape change in the study area. Because research
methods to be used in this locale have been used elsewhere, this case study will
contribute toward comparative analyses of regional landscape evolution and
paleoenvironmental change. It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
