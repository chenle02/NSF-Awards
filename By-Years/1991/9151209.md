Calculus students are benefiting from a mathematics computer laboratory which
provides computer tools for mathematical problem solving. Students are becoming
familiar with modern mathematical tools used in the workplace, are exposed to
realistic problem solving, and are obtaining a deeper understanding of
mathematical concepts through individual experimentation. Materials from Duke
University's Project Calc are being used. Selected area high school students are
bused in to use the lab and provide them with early exposure to these curriculum
improvements and to encourage them to choose a mathematics/science major.
