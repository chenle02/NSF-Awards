Ocean acidification is increasingly being recognized as a threat to marine
ecosystems and resources. While there has been a great deal of scientific
research on this subject in recent years, there is still much to be learned and
many challenges surrounding the management of ocean resources in the face of
ocean acidification. In recognition of these challenges, key ocean agencies
within the federal government, including NSF, are currently developing an
interagency strategic plan for ocean acidification monitoring and research that
will allow for impacts assessments and the development of adaptation and
mitigation strategies. The National Research Council study will assemble an
expert committee, representative of the broader research community, to provide
expert advice to help frame this strategic plan. This committee will not only
synthesize the existing research, but move beyond the natural science to provide
advice on high priority issues for natural resource management.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will
provide a comprehensive review of the current knowledge on ocean acidification
and will serve as a reference for the scientific community. It will help to
frame research priorities in the context of high-priority needs for adaptation
and management strategies. The recommendations in the report will provide
valuable input to the interagency working group in its preparation of a national
strategic plan for ocean acidification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
