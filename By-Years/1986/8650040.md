A three-year project, conducted jointly by the Social Science Education
Consortium, Inc., and Omega, Inc., will create a set of eight computer- based
decision-making modules focused on public policy issues related to science,
technology, and society. Each module will be appropriate for use in grades 7-9
science and social studies courses and will be a self- contained instructional
package which can be used by students individually or in small groups. Issues
which tentatively have been identified as subjects for the modules include:
Water Diversion and Depletion of Existing Water Sources, Radioactive Waste
Management, Can the Projection of Genetic Engineering be Patented?, and Life-
Sustaining Medical Technology. The development of the modules will involve
participation of experts from the university and precollege education levels,
systems analysts, and instructional designers to ensure that the modules are
scientifically sound, bias-free and of professional education quality.
