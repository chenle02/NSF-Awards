This proposal addresses the important issue of the impact of bodily reactions
on the experience of emotion. The theory developed by the PI, the "Vascular
Theory of Emotional Efference," proposes that cognitively unmediated facial
feedback can have a considerable impact on felt or experienced emotions. The
theory is based on the finding that facial muscle contractions can affect the
temperature of the hypothalamic region by affecting venus blood flow. Numerous
studies involving both animal and human respondents will be attempted in this
research, which promises to provide some important evidence about the nature of
human emotional responding. The PI is one of psychology's most outstanding
scientists, having contributed widely, to diverse areas in the discipline.
