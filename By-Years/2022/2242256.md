This project examines the dynamic and spatial processes that have resulted in
the diversity of 7,000 languages that are spoken and signed in contemporary
human societies. Although the geographical patterns of language diversity are
well-documented and fundamentally affect how human communicate, the formation of
these patterns remains debatable. In this study, the research team uses novel
methodological approaches to identify social, cultural, historical, and
environmental processes that influence language diversity patterns across the
planet. The project advances a methodological approach that can be applied in
other studies to assess spatial patterns in different facets of cultural
diversity. The project also contributes to the training of a postdoctoral
scholar and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to resolve longstanding debates about the sociocultural,
environmental, and geographic determinants of linguistic diversity. To surmount
challenges that have limited previous analyses, the researchers in this project
adapt methodological approaches that were initially developed in the field of
biogeography. In particular, the proposed project analyzes how a subset of
factors associated with language diversification are linked in complex causal
pathways, vary from one location to another, and differ across spatial scales.
The proposed research also helps to address concerns with the quality of
observed language range maps by examining the degree to which map quality
affects the results of analyses of geographical diversity patterns. The project
also enhances an international and interdisciplinary network of researchers,
trains early career researchers, develops a teaching unit for undergraduate
courses, and disseminates results in diverse outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
