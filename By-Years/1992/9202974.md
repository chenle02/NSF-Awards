The Fellow will make an integrated structural, petrologic, and geochronologic
study of major structural discontinuities in the Grenville Province of eastern
North America. Orogenic cores will be examined to decipher progressive
development of ductile fabrics especially with reference to porphyroblast
growth, the kinematic evolution of shear zones, and the development of fault
zones at their deepest levels. Use will be made of isotopic analysis of Sa
(samarium) and Nd (neodymium) for radiometric geochronology. The Fellow will
spend his fellowship tenure at the University of Michigan.
