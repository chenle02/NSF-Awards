This project is focused on two mutant lines of the yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, that respond anomalously to hyperosmotic stress. The mutants are
known as HOG1 and HOG4, because of their altered cell cycle response in a High
Osmolarity Glycerol assay. The altered genes in these mutants resemble genes
that encode a group of protein kinases known to be involved in signalling events
during cell growth and division. Osmotic shock is followed by the tyrosine
phosphorylation of the HOG1 protein and suggests that osmotic stress responses
are mediated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation
changes appear to underlie the signal transduction chain that follows exposure
to hypertonic solutions. The experimental plan is directed toward the
characterization of intermediate steps in the signal transduction pathway that
involve the HOG1 and HOG4 proteins, and in an analysis of changes in cell cycle
progression in these mutants after hypertonic shock. %%% This project is
directed toward the study of how cells sense and respond to osmotic stress.
Hyperosmotic treatment in yeast normally results in cell cycle arrest, but in
two recently-discovered mutants, arrest does not occur. The altered genes in
these mutants have provided clues to the signal transduction chain that is
activated during the hyperosmotic stress response. This project will provide
important information on the signal transduction pathway responsible for the
osmotic stress response in yeast, and clues to the underlying regulatory
cascades that are activated by osmotic stress in other kinds of cells.
