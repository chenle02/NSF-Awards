9503755 Taylor This U.S.-Argentina Collaborative Research grant will support the
research of Alan Taylor, National Bureau of Economic Research to work with
Gerardo Della Paolera, Universidad Di Tella in the preparation of a new economic
history of Argentina for the interwar period, with particular attention to the
effects of the Great Depression. Existing economic works of this scope lack
quantitative support and have not used the modern cliometric techniques. This
project will make use of more and better data than previously used as well as
apply a number of theoretical and econometric techniques to provide a sounder
basis for the analysis of the origins, experience, and long-run impact of the
era in question. There is great potential for new insights stemming from the
proposed work, since there have been no studies of the Argentine economy using
the modern methods proposed. Although there are theories about why the
economically strong and growing Argentina of the early 20th century became and
remained a faltering economy after the Great Depression, they do not have the
quantitative and analytic support which modern techniques can offer. Results of
the proposed study can shed light on the failure of some resource-rich
developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth. ***
