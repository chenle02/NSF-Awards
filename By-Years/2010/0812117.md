This project is aimed at substantially increasing the flexibility, autonomy, and
system robustness of heterogeneous multi-robot teams by changing the fundamental
abstraction that is used to represent robot competences from the typical "task"
abstraction to our proposed ?schema? abstraction. The inputs and outputs of
these schemas are characterized in terms of their semantic information content,
which our work exploits to automatically reconfigure the schemas to address the
teaming task at hand. This new abstraction allows humans to design task-
independent software that can be autonomously reconfigured by the robot team in
response to dynamic changes in the environment, and the current task needs of
the team. In doing this, we are able to simultaneously obtain a number of
significant, wide-ranging new benefits in coalescent multi-robot teaming,
including: (1) enabling robots to generate solutions to new tasks that were not
explicitly programmed by the human designer, but instead consist of new,
automated combinations of low-level building blocks, or schemas; (2) enabling
robot team members to automatically generate coalescent task solutions based on
sensor-sharing across team members, in configurations not previously explicitly
defined by the human designer; and (3) enabling flexible software code reuse
from one robot teaming application to another.
