Realistic formulations of performance-driven layout are the focus of this
research. Accurate models of circuit delay are being sought. These models
include technology parameters, such as capacitance, resistance, inductance, etc.
The approach is to study delay-optimal trees to define an envelope of achievable
routing performance. Methods for constructing near-optimal layouts are being
investigated. Additionally, the routing problem is being recast as one of
constructing low-delay routing graphs where cycles are allowed. This can have
the advantage of designs being tolerant to certain types of open faults due to
manufacturing defects or electro-migration.
