This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the renovation
of sections of the Graduate Physics Research Center (GPRC), a 7,000 sq ft
building used for physics research and research training.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovated facility will be used for research in
particle physics and optics, including laser crystal development, and the study
of the optical properties of nanoscale materials. The research in high-energy
physics will include analyses of data from the ATLAS detector that forms part of
the Large Hadron Collider experiment, and from the MINERvA neutrino scattering
experiment at Fermilab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing
infrastructure for faculty research, the renovated labs will provide
infrastructure for research training of undergraduates and graduate students
from a student body that is predominantly composed of members groups that are
under-represented in science and engineering. A better facility will be more
conducive to attracting students to modern research. The renovated laboratories
will also be used to provide research experiences for undergraduates from other
institutions (through a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program) and for
school-teachers (through Hampton University?s Research Experiences for Teachers
program).
