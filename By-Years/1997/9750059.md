Abstract DBI 9750059 Kenneth R. Petren This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Genetic differentiation of hybridizing
Darwin's finches." Darwin's finches are a model system for studying the
interaction of natural selection and hybridization and the process of
speciation. This research uses highly variable genetic markers, microsatellite
loci, to verify parentage of hybrids. Long term effects of introgressive gene
flow will be determined by comparing populations and species on Daphne Major and
other islands of the Galapagos.
