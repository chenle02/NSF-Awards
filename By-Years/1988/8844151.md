This project deals with a new processing technique for forming flexible A-15
superconducting tapes with high critical current densities and magnetic fields.
The processing technique involves melt-spinning of superconducting alloys to
form amorphous ribbons followed by annealing into the A-15 crystal structure
with very fine uniform grains.//
