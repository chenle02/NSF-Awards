9613907 Prose This project will enable Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia, video
producers from Earth Images Foundation, Inc., to conduct a seven- week film trip
to the Nanga Parbat region of Pakistan, during which they will document research
activities and landscapes related to the study "Collaborative Research: Crustal
Reworking During Orogeny: An Active System Himalayan Perspective." The producers
will use 16mm film to document major field work activities undertaken by an
international collaboration of scientists from the earth science disciplines of
seismology, structural geology, geomorphology, petrology, geochronology, and
magnetotellurics. Scientists will be filmed performing field work and discussing
in on-camera interviews their research and the geologic problems they are
addressing. Relevant geologic, hydrologic, and other landscape features of the
Nanga Parbat region, as well as local cultural features, will also be filmed.
This footage will be used in a planned video and CD-ROM that will depict the
ways in which earth scientists join forces to tackle geologic problems present
in the Nanga Parbat region. ***
