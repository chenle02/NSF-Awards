This is a proposal for a two-year study of the feeding ecology and positional
behavior of lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at the Dzanga-Sangha
Reserve in the Central African Republic. The work follows a three month pilot
study which assessed the feasibility of this study. The objectives of the study
are to document the frequency of locomotor and postural behavior in the context
of feeding and other activities, and to do an intraspecific comparison of the
effects of body size dimorphism on the use of arboreal substrates to gain access
to food. Virtually all of our knowledge of gorilla behavior at this time comes
form extensive studies of a different subspecies, the mountain gorilla which is
almost completely terrestrial. The preliminary pilot study of the lowland
gorilla indicated that it spends a great deal of time feeding in an arboreal
context. This is unexpected in view of what anthropologists currently know about
gorillas. This study will help to elucidate geographic variation in gorilla
ecology and behavior. It will also provide critical information for
understanding the relationship between hominoid body size and locomotor
behavior.
