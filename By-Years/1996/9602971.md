9602971 Reichl This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Drs. Linda Reichl, University of Texas, Austin, and German Luna
Acosta, of the Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Mexico, to study the quantum
conductance of the two-dimensional semi-conductor electron ripple channel. The
primary research goal will be to calculate the conduction properties of the
rippled channel for the cases of regular and chaotic electron dynamics, and to
compare these calculations with the conductance of classical channels to
determine the best materials for constructing the devices in the laboratory. The
study aims to clarify the dynamical origin of transport properties in open
mesoscopic systems, both classically and quantum mechanically. The research
combines the expertise of the U.S. researchers in classical and quantum chaos
theory, and access to the parallel computing facilities of their institution,
with the Mexican researchers expertise in condensed matter theory. A number of
young scientists and graduate students will participate in the project and will
be trained in both fields of physics. ***
