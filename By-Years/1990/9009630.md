These researchers request partial support for the acquisition of a high
temperature stage and control unit, modern x-ray detection and control
electronics, and a computer to enhance and upgrade an existing x-ray diffraction
facility in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of
Delaware. This facility will be used in structural studies of artificially
structured materials.
