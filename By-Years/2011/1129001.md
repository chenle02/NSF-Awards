Intellectual Merit The Smart Grid is among the most important and ambitious
engineering endeavors of our time. Deep integration of renewable electricity
generation is a key driver of the Smart Grid vision. A fundamental challenge is
that these energy sources are highly variable ? they are not dispatchable,
experience large and rapid changes, and are difficult to predict. The
electricity grid must absorb this variability through a portfolio of solutions
that include improved forecasts, demand shaping, electricity storage, optimal
grid operations, and new market instruments. Our objective is to analyze this
portfolio for wind energy integration. We will develop an analytical framework
to study how wind variability can be addressed in competitive electricity
markets at deep penetration levels. We will investigate market based wind
curtailment, aggregation, matching of variable generation and flexible loads,
and novel contract instruments.

Broader Impact The societal impact of our research comes from the fact that
renewable electricity generation is critical for energy security and
environmental sustainability. Our research directly addresses the obstacles that
must be overcome to significantly increase the penetration of renewable
generation. The technological impact of our research will stem from our novel
framework to analyze existing options and design novel mechanisms for renewable
integration. This will offer new insights and analysis methods which will guide
the design of optimal portfolios of technology components and coordination
mechanisms. The educational impact of our research is derived from our serious
efforts at integrating education at all levels with our research. We will equip
our students with the multi-disciplinary training in power systems operations,
optimization, control, and economics to become leaders in making the Smart Grid
vision a reality.
