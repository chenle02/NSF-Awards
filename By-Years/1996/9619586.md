9619586 Cotter The goal of the 1997 U.M.M. REU project is to nurture the
development of underrepresented individuals in the geological sciences. Ten
undergraduate women will be actively involved in field and laboratory research
to determine the origin and history of glacial and postglacial deposits in west-
central Minnesota. These studies will employ varying geologic research
techniques including, sediment analysis (characterization of till and sediment
facies), provenance studies (basic field descriptions and identifications,
sedimentary petrography, till magnetic properties, and till geochemistry) and
paleoecology assessments (micropaleontology, palynology, sedimentology and clay
chemistry.) This research can be readily accomplished by the undergraduate at
relatively little expense, yet will contribute substantially to the
understanding of the glacial geology of the area.
