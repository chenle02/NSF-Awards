This award is for support for an airborne radar sounding survey over the central
and downstream portions of ice stream D, West Antarctica during the 1995-96
austral summer field season using the CASERTZ aerogeophysics facility. Ice
stream D has been selected for study by glaciologists working on the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet project as the most appropriate for concentrated study. This
radar suvey is supposed to complement the one being carried out by the CASERTZ
group in the catchment area of ice stream D. By employing the GPS navigational
control of the CASERTZ facility, high precision maps of surface and bed
elevation, ice thickness, and hydrologic potential will be produced. Knowledge
of these parameters will lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of the
ice stream. The timing of the field work in the second year of the award will
allow for effective integration of the CASERTZ system with the existing
equipment and techniques used by the University of Wisconsin group.
