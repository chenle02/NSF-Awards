Despite their impressive performance in a variety of challenging real-world
tasks, concerns remain about the trustworthiness of state-of-the-art deep neural
networks (DNNs). The development of DNNs suitable for real-world deployment
requires formally proving that they satisfy a large number of trustworthy
specifications (e.g., robustness, safety, fairness). If they do not, then the
DNNs are iteratively repaired or re-trained until they are formally proven to be
trustworthy. Overall, trustworthy DNN development requires calling a DNN
verifier a large number of times for different specifications and DNNs. Each
call to a DNN verifier is computationally demanding and while there has been
plenty of work on improving the precision and scalability of state-of-the-art
verifiers for verifying individual DNNs and specifications in recent years, the
existing verifiers remain fundamentally non-scalable and unsustainable for
trustworthy development of DNNs. This is because the expensive verifier needs to
be run from scratch for every new pair of specifications and DNNs. The project
novelties are in overcoming this barrier by the design of new concepts,
theories, algorithms, and representations to enable incremental verification of
DNNs. The project's impacts are making DNN verification more scalable,
sustainable, and accessible. This allows scalable development of trustworthy
DNNs thus ensuring that this technology realizes its true potential in
transforming the society and economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
introduces the new concepts of proof sharing and proof transfer for enabling
incremental DNN verification. Proof sharing makes the verification of multiple
specifications on the same DNN more scalable and precise by computing a common
proof for multiple specifications. Proof transfer boosts the verification across
multiple networks by transferring the proofs generated on one network for
multiple similar networks. Precision, speed, and memory gains from incremental
verification are further improved by designing new mechanisms for DNN training
and repair. The frameworks and tools for incremental DNN verification designed
in this project are general, and compatible with diverse methods for DNN
training, repair, and verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
