Anthropologists Karla M. Slocum and Caela B. O'Connell, both of the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will undertake research on the effects of
Hurricane Tomas, which struck in late 2010, on Fairtrade farming in the island
nation of St. Lucia. Although hurricanes and tropical storms are expected in the
Windward Islands, Tomas' impact has been unique and widespread due to the
pervasive landslides and flooding that occurred in response to the historically
unprecedented rainfall as well as extraordinarily heavy winds. The researchers
were conducting research on the transition from conventional to Fairtrade
certified farming when the hurricane hit. The funding provided by this award
will support their collection of post-disaster data on farmland disturbances and
household economies, which will be compared to pre-hurricane data and also
provide a baseline against which to measure future
recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is being supported through NSF's
Rapid Response Research (RAPID) program, which supports research having severe
urgency with regard to availability of, or access to data, including quick-
response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar
unanticipated events. Disaster anthropology is a relatively new area of
anthropology, in part because disasters are usually unexpected and mobilizing
researchers immediately can be difficult. However, these researchers were
already in place, ideally situated to collect post-disaster data. Findings from
this research will help to evaluate the process of recovery, as well as any
benefits or vulnerabilities connected to any particular system of land-
management practices. Results also will be applicable to rural areas
experiencing extreme hydrologic events worldwide.
