A computer-interfaced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrophotometer together with
a computer-controlled Spectral Bulletin Board are being used by the Chemistry
Department at Adrian College to achieve the following goals: 1. Provide Adrian
students with access to high quality NMR spectra for spectral interpretation,
quantitative analysis of mixtures and reaction rate determinations. 2. Provide
access to high quality NMR spectra for faculty and students at other schools
throughout the nation. These spectra are available either by sending diskettes
through the mail or by telephone access using modems to the Adrian Spectral
Bulletin Board.
