This study of the Human Genome Project will use the tools and perspectives of
history, sociology, and anthropology to analyze rapid scientific and
technological developments in contemporary human genetics, the organizational
changes necessary to keep pace with those developments, the recent growth of
commercial ventures in genomics, and the challenges to ethical and social
analysis presented by such a fast-changing and complex set of processes. Using
archival materials, fieldwork, and in-depth interviews with scientists in
industry and academe, the project will examine the impact of recombinant DNA
methods in the field of human genetics, and the resulting demands for a
coordinated effort to map and sequence the entire human genome. The final
product will be a book, titled Inventing Speed Genomics, that will analyze such
developments and contribute to public discussion about genetics research and its
social meanings.
