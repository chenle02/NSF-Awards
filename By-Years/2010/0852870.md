This award provides support for a new and innovative outreach project in the
nascent field of gravitational-wave astrophysics. The project is timed to
coincide with the International Year of Astronomy (IYA) 2009 and the World
Science Festival (WSF) in New York City, June 2009. The LIGO exhibit will convey
to its visitor three main concepts: the LIGO scientific endeavor is motivated by
the same curiosity which motivated Galileo four hundred years ago; the violent
Universe is awash with gravitational waves but at the moment these phenomena are
entirely unexplored; giant, new \telescopes" are needed to detect the
gravitational-wave spectrum and the technology of these telescopes is pushing
back the frontiers of many scientific fields. The LIGO exhibit will comprise the
following elements: a fully interactive laser interferometer; a large-scale
three-dimensional LED artwork; large-screen multimedia presentations on
gravitational wave astronomy; an interactive `Black Hole hunter' computer game.
The design, integration and implementation of the exhibit elements will be
achieved in partnership with professional exhibit designers. This award is
cofunded by the Physics Division, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities,
and the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings.
