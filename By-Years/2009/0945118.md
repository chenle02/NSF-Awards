This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate whether
a new type of bioelectrode can provide lower noise on the skin than the current
state-of-the-art Ag/AgCl electrodes. Even after extensive skin cleaning and
abrasion, the noise level of present technology is approximately ten times
higher than the internal electronic noise of the first stage amplifier.
Preliminary experiments with a lash-up version of the new electrode showed an
immediate factor of two improvement in sensitivity. Arguments based on the
performance of the new materials underwater suggest a factor of ten reduction in
measurement noise might be achieved. This Phase I project will test a set of the
new electrodes made under different conditions on a range of subjects with the
goal of defining a protocol to best exploit the new approach. Based on the
results and in collaboration with four academic medical researchers, the
benefits in specific research and medical applications will be quantified.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact is that reduced measurement
noise in biolectrodes offers the capability to record and discriminate signals
too weak to be currently measurable, and localize and separate sources to small
to be resolved. Bioelectrodes are used extensively in research and medicine for
recording the electrical activity of the body (e.g. the heart, brain, and
general muscle activation). If successful, this SBIR offers a basic advance in
science and technology that is applicable in many areas. There are around 1000
laboratories worldwide studying brain electrical activity that could gain
substantial benefit from improved electrode sensitivity. As research progresses
and demonstrates clinical utility, the standard path is for new research
advances to be adopted into clinical practice, creating much larger markets. In
addition significant clinical markets exist for cardiac diagnosis involving
small signals such as the P-wave and T-wave of the electrocardiogram.
