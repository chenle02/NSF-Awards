During the past three years the PIs have synthesized major element data from
divergent and convergent plate margins into quantitative models of mantle
melting that account for the global systematics in a tectonic context. While
these models need to be tested, they provide a tool for understanding many
related problems of petrogenesis. This project will examine the global data base
for ocean island basalts to test how well the major element melting models work
in the tectonic setting of within-plate volcanism. In addition, the major
element models will be extended to investigate the relationship between the
major and trace elements.//
