9304052 Liebermann Phase transformations in mantle minerals at high pressures
and temperatures strongly influence the physical properties and dynamical
processes in the Earth's interior. The PI will study the elasticity and
microstructure of high-pressure phases using the techniques of ultrasonics and
transmission electron microscopy. *** Program Director Date
