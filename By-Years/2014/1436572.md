Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional
efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in
STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM
education and research. The award to Alabama A&amp;M University seeks to build
on previous successful efforts to increase participation of underrepresented
minorities in STEM disciplines. The overarching goal of the project is to employ
evidence-based strategies and activities for retaining, training, teaching, and
graduating undergraduate STEM students. The project will impact more than two
thousand undergraduate STEM majors at the University. Currently, 91% of students
at Alabama A&amp;M University are African American.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project has three specific goals that tie into the overarching goal: 1) to
augment a robust undergraduate program by retaining, mentoring and graduating
underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines; 2) to enhance the quality of
students' learning experience and depth of knowledge by expanding undergraduate
research opportunities; and 3) to enhance STEM faculty members' expertise in
effective evidence-based pedagogical methodologies. Carefully designed
activities and strategies are employed to achieve the following outcomes: a 10%
reduction of attrition in lower level undergraduate gate-keeping courses; a 20%
increase in the number of students matriculating in STEM fields; a 25% increase
in students' participation in interactive discovery-based undergraduate
research; and a 20% increase in the passing rate of the Fundamentals of
Engineering exam.
