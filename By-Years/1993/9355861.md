9355861 Harel The project has the potential to break new empirical and
theoretical ground and further our understanding of what it means to understand
mathematical proof and how that understanding develops. The knowledge gained
from this study has the potential to impact significantly the way preservice
teachers are trained to teach proof and ultimately how mathematics and
mathematical proofs will be taught/learned in the school and college setting.
