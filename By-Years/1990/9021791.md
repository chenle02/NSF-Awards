This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Washington for
the conversion of the Chemistry Library Building into the Environmental
Chemistry Facility which will house interdisciplinary research and research
training in atmospheric and environmental chemistry, encompassing a coordinated
program of research in critical aspects of biogeochemistry and global climate
change. This building was constructed in 1957 and last renovated in 1988. The
ARFMP grant of $225,000 and $335,155 provided by the grantee as cost sharing
will be used to modernize these research and research training facilities
providing a centrally located focus for campus-wide disciplinary strengths in
the earth and natural sciences. This project will address the need to improve
the current research infrastructure by means of a major upgrading and expansion
of the existing ventilation system, including the addition of air conditioning,
and redistributing or modifying the power and electrical systems on a room by
room basis. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing
an improved environment for the conduct of a new coordinated program of research
of national importance in critical aspects of biogeochemistry and global climate
change under the aegis of faculty from Chemistry, Atmospheric Sciences, and
Oceanography and for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate
students.
