9552898 Coble The University of South Florida (Tampa) will initiate a five-week
summer commuter Young Scholars program serving thirty young women entering 8th
grade in the summers of 1997 and 1998. The disciplinary focus of the program is
marine science, emphasizing biology, chemistry, geology, and physics, with
mathematics applications. The students experience field trips, a data collection
cruise on a research vessel, and laboratory experiments. Female USF faculty and
graduate mentors serve as role models. Also to be initiated is an Mathematics
and Science Teaching Perspectives component to provide opportunities for
research and learning opportunities for six middle school teachers. In addition
to completing research the teachers will develop lessons to take back to their
classroom, thus impacting a greater number of students.
