The problem of star formation is presently actively studied both observationally
and theoretically. The Principal Investigator proposes to model numerically the
collapse of a protostellar cloud into a young stellar object, using
3-dimensional hydrodynamics. The goal is to improve on the existing sets of
calculations of this kind by making the physics more realistic: including
magnetic effects in the starting models, mass loss through stellar winds, and
rotational instabilities. He also proposes to improve the spatial resolution and
numerical accuracy of the calculations.
