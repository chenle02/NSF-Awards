This project will develop stability, time optimal, and minimum effort control
theory of large scale hereditary systems. The principal investigator will focus
on two broad areas: the quantitative behavior of each isolated system and the
overall behavior of the large scale systems when the inter-connections are
accounted for. The aim is to analyze the dynamics of large scale systems in
terms of their subsystems and the properties of their interconnection. For the
isolated system there are four aspects of the problem: stability,
controllability when the controls are small, the form of optimal control when
time and effort are minimum, and all the construction of optimal feedback
controls. Proposed results may include: If each subsystem is controllable and
the interaction "nice" then the large scale system is controllable. If some
subsystem is not controllable the large scale system can still be controllable
if some external control impact is brought to bear. The implications to the
control of large organizations like global economics will be studied. Optimal
control strategies will be pursued.
