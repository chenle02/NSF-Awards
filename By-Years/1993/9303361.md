Dadarlat will investigate a nonstable theory of asymptotic homomorphisms of
C*-algebras, a homotopy classification of *- homomorphisms of subhomogeneous
C*-algebras, and a perturbation theory of homomorphisms into real rank zero
C*-algebras. This will provide connections between the geometrical properties of
C*- algebras and their algebraic invariants, and will lay the foundation for a
classification theory of nuclear simple separable C*-algebras. The general area
of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of
Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite
matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put together
in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract objects have
a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key role in knot
theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and
they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming
increasingly important in physics.
