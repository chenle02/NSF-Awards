This proposed dissertation study will analyze the articulation between Yupiaq
and Western ways of knowing. It will focus on the setting of a fish camp, which
reflects traditional Yupiaq ways of knowing, and examine how these Native people
use their own principles of science, and how they adapt to western science and
technology. The project will further assess science curriculums in Yupiaq
schools in Alaska to determine to what extent local resources, cultural
knowledge and practices can be used to develop culturally relevant science
education for the Yupiaq and other Native peoples.
