This award will support collaborative research between Professor Abraham Klein
of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Dr. G. Do Dang of the
Laboratory of Theoretical Physics and High Energies, University of Paris
(South). They will examine applications of a new theory of large amplitude
collective motion, which may account for certain forms of collective rotational
or vibrational motion in atomic nuclei. The two researchers have been working
since 1984 on this new theory, which is a development in quantum-mechanical
terms of the classical Hartree-Fock formulation. The Wigner transform is used to
make the required quantum transformations. Following the development of the new
theory, its applicability to systems of practical importance will be examined.
This award provides the opportunity for Professor Klein and Dr. Do Dang to apply
the theory to the description of large deviations from ground-state equilibrium
configurations, well described by classical Hartree-Fock models. This research
could lead to increased understanding of large-amplitude problems in classical
mechanics, and of certain problems in both fission and fusion reactions.
