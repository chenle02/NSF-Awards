The processing of semi-conductor lasers is becoming increasingly important.
Techniques for producing the fine structures needed to couple radiation into and
out of the laser are lacking as well as techniques for controlling the frequency
and stabilizing it. Moving the frequency to shorter wavelengths is also a
problem which needs addressing particularly as new applications of lightwave
technology come along. One technique which has been applied to address some of
these problems is the photoelectrochemical etching of semiconductors. This has
been successfully used to fabricate diffraction gratings for optoelectronic
devices. The effort proposed in the present proposal deals with the limits which
such processes might encounter. It also addresses the issue of accurately
tailoring semiconductor composition so as to provide precisely designed
structures. These will become crucial as lightwave technological advances
continue to occur. This effort is to be jointly supported by the lightwave
technology (EET) program and the interfacial, transport, and thermodynamic
processes program in CBTE.
