PI: Schrlau, Michael &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1604893&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to create a very tiny
biosensor for identifying and quantifying biomolecules inside a single living
cell. The investigator proposes a novel way of performing selective measurement
inside living cells, (instead of currently used methods of breaking open the
cell), and after proving the approach plan is to quantify cellular metabolic
state in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to create
the ability to identify and quantify biomolecules inside a single living cell
with minimal perturbation and over long periods of time using electrochemical
techniques. Multifunctional nanoprobe will be constructed, capable of injecting
fluids in order to conduct self-contained electrochemical measurements inside
confined aqueous microenvironments. The nanoprobe is then utilized to inject a
reaction-enabling substrate into the cell for selectively quantifying
senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, a cytosolic enzyme, an indicator of
many chronic diseases. It is proposed to use carbon nanotube (CNT) -based
nanoprobes will provide the ability for selectively quantifying cell senescence
in real-time. It is anticipated that at the conclusion of the project, there
will be a new analytical tool and technique for quantifying electroactive
biomolecules within single living cells. Simple, scalable template-based
nanomanufacturing processes will be employed to integrate the nanoelectrodes
into the tip of a pulled glass capillary without nanoassembly. The CNT-based
nanoprobe is designed to readily fit standard cell physiology instruments, thus
facilitating easy technological dissemination, broad utilization, and potential
commercialization. The outcome of this proposal is likely to provide a first-in-
class CNT-based tool for a novel minimally invasive analytical technique for
gathering quantitative data from single living cells. The proposed efforts will
generate new insights into fundamental cell physiology, which will ultimately
help identify the early onset of diseases, facilitate drug development and
improve therapeutic efficacy. More broadly, the development of intracellular
electrochemistry will advance scientific knowledge in nanotechnology, materials
science and engineering, electrochemistry, cell biology, and biomedicine.
Further, the project will provide several high-impact research and educational
opportunities for students at all levels as well as recruits and will support
underrepresented groups in STEM.
