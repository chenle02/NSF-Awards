Many natural and man-made media such as the atmosphere, the ocean, geophysical
media, biological media, and composite and disordered materials have spatial or
temporal random variations. The interaction of optical, electromagnetic, or
acoustic waves with these random media greatly affects communication through the
medium, as well as identification and imaging of the target in the medium, and
determination of the medium characteristics. Although considerable progress has
been reported on the interaction of waves with random media, several outstanding
problems have emerged which are expected to lead to important engineering and
scientific advances. Recent studies on the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of
random media when combined with inverse scattering studies should lead to the
improvement of image resolution and identification through practical media as
well as the advance of the multiple scattering theory. The study of
backscattering enhancement from disordered media and rough surfaces has
attracted considerable attention from those involved in localization phenomena
and may help clarify these new physical phenomena. Continued work on the
utilization of the complete statistical and polarization information of waves
should lead to a new imaging technique and graphic display of the medium and
target. An extension of the studies on rough surface scattering to very rough
surfaces and backscattering enhancement encompasses fundamental research as well
as practical applications and should lead to the construction of improved or new
statistical wave theories and applications.
