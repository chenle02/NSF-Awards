This award to Lamar University's Department of Geology is made in response to a
proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-half of the funds
needed to acquire personal computers, a digitizer tablet, drum plotter, and
geologic mapping software packages for use in the Department's undergraduate
training program. The University is committed to providing the other half
required. The equipment will be used to equip the department's mapping
laboratory which will enhance the hands-on experience of undergraduates in
producing geologic maps in physical and historical geology courses.
