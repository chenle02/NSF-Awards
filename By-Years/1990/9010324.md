Support is awarded for a one day symposium on "Computational Approaches to
Comparative Neurobiology" during the American Society of Zoologists in San
Antonio, Texas in December 1990. The symposium will introduce new ideas and
methods to zoologists interested in a wide range of studies in neurobiology of
behavior of vertebrates and invertebrates. Rather than a course on computer
generated mathematical modelling in these systems,the symposium will bring
together active researchers using the techniques to show how it can be done. The
conference will be educational and the proceedings will be published.
