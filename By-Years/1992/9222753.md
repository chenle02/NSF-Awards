The objective of this research is to carry further the work that has been
previously accomplished in reducing bit balling, and to double the rate of
penetration while drilling in shales by applying a negative potential of a few
volts to the bit which causes the development of a lubricating water film at the
bit-shale interface. Experiments so far have been carried out with roller-cone
bits at small scale. In this work it will be determined if similar good results
can be obtained at larger scale, with drag bits as well as with roller-cone
bits, and in the presence of clay-containing drilling muds. The project will be
supported by matching funds from industry.
