This project will develop an undergraduate computer laboratory in parallel
processing. The laboratory will be equipped with an INMOS, forty processor,
parallel machine which can be flexibly configured in either ring, mesh, shuffle-
exchange, or hypercube architectures. IBM PC/AT compatible machines will be used
for both the front-end and as a development system. Integrated with the
laboratory will be a course on parallel processing covering the topics of
architecture, algorithms, and programming languages. Topics on parallel
processing will be integrated into the courses Analysis of Algorithms,
Programming Languages, VLSI Design, Graphics, and Simulation.
