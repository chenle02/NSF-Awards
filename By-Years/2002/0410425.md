&lt;br/&gt;The foci of this research involve three areas. First, three methods
will be used to understand the modes of deactivation of ruthenium alkylidene
catalysts: Rates of the decomposition as a function of condition, additives and
ligand structure will be determined. The products of decomposition will be
investigated using crystal structures and isotopic labeling. A variety of new
1,3-disubstituted-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene and related systems, designed to
inhibit decomposition pathways, will be prepared. Second, methods for the
preparation of nanoscale layers of conjugated materials and the synthesis of
multilayer materials using block polymer techniques will be developed. Third,
methods for the preparation of cyclic polymers will be developed and a variety
of interlock polymer topologies will be synthesized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Polymers
Program are supporting the research of Dr. Robert H. Grubbs in the Department of
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology.
Professor Grubbs will focus his work on developing a family of ruthenium based
metathesis catalysts that have well defined parameters at the fundamental level
and that are highly efficient as well as selective. Further, the fundamental
principles required to produce a variety of nanoscaled materials with very
narrow dispersities, especially materials containing inorganic structures will
be explored. Research aimed at the preparation and characterization of cyclic
polymers will also be carried out. The project presents an excellent venue for
the training of students and has important broader impacts for the
pharmaceutical industry and materials science.&lt;br/&gt;
