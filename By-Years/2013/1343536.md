Cal Poly Pomona is establishing the National Cybersecurity Sports Federation
(NCSF) which brings together the community of cybersecurity academic, industry
and government leaders in cybersecurity competitions, to induce shared goals and
values, and to create an umbrella organization for a national sport of
cybersecurity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops NCSF, an organization
and infrastructure, to support current and future cyber competitions, to help
create rules of the game, determine learning objectives, eligibility, metrics,
and a code of ethics. A network of stakeholders is organized in a manner that
does not threaten individual competitions but provides value to the collective
endeavor. The NCSF is the cyber equivalent of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA), which organizes the athletic programs of many colleges and
universities in the United&lt;br/&gt;States and Canada, and the National
Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), the association that writes
the rules of competition for most high school sports and activities in the
United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a shared pathway vision
for students to learn cyber competitions the way athletes learn a sport. It
negotiates an agreement on common goals, learning objectives, performance
measurements, and desired outcomes. It radically expands the cybersecurity
pipeline with cyber athletes on the scale of organized sports today, and it
provides the same level of cooperation and coordination as interscholastic
athletics.
