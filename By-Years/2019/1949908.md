The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project introduces a paradigm shift from reaction-based
methods to a proactive-based approach to predict the onset of exertional heat
illness, which results when the human body fails to maintain core temperature
within a narrow range (33.2℃-38.2℃). Vulnerable populations include agricultural
workers, construction workers, and military personnel, as well as youth
athletes. The proposed project will develop a novel low-cost wearable hydration
sensor, coupled with predictive analytics, to monitor changes in a youth
athlete’s hydration state. This will mitigate youth injuries, reduce medical
costs, and minimize the risk of long-term health conditions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop an integrated hardware-software system to address human
hydration in real time. This project will integrate a wearable sensor with
cloud-based analytics and prediction. The project objectives are to develop core
sensing and algorithm modules, including: 1) exploring signal processing
methodologies for signal extraction; 2) development of a framework for learning
and predicting temporal patterns in hydration data; 3) experimental
determination of typical operating conditions of a wearable
sensor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
