This engineering education research initiation grant brings together an
interdisciplinary group of engineering and education researchers to conduct
mixed-method study of how formal and informal interactions with engineering
faculty and professionals influence the attitudes and intentions of under-
represented students. The study will utilize a social capital theoretical
framework to explore decision points in students' progression through an
engineering degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance
of this project arises from the focus on students traditionally under-
represented in engineering as well as the ability of the project to inform how
mentoring and advising can be structured to improve retention or other outcomes
in engineering degree programs. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals
of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce
with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society
by informing educational policy and practices.
