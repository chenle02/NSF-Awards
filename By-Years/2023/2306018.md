This award funds a series of conferences that will bring economists and other
social scientists from around the country together at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln College of Business in Lincoln, Nebraska. The conference, which
will be named the Nebraska Labor Summit, will provide a space for economists and
other social scientists to gather, discuss their ongoing research, and build new
collaborative relationships. The conference will focus on labor economics and
closely related fields. The conference objectives are to: 1) foster the exchange
of ideas and provide an opportunity for economics from around the Midwest,
including from nearby emerging research institutions, to form new relationships
that could expand the scope and quality of their ongoing and future work; and 2)
expose undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
and nearby institutions to frontier research, networking opportunities, and a
chance to discuss their work with top researchers. The conference also has
strong potential to benefit the broader community because the field of labor is
increasingly focused on using causal methods to answer questions of pressing
interest to individuals, firms, and policymakers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
