With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Eau Claire will
acquire a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and sampling
accessories. This instrument will support research in a number of areas,
including a) fundamental vibrational spectroscopy to determine molecular
structures; b) investigations of protein structure, dynamics and interactions
with surfaces; and c) inorganic synthesis, aimed at modeling enzyme functions,
as well as developing catalysts for organic reactions and olefin polymerization
processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general effectiveness of Fourier transform
spectroscopic techniques in academic and industrial research has been firmly
established. Many advanced spectroscopic courses now routinely include the
teaching of FT spectroscopy. These studies will have an impact in areas such as
surface science, catalysis, materials science and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
