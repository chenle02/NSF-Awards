This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to enhance the
development of high-efficiency, lightweight microconcentrator photovoltaic
arrays based on stretched silicon technology developed at Stanford University
The project output will be a sparse matrix of small, high quality, miniature
solar cells incorporated into modules.

The stretchable silicon process achieves the accurate placement and electrical
wiring of thousands of miniature solar cells in one parallel and potentially
low-cost step. The resulting reductions in module interconnect costs, weight,
and amount of active material may achieve the low costs necessary to make energy
provision via easily-installed solar panels compelling to commercial and
residential users.
