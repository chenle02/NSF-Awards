9360303 Cappo This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
seeks to fulfill the critical need in education for the development of
innovative assessment techniques that support the emergence of new teaching
strategies, reflect what is known about the process of learning, and measure
higher levels of reasoning. Studies by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)
and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, as well as state
reform movements, have identified the importance of a variety of assessments.
These formats include oral discussion, group work, portfolios, self-assessment,
peer grading, observation, and performance-based tests, as well as standard
written and multiple choice tests. To incorporate these new ideas so that
teachers can move from the use of traditional to current alternative assessment
methods of students, teachers will require tracking and recording devices that
are unobtrusive and adaptable. Also needed is a bank of assessment tasks and
scoring techniques which focuses on higher levels of thinking. The firm Learning
in Motion proposes to test the feasibility of designing assessment tasks and
software systems, which may include new pen-based technology, to improve the
quality of education and meet the educational needs identified by OTA, the
Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development and state reform
movements. Recognizing that curriculum reform and assessment reform must go
hand-in-hand, Learning in Motion seeks to make an important contribution to the
realization of curriculum reform via assessment reform. ***
