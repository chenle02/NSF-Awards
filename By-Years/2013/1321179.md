This project seeks to improve the performance of a wide verity of memory-
constrained object-oriented applications by automatically recycling objects.
Large-scale, object-oriented software commonly suffers from systemic performance
problems, due to inefficiencies inherent in an object-oriented language as well
as commonly-adopted design and implementation principles. These problems are
becoming increasingly critical as object-oriented languages are used in systems
that typically have small memory space and computation power, such as mobile
devices. In such systems, memory inefficiencies inherent in an object-oriented
language can lead to severe performance degradation and reduced scalability.
Evidence suggests that excessive object creation is a major source of
inefficiencies in memory-constrained object-oriented applications. Object
recycling reduces this object creation overhead. Recycling is achieved by
designing and implementing runtime system support that can cache objects upon
their creation, detect unreachable objects from the cache, and reuse both
instances and data content of dead objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern life
relies increasingly on memory-constrained systems such as smartphones, tablets,
and data-analytical tools. This project provides an immediate performance
benefit for such memory-constrained systems, thereby leading to improved
quality, usability, and user satisfaction. In addition, the research represents
a first step in a new direction for the research community to explore, and may
provoke further interests in automating, other important (currently manually-
enforced) optimizations. The impact of the research is extended by a strategy of
open-source licensing and distribution of the resulting software through the
OpenJDK and Android communities. The educational component of this project
includes creation of new course materials, recruitment of undergraduate students
and students from under-represented groups, and education of local programmers
on how to develop highly-efficient memory-constrained applications.
