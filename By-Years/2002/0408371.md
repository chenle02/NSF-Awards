Researchers will examine the role of climate factors on the carbon and nutrient
uptake by tundra root systems in the Arctic. Isotopic tracers will be added to
existing long-term plots to examine the flow of carbon through root systems and
into the soil through several growing seasons. The production of roots and the
fate of root-derived inputs to soils is not understood sufficiently well in the
Arctic to enable predictions of the effects of global warming on the
uptake/release of greenhouse gases. This project will determine C-N interactions
as a function of climate, assess the effects of climate change, examine the
controls on the fate of root carbon, and develop a model to predict carbon
distribution and export in Arctic tundra ecosystems. The results from this
project will be incorporated in regional scale models that are used to predict
ecosystem and landscape responses to climate change.
