Professor Nancy I. Totah, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Iowa, is developing new methods for the synthesis of complex natural products
with the support of the Organic Synthesis Program. Selective epoxidation of an
enamide functionality in ten-membered macrocycles and subsequent transannular
addition is explored as an approach to the synthesis of 6-6 fused ring amides
with control of up to four stereogenic centers. This methodology will be applied
to the enantioselective synthesis of phenanthridone alkaloids such as
pancratistatin. Exploitation of the conformational preferences of a tricyclic
precursor will provide access to C-ring modified phenanthridone alkaloids. The
phenanthridone alkaloids are an important class of natural products, displaying
a variety of biological activities that include anticancer, antiviral, growth
regulatory, and insect antifeedant activities. With the support of the Organic
Synthesis Program, Professor Nancy I. Totah, of the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Iowa, is developing new approaches for the synthesis of this
class of compounds. These approaches, based on the formation of molecules
containing two rings from precursors containing only one larger ring, offer
promise for the preparation of compounds available in only small quantities from
natural sources as well as modified compounds, not known to occur naturally,
which may have potential medicinal and agricultural applications
