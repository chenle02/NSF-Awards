This reseach is concerned with heat transfer enhancement in oscillatory
separated flow. The objective is to exploit the unsteady characteristics of
fluid flow in heat exchangers so as to promote the thermal effectiveness. The
work is a continuation of research employing numerical and experimental
approaches to examine the parametric dependence of resonance-induced
augmentation in both subcritical (stable) and super-critical (intrinsically
unsteady) flows. Experimental and numerical studies, the latter based on direct
simulation using the spectral element method, will be extended to the transition
and fully turbulent regimes. Emphasis will be placed on understanding and
predicting the important phenomenon of heat transfer enhancement due to
modulatory excitation of natural and undamped oscillating modes present in
separated flows.
