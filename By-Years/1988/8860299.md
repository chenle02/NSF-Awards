This is a feasibility study of using annihilation radiation from the positrons
produced by high-energy X-ray sources to increase the detected signal of
backscatter imaging tomography. Spatial distribution of those positrons with a
broad-spectrum source will be studied experimentally and the magnitude of the
required data processing effort involving the three-dimensional deconvolution
process will be made. If successful, this research will extend the
nondestructive examination (NDE) capability which is severely limited at
present. The PI's and BIR are well known in imaging technology.
