A Workshop on computational Models and Realizations is planned in St. Louis in
mid-November 1985. It is intended as a forum for discussion of the relationship
of formal models for concurrent computation to the physical realizations of
machines that can reliably carry out such computations. The goal of the research
to be discussed is one of providing a firm theoretical basis for the
specification, verification, and physical realization of distributed machines
for carrying out concurrent computations in an environment lacking a global
clock.
