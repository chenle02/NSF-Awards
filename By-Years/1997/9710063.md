After 1910 or so, the attention of most philosophers and physicists shifted
from the foundational uncertainties of the classical physics of continua-that
is, continuously extended, flexible objects such as wires, plates, or fluids-to
the novel puzzles raised by quantum mechanics and relativity. For various
extraneous reasons, twentieth-century physicists began to see the special
subject of point masses as comprising all of `classical mechanics,` although
this anti-continuum view would not have been shared by most of their nineteenth-
century forebears. Compared to continua, point masses present relatively few
conceptual problems, and the modern shift in the meaning of `classical
mechanics` has led many contemporary philosophers and historians to
misunderstand the conceptual problems with which the nineteenth century
struggled. At the same time, there has been much ongoing work on the behavior of
classical extended bodies in this century, conducted largely by engineers and
applied mathematicians. These investigations have taught us much about the
structure and range of validity of classical ways of thinking that were
completely unknown in the nineteenth century. Unfortunately, although
philosophers of science continually cite `the lessons to be learned from
classical theory,` most philosophers have not kept current with new knowledge on
the topic. The purpose of this project is to reexamine, in the light of
twentieth-century research on mechanics, a number of central historical episodes
that continue to play pivotal roles in philosophical argumentation today,
including the reasons why so many classical physicists believed that science
needs to be inherently `idealized` or otherwise `anti-realistic` in its
procedures; Duhem's motives in articulating the famed Quine-Duhem thesis; the
considerations that motivated his rejection of atomistic modeling; whether it is
reasonable to expect that a single set of axioms can adequately cover all of
what we usually regard as `classical mechanics.`
