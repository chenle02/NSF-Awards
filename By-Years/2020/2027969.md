The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from its
possible contribution to the shoreline preservation activities being conducted
on a national and international level. According to recent studies, the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that the average
cost of living shoreline protection ranges from $1000 to $5000 per linear foot
(LF). The 3D printing technology may provide an alternative living shoreline
protection at a fraction of this cost. The economic shoreline protection
technique proposed through this research will provide federal and state
agencies, landlords, and land developers with a user-friendly method to protect
their shorelines and stop possible impending property damage. The project may
suppy a low-maintenance living shoreline protection technique that provides a
permanent solution for shoreline scour and positively impact different
communities neighboring the shores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
targets the development and establishment of living shoreline protection to
mitigate scour problems affecting coastlines and depreciating multi-billion
dollars in structural assets per year. The Wasp technology for 3-D printing
provides the end user with the potential for printing random and complicated
shapes with internal voids without requiring form work or human intervention.
The Wasp technology for 3D printing will be used in printing oyster and coral
reefs by inserting printer needles with water pre-mixed with superplasticizers
in a predesigned blended mix of dry cement and supplementary cementitious
material to produce ultra-high-performance concrete reefs to be used in
restoring decaying oyster and coral reef barriers; hence, mitigating the scour
problem while restoring the ecological system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
