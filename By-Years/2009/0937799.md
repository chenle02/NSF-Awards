The objective of this research is to develop techniques that utilize solid-state
memory technologies from device, circuit, architecture, and system perspectives
across I/O hierarchy in order to exploit their true potential for improving I/O
stack performance in high-performance computing systems. &lt;br/&gt;I/O friendly
memory system architectures will be developed to enable hybrid processor-memory
3D integrations with largely reduced off-chip I/O traffic. Adaptive cache
management and hotspot prediction methods will be developed to address the low
random write performance of solid-state drives, and data processing techniques
will be developed to enable run-time configurable trade-offs among solid-state
drive performance characteristics. A comprehensive full-system simulation
infrastructure will be developed to evaluate and demonstrate the research under
diverse high-performance computing workloads.&lt;br/&gt;The research will
facilitate the high-performance computing systems to most effectively utilize
existing/emerging memory and processing technologies to tackle the grand I/O
stack design challenge. It can greatly contribute to enabling high-performance
computing systems to stay on track of their historic scaling, and hence benefit
numerous real-life applications such as biology, chemistry, earth science,
health care, etc. This project will also contribute to the society through
engaging under-represented groups, research infrastructure dissemination for
education and training, and outreach to high school students.&lt;br/&gt;
