George Washington University will bring together experts from the computer
science education, cybersecurity research, and education and assessment
communities to identify novel, compelling, and mutually beneficial approaches to
advancing cybersecurity education. The one-and-one-half-day workshop will be
held February 24-25, 2014 in Arlington, VA at the George Washington University
Arlington Education Center. A workshop report will synthesize the workshop
discussion and outline a set of novel, compelling, and mutually beneficial
research ideas for advancing cybersecurity education in the short and long
terms.
