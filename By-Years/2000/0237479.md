0237479 Burd The proposal addresses the role that nano-scale colloids play in
the transport of trace metals and pollutants in natural environmental and
engineered systems.&lt;br/&gt;The combination of experimental studies
encompassing microscopic methods (AFM and EM), synchrotron-based methods (SAXS,
XAS), and multi-scale modeling will aid in elucidating the significance of
particulate material in aquatic systems.&lt;br/&gt;This project is collaborative
and multi-disciplinary, combining expertise from chemistry, biology, and
modeling to investigate the role of fibrils and macromolecules in inorganic
colloid aggregation. Results of this work should help in the understanding the
self-cleansing capacity of fresh, estuarine and marine waters through transport
and sedimentation. Of special interest is the understanding of the similarities
and differences between freshwater and seawater.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was
received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative, NSF
01-157, category NIRT. &lt;br/&gt;
