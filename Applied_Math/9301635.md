9301635 Bayliss The investigator numerically studies the development of complex
spatial and temporal patterns in combustion. These patterns are associated with
narrow reaction zones in which rapid changes in the dependent variables occur
across narrow spatial regions. The solutions are obtained using an adaptive
pseudo-spectral method in which coordinate transformations are introduced during
the course of the computation to better resolve the reaction zone and the
associated patterns. He considers the formation of modulated traveling waves
(MTWs) in cellular flames, transitions between different types of MTWs and
transitions between MTWs and chaotic patterns, one-step and multiple reaction
mechanisms, the role of thermal expansion of the gas on the formation and
evolution of the patterns, and the formation of spatial and temporal patterns in
condensed phase gasless combustion. He also further develops the numerical
method to account for problems where there are multiple regions of rapid
variation. It has been observed that many combustible mixtures do not
necessarily burn in a unifrom pattern. Rather, ripples and other patterns can
occur along the flame. The formation of such patterns is believed to be an
important stage in the transition from laminar combustion (in which the burning
occurs in a regular, predictable manner) to turbulent combustion (in which the
burning occurs in an erratic, seemingly random fashion). An understanding of the
transition process is an essential prerequisite to control of the transition
process to lead to more efficient burning. In many instances these patterns can
not be predicted by analytic means and experiments are much less advanced than
for nonreacting flows. In the project, the investigator studies the problem of
the formation of patterns and the transition to turbulence in combustion. The
project uses supercomputer computations to study the formation of these patterns
and the physical mechanisms underly ing them. The study relates both to gaseous
combustion, i.e., the burning of fossil fuels, and gasless combustion, in which
a solid burns directly. The last process is employed in the synthesis of
materials, in particular of advanced ceramics and metallic alloys.
