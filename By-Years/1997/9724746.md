This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research among Joseph
Kearney and James Kremer at the University of Iowa and Stephane Donikian at the
Institute for Research in Informatics and Random Systems (IRISA) in Rennes,
France. IRISA is affiliated with INRIA, which is the French National Institute
for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics. The objective of the
research is to investigate scene and scenario modeling for simulating large-
scale virtual driving environments. These computer simulations are useful for
studying driving behavior and conducting experiments on the influence of drugs
and disease, the effectiveness of computer-assisted driving aids, and the impact
of new in-vehicle technology. The University of Iowa and IRISA groups have
developed independently driving simulators for rural and urban environments.
Their work is supported by US and French governments respectively and Ford (in
US) and Renault (in France). They have extensive and complementary expertise in
system building, dynamic simulation and control programming. The project will
advance knowledge of virtual prototyping and the development of computer tools
for understanding crashes and crash prevention.
