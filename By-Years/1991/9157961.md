As a PYI awardee, Dr. McCulloch will study the mechanical and
electrophysiological function of the heart using theoretical, computational and
experimental techniques in biomechanics. The work should lead to a better
understanding of the relationship between the excitation and contraction
mechanisms of cardiac muscle. The long-term benefit of this basic engineering
research will be the application of the results to improvements in the diagnosis
and therapy of the diseased heart.
