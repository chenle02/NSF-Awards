The project will develop statistical procedures for a variety of problems that
arise in the use of statistics in law, public policy, and in basic social
science research. The project will examine problems in legal, social science,
and public policy contexts and develop appropriate probability models and
statistical methodology for their solution. The objective is to ensure that
sound methodology is used in these important areas. This project, for example,
will study some techniques that have been used in actual legal cases to assess
their statistical properties and create alternative methods that are more
efficient. Because protecting the privacy of study participants and guaranteeing
the confidentiality of the information they provide is essential for retaining
public cooperation, the project also will investigate methods using grouped
rather than individual data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legal system decides many
important issues in our society. It therefore is important that the statistical
evidence submitted in actual cases involving, for example, equal employment or
environmental safety, is reliable and that sound conclusions are drawn from it.
One goal of the project is to develop improved methods for interpreting
statistical studies and analyzing statistical data arising in these areas. The
intent of the project is to study problems relating to issues that are basic to
a scientific discipline. Improving methods used to assess whether a test
accurately predicts job performance or who will do well in school is important
in educational research and psychology, as well as in discrimination cases.
Similarly, methods for obtaining proper conclusions from data that is in grouped
form to protect the anonymity of individual respondents can be used to analyze
survey data used in economic, sociology, and public health.
