9321375 Kling This study examines how computer specialists, managers and
workers' values shape computerization projects and change working conditions.
The key research questions are: To what extent and how do work values influence
the selection and eevelopment of information technologies in the workplace, and
how do people integrate these technologies into their worklives? Research
activities include both theoretical and empirical components. Theoretical
components focus on developing an understanding of some of the ethical
implications of computerizing work and the ethical issues faced by key
participants in computerization projects. Identification and analysis of these
issues proceeds by examination of existing case studies and participation in
discussion of the design and site selection for the empirical work as well as
some of the field interviews. Empirical research involves surveys and field
interviews of computerized work systems in three organizations. The
organizations will represent three ideal types of work values: (a)
rationalization, streamlining work for efficiency, organizing narrowly defined
jobs, and computerizing so as to reduce workers' discretion; (b) flexible
professionalization, organizing work to encourage responsibility, initiative
taking and learning, and developing computer systems to support enhanced work;
and (c) incremental accommodation, computerizing so as to support new services
or activities while minimizing the changes in work relationships. The
investigators will refine and pilot test their work values questionnaire in the
two or three organizations selected, and undertake initial field studies.
Results will be disseminated through presentations and case reports. One journal
article will be developed. ***
