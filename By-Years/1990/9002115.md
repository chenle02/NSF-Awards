The PIs are developing a radio scanner/recorder (SRS) which will aid biologists
in their field tracking of radio-tagged animals. RSR monitors radio frequencies
of animals and records their presence or absence. Currently, data are retrieved
from RSR by attaching a laptop computer; the PIs developing a command telemetry
module (CTM) which will allow remote retrieval of data. The prototype has been
tested successfully for 14 months along the Dolores River in southwestern
Colorado, the site of recent reintroductions of 18 radio-tagged river otters and
20 desert bighorn sheep. Funds are requested for the development and testing of
the CTM and for the development of the printed circuit board for the RSR and
CTM. Funds are also requested for components and assembly of a network of
instruments in order to test the system.
