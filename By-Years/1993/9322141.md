9322141 WILLIAMS This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduate Site in Sociology at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln. The
objective of the program is to provide a ten-week high-quality research
environment for students who are underrepresented in science careers
(minorities, women, and the disabled) and/or have limited access to research
facilities and training at the schools they are attending. Using the research
facilities of the Bureau of Sociological Research and under the close guidance
of faculty supervisors, students will initiate and carry out research projects
from formulating a problem to writing a final report. Students will participate
in morning seminars where they will learn research methods and share their
ongoing research with each other. Afternoons will be spent engaging in
individual projects and learning to use appropriate research technologies. The
students' papers will be presented at the Nebraska Undergraduate Symposium held
each fall and submitted for presentation at a professional meeting, such as the
Midwest Sociological Society and the Mid-South Sociological Society. This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences. ***
