9421069 Mossberg This proposal is for, "Experimental Quantum Optics". It calls
for a wide ranging experimental effort to explore several areas of current and
fundamental interest in the field of quantum optics. It proposes using driven,
cavity-confined, Ba atoms to study the effect of a driving field on spontaneous
radiative decay. Laser action will be studied in a special cavity which puts a
large fraction of all spontaneous radiative decay into the laser mode. Finally,
the proposal call for characterization of a new type of quantum-optical,
dielectric cavity consisting of glass bubbles in order to study strong atom-
cavity interactions. ***
