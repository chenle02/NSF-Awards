This represents a continuation of research previously supported by NSF grant
EAR84-08164, concerning fundamental studies of the structures, bonding, and
crystal chemistry of complex minerals. The project involves the systematic study
of spatial (both geometrical and topological) and chemical relationships among
crystal structures. When structures are considered as connected arrays of
fundamental structural units and ordered vacancies are taken into account, many
complex oxysalt structures are found to be analogous to simple intermetallic
compounds. The objective of this project is to examine these relationships
systematically in order to determine general relations among mineral structure
types. The results of these studies will contribute to our understanding of the
nature of structural organization and bonding in solids.
