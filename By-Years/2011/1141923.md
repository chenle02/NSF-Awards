Geomagnetic storms driven by solar wind perturbations are dynamic events that
can cause dramatic reconfigurations of plasma in the ionosphere, plasmasphere,
and magnetosphere. These events cause mesoscale redistributions giving rise to
the formation of storm enhanced density (SED) plumes and polar tongues of
ionization (TOI). Plasma patches are formed from the tongue of ionization and
subsequently propagate across the polar cap by the prevailing E x B drift of
charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field. Steep density gradients are
formed along the edges of polar cap patches and the TOI and SED features; these
gradients are the source region for plasma instabilities that produce cascades
of electron density irregularities in the background plasma. As radio signals
propagate through the irregularities, rapid fluctuations or scintillations are
produced in the received radio signal amplitude and phase. Scintillation
presents a considerable space weather hazard, especially for the high-precision
GPS observations and navigation. Comprehensive system level studies are needed
to link cause to effect through observations of SED, TOI, and polar cap patch
histories simultaneously with direct polar cap scintillation data. With this
award, scientists will study the formation of TOI and polar cap patches over
Antarctica, and observe the relationship of SED and TOI to polar scintillation,
using a combination of GPS data from multiple existing platforms and from
specially equipped GPS scintillation receivers located at three different
Antarctic sites. Educational opportunities will be provided through MIT
Haystack?s ongoing involvement in programs like the NSF Research Experiences for
Undergraduates, Research Experiences for Teachers, and focused high school
internships.
