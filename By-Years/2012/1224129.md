Portal to the Public: Expanding the National Network (PoP: ENN) is implementing
around the county the successful NSF-funded Portal to the Public model in which
researchers are trained to communicate and interact with the general public at
informal science education (ISE) institutions about the research that they are
conducting. The project, which follows on a thorough evaluation of the model at
eight sites and current implementation at an additional fifteen sites, will
incorporate twenty new ISE sites into the growing network, provide training and
mentorship to ISE professionals on the use and adaptation of the PoP
implementation manual and toolkits, and develop an enhanced network website that
will serve as a communication and innovation hub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work
is responsive to the needs and activities of ISE organizations which continue to
expand their missions beyond presenting to the public established science,
technology, engineering and math (STEM) and are working to become places where
visitors can also experience the process and promise of current research via
face-to-face interactions with researchers. The project is expanding both the
kind and number of institutions involved around the country and is facilitating
their capacity to develop a knowledge base, share experiences and best
practices.
