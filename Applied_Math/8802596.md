This research will consider theoretical and computational aspects of fluid
turbulence. The research group will combine experts in the areas of theory,
applied and numerical analysis, scientific computation, and computer science.
Recent advances in computers have now created sufficient computational power to
analyze significant problems in turbulent flows based on Navier- Stokes models.
However, computing power in and of itself is not sufficient to solve the true
problems of interest. The parallel streams of theory and computation in this
research will provide mutual inspiration and validation. Development of
algorithms which make more effective use of the new generation of computers will
be considered. Numerical experiments to test the limits of current
supercomputers and algorithms will also be part of this work. Turbulence is a
basic problem in fluid mechanics. A more complete understanding of turbulence
will lead to improvement in the design of advanced aircraft and fluid machinery.
