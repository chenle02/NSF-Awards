The first imaging correlator capable of correlating signals from 350 antennas
will be developed. The correlator will be capable of processing two orders of
magnitude more baselines than any other existing instrument, will have 200 MHz
bandwidth and will be the first correlator of its kind capable of active
interference mitigation. The design will allow measurement of all polarization
products and will use the latest commercial-off-the-shelf digital technology.
The correlator will be a prototype for a much larger correlator for the Square
Kilometer Array. The instrument will be part of the Allen Telescope Array, a
privately funded centimeter-wave radio telescope array. Funding the correlator
will enable the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory to continue in its
tradition of producing radio astronomers skilled in both observational radio
astronomy and instrumentation, critical skills for the future of radio
astronomy. Public outreach, especially at the K-12 ages is an integral part of
the ATA project: a visitor center built from private funds will be part of the
observatory.
