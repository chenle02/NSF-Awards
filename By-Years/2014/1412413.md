Recent technological advances have made it possible to reconsider the idea of
distributing spatially a large number of small devices that have actuating,
sensing, computing, and telecommunications capabilities. Such spatial
implementations can provide unprecedented capabilities for new applications in
spatially distributed networks. The investigator explores methods of nonlinear
sampling for distributed signal acquisition systems, with attention to
engineering applications. This interdisciplinary project has broader impact on
mathematical, engineering and industrial problems, ranging from nonlinear frame
theory and nonlinear signal processing to smart energy, transportation, and
security networks. Students are trained in the course of this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this project, the principal investigator
develops a novel mathematical framework to analyze and synthesize spatial
signals with compressive parametric representations. He develops globally robust
algorithms for cases where communication and energy resources are limited. He
investigates development of optimal sampling methodologies for analysis and
synthesis of smart signal acquisition in engineering networks. The main themes
of this project are based on localization techniques in spatial domains, quasi-
Banach algebraic relaxations of sparsity measures, and Hilbertization of quasi-
optimality in Banach spaces.
