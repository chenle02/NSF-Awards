Dr. Chisholm will investigate fundamental aspects of growth regulation and
dynamics of marine plankton in the fluctuating environments that are typical of
oceanic regimes. This understanding is essential for modelling and designing
studies of marine productivity and food web dynamics. Specifically, they will: *
Study the diatom life cycle, to better understand what environmental and genetic
factors control the switch from vegetative to sexual reproduction; * Investigate
the cell cycle in cyanobacteria and marine bacteria, to better understand how
their DNA cycle is regulated under changing growth conditions, and why aspects
of the cycle deviate from the classic E. coli model; * Develop a multichannel,
high-sensitivity (and relatively inexpensive) flow cytometer, which will
facilitate the study small picoplankton and marine bacteria. The results of this
work will augment our understanding of microbial growth rates in the sea and
phytoplankton population genetics; it should also contribute methodological
advances for the study of marine bacteria at sea. Moreover, it could enhance our
fundamental understanding of microbial physiology by revealing features of
marine organisms which deviate from classical paradigms.
