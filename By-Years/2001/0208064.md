This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Structural
studies on Cdc42Hs mutant proteins that may initiate cellular transformation."
NMR spectroscopy is being used to characterize mutant forms of Cdc42Hs, an
intracellular signal transduction protein cloned in E. coli. This protein binds
GTP or GDP and acts as a molecular timing switch based on the nature of the
bound ligand. The research will determine the structure and dynamics of two
Cdc42Hs mutants to understand the role of Cdc42Hs in processes that lead to cell
transformation.
