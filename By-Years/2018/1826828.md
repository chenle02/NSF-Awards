The Smart and Connected Communities (S&amp;CC) vision is to improve the well-
being and prosperity of diverse communities by connecting residents to each
other and their environments through smart technologies. Achieving this vision
will require solving complex and interlocking physical, social, behavioral,
economic, and infrastructure challenges, which will only be possible through
close engagement with community stakeholders to understand the community needs
and develop actionable solutions. This proposal is for the first S&amp;CC
Program PI meeting. The meeting will allow Principal Investigators (PIs) from
NSF's S&amp;CC Program and graduate students spanning multiple technological and
social disciplines to interact with NSF Program Directors, community partners
and stakeholders, and representatives from other Federal Agencies in order to
disseminate project objectives and accomplishments and foster new and emerging
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planned sessions of the PI meeting will
address cross-cutting themes of S&amp;CC, including improving outcomes in under-
served communities and sustaining S&amp;CC technologies beyond the development
and prototyping stages. These discussions will be enhanced through networking
activities for NSF PIs and participating community partners. In addition, the
S&amp;CC PI meeting will be held in conjunction with the Smart Cities Connect
annual meeting, which brings together city and municipality leaders who are
working on S&amp;CC problems and are interested in forming partnerships with
others including academic researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
