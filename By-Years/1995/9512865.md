This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in theoretical
physics between research groups at Texas A &amp; M University and the University
of Bordeaux. The teams are led by John F. Reading (U.S.) and Robert E. Gayet
(France). The main objective is to study fundamental processes of ion-atom
collisions. These processes are of practical importance in Fusion and in studies
of extinction rates in Biology. The investigators will focus on two electron
problems in which two or more electrons actively change their states. The
project benefits from the complementary expertise of the U.S. investigators in
ion-atom processes and French expertise in analytical high energy methods.
