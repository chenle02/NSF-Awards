This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the research of
Dr. Charles Doubleday. Both computational and time-resolved experimental studies
of the dynamics of bimolecular reactions which have low or zero enthalpies will
be carried out. Specific computational studies will focus on reactions of
singlet ethylene and methylene with ethylene, water and ammonia, as well as the
competition between combination and disproportionation in the reaction of methyl
and ethyl free radicals. Ab initio calculations of reaction potential curves
will be combined with variational transition state theory to derive reaction
rate constants. Experimentally, picosecond pump-probe spectroscopy of
intramolecular entropy-controlled reactions of biradicals will be explored. The
dependence of the transient decay trace on temperature and solvent viscosity
will be determined. Entropy-controlled bimolecular reactions such as carbene
trapping , reaction of ylides with olefins, singlet oxygen trapping, radical
recombination, cycloadditions and excited-state quenching are common in organic
chemistry. This research will advance our understanding, both on a theoretical
and experimental level of the dynamics of these important processes.
