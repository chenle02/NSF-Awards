A major goal in the field of fluid dynamics is to obtain a detailed and
quantitative understanding of turbulence, which is a type of fluid motion
characterized by rapid and irregular fluctuations in velocity. Turbulence plays
a pivotal role in countless engineering and industrial applications such as the
design of aircraft, where the production of turbulence must be understood to
achieve energy efficient and effective technologies. It has long been believed
that the inner workings of turbulence may be understood in terms of the
differential equations that are being used to model fluid motion, including the
Euler equations. However, the analysis of these equations has proved so
difficult that much of the relationship between turbulence and solutions to the
equations of fluid dynamics remains conjectural and unresolved. Recently, a new
approach has been developed to analyze solutions to fluid equations that have
rapid fluctuations comparable to what is seen in turbulence. This approach is
intimately tied to questions in the mathematical discipline of geometry. This
research project aims to push this new approach towards its fullest potential to
improve the understanding of turbulence and to expand the frontiers of
mathematical analysis. The project provides research training opportunities for
graduate students.

At a technical level, the PI will prove rigorous results on the structure of
weak solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics, including the incompressible
Euler equations. The results will address the extent to which such weak
solutions can be shown to exhibit the properties observed or predicted of
turbulent flows. One direction of research will relate to the phenomenon of
anomalous dissipation of energy and generalizations of Onsager?s conjecture. The
PI will also investigate fine properties of the dynamical structure of general
weak solutions to the Euler and related equations. The research will implement
and expand upon the method of convex integration, as well as introduce new tools
of geometric or harmonic analysis as needed.
