The prevention of structural collapse during an earthquake having a major
intensity at a site is a well recognized objective of seismic design. This
project addresses the importance in attaining this objective by ensuring that
buildings will not fail while undergoing inelastic response. This research is
part of an effort which seeks to provide a practical and reliable methods to
check the safety of a building against inelastic dynamic instability. The
specific objectives of the research are: a) To investigate the means of
identifying the kinematic mechanism that will control a building's dynamic
response to sufficiently strong ground motions. b) To calculate instability
limits for a number of representative buildings and ground motions using
accurate mathematical models. c) To examine the matter of inelastic dynamic
instability in the context of code-based seismic design and develop recommended
guidelines for design. The development of a method to check instability which
accounts for the inelastic dynamic nature of the problem is currently recognized
as one of the priority needs for improving seismic design performance standards.
This research will lead to a better understanding of how to prevent single story
and other undesirable collapse mechanisms.
