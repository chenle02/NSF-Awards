This award will provide funding to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) for a REU Site in electrical engineering and electronics,
under the direction of Dr. David B. Newell. The project will involve up to nine
undergraduate students for a 10-12 week summer program and internationally known
NIST research engineers and scientists in individual research projects covering
topics that include fundamental electrical measurements, national electrical
standards, electric power systems, flat panel displays, electronic data exchange
and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).
