Proposal #: 93-21903 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V ALPHA HELIX, a 133 foot vessel, which is owned by the NSF and
operated by the University. Instrumentation requested includes computer
hardware, a water sampling rosette, fluorometers, an automated oxygen titration
system, and a salinometer. The requested instrumentation is necessary to support
NSF funded cruises in 1994 and will enhance the scientific capabilities of the
vessel in the future.
