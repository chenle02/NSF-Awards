This award will provide support to a group from Southeastern Massachusetts
University, who is working on an experiment (E850) at Brookhaven National
Laboratory, designed to improve our understanding of the structure of hadrons
and the nature of the dynamics of their interactions at short distances. The
experimental method is based on observing two- body elastic scattering and
production processes, when they occur at 90o in the center of mass. This
experiment will test Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) by establishing the limits of
validity of perturbative methods in QCD and achieving some understanding of the
nature of the non-pertubative contributions.
