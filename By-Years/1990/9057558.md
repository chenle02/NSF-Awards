As shared-memory multiprocessors are scaled to a large number of nodes, coping
with the large latency for memory references becomes a major challenge. In
general, there are two complementary approaches for managing latency: (i)
methods that reduce latency for accesses, and (ii) mechanisms that help tolerate
large latencies. While both approaches are important for general-purpose
parallel architectures, it is preferable to first reduce the latency for
accesses before trying to tolerate the latency. This is because techniques which
depend on tolerating latency demand a much larger degree of parallelism in order
to successfully overlap communication and computation. This project explores and
evaluates novel techniques to deal with the latency problem. The research will
be done in the context of DASH (Directory Architecture for Shared Memory), a
scalable shared-memory multiprocessor currently being built at Stanford. The two
major topics investigated are: (i) the use of weak memory consistency models to
help reduce the latency for write operations, and (ii) the use of prefetching
techniques to hide latency for both read and write operations.
