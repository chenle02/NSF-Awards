The qualitative analysis of physical systems is a central problem in artificial
intelligence, but current techniques are successful only for simple models of
small systems. Exponential time complexity and the ubiquity of ambiguous
conclusions limit the usefulness of qualitative physics reasoning techniques
when applied to large models. Effective reasoning about complex systems will
require multiple models of the system that embody different simplifying
assumptions appropriate for different tasks. It is therefore proposed to develop
a theory of both qualitative models and the assumption on which they are based,
and to test that theory by constructing a reasoning program. This reasoner will
automatically determine which assumptions are appropriate, build and use the
corresponding model, and finally check its conclusions. This approach should
significantly speed up reasoning, decrease ambiguity, and enable automated
analysis of more complex systems.
