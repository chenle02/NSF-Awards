This award will support the Minitrack on Software Support for Genome Mapping and
Sequencing, to take place at the 26th Hawaii International Conference on Systems
Sciences, to be held in Kauai, Hawaii, January 5-8, 1993. The one day workshop
consisting of paper presentations and discussion sessions will bring together
computational specialists and biologists interested in computational aspects of
mapping and DNA sequencing. The workshop will include a panel discussion section
in which genome researchers will evaluate the usefulness and significance of the
presented research in light of their current computation tools and projected
needs. This workshop is being supported cooperatively with the National Center
for Human Genome Research of the National Institutes of Health and with the
Department of Energy.
