9730714 Moore Duke University is developing a family of web-based, interactive
modules for use by high school students who have completed a yearlong calculus
course. These materials will support an independent, self-paced, post-calculus
that emphasizes applications. Additionally, the modules may be used by high
school teachers for enhancement study. The modules are written in HTML with a
companion computer algebra system file (e.g. Maple of Mathematica) that can be
downloaded onto the user's local machine. On-line guides are provided for
students and faculty, workshops are provided for faculty monitors and special
summer workshops for other undergraduate schools that are interested in adopting
the program.
