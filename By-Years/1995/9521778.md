9521778 Ritzwoller Dr. Ritzwoller will study the shapes of the helioseismic
spectral lines to deduce key information about large-scale aspherical
structures, convection, magnetic fields and excitation mechanisms. The line
shape interpretation requires separating structural, dynamical and excitation
effects on mode peaks from the artifacts of data reduction techniques and is not
entirely straightforward since the seismic effects of various excitation
mechanisms and solar structures are not yet well understood. ***
