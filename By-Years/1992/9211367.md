Research in theoretical physics will cover a wide variety of topics, including
superstring and supersymmetry theory, lattice field theory, perturbative quantum
chromodynamics, collisions involving elementary particles, collisions involving
nuclei, statistical mechanics, and other problems. This broad research program
includes efforts to unify our description of all the forces, attempts to better
understand the behavior of the elementary particles, and studies which
illuminate basic physical principles by revealing their consequences in
interesting physical situations.
