PI Miyashita will create extensive documentation of the way stress, pitch, and
intonation are used in the pronunciation of Blackfoot, an Algonquian language
spoken in Canada and the United States. This documentation will contribute to a
general theoretical and typological understanding of these prosodic features in
human language. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus far, Blackfoot stress has been
difficult to characterize: there are rises and falls pitch associated with
Blackfoot stressed syllables; and the placement of stress appears unpredictable
in terms of the sound patterns of the language. In this study, Miyashita will
provide thorough descriptions of Blackfoot stress patterns in polysynthetic verb
phrases, pronunciation in connected speech; and stress as an inherent quality of
individual words. Miyashita's research will also identify the acoustic
correlates of stress in Blackfoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important product of
the project will be a verb paradigm database with stress orthographically
indicated. Blackfoot community members will find this material of great use in
creating pedagogical materials. The database, which will be accessible through a
website, will also be of use to theoretical and typological linguists
