9507988 Lutwak The proposed research lies in the area of geometric convexity;
more specifically, it focuses on the Brunn-Minkowski theory, otherwise known as
the theory of mixed volumes. Various problems concerning convex bodies in space
are proposed: the Minkowski problem, affine isoperimetric inequalities, and
possible duals to the Brunn-Minkowski theory (replacing projections by
intersections) are considered. The theory of mixed volumes has already found a
wide variety of applications. In probability and statistics, it is used to
supplement the Monte Carlo method. In geometric tomography, the theory is
applied to various imaging (X-rays, and MRI scanners in particular) problems .
One of the basic problems in the theory is the reconstruction of a convex body
from a minimal set of its cross sections or projections.
