This award provides partial support for an extended workshop and a conference
on turbulence in optics and plasmas under the US-USSR Cooperative Science
Program. These activities are envisioned as the step in a program of sustained
interaction between scientists in the US and the USSR in the general area of
nonlinear studies. These efforts will involve both theoretical and experimental
scientists with an emphasis on inclusion of new researchers. The problem of
turbulence is one of the most challenging in the interface between physics and
mathematics. It is a fundamental problem not only for hydrodynamics but for
plasma physics, astrophysics and nonlinear optics. It is now realized that many
different types of turbulence have the same characteristic feature - the
nucleation, formation and dissipation of special singular coherent structures.
These are related to singularities of the solutions of the governing partial
differential equations and are responsible for two key processes in turbulence -
the production of small-scale motion and the dissipation of energy. These areas
will be explored in an extended workshop and a conference under the auspices of
the US-USSR Cooperative Science Program.
