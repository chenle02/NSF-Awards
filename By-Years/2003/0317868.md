This proposal focuses on increasing our understanding of Geomagnetically Induced
Currents (GICs) near conductivity gradients associated with coastlines. The
effort will address the instrumental biases of ground magnetometers due to these
gradient structures. The PIs invoke a novel pseudo-current source technique to
allow analysis beyond the reach of past finite element methods. Their new method
for calculating the electric and magnetic fields at the Earth's surface during
space storms, called the "method of auxiliary sources" (MAS), will be
investigated, developed, and applied, thus meeting the goals of the NSWP. MAS
allows a more sophisticated treatment of laterally non-uniform ground
conductivity structures, such as ocean-continent boundaries. The proposed
research could provide an important link in the space weather chain by coupling
the ionosphere to the ground.
