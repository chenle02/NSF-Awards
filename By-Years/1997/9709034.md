This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Kansas State University to acquire a tunable
ultrafast laser for time-resolved spectroscopy and microscopy. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) the
microscopic/spectroscopic characterization of technologically important
mesostructured thin film materials and (2) the spectroscopic characterization of
the physical propoerties of proteins using the tryptophanyl residues as probes.
A laser can provide important information about chemical reactivity. Its use may
enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactivity and
non-reactivity of molecules.
