This supplementary award funds Pennsylvania State University's Industry/
University Cooperative Research Center for Dielectrics to perform collaborative
research with Rutgers University's Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Ceramics on a project "Effects of Particle and Grain Size on the
Phase Transitions and Dielectric Properties of Barium Titanate." Both Centers'
Industry Advisory Boards have recommended and cost shared this two year project.
A woman undergraduate is also funded to augment the Center's research studying
rate controlled sintering of electronic ceramic materials. Three years of
supplementary funding is also provided to maintain the evaluation protocols for
the Center. The Program Manager recommends that Pennsylvania State University be
awarded $25,000 for each of two (2) years for a "TIE" project with Rutgers
University, totalling $50,000. $24,000 for three (3) years is also recommended
for the evaluator costs. Another $5,000 for one (1) year is recommended for the
woman undergraduate with funds from the Women, Minority and Disabled Engineering
Research Assistants Program.
