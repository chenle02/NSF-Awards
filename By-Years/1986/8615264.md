From February 1973 to December 1976 a tall building in Boston was instrumented
with up to 140 transducers, and more than 20,000 hours of reliable data was
recorded. The data includes measurements of wind velocity, facade pressure and
deflection, and building motion. This was one of the most extensive onsite
studies ever carried out on a single building. The present work will use the
above mentioned body of accumulated raw data and in a one-year period will sort,
codify, document, and validate it. The resulting report will be made available
to the wind engineering and scientific community and the P.I. will send to NSF
twenty copies of the final report for further dissemination. The P.I. is highly
qualified to perform this project. A one-year award is recommended in which only
the described task will be carried out.
