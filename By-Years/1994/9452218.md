9452218 Metaxas We are purchasing a multi-processor computer to support
undergraduate education in parallel computation in computer science and other
computation-intensive disciplines. There is a strong need to introduce
parallelism to our curriculum. Building upon our substantial teaching and
research in parallel computing and our prior development of instructional
resources to support educational efforts in this area, we are developing a
course and the necessary curricular materials (exercises, algorithm animations,
textbook) that will serve as a prototype for undergraduate teaching and research
in parallel computation in similar institutions. Our project is unique in its
integration of algorithmic visualization and multimedia technology, and in its
firm grounding in applications in biology, chemistry and computer science.
Furthermore, we have both the human resources and an extensive infrastructure to
support it.
