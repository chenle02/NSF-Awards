The School of Chemical Sciences (SES) at the University of Georgia (UGA)
requests support to obtain a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. The
research programs of six members of the SCS are described here. These programs
involve the following areas of Chemistry and Biochemistry: 1. Characterization
of new metalloproteins involved in iron metabolism and electron transfer, 2.
Structural elucidation of complex alkaloids and other natural products, 3.
Conformational analysis of small peptides, 4. The study of the physical and
chemical mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed reactions. These programs are now
frustrated by the lack of readily accessible modern NMR instrumentation at the
University of Georgia. The NMR spectrometer will be located along with other
multi-user analytical instrumentation in a modern centralized "Instrument
Facility" maintained by the SCS.
