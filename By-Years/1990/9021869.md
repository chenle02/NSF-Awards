This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Duke University for the renovation
and repair of the Biological Sciences Building which houses that institution's
Departments of Botany and Zoology and the School of Forestry and Environmental
Studies and thus its systematics, ecology, physiology, genetics, cell,
molecular, and other biological research and research training activities. This
building was constructed in 1961, and there has been no renovation of the
building's basic systems since its construction. The ARFMP grant of $1,900,000
and $2,939,335 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize
these research and research training facilities. This project will address the
need to improve the current research infrastructure by providing conditions
compatible with new techniques and methodologies of biology which require
accurate environmental control, stable and sufficient electrical power, pure
water supply, and ready access to local and international computer networks. The
renovation will also assure a flexible infrastructure enabling the support of
developing and currently unforeseen areas of biological investigation that could
not otherwise be pursued. This award contributes to the infrastructure of
science by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for
the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students. Students trained in
these laboratories will have access to a stable, reliable environment which is
necessary for the preservation of collections, for long-term experimentation and
research, and for the operation of computers and sophisticated scientific
equipment.
