This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research that will allow Dr. Needleman to
develop a much needed system for the expression of cloned archaebacterial genes
of Halobacterium. The successful development of this system would have profound
effects on the study of halobacterial proteins like bactaeriorhodopsin and
halorhodopsin and on the molecular biology of archaebacteria.
