The Cdc28 kinase in budding yeast, and its homologs (cdks) in higher eukaryotes,
function as key regulators to allow progression through the cell cycle. The
proteins that regulate Cdc2 are targets for oncogene action. A genetic screen
was undertaken to identify additional proteins which regulate cell cycle
progression. This screen identified a novel, essential protein kinase, Pdl3.
Mutations in PDL3 affect cell cycle progression through G2 or M and bud
morphology. Additional data are consistent with a model where Pdl3 is required
for the activation of Cde 28 kinase. The primary goals of these experiments are
to: characterize biochemically the activity of the kinase, define the function
of Pdl3 in cell cycle control, and identify other components which interact with
Pdl3 in control of morphology and cell cycle progression. Interactive activities
at SUNY Stony Brook include: teaching two courses for women in the Project WISE
program; teaching a graduate course in the cell cycle; and acting as advisor to
undergraduate and graduate students doing research in the lab.
