Cutkosky 9610132 The principal investigator will continue a study of local
factorization of mappings. The investigator has recently proven that
factorization of birational maps along a valuation is possible in dimension
three and characteristic zero by constructing a triangle of monoidal transforms
with nonsingular centers. In general, it is necessary that both rings be
blownup. Some new directions which the principal investigator is pursuing are:
(1) Find a more "canonical" algorithm, which will patch to a global
factorization by monoidal transforms; (2) Extend the result to positive
characteristic; (3) Find a local result valid in all dimensions. He is also
continuing research on equivalence and finite determinancy of mappings, and on
Cohen-Macaulay coordinate rings. This is research in the field of algebraic
geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In
its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the
simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods
not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
