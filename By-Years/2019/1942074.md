This award will support student travel to the Midwest Programming Languages
Summit, to be held at Purdue University in September 2019. This research
workshop will serve as a valuable forum for researchers and students to share
in-progress research ideas and receive timely feedback to influence subsequent
work. This will be particularly valuable because of the high concentration of
programming languages researchers in the Midwest, and because it will provide
graduate student researchers opportunities to network and further develop their
research and presentation skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds from this award
will help support U.S. based students, focusing on graduate students at an
advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to
attend this workshop. The impacts include training the next generation of
researchers in this important research area. Higher priority will be assigned to
students giving presentations and a strong emphasis will be put on supporting
students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
