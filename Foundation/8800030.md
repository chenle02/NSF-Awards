Stob will continue his work in recursion theory, a branch of mathematical logic
which formalizes the notion of computability. He intends to study the structure
of the lattice of recursively enumerable sets and the upper semilattice of
recursively enumerable degrees. In particular, Stob will attempt to settle
conjectures about orbits under automorphisms of the lattice of recursively
enumerable sets, automorphism types of splittings of creative sets, and
isomorphism types of lattices of supersets of r.e. sets. Stob will also attempt
to answer questions about the Turing degrees of various natural classes of r.e.
sets and will attempt to settle two questions about minimal pairs in the r.e.
Turing degrees.
