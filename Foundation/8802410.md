This project continues the development of a theory for treating decidability
questions about analytic solutions of systems of differential equations. For
example, the principal investigator and J. Denef have previously shown that
there is no algorithm for deciding if a single ordinary differential equation
has an analytic solution on the non-negative real numbers, even given that it
has a unique solution near zero. Part 1 of the project is the development of a
theory of nonarchimedean rigid semi-analytic and sub-analytic sets. (By this is
meant the theory of semi-analytic and sub-analytic sets over a nonarchimedean,
algebraically closed, complete normed field.) This development will parallel the
recent treatment of p-adic semi-analytic and sub-analytic sets of Denef and van
den Dries. The principal investigator has proved an analytic elimination theorem
(over nonarchimedean, algebraically closed, complete normed fields) which will
facilitate the development of the theory. Results sought include (a) that the
complement of a rigid sub-analytic set is subanalytic; (b) that every
subanalytic set is a finite disjoint union of subanalytic manifolds; (c)
nonarchimedean Lojasiewicz inequalities for rigid subanalytic sets and
functions; and some further results. In part 2 the principal investigator seeks
to show that algebraic subsets of the p-adic integers Zp, defined by polynomials
involving few monomials, if they are finite contain only few points in Zp. In
part 3, he will investigate a decision problem about the existence of power
series solutions of maximally overdetermined systems of partial differential
equations.
