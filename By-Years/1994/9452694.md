9452694 Croft The University of South Alabama will initiate a four week,
residential, Young Scholars Program in meteorology for 20 students entering
grades 10 and 11. The program is designed to help students develop basic skills
in the field of meteorology and to make them aware of the interdisciplinary
nature of meteorology and the career opportunities available. The students will
be involved in a combination of lectures, laboratory exercises, field trips, and
a research project. The program will offer a rare opportunity to draw upon and
experience many different and varied scientific principles.
