This award supports the conference Seminar on Stochastic Processes (SSP) 2014 to
be held at the University of California-San Diego on March 26-29, 2014. These
seminars have been held annually since 1981; they have become the most important
regular conference series for probabilists in North America. They bring together
a diverse group of accomplished researchers and young investigators in
probability and stochastic processes. The primary goal is to provide a platform
for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and
to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal atmosphere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in
probability, and many of the most prominent probabilists make a habit of
attending it every year. The morning invited presentations provide a platform
for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the informal format of the
afternoon sessions gives graduate students and young researchers a unique
opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging
in high level open discussions, and by offering the opportunity to present their
own research to leaders in their field. The synergy made possible by this
original formula is very rarely found in more traditional meetings. Financial
support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate
students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may
not otherwise be able to attend the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
