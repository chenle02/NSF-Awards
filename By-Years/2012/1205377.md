The objective of this proposal is to adapt computer architecture simulation
infrastructure to model power and thermal issues for future multicore systems.
The main concern addressed by this proposal is simulation speed when power and
thermal estimations are also considered. &lt;br/&gt;To accelerate simulation
times, engineers employ sampling. The problem is that adding modern multicores
and thermal simulation breaks existing sampling techniques. The research
community needs performance, power, and thermal simulation results at least one
order of magnitude faster than currently available. This proposal provides
support to build such system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation
infrastructure will have a significant impact on the computer architecture
community. We expect an increase in the number of publications by third parties.
We also expect a larger, multi-university, class curriculum impact due to make
this simulator available to class projects. Combining the two previous impacts,
we expect a larger proportion of the graduate and undergraduate students to
learn and research about future multicores, mobile systems, and clouds with a
focus on power and thermal issues.
