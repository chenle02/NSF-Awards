Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS). This summer school provides an
important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study theoretical

The broader impacts are include building international community and cooperation
in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of students with
exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers.
