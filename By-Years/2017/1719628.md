This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US
students attending SIGMOD 2017, the 2017 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on
Management of Data. The Student Fellowships helps cover the travel costs for US
students, making it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and
disseminate their work. The conference also provides an opportunity for them to
interact with future national and international scientific collaborators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SIGMOD conference has a dynamic and comprehensive
program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers,
tutorials, panels, industrial papers, technical demonstrations, and
undergraduate research papers. The program also includes workshops that demand
dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current data management
research and development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in
academia and industry. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for
students to share their knowledge, experience, and research work with
internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.
