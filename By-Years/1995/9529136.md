Receptor organs for detecting gravity are called otocysts in invertebrates, and
otolithic organs in vertebrates. They are pouches that contain dense masses of
calcified crystals called otoconia; the action of gravity on these masses,
overlying specialized mechanosensory cells, provides a signal for determining
the normal earth-vertical direction. The otoconia have remarkably specific
mineral chemistry and crystalline structure in different animals, and pilot
studies suggest that these features may vary somewhat under different
gravitational conditions. The flight of Neurolab provides a unique opportunity
to examine the development of these gravitational sensing accessories in the
absence of normal gravity. Ground-based studies using electron microscopy and
atomic-force microscopy provide data on the sizes, weights, and mineral
composition of the otoconia during normal development. Results will be important
for understanding development of the vestibular system, for considering calcium
homeostasis in general, and may have some impact on biomaterials studies.

Directorate's participation in the NASA/Interagency Neurolab activity on the
space shuttle orbiter, which in turn is part of Decade of the Brain activities.
