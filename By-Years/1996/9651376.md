This project is designed to upgrade the technology used in the Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) program. In 1994, the university purchased three Sun
Microsystem Sparcstations and ARC/INFO software. The U.S. Forest Service loaned
a pen plotter to the university to supplement the project. Although the memory
has been doubled recently to 32 megabytes, student projects involving large
databases still prove to be a frustrating experience. Large databases are
difficult to manipulate because of limited memory. When the existing plotter is
returned to the Forest Service, the students would not be able to view completed
work except on a computer monitor. The limitations of existing technology would
negatively affect the potential of the GIS program. Therefore, the funds for
this project are being devoted to the purchase of a Hewlett-Packard 650C plotter
and to increase the RAM on each workstation to 96 megabytes. This equipment
helps provide students with real-world projects based on local and regional
needs and interests.
