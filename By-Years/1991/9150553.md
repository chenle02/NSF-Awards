Lecture materials and laboratory experiments will be developed for an issues-
directed, "chemistry in context" introductory course for business students. This
project addresses the problem of creating literacy in science among business
students by introducing chemical principles in the context of student interests.
The course will address materials science, energy, waste management, and the
chemical industry. New laboratory experiments will provide hands-on, realistic
experiences relevant to those that students will encounter as managers and
business leaders. The project will be evaluated, and the results will be
disseminated through educational and business forums.
