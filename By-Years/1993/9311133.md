ABSTRACT: 9311133, PI-Burris: This project will assist the Marine Biological
Laboratory in the acquisition of laboratory and multi user equipment that will
benefit resident and visi ting scientists and the educational program. A
metabolic gas analysis system will be acquired consisting of two components that
will enable the routine, ultra high precision measurement carbon dioxide and
oxygen in aqueous samples. The two components of the system are 1) a computer
controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) titrator, and 2) an ultra high precision K1
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) or total CO2 (TCO2) analyzer. These instruments
will allow precise determinations of DO (0.1 uM precision) in sediment pore
waters or the water column of freshwater, astuarine and marine systems. Research
projects benefiting from the acquisition of the metabolic gas analysis system
focus on: controls on organic matter production and decomposition in marine and
freshwater sediments; microbial food webs and trophic structure of lakes,
rivers, estuaries and the continental shelf; benthic and pelagic carbon and
nitrogen cycling in arctic lakes and rivers and land margin ecosystems; the
source and fate of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in aquatic systems; and
biogeochemical changes occurring in lakes due to increased sulfate deposition.
The metabolic gas analysis system will be available to all investigators at the
MBL and advertised through the widely distributed MBL brochures. A steam
autoclave will also be acquired. The Marine Biological Laboratory will make
these items available to visiting scientists as well as resident scientists. In
a secondary manner, the items may also serve educational purposes.
