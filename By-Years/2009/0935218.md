The Thirteenth International Workshop on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD-13) will
be held at Stanford University, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory from July
20-24, 2009. This award will support the broad participation by young scientists
at this conference. This workshop occurs every two years. These meetings have
about 300 international participants and cover a broad range of innovative
detectors and sensors based on low temperature properties of matter. These
detector advances have proven key to enabling a number of astrophysics,
biophysics and micro-analysis applications. The latest advances are presented at
these conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Broader Impacts, the Workshop
will address the development of cryogenic radiation and particle detectors and
the application of these new technologies in the many exciting fields ranging
from particle physics and astrophysics to biology and medicine. The Proceedings
of this conference will be published so that many others can take advantage of
the talks. For the first time in the LTD Workshop history, the proceedings will
be given to participants on a CD.&lt;br/&gt;
