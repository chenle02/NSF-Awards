Milwaukee Public Museum will provide underrepresented, economically-
disadvantaged, minority, urban girls in grades 6 to 8 an opportunity to
participate in hands-on science learning activities and mentoring by scientists
in botany, geology, zoology and biodiversity studies. The participants will have
the opportunity to learn directly from the scientists, join them at field
studies, conduct mini-research under their guidance and find out what inspired
their career choices. In addition to the expertise of the scientists, "Science
Explorations" program will utilize the exhibits, collections, live animals,
scientific laboratories and computer/distance learning laboratory during a
series of 12-week after school sessions in the fall and spring semesters. A
total of 141 girls will receive 96 hours of instruction over three years.
"Science Explorations" activities will promote learning of biological and
geological forces that have formed the present natural environment with a focus
on the local area where the participants reside. Parental involvement in the
"Families and Friends" event and a complimentary museum and Clue Crew membership
will sustain, support and encourage future visits to the museum. Participants'
change in science knowledge and attitudes, performance in science subjects,
career planning and support system to pursue interest in science will be
monitored as part of the project evaluation. The evaluation design could serve
as a model for studying informal science learning in a museum setting.
