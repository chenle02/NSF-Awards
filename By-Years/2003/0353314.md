The proposed research focuses on three central topics related to the
inflationary universe. First, the PI will focus on the large scale structure of
the eternally inflating universe and consider models where the dark energy is a
stochastic parameter which varies from one place to another. The observational
consequences of such models will be investigated and compared to data. Secondly
the PI will continue a systematic investigation of the formation, evolution and
observational signatures of various topological defects including those
postulated in "braneworld" scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;Thirdly the PI will investigate
the consequences of the new cosmological paradigm connected with eternal
inflation and publish a popular book on the subject. &lt;br/&gt;
