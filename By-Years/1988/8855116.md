Twenty-one high school students will learn computer interfacing and then design
research projects using this technology in the following areas: astronomy,
meteorology, geology, biology, modern physics, vision &amp; sound,
communications, and assistance to the physically disabled. The program will
start with a residential, five week summer program at Erskine College and the
students will continue working on the project at their high schools with their
peers during the following academic year and a visit by the directors will be
scheduled to encourage them in their scientific pursuits.
