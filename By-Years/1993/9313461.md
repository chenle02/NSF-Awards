9313461 Wylie Materials research, in the context of Civil Engineering
applications, is an essential subset of any modern, successful engineering
program. The basic public works infrastructure in the United States is in need
of massive upgrading. An important ingredient in the ultimate improvement of
these facilities nationwide is the development, introduction, and implementation
of new materials into the design and construction industry. The program at the
University of Michigan is attempting to play a major role in this process. This
award will make it possible for this institution to more efficiently utilize
their current (4000 square feet) laboratory space in materials research through
renovation of the facilities. Through massively reorganizing and upgrading these
facilities, the materials research and graduate training will be made more
effective. The facilities renovations will focus on the functions of processing,
mechanical testing, and microstructural analysis in separate areas. This will
enable researchers to operate independently and be productive in different
functional activities, something that is impossible in the current laboratory
environment. ***
