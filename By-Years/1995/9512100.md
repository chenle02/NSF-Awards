9512100 Chu Nonperturbative theoretical and computational methods will be
developed and applied to the dynamics of atoms in external electric and magnetic
fields. The systems studied are nonseparable and provide interesting examples of
the manifestation of regular and chaotic behavior in atomic and molecular
physics. ***
