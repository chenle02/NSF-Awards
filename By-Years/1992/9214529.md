This Award will renovate the space of a materials processing laboratory to meet
with standards of an Advanced Electronic Packaging Facility for the fabrication
and characterization of electronic and optoelectronic packages and materials.
Electronic packaging is considered to be a critical area where a significant
increase in research and research training output is needed to maintain the
strength of the U.S. in the 1900's and beyond. The proposed facility will be an
integral part of the Industry-Cornell University Alliance for Electronic
Packaging, a unique alliance between Cornell University and a diverse set of
companies including IBM, Digital Equipment, Carbonundum, and AMP. Its mission is
to perform both basic and pre-competitive direct research to achieve world-wide
leadership in electronic packaging. Electronic packaging research at Cornell is
also supported by the Semiconductor Research Corporation which is a consortium
of U.S. companies organized to sponsor research in the universities to enhance
the competitiveness of the U.S. The research activities supported by the
Alliance and the SRC are currently growing in five key areas: architecture and
design, interconnects, materials and thin films, optoelectronics, and thermal
management.
