This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative
in support of the collaborative research of Professors Callstrom and McCreery at
Ohio State University. Joint funding is provided by the Divisions of Chemistry,
Materials Research, and Chemical and Thermal Systems. The thrust of the research
is the development of new synthetic routes to doped glassy carbon materials and
an investigation of their properties. These engineered materials are likely to
find use as catalytic electrodes. Doped glassy carbon materials will be prepared
at low temperatures by thermal decomposition of poly(aryl- diacetylenes) that
are amenable to orientation in order to control the structure of the resultant
carbon materials. Transition metals with catalytic activity towards
hydrogenation, dioxygen reduction and methanol oxidation will be covalently
bound to the diacetylene polymers, prior to decomposition to specifically
control their concentration and activity in the glassy carbon materials.
