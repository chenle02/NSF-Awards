Pressing national concerns with global change and the mitigation of natural
hazards are leading to increased importance for research on the environments of
the recent geological past. International collaboration has become essential for
the analysis of important scientific problems related to these issues. This
project will support the participation of key U.S. researchers, including new-
career scholars, at the XIII Congress of the International Union for Quaternary
Research (INQUA) in Beijing, China, August 2-9, 1991. Due to its strong
multidisciplinary tradition, INQUA has direct relevance to seven programs within
NSF. The scientific contacts achieved at this meeting and the related scientific
field excursions will be invaluable for enhancing understanding of the dynamic
earth system at a critical point, when upon that understanding will depend the
habitability of the planet. This project will provide the necessary support for
32 U.S. Quaternary scientists to participate in this very significant
international meeting.
