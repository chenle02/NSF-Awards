There has recently been rapid development in computational mathematics due to
the demands from science and engineering. Many new methods and algorithms for
approximating solutions of partial differential equations have been proposed and
analyzed. Compared to traditional methods such as finite element, finite
difference, and finite volume methods, these newly developed methods are still
in their infancy, especially with respect to post-processing techniques.
Encouraged by the success of a special post-processing technique called
Polynomial Preserving Recovery (PPR has been adopted by the commercial software
COMSOL Multiphysics since 2008) designed by the PI and his students for finite
element methods, this project is intended to develop post-processing techniques
for some other newly developed numerical methods. The proposed project will not
only design algorithms, but also establish a mathematical foundation for post-
processing techniques under a unified framework. The proposed research has
direct application to other scientific disciplines such as classical mechanics,
molecular dynamics, hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, plasma physics, relativity,
and astronomy. The success of the project will impact science and engineering
practice as well as theoretical mathematical development. The goal of this
project is to develop some robust and high accuracy post-processing algorithms
and related mathematical theory for some newly developed numerical methods such
as Weak Galerkin methods, Virtual Element methods, Hybridizable Discontinuous
Galerkin methods, etc. Research efforts will be devoted to developing problem
and method independent gradient recovery techniques for the aforementioned
numerical methods. The implementation and theory of the Polynomial Preserving
Recovery (PPR) for continuous finite element methods will be utilized and
further developed and combined with recently developed algorithms and theory for
the aforementioned numerical methods.
