Real-time analysis of large-scale data sets is becoming increasingly important
in a variety of relativity new fields, including computational oceanography,
geotechnics (earthquake engineering), metal forming (car and aerospace
industry), elasticity (analysis of plates and beams), casting, aeroelasticity,
impact analysis (crash simulation), and biomedical engineering (protheses and
artificial teeth). This project will develop techniques and prototype software
systems for the representation and visualization of two-and three-dimensional,
time-varying scientific data sets (including scalar, vector, and tensor fields)
resulting from computational field simulations or physical measurements. The
research issues being addressed are data reduction, multiresolution methods,
spline representations, and visualization techniques or multiresolution
representations based on triangular and tetrahedral grids. This research will
impact the design of next-generation scientific visualization systems supporting
real-time rendering of large-scale time varying data sets represented on
triangulated domains
