9413420 Hemmendinger Acquisition of Equipment for Research on High-Level Design
of Concurrent Systems. The grant will support research in four areas of system
design: a) high- level synthesis of digital systems, b) hardware-software
codesign, c) combining formal verification with high-level synthesis tools, and
d) analysis and design of fault-tolerant network protocols. The equipment to be
acquired with the grant includes a lab of high performance workstations, a two-
cpu file server, and digital design and test equipment to facilitate rapid
prototyping: a FPGA programmer, data-generator and logic analyzers. The software
tools for the lab include a VHDL language simulator and synthesis tool, together
with experimental tools that are based on VHDL, but give the designer the
ability to write specifications directly in the familiar terms of finite-state
automata, for rapid exploration of design alternatives. The research in this
area will include the refinement of these tools for hardware/software codesign
and the development of better metrics of the cost of hardware and software
design solutions. ***
