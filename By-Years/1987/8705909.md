The electron is an elementary particle that may be isolated, brought to rest in
free space, and studied with extreme precision. It is proposed to re-measure the
fundamental properties of the electron and its antiparticle, the positron, to
the highest accuracy. To this end, the stationary "geonium" atom is synthesized
from an individual electron, the homogeneous field of a superconducting magnet,
and a weak electric quadrupole field. On this atom, the spin, cyclotron, axial
and magnetron frequencies are measured. Such measurements constitute significant
tests of QED and the CPT theorem. Hadronic admixtures will become observable.
The geonium spectra yield the most precise (QED) value for the fine structure
constant, alpha, to date and may soon give a non-QED value for alpha.
