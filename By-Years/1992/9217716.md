Multiwavelength surveys of galaxies are of great importance for investigations
of structure and stellar content. The research to be carried out will be a new,
extensive survey of spiral galaxies using wide-field infrared and optical
imaging systems developed at The Ohio State University. Infrared observations
are key to this survey because infrared light is a better tracer of the stellar
mass distribution than optical light and the effects of internal absorption by
dust are minimized. Photometry and infrared long-slit spectroscopy will be used
to study the dependence of stellar content on position, including the
identification of regions of active star formation. The effects of scattering
and absorption by dust on the observed luminosity and color of a galaxy will be
investigated.
