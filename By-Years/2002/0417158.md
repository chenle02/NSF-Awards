Prof. Douglas Tobias of the University of California, Irvine, is supported by
both the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within the Division of
Chemistry and the Molecular Biophysics program within the Division of Molecular
and Cellular Biosciences for research which employs atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate the interplay of the dynamics of proteins, lipids and
water in biological membranes. The research involves three projects: (1)
continuation and extension of his prior work on MD simulations of solvent
effects on membrane proteins and comparison to neutron scattering data; (2)
modeling of raft microdomains in lipid bilayers; and (3) molecular dynamics
simulations of fluorescence experiments on lipid bilayers with proteins. This
work will have a broad impact on the fields of biophysics and physical chemistry
of lipid bilayers.
