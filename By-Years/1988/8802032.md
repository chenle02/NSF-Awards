Dr. Janice Bahr plans to study the regulation of ovulation using the hen as a
model system. The domestic hen has a unique egg laying pattern, in that it lays
an egg at a later time on sequential days until the last egg is laid late in the
afternoon. The hen then skips a day and resets the biological clock so that the
first egg of the next sequence of eggs is laid early in the morning. The
objective of this continuing research effort is to understand the interplay
between the endocrine system, the brain (biological clock) and the reproductive
system that gives rise to this unique pattern. The focus of the work is on
factors controlling the action of the ovulation inducing hormone, LH, (produced
by the pituitary) on the regulation of progesterone production in the granulosa
cells in the wall of the follicle. Progesterone surges trigger ovulation from
the follicle; therefore, the regulation of progesterone synthesis from estrogens
and androgens in these cells is critical in the regulation of ovulation. LH
production by the pituitary is regulated by both blood levels of progesterone
and estrogen and by releasing factors that are under the control of the
hypothalamus (brain). The results are of prime importance to our understanding
of the control of ovulation in vertebrate species.
