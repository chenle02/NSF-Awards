Abstract

IIS - 0849499 SGER: Music Similarity Retrieval Using Power-Law Metrics Manaris
Bill Z. College of Charleston

The project is developing a music search engine based on identifying aesthetic
similarities. This engine is utilizing power-law metrics to extract statistical
proportions of music-theoretic and other attributes of music pieces (e.g.,
Pitch, Duration, Pitch Distance, Duration Distance, Melodic Intervals, Harmonic
Intervals, Melodic Bigrams, etc.). The engine searches for pieces that are
aesthetically similar to the input piece using a mean squared error (MSE)
approach. Preliminary testing has been done using the Classical Music Archives
corpus (14,695 MIDI pieces), combined with 500+ MIDI pieces from other styles
(e.g. Jazz, Rock, Country, etc.). A first year effort has demonstrated
functionality for additional file formats, including MP3, the predominant format
used in web-based music corpora. Assessment and validation experiments will be
continued to compare to computational findings indicating aesthetic similarity
of retrieved pieces. This research is potentially transformative to the internet
music economy and functionality.
