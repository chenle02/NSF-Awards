This project is focused on the mathematical prediction of mechanical behavior in
highly deformable elastic structures and solids, including both soft elastic
systems and brittle materials. Soft structures occur naturally in biological
systems such as skin and bio-membranes and are also manufactured as thin films
and elastomers. The prediction of their initial instability, such as wrinkling,
and post-critical pattern formation under loading and/or growth play a prominent
role in this part of the project. For brittle solids (such as ceramics or steels
at low temperature), we will use a new approach to fracture, predicting the
initiation and formation of cracks under incremental loading. Overall, the
project aims to provide new classes of continuum-mechanical models and novel
approaches to their analyses, leading to a quantitative understanding of the
mechanical behavior of these systems. The work has a range of potential
applications ? from bio-molecular structures to engineering machines and
structures. This project includes opportunities for the research training of
graduate students. Classes of nonlinear models of elastic-surface structures,
soft elastic solids, and brittle solids will be analyzed. The main goals of the
work are: (i) To provide properly formulated mechanics-based models. (ii) To
obtain rigorous mathematical results, viz., establish existence theorems ? the
only true way to ?ensure that the mathematical description of a physical
phenomenon is meaningful? (R. Courant). (iii) To detect new phenomena. Goals (i)
and (ii) inform and enrich each other; goal (iii) is enabled by goals (i) and
(ii). This research is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and
perspectives from several fields, e.g., nonlinear continuum mechanics, elliptic
PDE systems, bifurcation theory, calculus of variations, numerical methods,
symmetry ideas and biophysics, while providing new links between them. The
project will provide new results and insights pertaining to surface-creasing
formation in soft elastic solids, fracture of brittle materials, post-critical
growth in elastic solids and pattern formation in lipid-bilayer structures or
bio-membranes.
