The ubiquitousness of massive data sets presents great challenges. The
difficulty of dealing with massive data sets is especially formidable when
attempting to solve computational problems in which both the inputs and the
outputs to the computation are large. In such a situation, it would be useful if
one could find faster ways of computing just the portion of the output that is
required by the user.

This project aims to study "local computation algorithms", namely algorithms
that quickly compute only the portions of the output that are required by the
user, without performing the full computation. In particular, local computation
algorithms view only a miniscule portion of the input. The PI considers a broad
based approach, studying the application of local computation algorithms to a
range of problems and settings within algorithm design. The focus of this
research is on the question of when local computations can be done in time that
is sub-linear in the size of the input and output. The proposed research will
develop techniques for constructing such algorithms and for understanding when
such algorithms are not possible.

The project will leverage known results from sub-linear time algorithms, which
for the most part have focused on the somewhat different setting of
computational problems in which the inputs are large but the outputs are small.
In addition, the project will investigate well-studied classes of algorithmic
techniques and focus on modifying them for use in this new setting. Such classes
include algorithmic techniques first developed for parallel and distributed
algorithms, as well as the extensively used greedy method. Problems from
combinatorial optimization, graph theory and compressibility of strings will be
studied.
