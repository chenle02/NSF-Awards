The focus of this research is the use of alpha-amino carbanions for the
formation of carbon-carbon bonds. The methodology allows the preparation of a
myriad of both chiral and non-chiral compounds . The synthesis of chiral
benzazepines, biaryl azepines, the use of the copper assisted alkylation of
formamidines and the discovery of a new and powerful base system called `Amazing
Base` are among the highlights of the work. With this renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Albert I. Meyers of
the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. Professor Meyers will
focus his work on developing new methods for the formation of carbon-carbon
bonds. The methodology is based on the preparation of carbanions adjacent to
nitrogen in a variety of systems and the molecules to be prepared represent
types that are of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry.
