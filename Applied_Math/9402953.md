9300805 Lund/Bowers The Fourth Conference on Computation and Control will be
organized with the assistance provided by this grant. In recent years
considerable effort has been devoted to developing and enhancing rigorous
numerical and analytical methodologies for control design and analysis. Although
computational problems in control are extremely complex, these problems often
have special structure that can be exploited to obtain both theoretical and
computational results. Moreover, problems that arise from applications are best
addressed by interdisciplinary approaches where experts in various disciplines
(numerical analysis, control theory, fluid dynamics) come together in an open
exchange of dialogue on recent research and current open problems. This type of
communication provides an important forum in which researchers become aware of
new mathematical tools from other areas and in which new research problems are
spawned in the individual disciplines. This conference will bring together
leading experts from the areas of systems theory and control, numerical methods,
and a variety of other application areas to discuss recent developments in
interdisciplinary approaches to computational control. In addition to standard
presentations, many participants will demonstrate and share recently developed
software packages. The main objectives of this conference are to provide
exposure to recent research as well as currents trends in computational control,
afford young postdoctoral researchers and more established investigators an
informal arena in which to discuss problems, and to encourage graduate students
toward a career in research in interdisciplinary applied mathematics. Most of
the funds provided by this grant will be used to support young researchers and
graduate students. ***
