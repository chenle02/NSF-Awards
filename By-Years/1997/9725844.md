9725844 Halgedahl The P.I. proposes experiments that would establish the links
among LEM domain states, remanence, and remanent stability in paleomagnetically
significant minerals such as magnetite, titanomagnetite, and hematite. The field
of rock magnetism has entered an invigorating era in which magnetic domain
experiments and theories are converging in key areas. An elegant example of this
convergence is the existence of local energy minimum, or LEM, domain states. LEM
domain states immediately suggest a new mechanism for remanence acquisition and
stability in fine magnetic particles, such as those carrying the paleomagnetic
record in rocks. By this mechanism, remanence would not just be controlled by
the pinning of magnetic domain walls at defects, but also by the physical
evolution of final LEM states. Likewise, magnetic stability would depend largely
on the energies required for transitions to other LEMs. The proposed work will
address the linages among these effects. ***
