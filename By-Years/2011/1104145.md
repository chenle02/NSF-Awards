The Boston Area Technological Education Connections (BATEC) is a well developed
regionally coordinated system of high schools, community colleges, the
University of Massachusetts at Boston and industry. Talented students from
diverse backgrounds are attracted to information technology (IT) careers
particularly in - programming, databases, analytics, and business intelligence.
BATEC developed a sequence of industry driven and validated IT courses that
articulate from high school through community college to a Bachelor of Science
in Information Technology. The National Center extends and strengthens computing
discipline pathways and industry connections to produce 21st century IT
professionals. The work that the Regional Center is doing in defining the
knowledge, skills and attitudes that IT technicians need to be technically and
professionally successful in their employment is continued. Because IT is
pervasive in every industry, this goal is extended to learn about and implement
innovations that increase technicians' ability to work at the intersection of IT
and other fields - such as manufacturing, energy management, law enforcement,
and health. The National Center uses partnerships with urban districts in Las
Vegas, San Francisco, and Chicago as learning laboratories to learn how to scale
up the work done in Boston. The Center focuses on longer-term interventions that
are collaborative with existing centers and new partners and conducts research
that contributes to the continuous improvement of IT, CS and IS programs to keep
up with regional and national needs.
