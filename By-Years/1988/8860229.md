The project aims at the development of an integrated mathematical model capable
to predict flooding in low-lying coastal areas due to high winds and pressure
gradients on the surface of large bodies of water. The integrated model will
combine existing hurricane and hydrothermal models and an interface model will
be developed to couple the two types of models. The resulting integrated model
will be solved using numerical techniques and the output will help in
determining the potential and location of floods in case of hurricanes, high
speed rotating winds, and pressure changes over large bodies of water.
