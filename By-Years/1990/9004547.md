The mass extinction at the end of the Permian has been established as the
greatest perturbation which the Earth's biosphere has experienced since the
origin of metazoan life. Although relatively little is known about the cause of
this mass extinction, even less is known on biotic conditions in its aftermath
or the nature of biotic recovery from this event. Fossil faunas and limestones
in the Lower Triassic Virgin Member of the Moenkopi Formation (southern Nevada
and southwestern Utah), deposited 5 my after the end of the Permian, present an
opportunity to learn how benthic faunas in shallow marine carbonate environments
were faring in this recovery interval. Preliminary study of the Virgin
limestones indicates deposition in a normal marine environment with benthic
macroinvertebrate assemblages of relatively low species richness. Of potentially
great significance are intervals of apparent normal marine stromatolites, which
may represent temporary expansion from marginal marine refugia into normal
marine settings due to restriction of grazers, caused by the mass extinction.
Evidence for the beginning of recovery is demonstrated through the presence of
abundant specimens of the earliest articulate crinoid, which had evolved from
some unknown Paleozoic inadunate that survived the crisis. Research will
illuminate the way in which biotas recover from mass extinctions.
