Sheet metal forming is one of the most fundamental manufacturing technologies
used in the production of numerous goods including hundreds of automotive
components, consumer appliances, and beverage cans. The occurrence of wrinkling
on a part could be either acceptable or unacceptable based on the product
specifications. The ability of predicting such behavior is essential for
shortening the development cycle and reducing manufacturing cost. This research
project will numerically and experimentally address the onset, post-buckling and
secondary buckling behavior of thin sheets buckled into a wide range of
wavelengths under in-plane compression with or without normal constraints. This
research project may reduce the computation time of Finite Element Analysis by
about eighty percent while accurately predicting the onset of wrinkling. The
success of this project will be extremely beneficial to product and process
development at early design stage. This is a collaborative research project
between the University and an industrial partner.
