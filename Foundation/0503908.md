The investigator plans to concentrate his efforts on large sample theory
problems connected with self-normalized sums and functionals of the empirical
distribution. His interest in self-normalized sums arose largely out of the
question: When is the Student-t statistic asymptotically normal? Among his goals
in this area, he hopes to complete the theory of the asymptotic distribution of
self-normalized sums. The particular functionals of the empirical distribution
that he plans to investigate include statistics and estimators based on distance
measures such as the empirical Hellinger distance and a class of integral
functionals of density estimators, which are used to estimate entropy and the
integral of the squared density and its derivative. This will likely lead to the
development of a theory of local U-statistics processes. This theory would be
analogous to the local empirical process theory that he has worked out with a
number of his long-term collaborators to study the large sample properties of
kernel-type function estimators. These include kernel-type estimators of the
density function, the regression function and the conditional distribution
function. Local empirical process theory has shown itself to be a very powerful
tool to determine exact rates of point-wise and uniform consistency of kernel-
type nonparametric function estimators. A local U-statistics process theory
should be at least as applicable. The research problems outlined in this
proposal should lead to the creation of a number of new and useful methods to
treat large sample theory problems.

The investigator works in the borderline area between probability theory and
mathematical statistics. He is delighted when he uncovers unexpected
probabilistic phenomena that occasionally appear on this frontier. The problems
that he is interested in are frequently motivated by questions about the limit
behavior of statistical tests and estimators. They arise whenever one wants to
make a decision on the basis of limited knowledge. This is especially the case
when it is not feasible to sample an entire population to settle a question
about that population. Some typical examples are when a medical investigator is
interested in deciding whether or not a proposed new drug or medical treatment
is effective or a fisheries scientist wants to estimate the number of salmon
that will return this season to spawn.
