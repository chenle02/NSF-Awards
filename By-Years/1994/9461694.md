This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes an innovative
solution to the design of a power electric drive system capable of operating in
all four quadrants with maximum efficiency. The controller is insensitive to
system parameter changes and is stable. The system operates synergistically in
that each of the major subsystems (motor, inner inverter control loop, outer
speed control loop) is chosen or designed in such a way that maximum efficiency
is a constant goal. The proposed solution is a unique combination of a PMBDC
high efficient motor, an innovative voltage inverter design, and a self-
organizing fuzzy neurocontroller, each of which acts to maximize some aspect of
the controller operation while compensating for the disadvantages of the rest of
the system. The controller described here would be very suitable for use in
electric or hybrid vehicles. The main technical advance is extending the speed
range of a PMBDC using a unique inverter design and controlling the speed with
an unusual self-organizing fuzzy controller.
