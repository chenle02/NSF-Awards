The objective of this research is to demonstrate a new coupling technique to
excite propagating surface plasmons on an unstructured metallic surface by
illuminating it with structured light beams. The experimental approach is to
focus light from a Titanium Sapphire laser with a cylindrical lens into a narrow
diffraction limited stripe on a gold film and to image the surface plasmons by
advanced near field scanning optical microscopy techniques. The theoretical
approach is to use techniques such as Finite Difference Time Domain simulations
for visualizing the propagating surface plasmons.

The intellectual merit of this proposal is that if the proposed effect is
demonstrated it will have a major impact on plasmonics. The imaging of two
plane-like plasmon waves at an angle would confirm the striking resemblance
between this phenomenon and Cherenkov radiation. It will lead to fundamental new
understanding on the coupling of light to metallic surfaces and would introduce
a completely new approach to excite them, without needing couplers such as
gratings or prisms.

The broader impacts of this research stem from its technological, societal and
educational importance. It is important because observation of this effect could
lead to new optical interconnects on a chip by introducing a simpler and
easier/cheaper method. This discovery will thus positively influence on-chip
optical communications, leading to significant societal impacts. The findings
coming out of this project, by contributing to new basic understanding of
surface plasmons and their applications, will definitely also influence the
teaching of nanophotonics, including textbooks.
