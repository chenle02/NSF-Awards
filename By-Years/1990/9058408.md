This is a PYI application from a new Assistant Professor of Electrical
Engineering. Dr. Hannaford received his Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley in 1985, and was
employed by the JPL at Cal Tech until 1989. He has numerous publications in the
area of human motor control. His plan is to continue his research to better
understand how humans control their limbs, but he will be increasingly involved
in robotics research as well. His plan is to use the understanding of the
natural motor system to design robotic manipulators.
