"Operation and Management of the National Center for Atmospheric Research" Since
its establishment 27 years ago in Boulder, Colorado, the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has been an integral part of the atmospheric
sciences research community. Operated and managed by the University Corporation
for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), NCAR provides observational and computational
facilities, including aircraft, radars, and supercomputers, primarily for
academic and NCAR researchers. NCAR also conducts research, in collaboration
with university scientists, in climate and global dynamics, atmospheric
chemistry, mesoscale and microscale meteorology, and solar and solar-terrestrial
physics, and oceanography. This award is for the next 5 years (FY 88-92) of NCAR
operation. During that time, there will be four main research thrusts: climate
and the coupling of climate with other earth environmental systems; atmospheric
chemistry, including participation in the Global Tropospheric Chemistry Program;
mesoscale meteorology; and solar and solar- terrestrial physics. Plans for the
facility support program include acquisition of facilities needed by the
research community such as a medium jet aircraft and a next generation
supercomputer. These plans are consistent with the vigorous program of research
and facilities enhancement envisioned by the NSF Long-Range Plan.
