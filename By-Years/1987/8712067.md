Professors Burt and Willmott will generate global precipitation and temperature
fields on the basis of some 30,000 weather stations throughout the world. They
will also devise a new method for estimating evaporation, water transpiration by
vegetation, and soil moisture. The resulting data will be compared with existing
low-resolution climate data and with predicted values derived from models of the
general circulation of the atmosphere. Error analysis will be conducted to make
it possible to assign reliability measures to grid point estimates of values of
interest. The work conducted with this award will produce values for monthly
soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and surface air temperature
for land surfaces on a 0.5 by 0.5 degree latitude and longitude grid. Such high-
resolution data are needed for verification of general circulation models. They
are also an important step toward developing the kinds of macro-scale geographic
information system databases needed for global environmental and ecological
analysis.
