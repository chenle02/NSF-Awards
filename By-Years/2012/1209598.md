This action funds Kathryn Riley of Wake Forest University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Simplifying detection of microbes using nanoparticles,"
during the summer of 2012 at Saitama University in Sakura-ku, Saitama, Japan.
The host scientist is Dr. Shingo Saito.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of analytical
methods using gold nana-particules to simplify the detection of microbes. The
nano-particles interact with and differentiate between different microbial
species and are then separated using electrically-driven separation methods.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
