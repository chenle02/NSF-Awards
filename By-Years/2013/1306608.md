This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. Evelyn C. Rynkiewicz is
supported by both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of
International Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During
the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Rynkiewicz will work on a project titled, "Using
parasite removal to elucidate mechanisms driving immune phenotype variation and
co-infection patterns in wild rodents" under the sponsorship of Dr. Amy B.
Pedersen at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, UK.

With the emergence of new, virulent diseases that often originate in non-human
animals, and the continued invasion of parasites and pathogens to new areas, it
is important to study how variation in host-parasite interactions influence host
health and disease spread. This project will investigate the interactions
between co-infecting parasites and multiple aspects of the host immune system to
determine what effects these interactions have on individual health and parasite
community assembly. The host-immune system will be tested using multiple
parasite removal treatments, where two important parasite groups will be removed
from individual mice in a wild wood mouse population. The proposed research will
address the following questions: 1) How is the host immune system influenced by
co-infection? and 2) How does order of infection influence parasite co-infection
patterns and the immune system?

Testing rigorously how diverse host-parasite interactions influence individual
risk of infection and transmission in natural settings will provide better
prediction and management of outbreaks of emerging zoonotic diseases. The
methods developed in this project will be directly applicable to parasite
management in other common wildlife populations or in rare or invasive species
of conservation interest. In addition to benefits derived from the research, Dr.
Rynkiewicz will also mentor undergraduate and graduate students in this
research.

This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with
foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions available abroad.
