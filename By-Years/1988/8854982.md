The goal of this project is to broaden the exposure of high ability and high
potential secondary school students to research in the biological sciences.
Twelve students about to enter grade twelve will be recruited from 37 secondary
schools in the Western New York area. Each student will be provided an eight
week, summer "hands on" research experience in the laboratories of one of six
established investigators working in the areas of: bone cell physiology,
bacterial molecular genetics, structure/function relationships of
macromolecules, cellular and humoral immunology, bacterialphysiology,
immunochemistry of proteins. A seminar series will also be arranged for the
students to present their work to their peers and mentors. Interaction with
undergraduate collegestudents engaged in summer research programs at the same
site will also be available. Career awareness seminars and interactions with
researchers active in the welfare of laboratory animals and human research
subjects will also becomponents of the program. An academic follow-up will
evolve around mentors visiting the participants' high school the following
school year and students' presentation of research at a scientific meeting.
