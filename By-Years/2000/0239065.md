This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the
technology to produce faster growing oysters that yield bigger and higher
quality pearls than those currently available. Prior Phase I work has already
shown the production of the first-ever verifiable transgenic pearl oysters, and
the successful isolation of the first nacre gene from Pinctada margaritifera.
The proposed work in this Phase II project will demonstrate commercial viability
by isolating other potentially-important genes from Pinctada, refining proven
transfection methods, and evaluating nacre quality and deposition rates in
transgenic phenotypes. Biosecure land-based grow-out of transgenic oysters, as
mantle-tissue donors only, will increase application efficiency and overcome
environmental concerns.

The commercial application of this project will be in the black pearl market
that is estimated to be of the order of $ 5 billion worldwide. A U.S.-led
expansion of this lucrative industry could provide economic benefits to Hawaii
and to U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, increasing investment, employment
opportunities and self-sufficiency in these remote islands, and reducing the
economic burden on the U.S. Government.
