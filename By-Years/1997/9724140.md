Most of our insight into the energetics of terrestrial locomotion is derived
from studies of metabolic expenditure of animals running under steady-state
(constant speed, long duration) conditions. Non-sustainable locomotion of high
intensity but short duration, of the type seen during prey capture, territorial
defense, or predation avoidance represents behavior at least as important as
long duration sustained locomotion, and is a type of activity with different
metabolic underpinnings. This research will examine the energetics of this type
of activity. The PI will investigate four aspects of non-sustainable locomotion:
1) the effects of duration, 2) the effects of different locomotor intensities,
3) the differential responses of an endotherm vs. an ectotherm to brief
exercise, and 4) the role of hormones in defining this locomotor cost. The study
addresses a realm of animal activity for which we have no predictive database.
The preliminary data suggest that the net cost of non-sustainable locomotion may
be an order of magnitude more expensive than when animals cover the same
distance at aerobically sustainable speeds. If supported by the proposed
research, this finding will raise fundamental questions about the consequences
of some types of animal behavior, and open a new chapter in the study of animal
locomotion.
