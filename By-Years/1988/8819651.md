Picosecond time resolved photoluminescence experiments may be used to probe
GaAs/Si interface quality and to study the effects of the built- in strain in
GaAs and related structures on various material properties and carrier and
phonon dynamic processes which are crucial to the operation of high speed
devices. So far, no relevant picosecond studies have been reported. The PI
proposes a research plan to investigate the quality of GaAs and carrier dynamics
in GaAs quantum well structures grown on Si by time resolved photoluminescence
measurements.
