With this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Bo Zhang of University of Washington is developing
a new analytical microscopy method; namely fluorescence-enabled electrochemical
microscopy (FEEM), for imaging transient dynamic redox processes with large
electrochemical arrays. A fundamental underlying concept of this research is the
conversion of an electrical signal to fluorescence so that optical microscopy
can be used to monitor a redox species such as dopamine. This project will
develop FEEM as a tool for understanding molecular transport, neuronal activity,
and neuron-neuron communication in the brain. The broader impacts are addressed
through the recruitment of women and members of underrepresented groups to
participate in this science. The project provides interdisciplinary student
training in the areas of electrochemistry, sensor design and development,
microscopy, and nanofabrication and
characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrochemical imaging is vital for
numerous applications such as fundamental understanding of the
electrode/solution interface, catalyst screening, and neuronal secretion.
Previous methods have limited temporal resolution and are difficult to study
stochastic redox events. This project will address these challenges by
developing and utilizing very large electrochemical arrays of microelectrodes in
FEEM systems. Indeed, in the ideal, this FEEM approach should enable the
simultaneous reading of millions of microelectrodes to image transient parallel
redox events. As such, this project aims to establish FEEM as a useful
analytical tool that could be adopted by other scientists in a range of
disciplines including neurochemistry, environmental analysis, and
electrocatalyst screening.
