A large polyaxial loading system is being procured, which will be employed to
apply triaxial compression to large (l2 x l2 x l2 in) specimens of rock. The
equipment to be procured includes flatjacks, hydraulic assemblies, a hydraulic
pump, and a data acquisition system. The equipment will initially be utilized to
investigate: the spall failures induced in deep bore holes by field stresses and
thermal stresses; the shear conductivity for dilatant rock joints; acoustic
emission monitoring of fluid injection into various types of rock; failure
theories of coal which will include three dimensional stress effects; and
inelastic effects and residual strain in stress measurements of rock masses.
