Biological Science (61). This CCLI Adaptation and Implementation project
supports biological literacy through the infusion of problem- and case-based
lessons in a non-majors biology course. The project adapts curriculum materials
from SENCER, BioQuest and Workshop Biology, utilizing Problem-Based Learning
(PBL) and inquiry-based laboratories to teach the core concepts of biology from
the perspective of civically engaging issues or problems. Introducing problems
of timely importance and local interest provides a context and reason for
learning. Using a constructivist approach, students participate in semi-weekly
assemblies, and are challenged to propose solutions to science-related societal
problems. Related inquiry-based laboratories are designed to engage students in
the process of scientific discovery within the context of real-world problems.
The project also provides training for teaching assistants and for other faculty
members at the institution, so that the reform effort may be applied to other
courses. Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) is used to examine
students' pre- and post-course views about various aspects of science-
technology-society. This project has the potential to improve scientific
literacy among students not planning to major in science.
