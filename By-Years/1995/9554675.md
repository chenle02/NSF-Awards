Digital signal processors (special-purpose fast microprocessors), made possible
through advances in integrated circuits, have added a new element to the
environment of digital signal processing (DSP). These processors have found
their way into a number of applications including communications and controls,
graphics, instrumentation, speech, and image processing. They have emerged as a
response to the ever-increasing number of real-time DSP applications. This
workshop will combine both the lecture and laboratory components of DSP, with a
special emphasis on the laboratory component, providing the participants
valuable hands-on experiences. The undergraduate faculty participants will
implement a wide range of real-time experiments and mini-projects such as a
digital oscillator, finite and infinite impulse response filters, adaptive
filters, and the fast Fourier transform. Available tools and techniques will be
provided to the faculty participants who will quickly realize how software and
hardware experiences can be used to motivate their senior students. They would
then be able to integrate these software and hardware experiences into senior-
level courses at their home institutions.
