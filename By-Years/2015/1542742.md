This project supports the 2015 Rustbelt RNA Meeting , which will be held in
Huron/Sandusky, OH on October 23-24, 2015. A combination of posters and oral
presentations will promote sharing of new research and techniques that will aid
the study of RNA, one of the main forms of genetic material that encodes
information about all living organisms. The meeting will provide an
interdisciplinary experience by bringing together researchers investigating
biological and chemical aspects of RNA structure and function. A highlight of
the meeting will be the opportunity for early-career scientists to network with
current leaders in the RNA field; such interactions often serve as the
foundation for future collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rustbelt RNA
Meeting will feature a keynote address by a leader in the field, posters, and
oral presentations. Presentations will cover topics including long non-coding
RNAs, tRNA modification, and RNA structure-function studies and will include
discussion of various computational, biophysical, and cellular methods being
used to study RNA. This conference is notable for its focus on inclusion of
students and post-doctoral scholars, as approximately 90% of the research
presented will come from these groups of early-career scientists.
