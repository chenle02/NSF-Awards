Computational systems biology is a groundbreaking research area that seeks to
use tools from engineering systems theory to understand the holistic functioning
of a complex biological system. Translation of such knowledge into medicine is
revolutionizing and will continue to revolutionize disease diagnosis and
prognosis, medical therapy, disease prevention, drug discovery, and drug design.
The objective of this project is to seek student travel support from NSF for the
IEEE Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics, or GENSIPS, a
workshop sponsored annually by the IEEE Signal Processing
Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;Our goals for
GENSIPS13 are: 1) to address the systems biology issues in the emerging "omics"
fields of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, especially the
next-generation sequencing technologies (which facilitate parallel and much
faster sequencing of DNA or RNA); and 2) to significantly increase the
participation from the Signal Processing society, and the computer science,
biostatistics, and biological science communities. The theme of GENSIPS13 will
be next generation sequencing and systems biology applied to cancer. We will be
inviting expert plenary speakers from the cancer research and genome research
fields. To broaden the reach of the scientific work presented in the meeting,
accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Conference Proceedings and
selected ones in special issues in high profile journals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;Another important mission of
GENSIPS13 is to promote the participation of graduate students and post-doctoral
researchers, especially women and minority students, and foster student
education on systems biology. GENSIPS13 will provide travel awards to qualified
graduate students, whose papers are deemed to be of high quality. Specifically,
20-30% of the awards will be allocated to encourage women and minority students
to participate and submit papers to GENSIPS13.
