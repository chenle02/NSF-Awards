This work will use the Nitrite reductase enzyme (NiR) as an indicator of in
situ denitrification. The hypothesis that induction of NiR is related to
initiation of denitrification in low oxygen regimes will be investigated in
continuous culture experiments. This work will develop a set of tools for
measurement of species specific growth rates and investigation of the in situ
distribution of: 1) denitrifying bacteria, 2) NiR among cells of known
denitrifying strains and among the total bacterial population, and 3) the
genetic potential for denitrification. Assays for enumeration of denitrifiers,
for NiR in bulk samples and inside whole cells, probes for the NiR gene and
specific probes for denitrifier ribosomal RNA and ribosomal RNA genes are
described. Denitrification is a process in which simple inorganic compounds of
nitrogen dissolved in water are converted to dinitrogen gas such as makes up
most of our atmosphere. This process is carried out by bacteria and is
ubiquitous in both soil and water environments. One important consequence of
Denitrication in the water column accounts for about half the annual loss of
fixed nitrogen from the marine environment. Little is known of the taxonomic and
metabolic diversity of marine nitrifying bacteria, but by analogy to terrestrial
systems, marine denitrifiers are probably a diverse and successful group. This
study involves the application of state of the art immunological and molecular
probes to examine the physical and community distribution, as well as the
potential for the production of, a key enzyme in the denitrification pathway-
Nitrite Reductase. The objective of these advanced molecular biological
techniques is to increase our understand- ing of marine denitrification, a
problem that has been resistent to the application of more conventional
oceanographic methods.
