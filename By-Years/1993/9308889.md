9308889 MYERS Most research on urban residential mobility treats the housing
stock and the households moving through it as separate objects of analysis.
Housing research has been conducted with only slight regard to population
dynamics, and population research has under-emphasized the housing in which
people live. Both housing units and households have life cycles which are joined
together by an occupancy of some duration. This linkage between specific housing
units and specific households requires study in order to gain a better
understanding of urban residential structure. This research project will test a
theory of the role of time in urban residential structure and housing relocation
by integrating housing stock, population, and the residential mobility process
that links the two. It uses a model of cohort layering to integrate housing
construction and aging, cohorts of householders, and occupancy cohorts defined
by year moved into the unit, thus joining the histories of individual households
and housing units. This framework will be used to test for differences in
residential mobility rates observed across metropolitan areas in the United
States. Multivariate models will be estimated to explain the persistence of
occupancies from 1980 to 1990 for different types of households and dwellings
under different metropolitan conditions. Data will come from the Public Use
Microdata Sample of the U.S. Census. Age of housing is an important factor in
residential mobility of households, but it is unclear what role housing plays in
this process. This research will combine both spatial and temporal dimensions of
household residential mobility to give a clearer understanding of how households
and housing units combine in time and space to define rates of residential
mobility in urban areas. The model to be developed through this research will be
able to be implemented with readily available census data for any location in
the nation, which will make it of use to both researchers and policy planners
wishing to understand how housing age affects relocation. ***
