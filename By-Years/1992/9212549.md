Funded through an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a Rheometrics Dynamic
Analyzer and associated peripherals will be purchased for research on the
characterization of polymeric fluids and networks. The focus on the research is
on the coupling between mechanical properties and thermodynamic swelling in
materials. Such information is of importance in the design and processing of
polymeric materials.
