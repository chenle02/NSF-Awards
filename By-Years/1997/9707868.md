9707868 SOLTIS The angiosperms (flowering plants) represent the largest and most
economically-important assemblage of land plants in the world, there being over
300,000 different species. Diverse angiosperm forms appear in the fossil record
a little over 100 million years ago, and many additional species appear to have
arisen rapidly following the origin of the assemblage. However, despite
extensive effort, our understanding of relationships among angiosperm groups
remains far from complete, especially among groups that arose early during
angiosperm diversification. The research proposed by Drs. Soltis and Soltis will
help clarify phylogenetic relationships among major groupings of angiosperms,
and perhaps more importantly, help identify relationships among the most ancient
members of the assemblage. The latter will prove especially critical in
providing the basis for new interpretations of the patterns and rates of
diversification. The work will entail acquisition of DNA sequences from three
distinct genes (rbcL, 18S rDNA, and atpB) that will be used to infer
relationships among roughly 400 angiosperm species that were selected as
representatives of all major groups of angiosperm species. The work ultimately
will lead to a new classification of flowering plants that will reflect more
accurately both historical and genealogical relationships. The project also will
lead to new analytical methods for inferring family trees that involve extremely
large data sets for large groups of species.
