This NSF award provides support for a CPS Virtual Organization. The National
Science Foundation established the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program with the
vision of developing a scientific and engineering foundation for routinely
building cyber-enabled engineered systems in which cyber capability is deeply
embedded at all scales, yet which remain safe, secure, and dependable --
"systems you can bet your life on." The CPS challenge spans essentially every
engineering domain. It requires the integration of knowledge and engineering
principles across many computational and engineering research disciplines
(computing, networking, control, human interaction, learning theory, as well as
mechanical, chemical, biomedical, and other engineering disciplines) to develop
a "new CPS system science." Achieving such an ambitious goal is challenging. The
objective of the CPS "virtual organization" (CPS-VO) project is to actively
build and support the multidisciplinary community needed to underpin this new
research discipline and enable international and interagency collaboration on
CPS. In support of the CPS-VO, Vanderbilt University will work with the
community to develop strategies and mechanisms to: (i) facilitate and foster
interaction and exchange among CPS researchers across a broad range of
institutions, programs and disciplines, (ii) enable sharing of knowledge
generated by CPS research with the broader engineering and scientific
communities, sharing and integrating experimental tools, platforms and
simulators among researchers and stakeholders, (iii) facilitate and foster
collaboration and information exchange between CPS researchers and industry and
(iv) facilitate international collaboration on CPS research.
