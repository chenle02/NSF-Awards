This project incorporates global positioning systems (GPS) into the education of
mining engineers. Two Wild GPS - System 200 units and associated postprocessing
kinematic software will be purchased so that students can perform high-precision
surveying. GPS will be incorporated into three surveying courses taught by the
Mining Department at Montana Tech. The courses and equipment will also be
available to students in the departments of geological, geophysical, and
environmental engineering.
