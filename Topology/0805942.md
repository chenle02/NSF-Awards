This project concerns applications of techniques from classical 3-dimensional
topology and hyperbolic geometry to the study of polynomial link invariants and
finite type invariants of links and 3-manifolds: (a) The PI has proved results
suggesting deep connections between the volume of hyperbolic links and the
coefficients of their Jones polynomial. She would like to further investigate
these connections and establish a bridge between quantum topology and hyperbolic
geometry. (b) Investigate the connections of link polynomial invariants to a
graph theoretic polynomials (e.g. the Bollob\'as ?Riordan polynomial). She hopes
that studying link invariants within this framework, can lead to new connections
between link polynomials and Khovanov homology and geometric structures of link
complements. (c) Use the general machinery developed to understand how
3-manifolds change under surgery to explore the topological relations captured
by the finite type knot invariants. The main tools here include sutured
3-manifold theory, combinatorial techniques from Dehn surgery and surface
mapping group techniques.



The research of the project lies in the area of 3-dimensional topology the
central objects of study of which are spaces called 3-manifolds. A 3-manifold is
an object that locally looks like the ordinary 3-dimensional space but whose
global structure can be complicated. An important part of 3-dimensional topology
is also the study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in 3-manifolds)
and their classification. One of the ways that topologists have been approaching
these problems is through the use of invariants. In the recent years, ideas
originated in physics, lead mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of
invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. The central theme of the PI's project is to
understand the properties of these invariants, using ideas from 3-dimensional
topology and geometry and from physics, and investigate the extent to which they
distinguish knots and 3-manifolds.
