ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0244960&lt;br/&gt;Winograd/Pennsylvania
State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project, supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses fundamental aspects of the interaction
of energetic ions and photons with solid surfaces. The Principal Investigator
and his group at the Pennsylvania State University are examining the
interactions of cluster ion beams with organic thin films and with biological
samples in an ice matrix. A combination of state resolved experimental
measurement with classical trajectory calculational modeling, provides
information about the deposition of energy in the solid surface upon ion-surface
collision. Molecule-specific imaging of the sample surface is the goal of this
work. Results from these studies will impact analytical mass spectrometry,
fusion reactor design, biotechnology, and reactive ion etching of electronic
materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface analysis using high energy atomic and
cluster ion beams is the focus of the research supported in this project. With
the funding of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Winograd
and his coworkers are examining the fundamental aspects of ion-solid surface
interactions. The particular focus of this work is on the interaction of
energetic cluster ions with biological samples in an ice matrix, with the goal
of developing molecule specific surface analysis of biological materials.
