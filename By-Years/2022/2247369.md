The conference “Frontiers in Stochastic Analysis” will be held at the University
of Illinois at Chicago, in Chicago from Aug 09 to Aug 11, 2023. It covers a
variety of topics in stochastic analysis. These topics are deeply related to
each other and reflect current trend of research in the field. The plenary
speakers have been chosen by a scientific committee, not only for their
outstanding research records but also for their excellent lecturing style. Their
talks will provide an overview of several frontiers of current research in the
field. In addition, the conference features a program of short talks. This
program provides young researchers, senior graduate students and post-docs in
particular, with an opportunity to showcase their research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probability theory is the mathematical theory concerned
with the analysis of random phenomena. Many of such phenomena may mathematically
be modeled by continuous stochastic processes or random fields. Stochastic
analysis is an active branch of probability theory that provides a wide range of
tools to study those processes and fields. The choice of research topics of the
conference reflects several aspects of stochastic analysis areas that have
become the object of intense study in recent years. The broad array of topics
covered will broaden the scope and interest of graduate students and early
career researchers. The conference also provides an easily accessible platform
for interaction among different generations of researchers in the field and for
communication among different areas of stochastic analysis. The conference

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
