9728907 Watson Several environmental factors influence the growth and
development of green plants, but among them light is perhaps the most important.
Apart from its role as the energy source for photosynthesis, light provides
crucial environmental cues that control virtually every stage of the plant life
cycle, from seed germination, through stem and leaf development, to flowering.
The long-term goal of this research is to understand how the perception and
transduction of light signals regulate the growth and development of green
plants. The research will focus on two protein kinases and their genes from the
garden pea. Protein kinases are ubiquitous enzymes that are frequently involved
in signal transduction processes. One of the kinases under study is predicted to
be a blue light photoreceptor, while the other is likely to be involved in
signal transduction. A combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical
approaches is proposed to test these hypotheses, and thereby elucidate the roles
of these two protein kinases in transducing light signals. This work will
contribute to and expand our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by
which light regulates plant development.
