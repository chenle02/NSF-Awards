This award provides support for research on a new class of jointless mechanical
mechanisms. These mechanisms, which obtain motion and force amplification
through flexure, are called compliant mechanisms. The research will seek to
develop mathematical models of compliant mechanisms suitable for design
synthesis, validation and demonstration of the mathematical models through
construction of prototype devices, development of a set of compliant mechanism
design building blocks and materials, and investigation of compliant mechanisms
occurring in nature. A goal of this research is the development of a methodology
for the design of compliant mechanisms. If successful, this research could
impact the design of many mechanical and electromechanical devices. Compliant
mechanisms have the potential to drastically reduce mechanism parts counts and
in some cases, replace even complex mechanisms with a single part. Particularly
in the latter case, reductions in assembly cost can be substantial. Compliant
mechanisms have the further advantages of requiring no bearing surfaces and no
lubrication. Thus despite their high degree of functionality, compliant parts
may often be less costly to produce.
