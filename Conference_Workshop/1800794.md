This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Workshop on Analysis, Approximation Theory, Operator Theory and their
Interactions", a meeting that will take place during March 13-16, 2018, on the
campus of Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. Additional information about
the conference can be found on the website http://u.osu.edu/costin.10/

The Workshop on Analysis, Approximation Theory, Operator Theory and their
Interactions will engage participants in an interesting blend of approximation
theory, operator theory, and general analysis. It is intended to provide
opportunities for interaction among workers in these areas, to set future
research directions and provide an opportunity for young workers to learn
important aspects of the field. The latter will be accomplished by a series of
expository lectures by leading experts. The following subareas will be
emphasized during the workshop: orthogonal polynomials and systems, wavelet
theory (and its use in approximation of Besov and Sobolev spaces), special
functions, interpolation of operators, s-numbers and entropy numbers for
operators on Banach spaces and their approximations, nuclear operators,
eigenvalues of operators (including non-selfadjoint) and applications of
approximation and operator theory. This will be an important conference on
approximation and operator theory that will significantly impact the future
interaction of these fields.
