This proposal requests support to obtain a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography
(FPLC) system. The instrument will be shared by several investigators whose
research efforts require the separation and purification of proteins or
oligonucleotide. The following studies are proposed. Biochemical mechanisms of
nucleotide excision DNA repair, structure and catalytic mechanisms of
metal.activated enzymes, structure and internal dynamics in cytochrome c,
ubiguitin and calmodulin function, protein biosynthesis and the regulation of
cell growth in plant systems, conformations of nucleic acids and their
interactions with small molecules, the role of chromosomal proteins
phosphorylation in chromosomal structure, cell division and embryonic
development.
