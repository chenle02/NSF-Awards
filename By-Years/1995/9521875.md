9521875 Hellawell This two-year renewal provides for completion of research on
the development of equiaxed grains in metal castings. The initial source for the
grain solidification is thought to be dendrite fragments that have become
detached within the earlier mushy region of the casting. The fragments are
transported out into the bulk liquid by thermo-solutal convection. Surviving
fragments grow, sink, and eventually block columnar grains. The steps in
modeling the process have been identified and analyzed in some detail, and it is
recognized that the conditions that promote dendrite arm detachment are
associated with transient growth conditions. These conditions mirror those in a
casting, where columnar dendritic growth front is decelerating continuously and
the temperature gradient is falling simultaneously. This critical step in the
process is examined analytically and experimentally using transparent analogues
and selected metal alloys. %%% This topic addresses a major gap in understanding
the development of the microstructure of alloy castings. This complex process
should be clarified by the experimental and theoretical work proposed. ***
