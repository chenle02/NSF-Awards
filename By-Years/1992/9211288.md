The process of volume rendering is increasingly used for a wide range of
scientific visualization application as well as for the generation of complex
synthetic scenes. However, the process of viewing which constitutes the most
crucial phase in rendering is also memory intensive and time consuming. This
project investigates new ways to expedite volume viewing by exploiting coherency
and redundancy in the volume data. In particular, the objectives of the proposed
research are to: (1) develop methods to exploit coherency between rays, (2)
develop methods to exploit coherency between frames, (3) develop methods to
accelerate ray traversal by utilizing the empty space, (4) speed up recursive
ray tracing to precomputing view independent attributes and partial coverage
information, and (5) assemble the technology into a rendering toolkit that will
be used for the construction of application- specific volume rendering
environments. This research is expected to produce a portable rendering toolkit
delivering faster than ever high quality volume rendering. It is anticipated
that the toolkit will find a wide use in visualization, education, and graphics.
