The Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research
(CASPER) was founded thirteen years ago to make specialized computational
methods for radio astronomy widely available. It has since become a community of
hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide and their methods have become
ubiquitous throughout radio astronomy. CASPER has had such a broad impact in
radio astronomy that its methods and tools underlie each of the top-ranked radio
astronomy initiatives of the last decadal review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will support the CASPER Conference scheduled for 12-16 August 2019 at
the Harvard College Observatory. The workshop will include five days of
lectures, tutorials and hands-on exercises. This workshop will be run in
collaboration with NSF supported PIRE summer school on astronomy techniques
(OISE/1743747). This workshop will include a new technical focus on emerging
Radio Frequency System on a Chip (RFSoC) applications. Students will have the
opportunity to meet and interact with experienced researchers by being paired
with "lab mentors." In addition to academic presentations, speakers from
industry will be invited. These presentations give students an opportunity to
network with potential employers outside of academia. Presentations from the
conference will be made publicly available on the conference and CASPER
websites. The conference will also feature a public lecture on radio astronomy,
a poster session and several live demonstrations for the general public.
Requested funds will offset costs of student registration, accommodation and
travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
