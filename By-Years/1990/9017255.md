The goal of the research is to elucidate the mechanism of action of the carrier
molecule in a substrate-cation cotransport system in the bacterium E. coli, with
specific focus on the melobiose carrier. Isolation of spontaneous mutants
deficient in cation recognition and sugar recognition will be followed by
analysis of their physiological abnormalities in membrane transport. The
physiological effects of amino-acid substitution in the carrier molecule,
particularly in membrane-spanning regions, will be examined. Use of site-
directed mutagenesis is expected to provide an experimental test of the "helical
hairpin" hypothesis for insertion of the melobiose carrier into membranes. Other
studies will employ polyclonal antibodies in an attempt to determine the
orientation of presumed "loop" regions of the carrier in the membrane. The means
whereby small molecules such as sugars and inorganic ions gain entrance to cells
through the lipid-rich cell membrane is a matter of fundamental interest and
importance; active transport across membranes often involves specific carrier
molecules and it is one of these--the melobiose carrier--that is the focus of
this research. The goal of the project is to understand the molecular aspects of
the carrier molecule that permit it to bind specifically to some molecules and
not others, and to be inserted into cell membranes in a manner that permits
cotransport of sugars and cations in appropriate directions. //
