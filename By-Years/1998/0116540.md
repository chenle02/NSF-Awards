This is a Major Research Instrumentation award to acquire equipment to upgrade
the West Virginia University Plasma Physics Laboratory's new Space Physics
Simulation Facility. The facility consists of a cylindrical, stainless-steel
vacuum chamber 4 meters long and 1.8 meters in diameter. The objective of the
upgrade is to acquire equipment necessary to launch a unique category of
experiments within the subfield of dusty plasmas, a subfield with wide-ranging
scientific and technological applications. The new experiments enabled will
provide information about the electrostatic dust-cyclotron instability and other
new waves and instabilities associated with dusty plasmas having the dust-grain
gyroradius much smaller than the radius of the plasma, a parameter regime yet to
be achieved in the laboratory. The experiments will provide access to a
parameter regime that has commanded significant recent theoretical attention.
The equipment includes electromagnets, vacuum pumps, power supply, and
16-channel waveform recorder. The long range goal is for the Space Physics
Simulation Facility to assume scientific leadership in experimental studies of
magnetized dusty plasmas.
