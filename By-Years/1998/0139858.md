&lt;br/&gt;The award addresses offering of Symposium Y: Nanopatterning - from
ULSI to Biotechnology, to be held in the context of the 2001 Materials Research
Society (MRS) Fall Meeting in Boston, MA, during November 26-30, 2001. The
Symposium is to be preceded by a tutorial on Nanofabrication for Cellular
Engineering. The purpose of the Symposium and tutorial is to bring together an
interdisciplinary group of experts representing materials science, physics,
chemistry, electronics, biology and medicine, to explore the fundamental
processes and tools for nanoscale patterning. The technologies to be addressed
include optical as well as next generation lithography (EUV, X-ray, e-beam, ion-
beam); probe arrays; self assembly processes; maskless and soft lithography
including imprinting and holographic/ interferometric methods; materials design
and characterization for data storage, NEMS, displays, systems-on-a-chip,
molecular devices; metrology issues; bionanotechnology including tissue
engineering, biomimetics and interfaces; and theory, modeling and simulation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium technologies in nanoscale patterning address
critical challenges in a broad industry spectrum, from semiconductor to
biotechnology, where the development of such nanofabrication techniques is
particularly timely. It is expected that the Symposium and tutorial will promote
transfer of ideas and research expertise from the senior speakers to the young
faculty, postdoctoral fellows and student participants, and therefore contribute
to the professional/research development of new people in nanomanufacturing, as
well as the dissemination of information to the research community and the
development of educational materials for teaching.&lt;br/&gt;
