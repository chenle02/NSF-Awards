The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University was awarded a multi-
year grant (May 1, 2010- April 30, 2015) to develop an ice imaging system, or
"IcePod," for use in measuring the surface and subsurface topography of ice
sheets. IcePod will enable research on the effects of global climate change on
ice sheets and the effects of sub-glacial water on potential sea-level rise.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IcePod sensors are contained in a Common Science Support
Pod and operated on NYANG LC-130 aircraft during routine and targeted missions
over Greenland and Antarctica. The IcePod instrument package consists of ice-
penetrating radar, infrared and visible cameras, laser altimeter, inertial
measurement unit, GPS receiver and data acquisition system. IcePod will also
enable other instruments to be used in the modular Common Science Support Pod,
and will become a shared community research facility providing data to the
science community. Funding will support activities in both Greenland and
Antarctica needed to commission IcePod, to develop a data reduction flow and
data delivery system for IcePod data, and to engineer a UPS to provide IcePod
with clean, reliable power for system operation.
