9220202 Bloomer This project includes a field program to geophysically and
geologically sample the two largest transfrom fault zones on the Pacific-
Antarctic plate boundary. The principal objectives are: (1) to understand the
structures and tectonics of long, fast- slipping transfrom faults; (2) to test
structureal inferences based largely on remotely sensed seismicity and satellite
altimetry; (3) to the geologic composition of the crustal rocks exposed in the
transforms, and (4) to exploit known outcrops of lower crustal and upper mantle
rocks that the usually inaccessible to dredging on fast-spreading ridges.
