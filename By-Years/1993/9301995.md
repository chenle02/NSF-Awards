Understanding the flow of fluids through ocean sediments and crust is a major
objective of the Ocean Drilling Program. Such flow results in the alteration of
crustal rocks, the transport of heat and dissolved elements, and has a
significant effect on the rheology and deformation of sediment sequences. This
award will support deployment of instrumentation in ODP holes to measure
temperature, pressure and electrical conductivity, and to allow sampling of
borehole fluids. The ODP holes are isolated from bottom waters by sealing the
holes. Recovery of data and samples will be done by submersible or remote
techniques.
