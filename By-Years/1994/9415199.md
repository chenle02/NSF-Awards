The Department of Mechanical Engineering, at the University of Michigan-
Dearborn, is the recipient of funds from the National Science Foundation to
renovate engineering laboratory space to meet research needs of students and
faculty in the areas of combustion engines and fuels, and lightweight materials.
Research activities involving combustion engines, alternative fuels, and
emissions have allowed talented minority high school students, undergraduates
and graduate students to work independently or with faculty members in the
discipline. Although research activities are performed, existing laboratories
lack proper environmental controls and safety mechanisms required to effectively
operate the facility throughout the year. Due to the lack of air conditioning
and humidity controls, emissions equipment and other diagnostic instrumentation
are inoperable in the summer months. The test cell gas detection system
frequently malfunctions because of its age, thereby causing interruptions during
experiments. Proper facilities for research in lightweight materials such as
plastics and composites are not available. While scholarly activities in the
discipline have been expanding, the lack of space devoted to plastics and
composites research has limited student participation in experimental research
and design in the field. The renovation plan entails: consolidating the existing
foundry and metals processing laboratories to provide clean space for plastics
and composite research, providing climate and humidity controls for renovated
labs, and installing a new gas detection system to detect poisonous and
flammable gases that build up in the test cells. The renovation of the engine
test cells and the foundry area will increase research and design productivity
of faculty and students by increasing research training opportunities, sponsored
research activities in the department, and contributing to the needs of
industry.
