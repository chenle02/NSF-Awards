9451463 Thompson A ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrophotometer
specifically enhanced for analytical and biochemical applications significantly
affecting intermediate and advanced levels of the curriculum. Students are
gaining experience with such modern techniques as ultra-fast scanning, high
resolution spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance measurements, computerized
quantitative analysis and kinetics analysis, DNA melts, gel scanning, rapid
temperature control, controlled mixing, and remote instrument operation. Over a
three-year period approximately 100 undergraduates will have hands-on experience
with the instrument, while others are benefitting from materials prepared
through use of the instrument.
