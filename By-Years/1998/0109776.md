Each function of the adult nervous system, from a simple reflex response to a
complex behavior, depends on the actions of distinct neuronal circuits. These
circuits operate correctly because their component neurons are appropriately
connected to each other. Precise wiring of these circuits requires guided growth
of nerve fibers to reach the specific targets. Recent studies have identified a
variety of molecular cues that provide the "road signs" for growing nerve fibers
to navigate through their complex environment, with some of these cues
attracting but others repelling growing nerve fibers. It is believed that the
tiny, motile tip of each growing nerve fiber, known as the growth cone, is
responsible for reading these "road signs" to steer the fiber in the appropriate
direction (steering). Dr. Zheng's study aims to elucidate the mechanism by which
motile growth cones accurately read direction from these extracellular cues. The
research team will specifically focus on the role of intracellular calcium ions
(Ca2+) in the growth cone's sensing of direction from diffusible cues. The
hypothesis to be tested is that tempo-spatial Ca2+ signals in the growth cone
provide the cellular mechanism for encoding of the directional information in
the growth cone to initiate appropriate steering responses. Dr. Zheng's research
team will use a combination of high-resolution digital imaging and manipulation
techniques to examine the tempo-spatial pattern of intracellular Ca2+ signals
associated with growth cone steering in response to different guidance cues.
Furthermore, the research team will directly generate a similar tempo-spatial
pattern of Ca2+ signals in the growth cone using a sophisticated laser-induced
photoactivated release method to elucidate the precise role of these Ca2+
signals in guidance. The long-term goal of the study is to understand the
molecular and cellular mechanisms that allow nerve growth cones to accurately
sense direction in the complex extracellular space for the generation of highly
ordered brain architecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
