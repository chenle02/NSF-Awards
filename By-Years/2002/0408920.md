Many natural magnetic minerals undergo transitions at low&lt;br/&gt;temperature.
Scientists investigating the history of Earth's&lt;br/&gt;magnetic field
sometimes use such transitions to help demagnetize rocks,&lt;br/&gt;removing
magnetizations acquired after rock formation. For example,&lt;br/&gt;magnetite
undergoes a change in crystal structure (from orthorhombic
to&lt;br/&gt;monoclinic) at approximately 120 K known as the Verwey transition.
A&lt;br/&gt;loss of the magnetic remanence carried by relatively large
magnetite&lt;br/&gt;grains is also observed at the transition. However, our
understanding of&lt;br/&gt;this process, as well as processes associated with
transitions in other&lt;br/&gt;natural magnetic minerals, has to date been based
mainly on measurements of&lt;br/&gt;total magnetic moment. A prototype device
enabling the measurement of&lt;br/&gt;directions with a SQUID magnetometer
during cooling/warming through&lt;br/&gt;low temperature transitions suggests
interesting phenomena,&lt;br/&gt;possibly related to the interactions of
magnetic domain walls and&lt;br/&gt;crystal deflects. The PI will test this
hypothesis, compile new directional&lt;br/&gt;data on a wide range of magnetic
minerals, and continue to develop the device&lt;br/&gt;for low temperature
cooling/directional analysis. Broader impacts of the&lt;br/&gt;work include
educational efforts and the development of a research tool&lt;br/&gt;useful for
the rock magnetism and paleomagnetism communities (and the&lt;br/&gt;community
in physics interested in magnetic properties at low
temperatures).&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will take part in the characterization
of magnetic&lt;br/&gt;minerals, low temperature remanence measurements and data
analyses.
