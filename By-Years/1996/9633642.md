Abstract ATM-9633642 Heusser, Linda E. Heusser & Heusser, Inc. Title: Climate
Variability of Northeast Pacific/Western North American: Sub-millennial Scale
Marine and Terrestrial Evidence from Santa Barbara Basin This award supports a
project that is designed to study sub- millennial scale natural climate
variability during two major warm events at the beginning of the last glacial
cycle. The project focuses on the rapidly deposited sediments ( 100cm/kyr)
recoveped from ODP Site 893 in Santa Barbara Basin. The approach will be to
examine both marine and terrestrial indicators of climate change using subsets
of the same sediment samples, thus allowing for direct comparison of changes in
the rate and amplitude of the response of these two interrelated ecosystems to
global climate change. Marine plankton (foraminifera and radiolaria) and pollen
in sediments deposited between 65 to 108kyr at approximately 100- 200 year
intervals will be analyzed. Results of this study will lead to more rigorous
validation of models of present climate change and improvement in our
understanding of the interaction between low- and high-frequency climate
processes and associated forcing mechanisms.
