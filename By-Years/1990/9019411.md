Plant growth depends on the production of organic materials, mostly sugars and
amino acids, by photosynthesis. At first consideration, it seems reasonable to
suppose that the rate of plant growth should depend directly on the
concentration of these substrates: the higher their concentration, the faster
the rate of growth. However, this supposition is not supported by available
evidence. Young seeds, especially, seem to maintain preset growth rates that
show little relation to sugar and amino acid concentrations. Instead, growth
rates appear to be controlled by the transport of these substances from
conducting cells into the growing embryo, a distance of less than a millimeter.
Developing wheat grains offer advantages for studying this transport, since the
pathway is well- defined and growth rates and concentrations can be measured at
key points along the path. These investigations will develop a better
understanding of transport along this pathway and, consequently, of how the
growth rate of seeds might be controlled.//
