Coping with environmental challenges requires recognizing and harnessing
multiple forms of expertise to effectively manage environmental change. This
dissertation project investigates the potential contributions of combining
indigenous environmental knowledge with western science to better understanding
and manage rapid environmental change. It combines archival data and data from
in-depth interviews with Indigenous scientists who have strong cultural ties to
their natal communities to explore the ways that these different perspectives
can be hybridized and aligned to enable their combined use in environmental
policy making. This project supports graduate student training, the inclusion of
Native Americans in STEM fields, and find ways to use Indigenous knowledge to
help ameliorate pressing environmental problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project advances research within science and technology studies on hybrid forms
of knowledge, scientific collaboration, and the science of policy making. It
also advances efforts to promote environmental sustainability. The term
“Boundary Walkers’ is used to describe natural scientists who are Indigenous and
who have access to indigenous forms of environmental knowledge. Investigators
seek to understand how Western and Indigenous knowledge systems can work
together to confront problems arising from rapid environmental change, how
boundary-walkers navigate across this divide, and how this knowledge can be put
to practical use in environmental policy making. Data come from archives at
universities, museums, and tribal libraries and associations, and from in-depth
interviews with 30 boundary walkers. Overall, this original research provides
pathways forward for integrating diverse forms of knowledge for practical
good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
