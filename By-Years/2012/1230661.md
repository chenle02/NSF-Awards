The proposed projects objective is to develop a system level framework for
patient monitoring. This framework is intended to allow the interoperability of
various patient monitoring devices; data preprocessing and fusion to detect the
data inconsistencies and determine session and data prioritization; and
bandwidth-adaptive data and video transmission driven by real-time
prioritization. The proposed research will lead to the evolution of protocols
that can be used for providing interoperability among various physiological
measurement devices/sensors, and will have applications in numerous healthcare
domains such as home healthcare, post-operative care, preventive care, adult
care and nursing homes.

The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to impact the medical
sciences, healthcare and computer science, enabling an information rich
environment with which medical care and outcomes may be significantly improving.
The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as an individual
industry member of the center and has the potential to extend the centers
portfolio. The PIs will disseminate the results of the work using the already
established TerraFly web-based data dissemination tool.
