This amends an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by making an award to the
Pacific Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command (PACDIV) for engineering
services to the United States Antarctic Program (USAP).

The following tasks are included:

1. USAP PACDIV Management Support 2. McMurdo Medical Clinic Renovation Design

Similar services have been provided by PACDIV and their contractors since 1983.
The services have always been timely, cost effective, and professional. It is
expected that this work will be accomplished in a similar manner. PACDIV is a
government agency, not associated with the NSF or the support contractor. PACDIV
has no interest in the support contract that could constitute a conflict of
interest.

For the reasons stated above it is in the best interest of the NSF for PACDIV to
continue with the ongoing tasking. This award is recommended for the amount of
$157,966.
