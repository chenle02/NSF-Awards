The project will develop quantitative tools to analyze the large-scale tracer
transport in both models and the atmosphere. Numerical models of atmospheric
chemistry and transport are being increasingly used to understand the
interactions between various atmospheric regions, e.g., between troposphere and
stratosphere, and the Tropics and midlatitudes. Since trace gases do not
directly impact atmospheric motion, they reveal the movement of air parcels. The
climatological pathways of the air parcels and the dynamical mechanisms
determining the pathways are not known with great certainty at this time. Dr.
Bowman will develop a diagnostic tool for analyzing tracer transport, by
estimating the Green's (or influence) function for the tracer conservation
equation. Dr. Bowman will construct this function from particle trajectories
computed from observed (reanalysis) and NCAR Community Climate Model simulated
winds. Bowman's project is unique in view of its focus on transport dynamics of
the troposphere (as opposed to the stratosphere).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
