This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in X-ray
lithography between Franco Cerrina at the University of Wisconsin and Huguette
Launois of Laboratory for of Microstructures and Microelectronics at the French
National Center for Scientific Research. The project includes travel support for
Dr. Cerrina's graduate students. The objective of the research is to study the
limits of X-ray lithography by taking advantage of E-beam lithography and a
tungsten process developed in Dr. Launois' laboratory. The project will advance
our knowledge of X-ray lithography and has relevance to the microelectronics
industry.
