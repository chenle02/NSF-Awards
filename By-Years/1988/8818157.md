The proposed research will develop probes that detect moderately-highly
variable mini-satellite DNA genetic markers in plants. Several mini-satellite
probes of this type have been developed for use with tetrapods and they have
revealed a wealth of genetic polymorphic markers to the degree that some have
been referred to as "DNA fingerprinting" probes. Such probes have both proven
and potential applications in several fields of biology including genetic
mapping and linkage analysis, pedigree analysis (paternity and maternity
analyses) breeding improvement programs, and population and evolutionary
genetics. Recently, it has been demonstrated that some of these same probes used
with tetrapods also reveal alleles at variable loci in algae, gymnosperms, and
angiosperms. The central goal of the research is to develop DNA probes for such
genetic analyses of mini- satellite variable loci in plants through two
experimental approaches. First, numerous probes (naturally derived and
synthetic) previously used thus far only in tetrapods await exploration with
plants. Second, these same probes will be used to develop plant-derived mini-
satellite probes. The ultimate goal is to provide probes that are rapid, easy,
and broad in application that permit "DNA genetic fingerprinting" for plants.
Such probes will be a powerful new tool for the study of the apportionment and
dynamics of genetic variation within and between a wide variety of plant
species.
