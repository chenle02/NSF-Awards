This project, which is a collaborative effort between the University of
California at Riverside and Los Angeles, focuses on processor and system
architecture issues for Web Switches. Web switches are network processing
elements that modify network traffic based on content. These devices are
frequently used to provide load balancing between functionally equivalent
servers as well as cryptographic services; in in the future will be used for a
host of new applications including active security and multimedia trans-coding.
This project will begin by developing a benchmarking framework that can be used
to evaluate the performance of Web switches. The research will then use advanced
processor simulation tools to study architectural tradeoffs in the face of the
benchmark workload. In particular, the researchers will focus on the efficacy of
hardware accelerator blocks that have been proposed. Finally, work will be
completed to implement the workload and capitalize on acquired knowledge in the
context of an existing test bed for network processors.
