ABSTRACT Alvin Weiss This is collaboration with Professor A. M. Pak of the I
nstitute of Organic Catalysis and Electrochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of
the Republic of Kazakhstan. The goal of this work is to control the
stereospecifity of olefin isomers produced by the hydrogenation of long-chain
acetylenes. Copper and copper-palladium impregnated on alumina, magnesia, or
silica are studied and stereoselectivity is correlated with dispersion and
surface acidity. Metal-exchange zeolites are also used as catalysts. Quantum
chemical (CNDO/2) calculations are used to guide selection of conditions and
catalysts that might show the desired selectivity. Stereoselective reduction of
acetylenes (alkynes) is valuable for a number of systems including production of
monomer and a wide variety of biologically active molecules from flavor ehancers
to antibiotics. In the present study, the precursors of pheromones useful for
insect control are prepared.
