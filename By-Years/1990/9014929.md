The Snowbird conference has been held biennially at Snowbird, Utah in the
summer of each even-numbered year since 1974. The Conference provides a forum in
which the administrators of the Ph.D-granting academic computing departments,
research laboratory managers, representatives from government agencies, and
other interested parties can meet to explore and discuss issues important to the
development of computing research. The 1990 Snowbird Conference will be
consistent with this mission. The Computing Research Board (CRB) is inviting six
resource persons from non-member academic institutions to serve on panels and as
workshop leaders on such topics as Human Resources (increasing the involvement
of underrepresented groups in computer research), Educational Pipelines issues,
and Curriculum improvement. Also, invited will be four representatives from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The latter invitees could
increase their awareness on the issues relating to computing research and
provide insight into mechanisms for increasing minority representation in
computing research for the other participants at Snowbird. The Conference is
being held July 8-10, 1990 in Snowbird, Utah
