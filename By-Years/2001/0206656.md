This proposal is from the NYU group and requests funding for two distinct
projects: a search for a rare symmetry violating process that has the prospect
of discovering new physics beyond the Standard Model and a study of astronomical
gamma rays and cosmic rays of 100 GeV to 10 TeV.

Recognizing an opportunity to address new physics, a strong collaboration (MECO)
representing 20 institutions, has formed and is proposing funding for the
project entitled "Rare Symmetry Violating Processes" (RSVP). RSVP represents an
opportunity to empower the university community to make discoveries of
extraordinary importance. The current scope of RSVP includes 130 scientists,
about 60% from the United States, and the others from Canada, Switzerland,
Italy, Japan, and Russia, along with an expected 100 graduate students and post-
docs.

Observation of Muon to Electron COnversion by MECO would be the first evidence
for a process that violates muon and electron type lepton number and that cannot
be explained by the Standard Model of particle physics, extended to include
massive neutrinos. It would be direct evidence for previously unknown physics
processes involving new forces. This experiment is proposed to achieve a
sensitivity 10,000 times that of current experiments.

The second component of the request is work on the MILAGRO gamma ray observatory
to study the highest energy gamma rays and cosmic rays at energies where the
fluxes are sensitive to some of the most energetic processes occurring in the
universe. MILAGRO is a large water Cherenkov counter and is the first detector
capable of continuously monitoring the full overhead sky at these energies.
