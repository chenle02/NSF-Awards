The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the behavioral factors
exhibited by actors making decisions in dynamic systems, particularly those of a
supply chain. Previous researchers have looked at the question of supply chain
management from a purely rational point of view, developing inventory models
which assume each member acts to maximize a clearly defined (and often quite
complex) profit function. Evidence from other settings, like experimental
economics and psychology, suggests people rarely act so rationally. This
research investigates actual behavior in simulated (experimental) supply chains
and compares that behavior with the theoretically predicted behavior. There are
two main contributions of this research. First, increasing our understanding of
behavioral and institutional factors which affect supply chain coordination.
Second, achieving a better understanding of how individuals make decisions in
complex systems with difficult dynamics. On the applied front, results will
illuminate the effects of institutions and behavioral tendencies on supply chain
coordination and well as suggest recommendations for use in practice. On the
theoretical front, results will aid our understanding of how individuals make
decisions in complex problems, which rules-of-thumb they use, how they update
their beliefs, and how they learn. This young investigator already has a record
of accomplishment and is positioned to make major advances in an important area
of research. The investigator's previous research has focused on the
experimental testing of economic theories. Funding from the POWRE award will
allow her to extend that research focus to the experimental testing of
operations theories. This extension will enable her to use her experimental
skills in attacking a new and important problem in operations management. It
also will likely have a large impact on the field, enhancing her career and
leadership potential.
