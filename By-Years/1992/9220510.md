Professor Carol A. Venanzi and Dr. William J. Skawinski are supported by a grant
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to: 1) perform
theoretical chemical studies of amiloride analogs in an effort to understand
their efficacy as sodium channel blockers in epithelial cells, and 2) to develop
the use of stereolithography in conjunction with computer graphics as a three-
dimensional tactile modeling technique for visually impaired scientists. %%%
Drs. Venanzi and Skawinski will use theoretical calculations of molecular
electrostatic potential maps to explain experimental data on the binding
constants for chemical analogs of the compound amiloride which is a known
diuretic drug and a potent sodium channel blocker. Their working hypothesis is
that the long-range electrostatic interactions orient and direct the amiloride
molecule into the channel binding site which must be complementary to amiloride
in both molecular shape and molecular electrostatic potential. As part of this
research they will also exploit a technique known as stereolithography to
translate 3-D computer generated images into tactile models so that Dr.
Skawinski, a visually impaired theoretical chemist, can perceive the molecular
shapes of the active species and actively participate in the research.
