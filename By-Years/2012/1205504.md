This award supports theoretical research on dipolar Fermi gases. In such
ultracold gases of molecules, interactions between the electric dipole moments
of the molecules lead to a rich array of unusual quantum phases. They belong to
the latest breeds of quantum matter engineered in laboratories by precise
control of molecules using laser light. The system has the potential to simulate
and solve some profound mysteries regarding strongly interacting fermions with
long-range interactions. The research will chart out the phase diagrams of
dipolar fermions on two-dimensional optical lattices. The goal is to discover
and understand novel phases of matter and predict their experimental signatures.
The results can provide input for current and future experiments. The knowledge
acquired will contribute to the understanding of interacting fermions in
general, a subject of fundamental importance to physics and material science.
Better understanding and consequently better control over the system will help
to achieve other goals of ultracold molecule research, such as precision
measurement and quantum computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will
stimulate deeper dialogue between many body physics and Atomic, Molecular, and
Optical physics at the interdisciplinary frontier of ultracold molecules. It
will also strengthen the collaboration between George Mason University and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology on cold atoms research. The
principal investigator will continue to coach local high school students on
independent research projects to compete in the Intel and Siemens Science and
Engineering Fair.
