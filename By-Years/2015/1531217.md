An award is made to the Bioengineering Program, the Department of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-D) to acquire an Olympus
FV1200 spectral laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). UM-D has recently
introduced an undergraduate Bioengineering program. Bioengineering research at
UM-D involves faculty and students from engineering and natural sciences. The
new confocal capabilities will facilitate development of research and education
in the newly launched program. The undergraduate classes at UM-D are small in
size, enabling the faculty members to teach advanced experimental approaches to
the students while providing face-to-face demonstrations of the confocal
technique. Thus, the new instrument will help in the developing undergraduate
curriculum of the Bioengineering program. In addition, it will provide an
opportunity to develop new science activities/workshops to introduce aspects of
bioengineering to high school students and teachers, aligned with national and
Michigan science education standards. High school students from the Detroit
metropolitan area will continue to obtain opportunities to participate in summer
research. These students will have access to the instrument through their
involvement in various research projects supervised by the faculty
users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Olympus FV1200 laser confocal microscope will
substantially improve the quality of Bioengineering research at UM-D by
overcoming the limits of conventional microscopic analysis. It will help to
achieve high spectral resolution, rapid data acquisition, live cell and tissue
imaging through time series analysis, 3D reconstruction, and fluorescence
recovery. Bioengineering research at UM-D is multidisciplinary in nature
spanning diverse research interests from developing scaffolds for tissue
regeneration to studying ocular biomechanics and cancer metastasis, from
exploring dynamics of microbial communities to modulation of hypoxia in islets
and cryopreservation of living cells. In addition, the new confocal capabilities
will set the stage for establishing inter-institution collaboration and also
help to attract new research projects to the campus. In addition, four of the
PI, Co-PIs, and users of the instrument are pre-tenure, junior faculty. The
state-of-the art-microscope will provide them the cutting edge tool necessary to
successfully establish their research programs.
