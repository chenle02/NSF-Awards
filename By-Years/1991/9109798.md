Economies of scale achieved through mass production of a limited number of
products has been the cornerstone of successful manufacturing throughout this
century. For most industries, this strategy is rapidly becoming obsolete as the
competitive emphasis shifts to producing an enormous variety of products at
costs approaching the efficiency of mass production. This trend to variety
competition is driven by many factors. This proposal describes a program of
research to develop models and algorithms for designing the products in a
product line and for designing and managing the production process in an
environment of high product variety. The first component of our research is
concerned with developing detailed sequencing models and algorithms appropriate
for managing the mixed-model transfer lines that will soon become the dominant
production process for automobiles. The second component is developing strategic
planning models and algorithms that integrate product planning, technology
choice and design of production lines.
