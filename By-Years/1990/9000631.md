The principal investigator will study the relationship between the spectrum of
the Laplacian of a manifold and the geometry of that manifold. This will include
an investigation of the relationship between the spectrum and geometric
properties such as diameter and injectivity radius, as well as a trace formula
for Riemannian manifolds. The project will include a study of eigenvalue
estimates in the context of obtaining finiteness and compactness results for
isospectral manifolds. The problems to be addressed in this project are
extensions of Mark Kac's famous question, "Can you hear the shape of a drum?"
Mathematicians would ask if the spectrum of sound frequencies radiating from a
drum can be used to distinguish between different shaped drums. In two
dimensions these frequencies can be used to make such distinctions, but in
higher dimensions they can not. The principal investigator will study whether or
not other mathematical distinctions between objects other than their exact
shapes, can be determined by an analysis of their sound spectrums.
