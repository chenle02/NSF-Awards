The first objective of this project is to investigate the process of scouting
for candidates for emerging engineering technologies, and of assessing them for
their potential to become important technologies, with eventual substantial
impact on the economy. The second objective of the three-year project is to
generate a small list of candidate technologies, perhaps up to twenty, each
year, which will be submitted to the National Science Foundation. These
candidates will be further evaluated by NSF panels which will recommend the top
few technologies that should be supported. The National Science Foundation will
make the final selections.
