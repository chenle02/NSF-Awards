9617404 Hart This project will test the hypothesis that dusky-footed woodrats
use the fresh leaves of particular plants to control nest-borne ectoparasites.
If this proves to be true, it would be the first known case of a mammal using
the biocidal substances of a plant as a means of combating nest infestation by
blood-sucking ectoparasites such as fleas. In the study population, woodrats
place sprigs of freshly gathered bay leaves near the rim of their sleeping
nests, and pilot observations suggest that bay leaves are effective in
preventing the hatching of flea eggs. They may be effective against flea larvae
and adult fleas and against mites and ticks as well. Perhaps stickhouses in
areas with bay trees harbor woodrats with fewer fleas and ticks than those in
areas devoid of bay or other plants with biocidal properties. These questions
will be addressed with a series of observational and experimental studies,
including remote monitoring of nest activities with "videostick" cameras, tests
of the biocidal properties of plant materials against ectoparasitic insects,
experimental manipulation of parasiteload, and measurement of the impact of nest
material collection on survival and fitness. Improved understanding of the
interactions between woodrats and their ectoparasites is of considerable
theoretical interest theoretical interest because of implications for the use of
medicinal plants by animals other than humans, and has public health
implications as well. This study is also of interest because the relationship
between behavior and the exploitation of plants as nest protectants may
represent another step in the co-evolution of woodrats and their ectoparasites.
Additionally, the ticks of woodrats are an important reservoir of Lyme disease
and their fleas are potential vectors of plague. Since woodrats occur in or near
many public parks as well as in rural areas, and their large houses attract
human attention, they constitute a risk.
