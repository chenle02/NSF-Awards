9512726 Hoekstra This award supports a 15 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. John Hoekstra, Department of Materials
Science, University of Washington, at the Osaka National Research Institute
(ONRI), Osaka, Japan. Dr. Hoekstra will work with Dr. Masanori Koyama, at the
Osaka National Research Institute on a research project entitled, "The
Theoretical Study of Metal/Ceramic Interfaces Using Ab Initio Calculation." The
purpose of the research is to study the properties associated with the bonding
of metal and ceramic interfaces. Knowing the exact nature of the chemical bonds
at the metal/ceramic interface is extremely important in many of today's highly
technical industries, such as the semiconductor and aerospace industries. In
this study, they will use computer simulation to examine the chemical bonds at
the atomistic level to fully describe both the electronic and ionic
contributuions to the bonding. With this knowledge, current use of metal/ceramic
materials can be optimized, and possible new uses may be discovered. The
proposed research is of considerable theoretical and practical interest to the
materials science community and the benefits to be obtained from collaborative
research valuable. The Osaka National Research Institute is an excellent
research facility, and the research plan between the host scientist and Dr.
Hoekstra is well-conceived. The research will likely yield positive results for
the United States and Japan as well as the international scientific community as
a whole. As such, the research satisfies the objectives of the program in its
emphasis on the exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through
international collaboration. ***
