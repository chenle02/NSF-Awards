A new integrated laboratory course for biochemistry/molecular biology majors
will combine contents of the existing biochemistry course with a newly developed
molecular biology component. The first half of the course will focus on
isolation and characterization of biomolecules. The second half will concentrate
on techniques in molecular biology and gene manipulation. New equipment
including column chromatography, a high speed refreigerated centrifuge, a
refrigerated laboratory cabinet, gel electrophoresis equipment, microcentrifuge,
incubator- shaker, and bacteriological incubator will be used for experiments in
mutagenesis techniques, mutant analysis, bacteriophage purification,
transposons, bacterial conjugation, plasmid isolation, restriction endonuclease
digestion, DNA cloning, and transformation. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
