The main objectives of this project are explicit constructions of
representations, related to the fermionic formulas for characters of
representations of Virasoro or other W-algebras and affine Lie algebras. The
project also uses the ideas encountered in fermionic constructions, to give
formulas for graded multiplicities of irreducible modules in the tensor product
of finite-dimensional Lie algebra modules, or integrable modules in the fusion
product of affine algebra modules (coinvariants or conformal blocks). Some of
the specific goals are: The study of fusion products of representations of
finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras; the inductive limit of the fusion
product as the number of factors becomes infinite in a stabilized regime, which
is expected to give new realizations of integrable modules of affine Lie
algebras; combinatorial identities for q-series which result from these
constructions; semi-infinite constructions of arbitrary highest weight
representations of affine Lie algebras modules; and applications of semi-
infinite (c.f. Feigin and Styoanovskii's approach) constructions in solutions of
the fractional quantum Hall effect.

This research is at the interface of combinatorial representation theory and
mathematical physics. The constructions are guided by conformal field theory and
exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics. The results are important in
the representation theory of Lie algebras and affine Lie algebras. Combinatorial
questions such as dimensions of weight spaces in irreducible representations,
multiplicities of irreducible components in tensor products of Lie-algebra
modules are related to the counting of certain matrix elements or conformal
blocks. The physical applications include the study of wave functions in the
quantum Hall effect, and partition functions in statistical mechanical systems
at criticality.
