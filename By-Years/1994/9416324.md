9416324 Levi This study will examine the paleomagnetism of continentally-
derived, late Quaternary, Saugus Formation sedimentary rocks in the San Fernando
Valley and east Ventura Basin in order to delineate the boundaries of rotated
crustal blocks. Preliminary work has roughly delineated the boundaries of
rotated versus non-rotated blocks in the area, and has shown that crustal
segmentation and vertical axis rotations continue to the present. This work will
define the block boundaries more precisely and relate them to mapped faults or
other tectonic features. The results will enable more precise determination of
the strike-slip versus dip-slip components of movement in response to the
tectonic stresses and may provide a practical limit on thrust-fault earthquake
magnitudes in the Los Angeles Basin area.
