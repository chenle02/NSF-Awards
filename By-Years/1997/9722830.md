The life histories of a number of fish species such as lamprey, sturgeon, and
salmon include prolonged periods of voluntary fasting. These periods, usually
coincident with an upstream migration to the rivers and spawning, may last for
several months after which the fish either restore feeding or expire. Despite
many attempts, it remains unknown what ecological or physiological signals
suppress food intake and later, in some fish species, initiate it again. The
purpose of this project is to investigate whether fish food intake is linked to
metabolic cues, primarily to body adiposity or controlled by coordinated network
of hormones such as neuropeptide Y, insulin, leptin and glucagon-like peptide.
The expected results will expand the basic knowledge of regulation of appetite
and food intake in non-mammalian vertebrates. The practical application of the
proposed work may eventually give fish culturists a tool for optimizing feeding
regimes and, consequently, food utilization and body composition. This, in turn,
will diminish expenses of fish food, prevent as much as possible the body fat
dependent phenomenon of early sexual maturation, and at the same time permit
production of healthful food sources for humans.
