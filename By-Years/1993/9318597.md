9318597 Thorndike This group of a senior faculty member and two post doctoral
associates participates in research on b quark properties with the CLEO group at
the CESR electron-positron collider facility. CESR provides record numbers of
B's whose partial decay rates to rare and exotic states will be determined. The
program is one of the most important in particle physics. It provides tests of,
and is a means to search for deviations from, the standard model as applied to
heavy quarks. ***
