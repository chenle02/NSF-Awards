Nerve cell activity depends on various ions crossing the cell membrane through
channels that are sometimes very specific. These channels are formed by protein
molecules in the membrane. Nerve cells often have a long process, the axon which
extends from the cell body known as the soma. Often channels in the axon are
distributed differently from those in the soma. This research addresses the
question of how different proteins, which are continuously synthesized in the
soma of nerve cells, are spatially distributed. This project will examine the
molecular mechanisms of sorting sodium channel proteins in nerve cells. Sodium
channel proteins are synthesized in the soma, but are found in the membrane of
the axon and are absent in the soma. In the squid, an invertebrate, mRNA coding
from rat sodium channels will be injected into the soma. As a result the cells
will synthesize two different types of sodium channels making it possible to
compare the spatial distribution of the two protein molecules. The part of the
molecule responsible for its peculiar spatial distribution can be changed by
changing the coding and thus is able to be identified. This study will advance
our understanding of long-term regulation of how nerve cells function.
