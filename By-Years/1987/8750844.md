This grant has provided the Department of Biology a Hewlett-Packard capillary
gas chromatograph (GC) linked to a mass spectrometer (MS) with a direct
insertion probe that is being used to facilitate instruction in Toxocology
courses and to facilitate the development of more interdisciplinary
undergraduate science projects. Since the MS is an essential tool in the
qualitative and quantitative structural analysis of unknown toxicants in the
environment, projects have been designed in six courses to teach how the GC/MS
functions, and how it is used in Toxicology and in other areas of the Biological
and Physical Sciences. Experiments have been developed to exploit the advantages
offered by the GC/MS as well as show the disadvantages of inappropriate use
(e.g. unstable antibiotics injected into a GC/MS versus direct insertion into
the MS). Student projects involve the use of the GC/MS to detect environmental
pollutants and unknown metabolites of well-defined toxic chemicals or
medications. Stable isotope analyses, potentially useful to those pursuing human
nutritional toxicology research, and experiences with new methods for using the
GC/MS (e.g. with theoretical, pure standards and with biological sample spectra)
are providing instruction on uses of a low resolution GC/MS in Toxicology.
