The Juan Fernandez microplate was surveyed in 1991, obtaining GLORIA sidescan,
Hydrosweep bathymetric, magnetic, gravity, and 3.5 kHz data. The principal
investigator will conduct an extended analysis of these data and will map in
detail the structures of the Juan Fernandez microplate, determining the best-
fitting model or models for its tectonic evolution, and will study the forces
that derive microplate evolution. Questions to be addressed include: (1) What is
the present-day detailed structural and tectonic nature of the Juan Fernandez
microplate and its boundaries? (2) What is the origin and detailed evolution of
this microplate? (3) How is the lithosphere deformed along the Juan Fernandez-
Antarctic plate boundary? (4) How does the Juan Fernandez microplate compare to
other microplates and what general model best applies to their origin and
tectonic evolution.
