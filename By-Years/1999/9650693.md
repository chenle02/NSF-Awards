The Telecommunications Technology Department is enhancing its curriculum by
acquiring a digital video computer editing lab. Over the past 5 years, the use
of high-speed computers in specialized configurations for manipulating video,
print, and sound has rapidly come into its own. In combination with
sophisticated software packages, these computer systems have moved into
increasing use in the teleproduction industry, where they can be made to perform
a variety of tasks, including the creation of educational multimedia CD-ROMs for
interactive training. Acquiring a digital video computer editing lab makes it
possible to assign students digital video experiments in four current courses:
Video Techniques, Video Production, Electronic Media Systems, and Informational
Video Design. Through these courses, students are learning the technical and
methodological processes by which video images are conceived, captured, and
edited temporally using analog tape processes. With the digital lab in place for
experiments, students are able to experience for themselves how transforming
analog video to digital form makes possible highly complex manipulations
performed rapidly and with perfectly controllable precision, control of
variations of almost any image parameter through software, layering of images
and sounds in multiple generations without quality degradation, and design of
variations without destruction of prior versions.
