Traditional methods for characterizing defects in semiconductors are not
entirely adequate at the VLSI/ULSI level of integration. SIMS coupled with
defect decoration by a SIMS-sensitive element is proposed as a complementary
method. The objectives of this Phase I project are: (1) to determine how well
SIMS can detect oxygen precipitates, dislocation loops, and stacking faults in
silicon when a SIMS-sensitive element is used to decorate the defects; and (2)
to determine the quantitative relationship between the SIMS measurement of the
decorative element and the defect density and size. The primary decorative
element to be studied is fluorine.
