The PI will continue his work on glacial/interglacial changes in water
chemistry, productivity and biogenic accumulation rates in eastern tropical
Indian Ocean. Benthic foraminiferal stable isotope and Cd/Ca data from a depth
transect of cores on Exmouth Plateau will provide direct record of chemistry of
deep and intermediate waters. The record of climate-mediated changes will be
extended back to 130K. y. The project will be carried out in collaboration with
Dr. H. Veeh from Flinders University, Australia.
