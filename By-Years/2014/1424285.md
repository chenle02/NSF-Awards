This award provides support for committee deliberations and consultations with
the geochronology producer and consumer communities during the Goldschmidt
Conference and Geological Society of America Meeting in 2014. The goal is to
document the intellectual and technical goals of geochronology stakeholders and
translate those aspirations into suggestions that NSF's Division of Earth
Sciences can consider in prioritizing funding initiatives.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed meetings will allow community input into
defining the areas of potential priority support for geochronology, identify
gaps in the requirements of geochronologic consumers, and forecast the training
and education needs of the next generation of scientists. Information gathered
during these consultations will be compiled by the steering committee and
consolidated in a report, including findings and recommendations, with an
expected publication date of December, 2014.
