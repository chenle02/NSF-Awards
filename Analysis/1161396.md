The main thrust of this project is to further the understanding of the long-time
behavior of solutions to dispersive equations with broken symmetries.
Specifically, the principal investigator considers global well-posedness,
scattering, soliton formation, and finite-time blowup questions for equations
such as the following: nonlinear Schrodinger outside nontrapping domains, Gross-
Pitaevskii, nonlinear Schrodinger with combined focusing and defocusing
nonlinearities, generalized Korteweg-de Vries. The common feature of these
equations is that each has one or more broken symmetries such as spatial-
translation, scaling, or Galilei invariance. By this is meant that, while the
solution can concentrate at arbitrary positions in space (or length scales or
frequency locations), the evolution depends nontrivially on the position (or
scale or frequency location) of concentration. One of the remarkable new
phenomena that can occur in this setting is that minimizing sequences of
solutions to an equation with broken symmetries can converge to a solution of
the same equation but in a different geometry, or even to a solution of an
entirely different equation.

The partial differential equations to be investigated in this project arise as
effective models in various areas of physics, such as models for waves in
shallow water, laser light in Kerr media, Bose-Einstein gases in a trap, and
superconductors. While they are oversimplified models for engineering purposes,
the study of these examples allows one to focus on the new phenomenology that
arises when symmetries are broken. Stability of results under such perturbations
is essential to make a meaningful connection to real-world systems; indeed,
engineering limitations mean that real-world systems never have perfect
symmetry. Conversely, failure of stability implies that computer simulations
cannot be relied upon to accurately predict experimental phenomena.
