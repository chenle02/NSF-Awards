This award funds a research planning workshop on geometric uncertainty in motion
planning, to be held June 15-17, 1992 at the USC Marine Science Center on
Catalina Island in California. The organizers are Profs. Ken Goldberg and Ari
Requicha of the University of Southern California and Matt Mason of Carnegie-
Mellon University. Robotic operations in most practical settings must cope with
uncertainties arising from sensor noise, control error, mechanical tolerances,
and incomplete or inaccurate models of the environment. Effective motion-
planning methods are critical to successful robotic implementations. Researchers
from academia, government, and industry laboratories will come together to
review past work, work-in-progress, and limitations and alternatives to existing
theory that suggest priorities for future research.//
