Single-chip processor speeds are increaasing at a tremendous rate, providing raw
processing power that is rapidly approaching that of mainframe computers.
Unfortunately, external memory speeds are not exhibiting the same high rate of
increase, and in high-performance single-chip processors external memory
references are becoming a serious performance bottleneck. One way to reduce the
impact of memory latency on performance is to incorporate architectural I/O
queues between the processor and external memory. Analysis of a processor that
employs such I/O queues (the PIPE processor) in its processor-memory interface
indicates that these queues can and do provide significant performance
improvements. However, the studies done so far have only looked at the
effectiveness of I/O queues on scientific programs. The goal of this research is
to more fully evaluate the overall effectiveness of I/O queues by generating a
wide spectrum of benchmark programs and analyzing their execution on the PIPE
simulator. These new benchmark programs will be produced by either creating a
new optimizing compiler for the PIPE architecture that is capable of taking full
advantage of the I/O queues, or by modifying the output of the compiler written
for the ZS-1, a commercially available product that employs architectural queues
similar to those used by the PIPE processor.
