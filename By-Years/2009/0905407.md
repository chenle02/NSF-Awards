This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is widely recognized that current
wireless spectrum policy has been an impediment to the continued growth of high-
capacity wireless networks. This project is investigating the consequences of
lifting current restrictions on spectrum allocation and ownership, and allowing
for extensive spectrum markets for allocating spectrum across locations, times
and diverse applications. Various market structures that may emerge in such a
setting are being studied using multi-disciplinary techniques including ideas
from micro-economics, optimization theory and wireless networking. A key issue
being explored is how to define the spectrum assets that will be traded in such
a market taking into account both the interference among different users of
wireless spectrum and the performance of the resulting market mechanisms. This
results in a characterization of the trade-offs, in terms of efficiency and
complexity of different asset definitions and market mechanisms. These results
provide new insights into market-based allocation for wireless spectrum.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results disseminated via publications could help
facilitate a transition to new market structures that may lower the barriers to
entry into the wireless services market thereby facilitating competition and the
introduction of new services. The infusion of the cross-disciplinary ideas
developed through this project into graduate classes also broadens the training
of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
