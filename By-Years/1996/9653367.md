The modern workplace needs more mathematically and technologically literate
graduates in introductory college mathematics and calculus than it is receiving.
To address this need, a consortium of five New Mexico community colleges and the
state's mathematics association of two-year colleges created the New Mexico
Initiative for Math Reform. The project is designed to help improve student
learning in introductory college mathematics and calculus through mathematics
reform and technology. Classroom intervention is being achieved by increasing
and continuing the professional development of regional mathematics faculty
member in the ways of mathematics reform and use of computer classrooms to
implement reform. The method of operation is the recursive application of
sessions and workshops in which the participants, after acquiring and honing the
techniques of mathematics reform, fan out across the region and host their own
workshops. This iteration of workshops ensures an "exponential delivery" of the
material. The region to be serviced is New Mexico and adjacent areas of its
bordering states. The partners are the Albuquerque Technical Vocational
Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, New Mexico State University at
Alamogordo, New Mexico State University at Dona Ana, University of New Mexico at
Valencia, San Juan Community College, and one professional organization, New
Mexico Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges. The impact is on the
students of introductory college mathematics and calculus. The project has the
potential of reaching every such student in the New Mexican region. The project
is being evaluated with the aid of an outside investigator both formatively and
summatively. The results of the project are being disseminated by the
participants themselves through their own workshops, by presentations to
professional organizations such as the American Association of Two Year
Colleges, and by publications in scholarly journals.
