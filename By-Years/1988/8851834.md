This project introduces computer science students to a laboratory environment
where they can master the concepts of data communications. The equipment in this
data communications lab includes four (4) microcomputers that are configured for
several network connections: a modem connection and telephone system simulator
that offer typical "dial-up" connections between units; a terminal connection
that allows simulation of a computer terminal - host interface; an Ethernet
configuration that provides high speed networking using coaxial cable. These
equipment configurations, along with some special monitoring equipment and
software, allow students to gain hands-on experience in data communications. The
experiments that students can perform in such an environment can only be carried
on in a dedicated laboratory of the type developed for this project. This award
is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
