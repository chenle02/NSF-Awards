The PIs will organize a workshop that brings together members and stakeholders
of the integrative Structure Determination Federation (iSDF), a new entity that
is envisioned as a network of model and data resources that contribute to
structural biology. The proposed workshop is aimed at initiating engagement of
diverse experimental data and structural model communities in order to plan for
an interoperating network of model and data repositories. The workshop builds
upon three years? effort on building blocks required for developing coordinated
network of structural biology resources. This earlier effort stems from an
action in 2014 by wwPDB to create an Integrative/Hybrid Methods task force which
had, as one of its key recommendations, to create a federated system of model
and data archives. The outcome of the workshop is a set of requirements for
creating well-aligned data standards and protocols for efficient data exchange
among participating repositories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
supported by the National Science Foundation Public Access Initiative which is
managed by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure on behalf of the
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
