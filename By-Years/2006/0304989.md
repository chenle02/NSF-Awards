This research project is devoted to the theory and applications of variational
analysis, an active area in applied mathematics primarily concerned with
optimization-related problems. It also applies variational techniques to the
study of a broad range of problems that may not be of a variational nature.
Since nonsmooth structures frequently and naturally appear in analysis and
optimization, constructions and techniques of generalized differentiation lie at
the heart of variational analysis and its applications. The project will mainly
deal with developing the basic theory of variational analysis and generalized
differentiation, with applications to important problems in optimization,
control, stability, mechanics, and economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimal
decisions are required in various activities, including high-performance
computing, manufacturing, environment and global change, etc. Variational
analysis concerns mathematical methods of optimization that play a crucial role
in many applications to complex systems in engineering, economics, and other
areas of modern science and technology. This research project will focus on the
development and application of efficient mathematical techniques for discovering
optimal solutions in systems with complex structures. It particularly involves
developing new methods of optimal control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the
Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences as part of the
Mathematical Sciences Priority Area.&lt;br/&gt;
