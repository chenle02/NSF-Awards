Teachers Assisting Students to Excel in Learning Mathematics (TASEL-M) has been
developed by a partnership that includes California State University-Fullerton,
the Orange County Department of Education, Orange Unified School District,
Fullerton Joint Union High School District, and Garden Grove Unified School
District. TASEL-M is a standards-based, data-driven program designed to improve
students' academic performance in mathematics by giving their teachers the
knowledge and tools to accurately diagnose students' deficiencies, assess their
progress, adjust the curriculum and pedagogy, and transform the departmental
culture to maximize student learning in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
partnership seeks to improve the mathematics performance of 14,000 students
(approximately 70% of these students are from underrepresented minority groups)
at four low-performing high schools and seven feeder middle schools. TASEL-M
focuses on these students' ninety mathematics teachers, roughly one-third of
whom have emergency or supplemental credentials and neither majored or minored
in mathematics. Strategies employed to raise student achievement include: using
data to get results; improving classroom assessment; teacher coaching and
mentoring; and increasing pedagogical content knowledge. The nature and form of
the comprehensive professional development activities are expected to change
administrative practice in the school and in the classroom, effecting a cultural
change that creates a sustainable climate of improvement and
achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
