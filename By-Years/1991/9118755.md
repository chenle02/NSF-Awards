The objective in this study is to investigate the modes of emplacement of lava
flows in the giant Tertiary-age flood basalt province of the Columbia River
plateau. Also planned is research that should enable an estimate to be made of
the amount of degassing that occurred during the extrusion of one or two
selected large lava flows. In addition to gaining new insights into flood basalt
volcanism, knowledge of discharge rates, eruptive styles, and volatile budgets
of the magmas will be crucial to assessing the environmental impacts of this
end-member style of volcanic activity. The PIs are testing methods of diagnosing
flow surface morphologies, vesicle distribution patterns, and internal flow
structures of the lavas. They also will be making parallel studies on the
characteristics of vent structures and feeder dikes to gain additional
information on discharge rates.
