This work will continue nuclear theory research relevant to heavy-ion
collisions at intermediate and high energies. The topics include developing a
stochastic treatment of quantum propagators, string model simulations of ultra-
relativistic nuclear collisions and quasi-classical approximations of the
quantum Liouville equations.
