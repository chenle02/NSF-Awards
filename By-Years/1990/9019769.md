This project will create a high field ultra-long pulse magnet laboratory. The
laboratory expects to operate nondestructive magnets in the 60-70 Tesla range
with a "flat top" time at maximum field of more than 0.5 second. This doubles
the field strength presently available in DC magnets, in a pulsed system with a
duration of sufficient length that traditional experiments can be performed in a
straightforward manner and metallic samples have time to thermally relax from
eddy current heating. The magnets will serve the ongoing research programs of
the three principal investigators in High Tc superconductors, Quantum Hall
devices, and low dimensional organic conductors, and will be available to
industrial collaborators, and other users as well. The magnets will have a
strong impact on materials science, electronics, and many new technologies as
well as on the future development of higher field magnets. The high stored
energy source at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (200 MW, 400 MJ in a
flywheel generator set) will be made available for this project.
