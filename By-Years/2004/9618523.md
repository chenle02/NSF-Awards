Bieging, John AST 96-18523 Dr. Bieging will study the process of mass loss in
evolved stars of intermediate mass, both red giant stars and stars evolving
beyond to become planetary nebulae. His observational program takes advantage of
a variety of techniques and instrumentation to obtain a full picture of the gas
and dust in the circumstellar envelopes of these stars, with a particular focus
on the source IRC+10216. The analysis of molecular spectroscopy in the mm-
wavelengths will reveal details about the chemical and physical structure of the
circumstellar envelope and the process of mass loss. Observations in the mid-IR
for a sample of stars evolving from the red giant to the planetary nebulae stage
will also allow the determination of the dust distribution, density, and
temperature in the stellar envelopes. ***
