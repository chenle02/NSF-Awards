The research emphasized detailed studies of elastic, and superelastic
collisions of electrons with laser excited atoms, including measurements of
azimuthal effects. These are a sensitive probe of the details of the
interactions between the free and bound electron during the collision. Atomic
beam recoil spectroscopy is exploited to perform absolute cross section
measurements. The experimental geometry enables the study of ionization of laser
excited Na, including the angular distribution of the scattered electrons. In
addition, earlier polarizability measurements will be extended to the study of
atomic clusters of up to order five for alkali metals and alkali halides.
