This project seeks to fully analyze and interpret sediment physical property
measurements, through integration of sediment microstructure observations, new
experimental in situ and laboratory velocity data, and model representations
based on rock physics theory. This work is essential to understanding how
laboratory measurements of sediment physical properties are related to in situ
logging measurements. The PI's previous work indicates that substantial
discrepancies may exist between these two types of measurements, and that
existing models of sediment compaction and porosity reduction may be inadequate
to explain these observed differences. This research should allow better
interpretation of laboratory and in situ data, and should provide new insights
to diagenetic processes, cyclic sedimentation, and seismic reflection data. In
addition, the project will potentially have significant impact on ODP (Ocean
Drilling Program) shipboard physical property data collection procedures.
