The objective of this project is to provide new information on the cellar
mechanisms that explain the ability of many 'cold blooded' animals to tolerate
conditions of low (or no) oxygen and low temperature. The ability of many
vertebrate animals to withstand environmental conditions that are completely
incompatible with human life has intrigued scientist and laymen for centuries.
We now know that some fish, amphibians (i.e., frog larvae) and reptiles
(turtles, for example) are capable of surviving days, weeks, or even months
buried in the mud at the bottom of frozen ponds, even though there may be
essentially no oxygen present at all. While some species remain in a state of
hibernation, during which their metabolism virtually comes to a halt, many other
animals remain fully active at body temperatures that would be quickly fatal to
humans. The mechanisms by which these animals tolerate such extreme conditions
are very poorly understood. The goal of this project, then, is to begin to
understand the fundamental mechanisms by which animals that are in many ways
similar to humans are able to function under conditions so foreign to our
existence. The key to this understanding may be differences in the way that
substances such as calcium and potassium are permitted to move through the walls
of cells in crucial organs, such as the brain and heart. If so, it may
ultimately be possible to identify drugs that would expand the resistance of
humans to extreme environmental conditions.
