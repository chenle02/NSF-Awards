Professor Asmar's research project concerns the applications of transference
methods in analysis. The emphasis is on finding dimension independent bounds on
the strong and weak type norms of maximal operators and other singular integral
operators. The method and applications under study involve the kinds of
operators or functions in infinite dimensional spaces which occur in the
analysis of the partial differential equations of mathematical physics. This
includes, for example, the equations of electromagnetism and fluid dynamics.
Knowing that these are bounded operators is often an important first step in
studying solutions to these equations.
