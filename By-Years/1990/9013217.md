The objective of the proposed study is to continue research on the physical
mechanisms of Quaternary glaciations. Simple models of these mechanisms will be
developed further, including box models of the paleooceanic circulation, in
addition to the previously-modeled radiation balance, ice-sheet mass balance and
hydrologic cycle. Model results will be compared in the spectral and temporal
domain with marine and continental paleoclimatic data, including the Vostok ice-
core records and marine records dated by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The
previous research on the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere will also
be extended, emphasizing intraseasonal oscillations in the global atmosphere.
This research will proceed through theoretical studies with a hierarchy of
simple and intermediate models, observational studies of the longest upper-air
datasets, and the UCLA GCM. The results of the study will be valuable in helping
us to narrow the gap in our understanding between paleoclimate and more the
recent climate.
