The investigator continues working with fluid and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
equations to assess turbulence in solar phenomena such as the extended solar
corona, solar wind, magnetosphere, and interstellar medium. Turbulence plays a
critical role in coronal physics leading to the origin of the solar wind,
mediation of space weather by energy transfer through the heliospheric plasma
and energetic particles, and turbulent diffusion of energetic particles
impacting the outer heliosphere structure. The investigator further elucidates
basic properties of MHD turbulence. He integrates MHD and fluid simulation
techniques, transport theory with numerical implementations, analytical theory
of turbulence and particle diffusion, and related analysis and interpretation
based on spacecraft observations.
