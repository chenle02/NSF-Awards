This project involves observations of the near infrared solar corona both prior
to and during the total solar eclipse of 11 July 1991, in an attempt to
understand the relative contributions of electron scattering, dust scattering
and dust thermal emission near the Sun. The observations will be carried out in
collaboration with scientists at the Institute for Astronomy at the University
of Hawaii. Instrumentation for this effort is currently being developed at the
Institute by team members, and features a system utilizing coronagraph
techniques, designed to allow measurements to be made outside the period of
total eclipse. Dr. MacQueen is an expert on coronagraphs, and this information
is likely to lead to a better understanding of the interplanetary medium.
