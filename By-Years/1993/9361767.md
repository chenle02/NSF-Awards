9361767 Dwyer This proposal deals with the development of unique "hyphenated"
technology which will interface Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC,SEC) or other
forms of High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC with Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). This unique technology, along with accompanying
software, will greatly benefit polymer chemists in their analysis and
interpretation of polymer composition and structure, a prerequisite for
optimizing and controlling the polymerization reaction itself, with the goal of
producing the best possible properties form the chemical stern. ***
