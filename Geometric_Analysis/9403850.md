9403850 Smillie The research entails the study of the dynamics of the family of
polynomial diffeomorphisms of complex euclidean space of 2- dimensions which is
to parallel the 1-dimensional case. The techniques are drawn from the areas of
smooth ergodic theory, pluripotential theory and the theory of currents. New
insights into the dynamics of real and complex diffeomorphisms are expected. The
research is related to current research in fractals and chaos. ***
