Plant organelle, mitochondria and chloroplasts, contain their own genomes. For
unknown reasons, these genomes have a high frequency of recombination. The
multiplicity of differently organized DNA molecules isolated from these
organelles, consequently, was initially confusing. Dr. Jeffery Palmer is
investigating the molecular mechanism and evolutionary ramifications of this
high frequency recombination in plant genomes. His experimental systems range
from lower plants to flowering plants.
