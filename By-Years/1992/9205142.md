This study will conduct paleomagnetic analyses of lower Paleozoic-aged rocks in
Britain in order to define the movement of Eastern Avalonia and closure history
of the Iapetus Ocean during the Silurian and Ordovician. A broad picture of the
paleogeographic setting of Eastern Avalonia has been recently developed and this
work will provide much needed constraints. The results will be of broad
significance to plate tectonic reconstructions of the Appalachian - Caleonide
orogen. They will also provide additional criteria for the recognition of
remagnetization phenomena, which is of considerable importance to geophysicists
interested in tectonic problems.
