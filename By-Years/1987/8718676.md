Statement on the basic and applied aspects of research to be conducted with the
support of NSF Grant BSR-871876, Rollin C. Richmond, PI. The nature and extent
of genetic variation in natural populations and its adaptive significance are
central questions in population genetics. The use of recombinant DNA
technologies allows population geneticists to specify precisely the amount and
kind of variation which are found in natural populations at specific gene loci.
Genetic variation in DNA sequences coding for the structure and regulation of
the esterase-6 gene in fruit flies (Drosophila) will be assessed by determining
the sequence of esterase-6 genes which specify different forms of the esterase 6
protein. This information will allow a test of predictions about the genetic
structure of natural populations and the significance of genetic variation in
the structure of enzymes. The esterase-6 gene specifies the structure of an
enzyme which is involved in regulating the reproductive behavior of female fruit
flies and may also be involved in the mechanisms by which fruit flies and other
insects develop resistance to some classes of insecticides. Information about
the structure of this enzyme may contribute to our understanding of the basic
reproductive processes of insects and may eventually allow the design of
insecticidal agents which are specifically targeted and less likely to be
thwarted by the development of resistant strains of insects.
