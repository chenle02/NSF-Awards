Nitrogen fixation by humans, for agricultural and industrial use, has increased
tenfold since the beginning of the 20th century. This profound perturbation to
the nitrogen cycle has revealed that the links between the global nitrogen cycle
and the biosphere are more complex than previously thought. To improve the
understanding of these links at the global scale, investigators will develop a
new tracer for the nitrogen cycle that exploits natural co-variations in 14N14N,
14N15N, and 15N15N.

These three isotopologues of N2 comprise a tracer that is fundamentally
sensitive to processes that alter N-N bonds such as nitrogen fixation and N2
production. Through a combination of laboratory measurements, field
measurements, and experiments involving microbes, investigators will
characterize the basic biogeochemistry of these species that is relevant to
atmospheric and oceanic settings. These measurements will test whether N2
triple-isotopologue analysis can be applied more broadly to constrain nitrogen
cycling on local and global scales. The scientific findings will be disseminated
during conference presentations and in peer-reviewed publications.

This project will also integrate research and education through the training of
a female graduate student from a traditionally underrepresented group,
supporting her training in a biogeochemistry short course. In addition, a series
of short animations about nitrogen will be produced in partnership with the
popular PHD TV YouTube channel. They will highlight how nitrogen has played a
larger role in society than is often unrecognized, weaving together human
history, biogeochemistry, and climate science in an approachable comic-animation
medium that has become the hallmark of PHD TV.
