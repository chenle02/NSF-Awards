This project is a study of the structure of the mitotic chromosome of animal
cells. For this work the investigator will use a unique combination of
micromanipulation and biochemical techniques. Biophysical force measurements
will be used to assay biochemically-introduced structural changes in mitotic
chromosomes. In this way the role of specific types of molecules in defining
mitotic chromosome structure can be quantitatively studied. Preliminary results
indicate that DNA itself provides the structural integrity of the folded mitotic
chromosome. These results challenge the classical protein scaffold model of
mitotic chromosome structure, and indicate the value of this approach in ruling
out specific models of chromosome structure. The first objective of this project
is further study of DNA connectivity in the mitotic chromosome in this way, and
to extend these measurements to Xenopus chromosomes. Additional enzyme
experiments will study the role of RNA and protein in mitotic chromosome
structure. A second objective is to compare the physical properties of Xenopus
chromosomes from cells with chromatids reconstituted using Xenopus egg extracts.
A third objective is to characterize the interchromosome filaments observed when
chromosomes are removed from cells during mitosis, and in particular to quantify
their DNA content. The question of whether or not there is a contiguous protein
skeleton inside the mitotic chromosome is a basic and open topic in cell
biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the relation of reconstituted
chromosomes to chromosomes in cells is extremely important given the general
assumption that the former system is an accurate model of chromosomes. Finally,
putting the question of existence of mitotic interchromosome filaments on solid
ground will demand new thinking about many assumptions about mitotic chromosome
structure. Broader impacts of this research will be the development of new
biophysical techniques (nanonewton-scale force measurement, microfluidic
enzymatic treatments) for the study of chromosome structure. Along with this,
the proposed activities will focus on research education for Ph.D. students,
combining physics and biology. There is currently a national shortage of young
scientists with this kind of training. This project will therefore uniquely
strengthen the scientific personnel and technique pools in this growth
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
