Proposal No.: 9732345 PI: Amiridis University: U of SC Columbia ABSTRACT Funding
is requested in this proposal for the establishment of a REU site in the
Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of South Carolina. The
objective of the proposed site would be to provide chemical engineering
undergraduate students with research experience obtained from projects exploring
Novel Technologies in Pollution Prevention. This is considered one of the core
competence areas of the Department of Chemical Engineering at USC with ten
faculty members having active research programs associated with it. Each student
will be assigned a faculty member as his/her research mentor. It is further
anticipated that due to the significant interactions among the faculty the
students will be grouped into larger research teams in three areas: Catalytic,
Separation and Electrochem Technologies. In addition to the individual research
projects, the proposed REU program will include several group activities for the
participants. The goal of these activities will be to enrich the participants'
educational and research experience and facilitate collaboration and long-term
relationships between them. The proposed group activities include tours of
industrial sites, a weekly seminar series, and workshops on ethics in science
and engineering and graduate studies, welcome and farewell symposia, and social
activities. Exclusively non-USC undergraduate students will participate in the
program. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting minorities from
designated "target" schools. It is expected that the program will have a long-
term impact on the participants: it will encourage them to continue their
studies and seek research careers in chemical engineering; it will assist them
to realize the employment and research opportunities available in chemical
engineering aspects of environmental research; and it will provide an enriching
experience by exposing them to a non-classroom faculty-student inte raction.
