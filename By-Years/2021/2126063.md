The U.S. National Academy of Sciences will plan and manage the 2021 USNC-URSI
International Travel Fellowship Program. The U.S. National Committee for the
International Union of Radio Science (USNC-URSI) will support eight U.S. early
career scientists to attend the International Union of Radio Scienceâ€™s General
Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS). The committee will seek a diverse
pool of applicants and will place a special emphasis on women and
underrepresented groups. Social media will be used to form and promote a network
of early career U.S. scholars interested in international collaborations and
experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academy of Sciences is the U.S.
adhering body to the International Union of Radio Science (URSI), and it manages
this relationship through the USNC-URSI. The program will be evaluated, and the
findings will be shared with the committee and the National Science
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
