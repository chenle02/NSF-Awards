9306872 Eissenstat In a range of ecosystems, there is greater annual biomass
productionbelow ground than aboveground. In spite of the magnitude of root
biomass production, there is extremely little information on factors influencing
root death. Root carbon costs can be divided into that used for root
construction and that used for root maintenance. Maintenance respiration can
exceed the total cost of root construction in as little as two to three weeks,
whereas roots of many species live an average of eight months or longer. Thus,
plants experience a tradeoff between having long-lived roots and paying high
lifetime maintenance costs vs. shorter lived roots that need to be constructed
more often but with lower lifetime maintenance costs. We predict that species
with small diameter roots of high specific root length (SRL; root length/mass)
may have higher maintenance respiration costs than species of low SRL, which may
in turn affect root- life span. Furthermore, when maintenance respiration
increases, as caused by increases in soil temperature, root- life span may
decrease. Root maintenance respiration and root life-span of individual roots
and whole-root systems in pots will be examined to test these prediction in a
combination of controlled laboratory under conditions where soil moisture, soil
temperature and SRL are varied. This work has important implications for better
understanding the effects of climate change on global CO2 sustainable
agriculture and plant growth in general. ***
