With increasing network connectivity available, data generated by embedded
sensor devices have been effectively shared in many collaborative applications,
such as sensor data collection, environmental monitoring, and wearable
computing. Data sharing has been a research topic for many years, with hundreds
of related projects. In contrast, the concept of energy sharing among multiple
embedded sensor devices has captured very little attention. Until now, energy
has been predominately harvested and consumed locally in a single embedded
sensor device. In this project, we attempt to lay a foundation for energy
sharing among sustainable sensor devices. The outcome of this research will
constitute a significant advance in the development of theoretical foundations
and practical algorithms for designing and improving energy efficiency of
sustainable sensor networks. The broader impact of this work shall be amplified
by (i) improving course development and student training; (ii) increasing
research participation of minorities, women, and Native Americans; (iii)
facilitating international dissemination of research findings; (iv) raising
interest in technology among K-12 students and other under-represented minority
groups; and (v) fostering interdisciplinary collaborations.
