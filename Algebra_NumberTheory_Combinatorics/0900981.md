In algebraic geometry, there is an important correspondence between commutative
graded algebras and projective schemes. Noncommutative projective geometry
generalizes aspects of this correspondence to the noncommutative setting, for
example by using the category of graded modules over the ring as a substitute
for an actual geometric space. Noncommutative projective curves are well-
understood, so noncommutative surfaces and special kinds of threefolds are the
major subjects of current interest. A major goal of this project is to study
surfaces in the birational classes of noncommutative projective planes,
especially those of Sklyanin type.

Noncommutativity is the phenomenon of two operations giving different results
when performed in a different order. An important example in physics is the fact
that the position and momentum operators do not commute; this is the part of the
mathematical formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle. The subject of
noncommutative geometry attempts to give some geometric intuition behind
collections of noncommuting operations which are closed under addition and
multiplication (these are called rings). Then the study of points, lines, and
other such geometric concepts can help to illuminate our understanding of such
rings.
