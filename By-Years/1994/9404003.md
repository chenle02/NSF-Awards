9404003 van Zee This is an individual Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology award. The applicant received her Ph.D. from University of Munich in
Germany. For her Ph.D. thesis research, she focused on the cellular machinery
required for nuclear protein importing mammalian cells. She now plans to expand
her scientific experience to plant biology. She will carry out her postdoctoral
fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Tony Chen at Oregon State
University. The proposed research is entitled "A strategy for selecting novel
Arabidopsis thaliana mutants in abscisic acid signal transduction pathways".
