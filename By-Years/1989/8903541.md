The objective of this research is an intensive study of the crust across the
physiographic boundary of the Colorado Plateau. This project involves a
"piggyback" deep reflection experiment to utilize the same sources that the U.S.
Geological Survey will generate for its 250 km refraction profile on the
Colorado Plateau in 1989. The five areas of research include: 1) a P-wave
structure interpretation of vertical incidence seismic data across the edge of
the Colorado Plateau emphasizing the lower crust and Moho, 2) an analysis of fan
shots to image the Moho using source-receiver offsets beyond the critical
distance of PmP, 3) a study of wide-angle profiles collected by the piggyback
experiment, 4) analysis of Laramide and late Cenozoic deformational structures
observed in the upper crust and 5) analysis and interpretation of 3-component
data from the piggyback experiment with an emphasis on crustal composition
derived from P and S velocities. The upcoming U.S. Geological Survey refraction
experiment provides a unique opportunity to acquire and study a data set of
excellent quality and close trace spacing across the Colorado Plateau margin, a
boundary that separates the highly extended Basin and Range province from the
stable relatively undeformed Colorado Plateau.
