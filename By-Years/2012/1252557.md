The grant funds travel to a meeting of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) researchers to promote synergies between the two fields.
Advances in several AI areas, such as data mining, natural language
understanding and constraint solving, have become ready for application in many
domains, including SE. SE as an area for AI -- automating the activities of
programmers -- is still a long-term vision for AI. SE goals, such as component-
based, evolvable software containing valid world models and correct code, are
important to AI as they are to other fields. The workshop will explore synergies
between the fields and serve as a planning meeting for future interactions.
