This study proposes to utilize new molecular approaches to recover, amplify,
and sequence DNA from dense deposits of permafrost remains in Alaska and the
Yukon which represent unique samples of the faunal inhabitants of the area over
the past 40,000 years. The PIs propose a small, innovate and experimental
approach which has a high possibility of obtaining data that can address long
standing questions in polar biology including population movements, extinctions,
and biotic adaptations. The basic research techniques involve using ancient DNA
techniques to extract and characterize preserved DNA in permafrost stabilized
specimens.
