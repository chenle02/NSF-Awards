With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports research by Dr. Steven P. Nolan of the Chemistry Department,
University of New Orleans, for studies to determine bond strengths in
organometallic compounds. Metal-ligand bond enthalpies will be determined
primarily for carbonyl and phosphine bonds for compounds involved in homogeneous
catalysis. Novel mono- and bi-dentate phosphines and phosphites of iron and
ruthenium, and ruthenium and rhodium carbonyls will be studied. In addition some
metal-carbon, metal-hydrogen, and metal-silicon bond enthalpies will be
investigated. Thermodynamic data provides a quantitative basis for understanding
reactivity in reactions, including catalytic reactions. The feasibility of new
reactions can be predicted and design of new catalysts can be optimized. The
available thermodynamic data on organometallic compounds is limited. This
research will provide basic information on the enthalpy for breaking metal-
carbon and metal-phosphorus bonds in compounds related to those found in
important industrial catalysts.
