Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0341003&lt;br/&gt;Development Materials
for Using mMPS in the Undergraduate Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;Xavier
University&lt;br/&gt;Michael Goldweber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates
a new hardware simulator, mMPS, to support a long-term, multi-assignment,
layered system implementation project for courses in operating systems. It also
creates both a Student Guide and an Instructor's Guide that together provide a
turnkey system for instructors using the simulator. The Student Guide describes
the simulated hardware and contains a tutorial for using mMPS's GUI. It also
contains detailed descriptions of the overall OS design and of each layer and
assignment. The Instructor's Guide describes the purpose of each of the layers
or assignments, which OS concepts are needed by the students for each and
includes appropriate test files, and contains a detailed solution for each
layer/assignment. With this support, students can finish a course with a
completely student-written operating system that supports virtual memory and
multi-tasking.
