This award supports further development of an instrument based on use of a
Fabry-Perot for cavity-enhanced spectroscopy of biological molecules. The
instrument will use an extremely high-finesse optical cavity to enhance the
sensitivity of laser absorption spectroscopy, in a configuration that allows the
study of molecules in liquid solvents or in phospholipid membranes. This
approach has the potential to be able to provide information about the dynamic
behavior of individual biological molecules, an important theme in modern
biology. The device will be tested using bacteriochlorophyll, one component of
the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center. Although much is known about the
dynamics of electron transfer and the atomic structure of such reaction centers,
the information comes from studies of the bulk properties of large numbers of
molecules. Information about dynamics of individual molecules has the potential
to provide substantial improvement in understanding of the interrelationship of
structure and function in the reaction center. The broader impacts of this
research reflect both the participation of graduate and undergraduate students
from a wide range of academic disciplines and, as a result of the biophysical
research activities that the instrument will make possible, high visibility in
the quantum optics and optical metrology communities. This visibility is likely
to encourage greater technical cross-fertilization between these fields and the
biological sciences. An acceleration of the development of highly sophisticated
optical instrumentation for biological experiments could have substantial impact
on the future progress of the technology used in biological research.
