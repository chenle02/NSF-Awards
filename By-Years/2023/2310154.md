This project at Minnesota Duluth promotes progress in fundamental neutrino
physics and particle astrophysics. The major part of the work supports the
design and installation of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The
experiment aims to resolve mysteries about the matter vs. antimatter asymmetry
of the universe, search for beyond-the-standard-model physics effects related to
proton decay and dark matter, and measure neutrinos from a galactic supernova.
These are among the highest priority scientific goals in particle physics.
Undergraduate and M.S. students trained on this project, like recent students,
go on to technical careers in technology, energy, and defense, some pursuing
advanced degrees along the way.

The two PIs and the supported students contribute to the project goals in
complementary ways, including sustained leadership positions. One is working on
sensitivity analyses for the DUNE oscillation experiment focused on the value
added by proposed Near Detector designs. The group is leading the inclusion of
field-leading model systematic uncertainties drawn from MINERvA, operating
experiments such as NOvA, T2K, and SBN, and recent theory developments. The
other PI has a major role in the installation of computing and electronics
infrastructure. These are needed for the full experiment, but a subset are
designed especially to buffer data to enable non-beam analysis such as supernova
neutrinos and proton decay measurements. This project also supports continuing
effort on the MINERvA and NOvA experiments. The analysis and operational
activities support completion of those experimentâ€™s scientific missions but
simultaneously are an intellectual investment in DUNE.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
