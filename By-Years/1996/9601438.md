9601438 Bauer This award partially supports a meeting on photosynthetic
prokaryotes to be held at Indiana University in October 1996. A variety of
topics including ecology, diversity, metabolism, nitrogen fixation,
photosynthesis and respiration will be presented by experts in their fields.
Since the meeting will be small, there will be opportunity for investigators to
exchange ideas and discuss their work in an informal setting. Young
investigators will have a chance to meet and interact with leaders in the field.
