The objective of the research is to study gas phase ethylene polymerizatin over
based catalysts and hgas phase propylene polymerization with Ziegler-Natta
catalysts on Mg Cl2 supports as a function of the pore morphology of these
catalysts. There are six aspects to the proposed research: preparation of
catalysts: active for olefin polymerization on supports with different strength
and morphology; characterization of catalysts: spectroscopic techniques to
analyze the chemistry and structure of the catalyst; kinetics of gas phase
polymerization: measuring and controlling the active site concentration and
specific reaction rate; characterization of polymer produced: to be correlated
with catalyst properties; microscopy of the catalysts before, after, and during
reaction: to study the changing morphology on these catalysts; and modeling of
the kinetics and fragmentation: to relate the dynamic behavior of catalyst and
polymer production.
