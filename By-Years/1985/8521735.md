It is intended in this Phase II of the project to continue and complete the
development of the general formulation of diffraction tomography that was
initiated in Phase I. This formulation is applicable to weak and strongly
scattering objects, to general experimental configurations employing plane, fan
beam or other types of incident wavefields and to applications where the data is
sparse either because of a limited number of experiments (limited views) or
under sampling of the waveforms over the measurement surfaces. The general
formulation will be implemented in software codes on a microprocessor equipped
with an array processor and will be extensively tested in computer simulations
and on experimental data drawn from seismic, electromagnetic, ultrasound and
optical tomographic applications. Major emphasis will be given to applications
for which follow-on funding commitments are obtained. This project is aimed at
developing mathematical and computational techniques for the so called
diffraction tomography. This is a generalized formulation of tomography for
applications involving radiation other than x-rays, such as for example,
ultrasound tomography, optical tomography and geophysical tomography. Earlier
studies in diffraction tomography assumed plane wave illumination of the object
and worked with the linearized version of the wave equation. More recent
approaches, including this one, work with the complex phase of the transmitted
field. Potential applications of this research include ultrasound tomographic
scanners for medical and industrial applications, coherent optical tomographic
scanners for monitoring combustion processes and a host of geophysical
applications including seismic imaging, well-to- well tomography and ocean
acoustic tomography.
