This Phase I SBIR project proposes a field adaptation and evaluation of a
prototype in situ geotechnical testing system for earthquake resistance. The
system is to provide reliable estimates for soil deposits of the in situ cyclic
shear vs strain characteristics needed by dynamic earthquake analyses such as
liquefaction, cyclic degradation and deformation, and undegraded nonlinear
inelastic characteristics. Problems to be addressed include reliably predicting
amplified motions, liquefaction, and deformations of soil deposits - sources of
significant seismic loss. While this area has been advanced considerably,
fundamental improvements in estimating soil characteristics are still greatly
needed. Earthquake-like cyclic loads are to be applied. Tests, however, are to
be conducted in situ with many steps to preserve in situ conditions. Recent
laboratory prototype tests show promise in the proposed approach and the
potential is good to apply it to retrofitting of existing critical constructed
facilities for earthquake resistance and in land use planning for seismically
active areas.
