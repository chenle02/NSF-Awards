A research planning and assessment workshop is planned for January 1987. It will
bring together about twenty-five key researchers who are actively working on
coordinated cooperating multiple robot systems. The specific topics to be
covered include path planning and obstacle avoidance, dynamic modeling, sensory
information and knowledge base systems, control strategies, implementation and
computer languages, role of artificial intelligence, and integration strategies
-- all for multiple robot manipulators.
