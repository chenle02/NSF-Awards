9706326 Evans This project will extend the PIs work on the crystallographic and
thermodynamic properties of the aluminum-free "quadrilateral" amphiboles into
the Al-bearing orthorhombic gedrite series and the monoclinic hornblende series,
both of which occur widely in crystalline rocks. X-ray single crystal structure
refinements will be done on suites of natural samples encompassing a range of
Mg/Fe ratios and Al-contents, prior to and after equilibration at 700o-1000oC
and high pressure. Site scattering and bond length data will be incorporated
with compositional data to provide a description of octahedral and tetrahedral
site order-disorder as a function of temperature. The Gibbs energy of these
complex amphiboles is written to explicitly include the measured configurational
entropy, as well as end-member, reciprocal and reciprocal-ordering terms.
Experimental, thermochemical and natural phase equilibrium data provide
additional constraints. These data allow calculation of phase diagrams for
magmatic and subsolidus systems involving amphiboles and other minerals for
which there are previously developed consistent thermodynamic models.
