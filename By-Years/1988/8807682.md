The recent fabrication of high-quality semiconductor heterostructures has led to
novel and remarkable physics discovered in two-dimensional electron gas systems.
Magneto- transport experiments have shown that resistivity anomalies occur when
the electrons have fractional values for Landau level filling. Subsequent
theoretical studies revealed that the fractional quantum Hall effect is a
manifestation of a new cooperative many-body electron fluid. although most of
the experiments use electrical transport, our recent optical investigations will
lead to a better understanding of the condensed electron state and possibly to
new electron-electron interactions. This work will be an optical study of the
two- dimensional electron system in GaAs quantum wells to temperatures as low as
.05K and dc magnetic fields to 30 tesla. Spectroscopic techniques involve
bandgap emission, adsorption and reflectivity, and inelastic light scattering.
New fiber-optic systems will be implemented for light scattering experiments at
these extrema of temperature and magnetic field.
