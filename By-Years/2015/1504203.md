This award supports a dissertation project focused on traditional ecological
knowledge (TEK) held by people who live and work along the Yukon River in
Alaska. The researcher is interested in how the knowledge held by local people
can improve the decision of fisheries managers. The project will explore how
Federal and State water managers could make better-informed, more relevant
management decisions if they included the traditional ecological knowledge held
by people who live and subsist along the Yukon River. The researcher makes a
strong argument that this research is an investigation of one of the leading
Tribal priorities in the State of Alaska and that research on indigenous
knowledge of fisheries and fish resources could be critical an understanding of
the sustainability of livelihoods and lives of not only indigenous populations
but all peoples in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CoPI, student researcher,
will do ethnographic research through interviews, participant observations, and
open-ended survey methods to gather data on traditional ecological knowledge and
local environmental knowledge in three Yukon River Communities. In addition to
exploring the TEK aspect of the research, the project will collect data that
will feed into the development of a decision-based support tool and mobile cell
phone application (App) that can be used to communicate information among
fishers and to resource managers. In addition, as an indigenous person from a
non-Alaskan Tribe, the student researcher has the potential to provide non-local
indigenous insight into the issue of fisheries management along the Yukon, and
as such, the project not only adds to our understanding of the application of
TEK to environmental management but has the potential to add a decolonized
methodology for social science.
