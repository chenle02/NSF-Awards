This research will advance theoretical understanding of criminal courts by
applying the concepts of court community and decision makers' focal concerns to
the Federal Criminal Justice System (FCJS). Its central working hypothesis is
that differences in federal criminal court communities help account for inter-
district differences in case disposition procedures and outcomes. With few
exceptions, existing quantitative empirical research on the FCJS has focused
only on the sentencing stage. It usually ignores inter-district variation in
disposition procedures and outcomes. As the first empirical, theoretically
oriented study of the FCJS, this study will achieve a second purpose: It will
significantly expand our knowledge of the FCJS by looking at decision stages
prior to sentencing and assessing the nature and causes of inter-district
differences. This research employs analysis of quantitative data and interviews
with FCJS officials. Phase I includes pretest interviews with key decision
makers in a large federal court community and with key staff in the Department
of Justice and quantitative examination of differences in outcomes and
disposition modes by district. Phase II will involve interviews in six districts
selected for variation by size of court and by case disposition techniques and
in Washington, DC. Interviews will be conducted in two stages: The first will
explore decision-making patterns informed by knowledge gained from the phase I
quantitative analysis; in the second, re-interviews in these districts will
focus on questions and hypotheses generated by analysis of the first stage.
