9707568 Lamb Biogeography addresses the influence of earth history on the
diversification of life. Isolation plays a key inceptive role in this
diversification: groups of organisms separated geographically from others assume
their own phylogenetic and biological trajectory. One potential effect of long-
term geographic isolation is the divergence (origin) of unique species that are
restricted or endemic to an isolated area (e.g., marsupials in Australia). In
this research, Lamb and Bauer will examine the role that geologic and climatic
events have played in shaping the extensive regional endemism observed among
lizards in southern Africa. To assess the influence of regional events on lizard
diversity, they will utilize more than 2,000 base pairs of DNA sequence (sampled
from three mitochondrial genes) and a suite of morphological characters to
construct a genealogical or phylogenetic tree (topology) for each of five
different lizard genera. The five different topologies will then be compared for
similarities (congruence) in overall shape in order to identify common patterns
and biogeographic factors. Hypotheses that divergence of these lizard taxa are
linked to geotectonic episodes and paleoclimatic shifts in the early Miocene and
Plio-Pleistocene periods will be tested. The research also will provide
phylogenetic and classification information for several taxa that are poorly
known. Finally, there is substantive involvement of undergraduate students in
almost every phase of the project.
