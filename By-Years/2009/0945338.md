This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
novel textile coating and reading device for positive identification
applications such as anti-counterfeit, textile brand verification, etc. The
basis of this project is to use a layer-by-layer self-assembly process to
control the interface between engineered textile substrates and nanomaterials.
The resulting nanostructured composite materials may display a unique property
that can be detected by a reading device. This technology allows for the precise
control over the deposition of metal nanoparticle materials onto the surface of
natural and synthetic textiles, which can be implemented into standard
industrial processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of
this project will be the potential to provide a technology for positive
identification and anti-counterfeit of textile products, which ranges from the
basic clothing industry to military applications.&lt;br/&gt;
