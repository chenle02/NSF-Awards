Eigenfunction Estimates on Manifolds with Boundary and Applications to Partial
Differential Equations

Abstract of Proposed Research Xiangjin Xu

This project is to study properties of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-
Beltrami operator on compact manifolds with boundary. Either zero Dirichlet or
Neumann boundary data are imposed. Specific topics include L-p estimates,
multiplier problems and convergence phenomena for eigenfunction expansions. Also
bilinear and multilinear eigenfunction estimates for spectral projectors.

Eigenfunction expansions are one of the primary tools in the analysis of
partial differential equations in science and engineering. The results of this
project will provide information that is important for the understanding of many
scientific phenomena.
