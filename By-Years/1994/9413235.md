9413235 Whitman This award supports an integrated, multidisciplinary training
program for graduate and undergraduate students with a focus on microbial
diversity. The research programs of the 22 participating faculty cover a wide
range of problems from identification and isolation of new organisms to analysis
of genetic and biochemical mechanisms at the molecular level. The faculty group
come from the departments of biochemistry, entomology, marine science,
microbiology, and plant pathology. Training arrangements include existing
courses, a new seminar program, a new yearly retreat, and a new summer workshop
that will focus in depth on two different organisms each summer. The workshop
will involve students and faculty from across the nation, and is expected to
have a national impact on training of the next generation of microbial
researchers. This award is also being supported by the Metabolic Biochemistry
Program. ***
