The purpose of this proposal is to introduce microcomputers into Neumann's
biology laboratories and to expand opportunities for independent research on
campus. Presently the students have little experience using microcomputers to
facilitate data collection and analysis in the laboratory. Funds are requested
to purchase five lab stations each comprised of a microcomputer (Apple
Macintosh), an inexpensive analog to digital board (Universal Lab Interface by
Vernier Software), and appropriate transducers (many of which will be adapted
from existing instrumentation). Funds are also requested for sound analysis
software/hardware to interface with the same microcomputers. This equipment will
be used to enrich existing laboratory exercises in physiology, and to develop
new laboratory exercises in human physiology and the animal behavior portion of
ecology. It will also enable students to participate with faculty in ongoing
research programs in animal communication.
