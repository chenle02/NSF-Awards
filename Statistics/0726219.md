An international conference on `Current and Future Trends in Nonparametric
Statistics' will be held October 11-12, 2007. The conference is co-sponsored by
the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. It will feature four plenary
talks by internationally prominent researchers. There will also be eight to
twelve topic-orientic sessions, each session having four invited talks. There
will also be contributed session for junior investigators and graduate students.

Nonparametric statistical methods are methods which avoid unrealistic
assumptions about underlying structures in scientific studies. The advent of
universally-accessible, powerful computing, and also of massive data sets
arising from automated data collection and remote sensing, has brought
nonparametric methods to the forefront of statistical theory and practice. The
goal of the proposed conference is to present some of the most important recent
advances in nonparametric statistics and to discuss future research directions.
The conference is expected to accelerate interactions and collaborations among
researchers in the important area of nonparametric statistics, and thereby lead
to the development of new and more modern methods of nonparametric modeling and
inference.
