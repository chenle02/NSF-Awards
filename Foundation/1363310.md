Antonio Montalban will study problems in Computability Theory. He is interested
in the interplay between complexity and mathematics. In mathematics, as we all
know, some structures are more complicated than others, some constructions more
complicated than others, and some proofs more complicated than others. He plans
to apply methods from computability theory to study the complexity of various
areas of both classical mathematics and foundations of mathematics.

One of our objectives is to study of the computational properties of
counterexamples to Vaught's conjecture, which is one of the most well-known and
longest-standing conjectures in logic. This is with an eye towards either
showing that those counterexamples do not exist, or just trying to understand
them if they do exist. Montalban has already shown that being a counterexample
to Vaught's conjecture is equivalent to a couple of purely computability-
theoretic properties, and he has in mind a few other properties that might also
end up being equivalent.
