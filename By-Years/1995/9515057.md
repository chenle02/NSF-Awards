Arik M. Levinson University of Wisconsin SBR-959515057 This research will use
detailed data to analyze interjurisdictional hazardous waste shipments in the
United States. The conclusions of this research will have implications for
policies affecting national and international transport of hazardous wastes. The
research will look at the impact of hazardous waste disposal taxes. Preliminary
results indicate that such taxes may be encouraging more on-site disposal of
hazardous waste. It will also consider other factors that determine the
transportation of hazardous waste. These include industrial composition,
hazardous waste capacity, state taxes and regulations, transport cost,
geographic concentration of waste generators, scale economies of waste disposal,
and demographic factors such as population density, income, education, race and
local activism. The effect of hazardous waste regulations on industries that
generate waste will be examined. Finally, the economic and environmental effects
of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the commerce clause of the U.S.
Constitution will be examined.
