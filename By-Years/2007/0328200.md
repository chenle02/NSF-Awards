Electric power generation depends largely on the operation of large synchronous
machines. These generators represent a costly investment for electric utilities,
thus it is of utmost importance that any anomaly in their operation is promptly
corrected. On-line estimation of generator parameters is a desirable feature
that could aid in better monitoring of the machine behavior. It could have a
significant impact in establishing an adequate maintenance schedule for the
generator that ensures proper operation while taking into consideration cost and
risk. The study will augment the research agenda of the multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Power Systems Engineering.
