The grant provides for the laboratory analysis of airborne fine particles
collected in different regions of the world at locations representative of
characteristic vegetational communities. Complementing earlier work by the same
investigator in which hydrocarbon types were the prime object of the laboratory
analyses, the current project will emphasize the analysis of the oxygen-bearing
species in the same samples stored up to ten years following earlier field-
sampling operations. An important element of the research is the identification
of "chemical signatures" in terms of the composition of plant waxes naturally
released from the vegetation of plant communities characterizing areas of
regional extent around the world. Some samples are included to represent both
anthropogenic and natural combustion sources. The research will further define
the organic chemistry of airborne particulate matter in the troposphere, and it
will provide data on the chemistry of particulates from known regional origins
for use in tracing atmospheric transport pathways.
