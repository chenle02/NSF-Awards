9526723 Hanan The object of this proposal is to investigate connections between
the dynamics of mantle plumes and continental basalts. The proposed connection
between mantle plumes, flood basalts, and intraplate seamount chains implies
that volcanic rocks which form by passage of lithosphere over a mantle plume
will display chemical and isotopic compositions which vary in response to plume
dynamics and interactions between the plume and the overlying lithosphere. The
P.I.s propose to investigate this process by examining spatial and temporal
variations in the chemistry of basaltic lavas found in the Snake River Plain
along a transect between Mountain Home and Twin Falls, Idaho. Selected samples
from each will be analyzed for major and trace element geochemistry by XRF
spectrometry (USC); a representative subset of these will be chosen for analysis
of additional trace elements ICP-MS (Centenary),and radiogenic isotopes (SDSU).
The P.I.s plan to date 14 lava flows using 39Ar/40Ar (Berkeley Geochronology
Laboratory). These data will allow us to assess changes in the mantle source
regions of the basalts, and to identify the effects of lithospheric and crustal
assimilation.
