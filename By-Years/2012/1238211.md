The Iowa STEM Education Evaluation (I-SEE): Navigating the Iowa Roadmap is a
Research, Evaluation and Technical Assistance (RETA) project focused on research
on state plans for STEM education. It is seated strategically within the Iowa
STEM Education Roadmap, which is led by the Governor's Science Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Advisory Council, set in place through
Executive Order Number Seventy-Four. The I-SEE is building a coordinated
statewide evaluation system that comprehensively assesses the educational and
economic changes that occur throughout a long-term statewide STEM initiative.
The I-SEE project objectives are to: 1) generate best practices in developing
and implementing evaluative strategies to examine statewide STEM initiatives, as
well as translating and disseminating evaluation and research findings to
support the improvement of a state plan to advance K-12 STEM education; 2)
identify, develop and sustain evaluative capacity and infrastructure that
emphasizes accessible and useful resources, especially those that are online;
and 3) create a system to examine statewide cultural change related to STEM,
particularly in terms of public awareness of and support for STEM education and
workforce/economic development initiatives. These objectives are obtained
through implementation of four major strategic components: Web-Based Portals,
Process Evaluation, Survey of Iowans, and Asset Identification. Major players in
this effort are the Iowa Mathematics and Science Education Partnership housed at
the University of Northern Iowa (UNI), the UNI Center for Social and Behavioral
Research, the Research Institute for Studies in Education at Iowa State
University (ISU), and the University of Iowa (UI) Center for Evaluation and
Assessment. The project team conducts research to strategically disseminate to
other states what is learned about facilitating conditions and barriers critical
to advancing a statewide STEM K-12 education plan for all learners, educators,
and families.
