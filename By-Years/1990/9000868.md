Professor Andrew G. Ewing and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Pennsylvania State University are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92,
ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from laser
spectroscopy and thermochemistry to template synthesis of oligomers and computer
modeling of semiconductors. Students will attend two weekly seminar series on
research and on instrumentation and will prepare oral and written final reports.
