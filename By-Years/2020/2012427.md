Riemannian geometry plays a fundamental role in mathematical physics and
geometric analysis, and computational methods for Riemannian geometry have
surprisingly many practical applications. Equations that govern time-varying
Riemannian metrics, for example, are prototypes for curvature-driven flows that
arise in science and engineering like surface tension-driven flow. Such
equations also underly several algorithms that are used widely in computer
graphics, machine vision, and medical imaging. Examples include algorithms for
surface parameterization, texture mapping, and surface registration.
Computational Riemannian geometry also plays an essential role in gravitational
wave astronomy, where accurate numerical simulations of Einsteinâ€™s equations are
needed to make inferences about gravitational wave signals. Despite its
importance, Riemannian geometry is, in certain respects, underserved by
traditional tools of numerical analysis, which are tailored toward problems
posed in Euclidean space. This project centers on developing novel computational
methods for Riemannian geometry. The computational methods will be made freely
available in a public repository, and graduate students will participate in
their development. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to
design and analyze high-order methods for three families of problems in
computational Riemannian geometry: (1) the numerical solution of intrinsic
geometric flows with finite element methods, (2) intrinsic curvature
approximation with finite elements, and (3) the efficient computation of
interpolants, geodesics, Riemannian means, and the Riemannian exponential map on
matrix manifolds. These three problems are tightly intertwined. The vast
majority of geometric flows in Riemannian geometry are curvature-driven flows,
so their discretization with finite elements goes hand in hand with the
construction of finite element approximations of the Riemann curvature tensor
and its contractions. In turn, tensor field and frame field discretizations play
an important role in curvature approximation, underscoring the need for
efficient algorithms for computations on matrix manifolds. This project aims to
design numerical methods for the aforementioned problems that are high-order,
provably convergent, and structure-preserving. This project will support one
graduate student each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
