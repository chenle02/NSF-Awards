Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly monochromatic
electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is used in chemistry to study a broad
range of subjects, from the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to
photoelectron transfer processes, and from interfacial chemistry to picosecond
pulse shaping. Lasers are also useful in optics, communication, and engineering.
This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama purchase laser equipment.
This equipment will be used in the following research activities: 1. CIDEP
Studies of Polyene and Carotenoid Radical Cations 2. Relaxation Dynamics of
Photo-Excited States in Organic Superconductors 3. Non-Linear Optical Properties
of Donor-Sigma-Acceptor Polydiacetylenes
