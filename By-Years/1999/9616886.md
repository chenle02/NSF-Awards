Stein, Robert AST 96-16886 Drs. Stein and Hawley will model and develop
diagnostics for analyzing dynamic phenomena in the solar atmosphere. Their
theoretical calculations will follow the detailed interaction of the radiation
and plasma motions in response to driving motions and rapid energy injection
both in the presence and in the absence of magnetic fields. The analysis of line
profiles, when compared to observation, will constrain the dynamics of the
photosphere, chromosphere, and the transition region and shed light on the types
of motions found. They will also model the behavior of these regions of the
atmosphere in response to energy injection during flares and compare models with
observations. ***
