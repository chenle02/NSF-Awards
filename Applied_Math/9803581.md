This project concerns the study of multi-frequency oscillations arising in
almost periodically forced oscillators and self-excited systems. Main problems
to be considered are the nature of complicated dynamics resulting from the
interactions of several frequencies especially when these frequencies are close
to resonance. By studying issues such as mean motions of toral flows and quasi-
periodic bifurcations, the investigator would like to address the important role
played by almost automorphic oscillations in these systems. The results of this
project will have significant applications to electric circuit designs of
crystal oscillators.

This project is devoted to the study of mathematical models of physical systems
that present multi-phase oscillations (e.g., mechanical devices and electric
circuits) or systems that are subjected to seasonal variations (e.g., biological
oscillators and population models). Due to the complexity of these physical
systems involving large dimension, multi-parameters and many oscillating
frequencies, qualitative analysis (with help of numerical computations) will be
extremely important to guide practical designs of the physical systems with
respect to the prediction of valuable design parameters and the explanation of
new oscillatory phenomena etc. In particular, the results of this project will
be of a great impact on electric circuit designs of crystal oscillators arising
in a large variety of applications of communication systems.
