This is a Career Advancement Award to support the acquisition by Dr. Head of
basic molecular biology techniques and skills and to subsequently establish
these procedures in her laboratory. Dr. Head will accomplish this by spending
time in the laboratories of three experienced molecular biologists: Dr. Linette
Casey, University of Texas Southestern Medical School; Dr. W. Sue Griffin,
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; and Dr. Joan Hunt, University of
Kansas Medical Center. Dr. Head will then apply these techniques to studies of
immune function at the maternal- fetal interface. It is anticipated that the
proposed training and research activities will lead to significant advances in
the field of reproductive immunology, and will significantly enhance Dr. Head's
career.
