Mary Susan Lindee, Doctoral Student. Dissertation topic: "Radiation, human
heredity and the work of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, 1947-1956." Ms.
Lindee is examining the study by American scientists of the genetic damages on
human populations of the atomic bomb blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end
of World War II. The study attempted to track genetic damage in the offspring of
survivors of the atomic bombings. This genetics study was unique scientifically,
socially and politically. The tensions that shaped it included the developing
Japanese-American relations, the expectations and fears of those exposed to
A-Bomb radiation, the professional goals of participating scientists, and the
military's need for immediately useful information about the effects of
radiation. There pressures all affected scientific choices made by ABCC
investigators. Ms. Lindee hopes to study how the various political, social, and
military pressures led genetics researchers to focus their attention on
radiation mutagenesis primarily in terms of its social costs. She will also
examine the implications of this focus for understanding the post-war
development and institutionalization of American human genetics as a whole.
