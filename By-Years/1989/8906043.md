This project is in the discipline of chemistry, broadly defined, with a specific
focus on education and human resources. The thrust of this activity is a multi-
part workshop, symposium, panel discussion, and outreach activity that is
designed to acquaint women faculty members and students in the Southeastern
United States with career opportunities in chemistry and Foundation programs
that are structured to enhance the research careers of women scientists and
engineers. Dr. Alice Cunningham, Kenan Professor of Chemistry and Chairperson of
the Department of Chemistry at Agnes Scott College, will contact some 450
institutions of higher learning in the 10-state southeastern region of the U.S.
and informing them that four outstanding women scientists will describe their
research programs and discuss career opportunities for women in chemistry at a
symposium that will be held on Friday afternoon, March 3, 1989, at Agnes Scott
College. Additionally, NSF staff will conduct an ROW Outreach on the morning of
March 3, 1989, preceding the symposium. This project will contribute to the
infrastructure of science by showcasing the achievements of women in chemistry
and cast those women as effective role models for the women students who will
attend the symposium. The participants in the symposium are particularly well-
suited to this activity in that two of them (Cunningham and Morse) are members
of the American Chemical Society's Committee on Professional Training and two
others (Dixon and Lester) are currently NSF Research Opportunities for Women-
Career Advancement Award grantees. Additionally, the focussed inclusion of
minority (e.g., Spellman College) and numerous undergraduate institutions among
the invitees is a particularly important aspect of this activity.
