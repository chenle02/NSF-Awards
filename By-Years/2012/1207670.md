The standard approaches to the Lefschetz fixed point theorem and its converse
have focused on integer valued invariants: the Lefschetz number and Nielsen
number. These invariants are easy to define but very difficult to generalize.
The PI has developed an approach that produces invariants that are elements of
stable homotopy groups of spheres and twisted loop spaces, as well as more
algebraic targets. These invariants readily generalize and agree with the
integer valued invariants in the classical cases. In this project the PI
proposes further generalizations to coincidences and periodic points. She also
plans to explore extensions of important classical properties of fixed point
invariants to generalizations such as equivariant and fiberwise fixed point
invariants. The PI intends to mentor graduate students and graduate school bound
undergraduates, expand graduate student participation in the topology seminar
and facilitate greater interaction between students and external visitors.

Fixed points arises in many different areas of mathematics and have a variety of
applications. In some cases fixed points are very well understood, but there are
also many important questions that have not been resolved. The goal of this
project is to use tools from algebraic topology to define new invariants that
detect fixed points and their generalizations and to provide a better
understanding of the structure of an important collection of fixed point
invariants. This project involves new approaches to a classical area of
algebraic topology that should be amenable to doing computations. Students at
different levels will be involved in the project.
