A cooperative study is developed between University of Missouri and the National
Chungkung University of Taiwan to develop axial-rocking (ARR)) spectra, use the
ARR spectra with other existing spectra of lateral, verical, and lateral-
torsional motion to study the effect of interacting ground motions on three-
dimensional building systems, conduct experimental study of the hysteretic
behavior and stiffness reduction of reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls without
boundary columns aand with various height-and-width ratios (0.5 to 3.0)
subjected to monotonic models for predicting the inelastic behavior of buildings
systems, and study the damage of RC shear wall systems through analysis and
expermental observations.
