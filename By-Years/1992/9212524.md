High resolution recording, display, and computing equipment will be purchased
with this award and used in research projects involving image processing. The
research will primarily take place in the Digital Image Analysis, Computer
Vision, and the Color Image Processing Laboratories where projects include a
common need for long-term archival storage of large, multi-dimensional imagery
and visualization of processing results.
