This is a U.S.-French field study in the Central Indian Basin aboard the French
research vessel Marion Dufresne. Long (30 to 45 meters) and large-diameter
(15cm) piston cores will be obtained along a transect extending from the equator
to approximately 15 south. This transect spans several first- order
oceanographic and sedimentary transition zones, reflecting the confluence of
distal turbidite sedimentation on the lower Ganges fan and biosiliceaous
sedimentation associated with the hydrochemical "front" (10 S) and the South
Equatorial Current. These cores will extend the Indian Ocean
magnetobiostratigraphic type-section from Plio-Pleistocene down into the Middle-
Upper Miocene, ca 10Ma. Using this stratigraphic type-section, the study will be
able to establish with high precision the chronology of major episodes of
biosiliceous and distal turbidite sedimentation in the Central Indian Basin
during the Neogene, and the degree of non-synchroneity of radiolarian datum
levels.
