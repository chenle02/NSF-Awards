9634872 Shaw The silver-sheathed Bi-2212 superconductor has been the prime
candidate for the applications such as electric generators, motors, high-field
magnets, transmission cables, superconducting magnetics energy storage for the
high Tc superconducting wires and tapes. It needs to be melt processed, between
870-910 Centigrade in air, to transform the oxide precursor powder to the proper
(PMG) processing has been widely studied, but has several drawbacks which have
prevented the manufacturing of long length of these conductors. The (IMP)
techniques to fabricate 100-400 meter long high temperature silver-sheathed
superconducting tapes with a critical current density greater than 50,000
A/square centimeter. This project has a balance between theory and experiment.
The outcome of this study will lay the groundwork for scaling up the IMP
technique to produce long BI-2212 conductor.
