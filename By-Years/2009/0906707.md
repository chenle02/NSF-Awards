Dr. Megan Tracy of James Madison University will use this Small Grant for
Exploratory Research to investigate changes in conceptions of accountability and
transparency due to the ongoing melamine scandal in China's dairy industry. The
project examines, first, how local corporations reassess accountability and
transparency as related to the scandal and, second, whether or not this
reassessment draws upon or contradicts globally circulating ideas of
accountability. This research will contribute to social scientific understanding
of standardization, governance and corporations by documenting the specific
reactions of Chinese national corporations to the melamine crisis. Due to the
transitory nature of crises, this project meets Small Grants for Exploratory
Research criteria for the collection of ephemeral data and proof of access. For
researchers, the scandal presents singular opportunities to document how China's
corporations will move forward in light of this series of crises and to fine-
tune theories of transparency, standardization and governance. The research also
will inform the global increase in demands for corporations to adopt and
implement increased standards and regulations to demonstrate their commitment to
global norms of accountability and responsibility.
