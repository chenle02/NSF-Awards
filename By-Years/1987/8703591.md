This research will concentrate on three important problems in number theory.
The first will be to sharpen the lower bounds known for regulators of number
fields. The second will be the study of the distribution of the Frobenius map
acting on the Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves over a finite field and thereby
study the distribution of the divisor class groups of such curves. This is
connected with the Cohen-Lenstra conjecture in number fields. The third problem
is the study of the purely ring theoretic properties that may govern the
vanishing of the Iwasawa mu-invariant. This research will consider various
problems in number theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the
integers. The proposer brings to bear a wide variety of tools to perform this
research. Using analysis and geometry the study of lower bounds of one of the
crucial invariants in algebraic number theory, the regulator, will be studied.
The study of the distribution of divisor class groups involves a study in
probability concerning these geometric objects. The problem on the Iwasawa
involves a heavy use of algebra techniques. The principle has a firm command of
these diverse tools and will contribute a great deal to the theory.
