The purpose of this project is to improve the undergraduate laboratory courses
in civil engineering by integrating state of the art interactive graphics
computer hardware and software with the experimental program. The addition of
this capability allows upgrading of the undergraduate laboratory course through
the use of more sophisticated experiments which can now easily be related to
theoretical analyses. The equipment also permits the laboratory courses to be
more closely related to the comprehensive design project now underway in the
department.
