Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Novel chromatofocusing
Methods with Applications in Proteomics&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:

Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new chromatographic technique, serial
displacement chromatofocusing (SDC), will be developed and evaluated with regard
to its usefulness as a replacement for preparative isoelectric focusing in the
field of proteomics. To further enhance the usefulness of the method,
theoretical tools involving computer-aided process design, the thermodynamics of
protein adsorption, and bioinformatics, will be developed and employed. The
proposed SDC method involves the formation of a self-generated, retained pH
gradient consisting of a series of self-sharpening pH fronts, which propagate
inside an ion-exchange column, which will use nanometer-sized particles as a
packing material. This project will address three prototypical uses in the field
of proteomics: (1) its use as an efficient prefractionation method prior in 2D
gel electrophoresis, (2) its use as a rapid separation method for use in high-
throughput proteomics, and (3) its use as a non-denaturing first separation
dimension in a 2D zymogram method for detecting enzymatic activity. In terms of
the broader impacts, the work has applications in several areas of critical
national importance, such as in the search for new diagnostic markers for
diseases and in the rapid identification of microorganisms for food safety and
counter-bioterrorism. In addition, the proposed work is an interdisciplinary
study that involves aspects of chromatographic process engineering,
bioanalytical chemistry, and applied biology, so that students working on the
project will be well prepared to join the U.S. workforce in the biotechnology
area. Through the Meyerhoff scholarship program, students at both the graduate
and undergraduate levels will be recruited to work on this project, which will
help to increase the number minorities working in the U.S. biotechnology
industry.&lt;br/&gt;
