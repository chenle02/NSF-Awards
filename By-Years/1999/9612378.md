*** 9612378 Ban This Small Business Innovation Research Project is to design and
build a radically new prototype reactor capable of deposition of OLED materials
on large area substrates. In Phase I a new method for the large area, low cost
growth of organic light emitting devices (OLEDS) was successfully developed
using a patented process of Organic Vapor Phase Deposition (OVPD). The potential
of OVPD was developed by producing an efficient green Organic Light Emitting
Diode (OLED), consisting of OVPD deposited TDP and vacuum deposited Alq3 films.
This represents the first step in large batch processing of "small molecule" and
possibly polymer based OLEDS, devices of great importance for emissive color
flat panel displays. This type of reactor can be scaled up to produce large
area, full color flat panel displays continuously. In Phase II the extensive
expertise gained in OLED materials and reactor and process design expertise will
be combined. The commercial potential in this type of display market may be
enormous (estimated at over $20 billion/year). The technology proposed is unique
in its approach to producing low cost OLED based flat panel displays in high
volume. ***
