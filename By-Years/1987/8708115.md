A variety of experiments employing infrared-microwave sideband laser sources in
the carbon monoxide and the carbon dioxide laser regions will be carried out by
Dr. Schwendeman. The sources will be used to record high-resolution (Doppler-
free as well as Doppler-limited) fundamental and hot-band vibration-rotation
spectra of gaseous samples. Substances to be investigated include molecules of
interest in atmospheric, astrophysical, or far-infrared laser studies (i.e.,
hydrocarbons with small or zero permanent dipole moments and van der Waals
dimers). These studies will focus on obtaining accurate structural information
and energy transfer rates. The spectroscopic research program continues to
develop new laser experimental methods that can be used to probe more accurately
the structures of gaseous molecules. Important molecular parameters will be
determined and new experimental techniques that can be used by other
laboratories will be developed.
