This SBIR project will develop a novel reactor design for UV/TiO2
photocatalysis. Specifically, the degradation of MTBE will be investigated and
the project will then look at byproduct formation. Additionally, optimizing the
system by adding oxygen as an electron acceptor and H2O2 as an alternative
method for degrading MTBE will be explored.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development and
commercialization of a portable system to degrade organics. There are a number
of potential applications for this technology ranging from groundwater
remediation to military applications to recreation and other portable uses.
