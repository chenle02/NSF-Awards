This proposal requests funding in support of the domestic travel of participants
to a symposium: "Hairy Particles: Theory, Synthesis, Behavior, and
Applications", to be held at the ACS National Meeting Sept 8-12, 2013. Hairy
particles are composed of a core, either inorganic, metallic, or polymeric, and
a layer of polymer chains densely grafted by one end via a covalent bond on the
surface of the core (i.e. polymer brushes). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diverse
potential applications of the hairy particles range from advanced composites to
catalysis and sensing. The organizers (Profs. Zhao,Zhu,Li) bring a broad range
of expertise in polymer chemistry and polymer physics pertinent to the symposium
topic.
