With this Award from the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of
Chemistry, Professor Frantz at the University of Texas at San Antonio is
developing new chemical reactions to meet unmet synthetic needs that broadly
impact the efficient manufacture of small molecules in areas such as
pharmaceuticals, agricultural products, and advanced materials. As a part of
this proposed research program, Professor Frantz has developed excellent
opportunities to train students at all levels in the development of modern
methodologies in asymmetric catalysis and organic synthesis. The techniques and
knowledge gained during the development of this research will improve students'
competitive edge in both industrial and academic careers. In addition,
recruitment and participation by underrepresented minorities and groups,
Hispanics and women, is a key component of the supported project.

This project focuses on the discovery and development of new catalytic methods
to synthesize chiral allenes from sustainable raw materials. In the proposed
funding period, various metal-based catalysts in combination with chiral
phosphorous-based ligands are being evaluated for their ability to promote an
enantioselective beta-hydride elimination from intermediate cationic vinyl
Pd(II)-complexes to efficiently control the axial chirality in allenes. Specific
explorations focus on several transformations to explore this new chemistry
including tandem transmetalation/beta-hydride elimination of vinyl boranes and
intramolecular tandem carbometallations/beta-hydride eliminations of alkynes. A
key feature of these transformations is the exploitation of a reaction manifold
that is typically viewed as an unproductive side-reaction (beta-hydride
eliminations) in most metal-catalyzed processes to a new productive avenue in
asymmetric catalysis and synthesis.
