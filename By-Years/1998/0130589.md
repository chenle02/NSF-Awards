The hypothesis of this project is that local deviations from ideal, bulk
translational mobilities and concentrations of ligands near membrane surfaces
exert critical influences on the kinetics of ligand-receptor interactions and,
as a consequence, biological function. To test this hypothesis, three groups of
specific aims will be pursued. In the first group of aims, physical factors
(electrostatic, hydrodynamic and entrapment) governing the translational
mobilities and concentrations of fluorescent ligands in regions of solution that
are very close to model and natural cell membranes deposited on transparent
planar substrates will be examined. These measurements will be carried out by
using total internal reflection with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy as
developed during the last funding period. In the second group of specific aims,
three technological innovations will be implemented. These innovations will
provide distance-dependent, rather than distance-averaged, information about
local ligand dynamics. First, the distance-dependence of the local ligand
translational mobility and concentration will be probed by changing the
evanescent depth. Second, photon counting histograms obtained with evanescent
illumination will provide a direct measure of the manner in which the ligand
concentration and therefore potential depend on the distance from the membrane
surface. Third, high order autocorrelation will be employed to further confirm
and understand the effects of the nearby membrane surface on the local ligand
concentration and mobility. The goal of the final specific aim is to correlate
local changes in ligand concentrations and dynamics, as they are observed, with
specific ligand-receptor kinetics. The interaction kinetics will be monitored
with a well-established method, total internal reflection with fluorescence
photobleaching recovery.
