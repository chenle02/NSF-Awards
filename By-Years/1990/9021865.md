This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of San Diego for the
repair and renovation of Serra Hall which houses research and research training
activities in biology and electron microscopy. This building was constructed in
1958 and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $131,000 and
$157,248 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these
research and research training facilities. This project will address the need to
improve the current research infrastructure by converting four rooms into a
multi-use microscopy facility; providing space for preparation of samples,
instrument facilities, and three faculty research laboratories; and upgrading an
existing dark room. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by
providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of undergraduate students in a department with a particular commitment
to encouraging students to pursue research careers. This commitment, reflected
in the provision of summer research opportunities, clearly defined faculty
responsibilities in research training of undergraduates, and a goal of having a
certain percentage of their students enter graduate school, will be further
facilitated by this project.
