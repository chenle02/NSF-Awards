Water is absolutely necessary for the intestine to absorb food and dispose of
wastes. The amount of water in the intestine is regulated by a small protein
hormone produced in the wall of that organ. Too little water results in the
release of this hormone, stimulating the cells lining the intestine to secrete
water. Too much water results in a decrease in the release of this hormone,
reducing water secretion into the intestine. However, it is unclear how this
hormone stimulates intestinal cells to secrete water. It is known that the
hormone binds to specific protein receptors on the surface of intestinal cells
to stimulate secretion. Interestingly, there appear to be several receptors for
this hormone with different structures and functions. These receptors appear to
activate different signalling mechanisms in the cell. Which signalling pathway
is responsible for triggering secretion is unknown. Also, which receptors are
coupled to different signalling pathways has not been defined. Finally, the
relationships between the different structures and functions of these receptors
have not been examined. Studies outlined in this proposal involve the
purification of these different receptors from intestinal cells. The structure
and function of these isolated receptors will be defined and compared, to
establish their relationship. The coupling of these different purified receptors
to cellular signalling pathways will be established, to determine which receptor
and signal pathway is involved in regulating intestinal secretion. These studies
are significant because they will define basic mechanisms regulating a key
intestinal function at the molecular level. In addition, the fundamental
mechanisms coupling receptors and signalling pathways defined in these studies
are generally applicable to the regulation of other organs, including the kidney
and blood vessels.
