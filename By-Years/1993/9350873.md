The proposed project is to provide hands-on experience in communication
techniques, relating theoretical concepts to practical circuits and processes.
The main emphasis will be in digital communication. A wide range of experiments
will be performed in analog signalling such as linear modulation methods and
digital signalling such as pulse shaping. Spectrum analysis of digital
modulation schemes, and bit error rate analysis will also be included. The
practical experience the student will gain in the laboratory will supplement and
reinforce both analog and digital communication concepts learned in the
Communication lecture course. Major equipment include modulation systems. This
equipment will also be used for the design of Senior Projects.
