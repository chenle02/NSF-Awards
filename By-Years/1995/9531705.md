Paul Houston of Cornell University is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to continue his studies on photodissociation dynamics.
Specifically, he will focus his efforts in two areas: a) photodissociation
dynamics of small free radicals, where comparison with theory is very fruitful,
and b) photodissociation dynamics of state-selected molecules, where it is
possible to observe the influence of the initial excitation on the product
distribution. The studies on radicals will not only provide an experimental
benchmark for theoretical chemists, but will also have a large impact in the
areas of atmospheric and combustion chemistry. The state-selected
precursor/state-resolved product experiments will contribute tremendously to
further our understanding of collision dynamics.
