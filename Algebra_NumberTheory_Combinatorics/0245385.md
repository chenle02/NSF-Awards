Abstract for the proposal DMS- 0245385 of Stembridge and Fomin

The investigators will continue their study of combinatorial structures arising
in algebra, representation theory and algebraic geometry, and to develop
software tools to assist researchers in these areas. One example of such
structures are the cluster algebras, designed to provide a concrete algebraic
framework for dual canonical bases and total positivity in semisimple groups.
Our investigations will also include the study of generalized Kostka-Foulkes
polynomials, sub-Coxeter arrangements, and the combinatorics of crystal graphs
and generalized associahedra.

In selecting combinatorial problems and conjectures to investigate, the
proposers intent has been to identify areas that are most likely to provide
insight into other disciplines. Indeed, combinatorics has an important role to
play in an ever widening array of applications in both mathematics and computer
science; this increasing importance is related to the demand for explicit or
algorithmic understanding of discrete structures, and has grown in tandem with
the prominence of computation in nearly all phases of research in mathematics.
