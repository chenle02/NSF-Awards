The Second International Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology will be
held at Northeastern University. The Symposium is interdisciplinary in nature
and will cover a wide range of topics in particle physics, string theory and
cosmology and their interconnections. There will be both theoretical and
experimental talks at the Symposium, and it is expected that there will be a
scientifically very useful exchange of ideas.
