This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses solid
polymer electrolyte (SPE) fuel cells for applications with the Next Generation
of Vehicles (NGV). These fuel cells hold promise of providing power at high
energy efficiencies and low pollutant emission rates. Long-term durability,
quiet operation, and modular design are other desirable properties that will
also be required in NGV power supplies This research explores the possibilities
of an improved SPE for hydrocarbon/air fuel cells The project will involve
preparation and characterization of a novel form of perfluorinated acid
membranes and will demonstrate high temperature operation of SPE fuel cells. An
improved high-temperature SPE fuel cell could mean that portable fuel cells may
run on unrefined fuels such as methanol and propane. This would contribute to
practical fuel cell designs for automotive and other portable power
applications.
