CTS-9501946 Edith Sevick University of Colorado The career development plan
involves three areas of research: polymer brushes as microvalves,
electrophoretic separations using microlithographic arrays of polyelectrolyte
chains, and adsorption of surfactants onto a model clay suspension. The focus of
the research will be on the design, modeling and construction of a novel
microvalve system, consisting of polymer chains end-grafted onto pores several
nanometers in diameter. The microvalves impart unique flow control to the
membrane without mechanical parts or feedback control loops. Understanding how
the adsorbed polymer brushes sense and respond to flow under different
geometry's may lead to unique membranes with flow-dependent properties.
Potential applications include filtration and controlled drug release. The
educational plan involves the development of a graduate course in statistical
mechanics, and the introduction of computer simulation and process simulators to
the undergraduate curriculum.
