This researh project investigates numerical techniques for solving Vlasov-
Poisson systems, including a convergence study of the Lax-Wendroff method for
one dimensional problems and a comparison with simulation or particle-in-cell
methods. A Vlasov-Poisson system typically consists of a hyperbolic conservation
law coupled with the Poisson equation. The research results are expected to have
applications in stellar dynamics and in plasma physical settings.
