This award enables Tufts University to attach its campus-wide network to NSFNET
through a 56,000 bit per second line to NEARNET, the New England Regional
Network. This connection allows Tuft's researchers to: 1) access supercomputer
facilities for a wide range of funded research projects; 2) conduct joint/
collaborative research projects at a variety of remote sites; 3) routinely
access remote data bases and archives; 4) greatly simplify and improve the
performance of their former multiple external network connections; and 5)
improve mail, file transfer and remote login capabilities.
