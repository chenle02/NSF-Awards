The U.S. mathematical and phycial sciences communities are represented by the
Naitonal Academy of Sciences (NAS) in seven international scientific unions: the
International Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Radio Science Union
(URSI), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the
International Commission for Optics (ICO), the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr),
and the International Mathematical Union (IMU). U.S. National Committees
(USNC's), staffed by the NAS, coordinate U.S. preparations for meetings of the
corresponding international unions and for scientific conferences, symposia, and
workshops organized by these unions to identify research topics, issues, and
programs of interest to their specific disciplines; identify and support U.S.
scientists to participate in union activities; and arrange for payment of U.S.
dues to the seven unions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides resources to
underwrite the costs of these activities through CY 2003.&lt;br/&gt;
