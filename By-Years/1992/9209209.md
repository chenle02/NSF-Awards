The object of the project is to develop multilayer composite coatings on
carbide tool inserts for high speed machining of steel and cast iron.
Nonequilibrium processing using laser physical vapor deposition will be
employed. A multitarget, high vacuum chamber with facilities to maintain
selective environment and in- situ process the coatings has been designed and
constructed. Titanium carbide will be deposited on tungsten carbide tool insert
to form and initial adherent coating. Multilayer composite coatings will be
developed. Laser parameters, thickness and number of the layers of the coatings
will be optimized to achieve high quality coatings. The coatings will be
characterized using modern analytical techniques to determine second phase
formation, interdiffusion, segregation, and epitaxial nature of the interface.
Mechanical properties of the coatings will be evaluated. The coated tools will
be tested in high speed machining to determine the wear and failure mechanisms.
The project should lead to the development of coatings for cutting tools with
improved wear resistance which should allow increased productivity in machining.
