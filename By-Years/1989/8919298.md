The red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) is a well-known inhabitant of
American marshes and fields. Among birds, this species is somewhat unusual
because of its mating system in which one male attracts several females who nest
within his territory. Generally, such a mating system is associated with reduced
male parental care, perhaps because males stand to gain more from getting more
females than from caring for their young. Male red- winged blackbirds, however,
care for their helpless and immobile nestlings in three distinct ways: They act
as sentinels by sitting at prominent, exposed perches to look for potential
predators; as defenders by harassing and attacking predators that are searching
for prey; and as providers by feeding their nestlings. In some populations, such
as the one to be studied, the male's parental care is substantial and effective
in improving the health and survival of the young. Dr. Yasukawa's research will
examine the causes and effects of paternal investment in nestling red-winged
blackbirds. Both observations and experiments will be conducted, and all
research will be carried out in the field on a wild population with minimal
disturbance to the birds. Much of the research will be performed by
undergraduate students, who will make significant contributions to all aspects
of the project and get valuable experience in scientific field work.
