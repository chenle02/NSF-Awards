The Purpose of the project is to support research in operator algebras and
related fields. Operator algebras provide models and tools for the study of
noncommutative, or quantized systems and objects. A large part of the subject is
the study of von Neumann algebras (introduced by John von Neumann about seventy
years ago). These are the noncommutative measure spaces. The research objective
of the project is to further develop the theory of quantum (or "free")
probability and statistics in the context of von Neumann algebras and find
applications in mathematics and beyond.

Probabilistic and statistical methods are widely used in many areas of sciences
and in our daily lives. For many complicated systems such as financial markets
or networks, classical theories are not quite effective in explaining how the
systems work and predicting the future. Quantum probability and statistics
provide tools in dealing with large systems with more interactive or intertwined
variables. Progresses in the study of quantum probability and statistics will
enhance our understanding of the laws in nature and the quality of our living.
