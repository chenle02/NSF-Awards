Many design problems require that an existing process or system be redesigned
to meet new requirements, respond to a changed environment, or respond to new a
technology. An existing design imposes many constraints on redesign, and often
the redesign must be achieved with limited resources. Examples of this class of
design problems are retrofitting of chemical plants, redesign of manufacturing
facilities, and expansion of electrical transmission and distribution networks.
The goal of this research is to develop systematic methods for the redesign
problem based on synthesis, simulation, and optimization. The principal
investigator will initially study the redesign problem in the context of
retrofitting chemical process plants. Specifically, he will develop methods for
describing the existing process accurately, identifying the elements of the
existing design that limit its improvement, generating a superstructure for
describing the design with and without the limiting elements, identifying and
modeling promising alternatives, and finally integrating and optimizing the
alternatives within the existing design. This research focuses on an area of
design that is neglected by researchers because redesign appears to be easier
than the design of something completely new. However, most industrial design is
redesign, and redesign is often more difficult because of the constraints
imposed by the existing design.
