Stuller This research has three major objectives: 1. to derive the mathematical
operations that should be performed on two or more stochastic signals to obtain
theoretically optimum estimates of the delay or displacement between them; 2. to
develop practical systems that attain or closely approximate the theoretically
optimum estimates; and 3. to compare the accuracy of the theoretically optimum
estimates with the estimates obtained by the practical systems. The research
method is primarily theoretical, but includes computational studies and
simulation experiments. The approach has the potential to synthesize the
traditional divisions between: 1. motion estimation based on optical flow and
motion estimation based on feature tracking; and 2. segmentation and motion
estimation. This unification should lead to an increased understanding of image
motion estimation and improved motion estimation techniques.
