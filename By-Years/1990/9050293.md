This three-year project will produce a series of staff development seminars and
teachers enhancement materials for teachers in grades four through six. Building
on the successful "MathTools for Teachers K-3" project at the University of
Chicago, the staff will design teacher enhancement materials to develop the
connections between the mathematical structures of arithmetic and geometry and
the school curriculum. Mathematical applications will be emphasized. Exemplar
student problem sets will be developed and introduced to teachers through the
materials. A series of workshops for staff development leaders will serve as
pilot sites for the implementation of the seminar. An evaluation of the
effectiveness of the seminars is included in the project plan. Cost sharing is
provided by the University of Chicago, the Amoco Foundation, the Ford Motor
Company, local school districts, and COMAP as 66% of the NSF award.
