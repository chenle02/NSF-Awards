Part 1 Non-technical&lt;br/&gt;Corn is unique in that it is one of the best
model organisms for studying fundamental biological questions, and at the same
time has significant economic value as a major crop. To maintain competitiveness
in agriculture and prepare for future environmental challenges, such as drought
or disease outbreaks, new technologies are needed to accelerate basic research
in corn. Genetic transformation is an essential tool for fundamental biological
studies. It allows for a more complete analysis of gene function, enabling an
increase in the knowledge base upon which advances in agriculture are made. It
is also a key step in generating biotech traits in crop plants to enhance and
provide stability for food production. Despite years of effort, genetic
transformation is still remarkably difficult to perform in corn. The current
technology for production of transformed corn plants is limited by technical
difficulties, high cost, and long turnaround time. Consequently, genetic
transformation is a bottleneck that slows basic research and agricultural
advancement. This project will develop a new method to deliver genes to immature
seed on corn ears, combined with genetic color markers that visibly identify the
successfully transformed seed. This will accelerate progress for many aspects of
maize research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Part 2 Technical&lt;br/&gt;Using knowledge
of maize reproductive development, a method is being developed to make
transformation of maize accessible to all labs that are able to perform basic
maize genetics and molecular biology. Agrobacterium treatment of developing
maize ears will be tested for the ability to produce heritable transformation of
maize kernels. Two maize inbred varieties that are commonly used for genetic
research will be tested as well as a mutant with reproductive abnormalities to
identify the most robust and user-friendly method possible. This simple, quick
and efficient technique will enable individual labs to produce transgenic plants
without the epigenetic abnormalities associated with tissue culture plantlet
regeneration while also circumventing the need for highly specialized personnel
or out-sourcing of transgenic line production to service facilities, which are
limited in capacity. Broadly, this new transformation technique will not only
benefit fundamental researches using maize as a model organism, but also
contribute greatly to maize production in agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
