MARANTZ This study employs MEG imaging techniques to investigate how the brain
represents and uses linguistic categories. Ultimately this research will explore
all levels of linguistic analysis from the phonetic to the semantic. The current
project starts with phonetic and phonological categories - distinctive features
of speech sounds - and how they are realized during speech perception at
auditory cortex. The primary goal of this preliminary research is to compare the
brain's reaction to the acoustic as opposed to the linguistic properties of
speech. For example, voiced and voiceless stops (in English) are distinguished
acoustically by voicing onset time (VOT), a continuous physical dimension.
Perception of speech sounds, however, isn't continuous along the VOT dimension.
Along this dimension, sounds are heard categorically, as belonging to either the
voiced or voiceless categories. Relatively large differences in VOT within a
category are difficult to perceive while relatively small differences that cross
the boundary between categories are easy to perceive. It is clear that the
auditory system and brain do not map the physically continuous dimension of VOT
linearly, or log-linearly as pitch and loudness are mapped. Possible
neurophysiological bases of categorical perception have been suggested from the
results of experiments with animals. This project asks to what extent the human
response resembles the animal models and what constitutes linguistic category
perception over and above the physical response common to the mammalian auditory
system.
