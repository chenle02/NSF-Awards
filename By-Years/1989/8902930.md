This project examines how a small group of collaborators works together to
design software requirements, and what impact--good or bad--the use of groupware
(integrated hardware/software for group processes) might have on this process.
Scientists from the University of Michigan will cooperate with colleagues from
the Software Technology Program at Microelectronics and Computer Technology
Corporation (MCC) and Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. The specific projects represent
the blending of skills in the building of computer systems, the empirical
analysis of human behavior, and the application of theory, both from technology
and from cognitive science, to the design and analysis of technology
augmentations of work. The approach stresses the need to use a vision of future
technology environments to navigate the design space of collaborative
technology, but uses the science base of behavioral science on the one hand and
computer science and information systems on the other to assist in the
development of technology experiments. The research will pursue the following
specific activities: Studies of current practice-- 1. An analysis of
collaboration from interview data already collected by MCC 2. Observational
studies of collaboration as they occur now; Studies of groupware supported
collaboration-- 3. Studies of collaboration using MCC groupware prototypes 4.
Studies of collaboration using University of Michigan groupware prototypes. The
project will use observational methods to study group behavior in situ, and will
use successive generations of groupware prototypes as experimental tools for
better understanding the collaborative process itself. The goal of the project
is to contribute to the science base of collaboration theory, which is a blend
of the behavioral sciences and the computer and information sciences interested
in understanding how autonomous agents coordinate their behavior in the pursuit
of a common task.
