Relatively little is known about the environments of central North America
during the early and middle parts of the Wisconsin glacial period, which
extended roughly from 70,000 to 25,000 years before the present. Few deposits of
materials from the period remain; one of the most important formations that does
exist is the Roxana loess, a fine, wind-blown material found in the upper
Mississippi River valley. Scientists have disagreed about the origins of these
deposits, however, with each alternative explanation providing markedly
different interpretation of prevailing environmental conditions. This doctoral
dissertation project will use geochemical, particle-size, mineralogical, and
radiocarbon analyses to determine the source materials and age of Roxana loess
deposits in the Mississippi River valley between LaCrosse, Wisconsin, and Rock
Island, Illinois. The results of these analyses will be compared with comparable
analyses of deposits from the Illinois River valley to determine whether the
loess is composed of materials from local or from glacially transported sources,
and the results will provide a firmer basis from which to infer large- and
smaller-scale paleoenvironmental conditions and geomorphic processes during the
early- and middle-Wisconsin period. This research will provide valuable
information for scientists conducting geomorphic and paleoenvironmental research
in the upper Midwest, and it will contribute toward reconstruction of regional
conditions during the last ice age. The project also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent
research skills.
