The focus of this research is the synthesis and origins of the porphyrins from
oil shales and petroleum, including porphyrins with five- and six-membered
exocyclic rings. In addition, the preparation of N-15 and deuterium labeled
porphyrins needed for resonance Raman studies will be carried out. Other
porphyrin systems that will be synthesized include porphyrin dimers and novel
porphyrin-containing chromophores such as indenoporphyrins, naphth 2,3-b
porphyrins, tetranapthoporphyrins, phenanthropor-phyrins, coronenoporphyrins and
phenanthrolinoporhyrins. These latter porphyrins will be of particular interest
because of their ability to bind metal cations at the external phenanthroline
subunit as well as within the central porphyrin cavity. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Timothy D. Lash of
the Department of Chemistry at the Illinois State University. Professor Lash
will focus his work on the synthesis of sedimentary cycloalkanoporphyrins, which
are geochemical markers that help determine the origins of oil shales and
petroleum, and also novel porphyrin-containing chromophores with highly
conjugated systems. These later compounds will provide an important new entry
into supramolecular porphyrin chemistry.
