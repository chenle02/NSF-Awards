This program is concerned with the study of optical nonlinearities in
semiconductors. The objective is to achieve stronger optical nonlinearities that
permit operation at lower light intensities. Defect-assisted optical
nonlinearities will be studied. Prior work by this principal investigator
employing quantum-confined excitons has pioneered in new resonant phenomena that
can lead to significant enhancements of nonlinear interactions. Semi- insulating
multilayer materials for understanding the screening mechanisms. Other
nonequilibrium nonlinear optical phenomena such as the quenching of the
photorefractive effect, optical metastability, and chaos will also be studied.
