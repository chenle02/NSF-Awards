This award funds research to develop improved methods for using risk comparisons
in risk communications. Risk comparisons, which compare the estimates of risk
from one source to those from another source, are intuitively appealing as a
means for aiding the communication and understanding of risk estimates. However,
past applications have been criticized because they failed to account for
qualitative differences between risks (e.g., discrete vs. continuous risk
sources) and because they ignored important attributes that affect risk
perception (e.g., voluntary vs. involuntary exposure). The proposed research
plan includes the development of a conceptual model for guiding the
identification and evaluation of risk comparison methods. The conceptual model
will summarize available information regarding the communication process and
include explicit evaluation criteria. Using the example of health risks from
electromagnetic fields, a set of risk comparisons will be developed for
illuminating specific aspects of risk. Focus groups, which involve in-depth
interviews with selected participant groups, will be conducted to test the
effectiveness of the methods and to collect additional information concerning
(a) how characteristics of the affected population should influence the
selection of a risk comparison method, (b) what characteristics of the risk
source typically determine the choice of reference risks, and (c) how
uncertainties in risk estimates should be presented. On the basis of these
results, an implementation strategy and evaluation criteria for the use of risk
comparisons will be recommended. This information will be of use to risk
analysts, decision makers, and others who must communicate risk information.
