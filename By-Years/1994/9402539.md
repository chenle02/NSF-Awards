9402539 Gilbert The research seeks to investigate direct and inverse acoustic
problems in shallow oceans. The approach would be to use homogenization to
derive the deterministic and stochastic differential equations for the ocean
seabed system. There are several open problems still associated with the
deterministic problem such as a correct formulation of the farfield, the
unidentified inclusion problem, and for that matter, the proof of the existence
of the fundamental singular solution and an efficient computational method for
finding it. The homogenization approach produces the deterministic model as the
zero order term and the first order takes in the random nature of the media by
proposing a stochastic differential equation. The research is aimed at studying
this stochastic differential equation and to pose and investigate the random
inverse problems associated with it. ***
