A modern, near-infrared camera for the University of Wyoming Infrared
Observatory will be built. The Wyoming Wide-Field Camera will be based around a
2048x2048 Hawaii-2 HgCdTe detector and will include a prime focus corrector and
two cryogenic 5-position filter wheels. The camera will be placed at the f/2.1
prime focus of the Wyoming Infrared Observatory 2.3-m telescope and will produce
a plate scale of 0.76 arcsec/pixel and a field of view of 26 arc min. The
instrument will play a leading role in the newly restructured graduate and
undergraduate astronomy programs at the University of Wyoming and boost the
science and technology infrastructure in the Wyoming region.
