9351858 Bagenal The goal of the project is to enhance science literacy of the
1200 non-science majors who take introductory astronomy courses at CU. a
significant improvement to our undergraduate astronomy classes and labs results
with the introduction of hands-on computer experiences to augment the present
telescopic observing. the observing experience is being enriched from one in
which the students look at a few brighter objects through the telescope to one
in which they can observe many more much fainter objects with a state of the art
CCD camera attached to the telescope and then manipulate the image themselves on
a PC, finishing by making a hard copy of their results that they can keep. This
is effectively the difference between astronomy 100 years ago and astronomy of
today. What is needed is a way for the students to fit their observations into
the material that they are learning in the rest of the course: the discovery of
the layout of the solar system, the celestial motions, comparisons of different
types of celestial objects, the organization of material from molecular clouds
to star clusters to galaxies, etc. This is much easier when students have images
that they can access on a computer screen or on a hard copy that they can
measure. The process of making one's own observation, manipulating the image,
measuring such things as stellar magnitudes and positions, and making a print to
keep are vital parts of the experience. The project uses two CCD cameras
attached to currently-existing 24" and 18" telescopes. Separately, the
University of Colorado has been asked to provide 10 personal computers, a SUN
Sparc II workstation and a high resolution printer. In addition, the project
uses 10 CD- ROM readers to allow the students to access large data bases of
planetary and astrophysical images for use during daytime and cloudy nights. ***
