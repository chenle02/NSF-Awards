The investigator will devise, improve, and analyze methods for the numerical
simulation of complex physical phenomena modeled by partial differential
equations. Three major areas of application will be studied, each requiring
special methods: computational relativity, certain important classes of
differential equations arising from incompressible fluid flow and from
electromagnetism, and linearly elastic plates.

In the area of computational relativity, the work is motivated by the search for
gravitational radiation using the LIGO detector, presently under construction.
LIGO is the prime example of a new generation of gravitational wave detectors,
and is being designed to detect gravity waves (which have hitherto escaped
detection due to their small amplitude). If the detected wave can be analyzed to
determine the nature of the massive but distant astronomical event which gave
birth to it (e.g., the spiraling coalescence of a pair of black holes), then
LIGO will become mankind's first window on the universe that can "see" beyond
the electromagnetic spectrum (light and radio signals). The proposed project is
to devise efficient algorithms to enable such analyses to be performed on high
performance computers. These algorithms are based on Einstein's equations
underlying general relativity. The investigator will both extend and apply
already completed computer codes for the constraint equations, purely spatial
partial differential equations arising from the Einstein equations, and will
also study the problem of numerically solving the Einstein evolution equations.
This is highly interdisciplinary work, involving extensive collaboration between
the investigator, a mathematician, and his group, and physicists and
astronomers.

The second area of study concerns the developments of multigrid algorithms and
supporting theory for solving certain sorts of differential equations which have
hitherto resisted such approaches. Multigrid algorithms, which exploit a
decomposition of the desired solution into components on many different scales,
are among the most efficient algorithms invented for solving many sorts of
differential equations. However for an important class of problems arising from
incompressible continua and another group of problems arising from Maxwell's
equations of electromagnetism, new multigrid approaches are required.

Finally the investigator will collaborate on a monograph on the theory of
elastic plates, including modeling, analysis, and numerical simulation. There
has been extensive progress in these areas over the past decade, and the book
will serve as both a reference for workers in the field and in the active field
of elastic shell modeling, and as an introduction for researchers new to the
area.
