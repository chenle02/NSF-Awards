Bridge management is concerned with the improvement of existing bridges through
systematic inspection and maintenance. Inspection of bridges in the United
States is normally performed at two-year intervals, subject to change if
requested by state agencies. A bridge deterioration model obtained through
statistical analysis of bridge inspection data as well as reliability evaluation
of the bridge can be used as a basis for the selection of a more objective
inspection interval. The statistical analysis will be applied to bridges in
states with more diverse environmental and climatic conditions for a more
complete evaluation of the current inspection practice. A methodology is
presented for quantifying inspection intervals using reliability analysis and
determining existing and future reliabilities of a bridge. The conceptual
inspection strategy schedules bridge inspection based on the prediction of the
bridge condition. A simple bridge case study is presented to show the
effectiveness of such program. Certain assumptions and approximations that are
made for this case study will be studied in detail and a comprehensive
reliability based inspection strategy will be developed. The National Bridge
Inventory lacks structural properties that are needed in the reliability
analysis. Recommendations will be presented for the creation of a bridge
database using existing Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) technology.
