This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project targets the
development of an innovative environmentally friendly active-passive natural
fiber-reinforced composite (APNFC) material that can be used for control of
noise and vibrations in a wide variety of noisy environments. The development of
this innovative material concept is a result of integrating two emerging
technologies, natural fiber-reinforced composites having excellent acoustical
properties, and state-of-the-art active noise control technology. The unique
design of the proposed composite material will reduce noise transmission over a
broad band of frequencies through a combination of absorption and dissipation
phenomena.

The success of this research will revolutionize the design of practically all
noise generating machines. This material can lead to manufacture of a wide
variety of 'quiet' machinery and/or appliances; for example, quiet vacuum
cleaners, lawn mowers, washers/dryers, and aircraft cabins. Currently, no
material is known to exist which has the capability to provide passive-plus-
active control. Noise and vibration control pose a challenging problem in
various engineering disciplines.
