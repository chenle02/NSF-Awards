ABSTRACT CTS-9702327 In this project, a novel strategy for enhancing growth
rates of solid particulate products of combustion is tested. The technique
involves the irradiation of the effluent stream from a dirty combustion system
by an intense acoustic field; this enhances the aggregation of the soot and
facilitates its subsequent collection. Also, interesting flame dynamics occur
when the flame is embedded in the acoustic field. The coupling of the combustion
processes to the acoustics are determined. Control of flame properties by tuning
the acoustic field is attempted. Diagnostic's track soot production from the
flame through the acoustic field. Soot morphology is determined by sampling and
scattering measurements, impactor measurements characterize the soot size
distribution, and effects of the acoustic field on local flame properties are
followed by flowfield, temperature, and species measurements in the flame zone.
Computations complement the experimental work. The benefits of clarifying soot-
growth physics are significant. Most practical large-scale burners use turbulent
nonpremixed flames which potentially produce large amounts of soot, and the
impact of reducing the soot number concentration from the flame is
environmentally significant. Current regulations do not require characterization
of particulate size distribution in emissions, but recent fundings on health
risk factors many change this.
