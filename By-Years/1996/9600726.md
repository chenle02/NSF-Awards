A conference will be held on the subject of the latest developments in electron
scattering and photonuclear reactions. This is a biennial meeting. The topics
include: the spin and flavor structure of the nucleon, structure of the delta
resonance, the short-range structure of the deuteron and few-body systems, tests
of chiral perturbation theory and low energy predictions of QCD, and short-range
correlations and nuclear medium effects. All of these topics are at the
forefront of nuclear research, worldwide. The meeting will permit researchers to
compare techniques and results which will in turn help them to plan their future
activities and produce the most insightful results. The resources provided will
allow very well qualified young people to attend the meeting - researchers who
would not otherwise be able to attend.
