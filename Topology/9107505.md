Matic will study a theory of moduli spaces of anti-self-dual connections for
pairs, and a Yang-Mills theory for parabolic stable bundles in dimensions four
and two. She will also work on Floer homology for rational homology spheres.
This project also includes partial support for the annual Georgia Topology
Conference. Matic's research combines theoretical physics with topology and
differential geometry in the following way. The physics concerns topological
quantum field theories. These lead to invariants of the underlying spaces on
which they are defined. Although differential geometric constructions are
involved as intermediaries, in the end quantities are derived which depend only
on the topological and not the geometric character of the spaces.
