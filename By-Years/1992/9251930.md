This project will improve the first-semester laboratory in Human Chemistry, a
course for nurses and physician's assistants. The project will enhance the
student's learning experience beyond that found in a traditional lecture and wet
chemistry laboratory. This involves overcoming prior deficiencies, developing
the ability to analyze and conclude, and nurturing a student's desire for
inquiry. An interactive workstation laboratory that consists of specially
equipped IBM PS/2 57's attached to laserdisc players, using Exploring Chemistry
II, an interactive videodisc laboratory in general chemistry, will accomplish
these goals. Fifteen additional interactive videodisc experiments will be
included with the ten wet chemistry experiments already in the laboratory
schedule.
