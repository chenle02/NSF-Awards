This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
characterize lead-free adhesives with very high thermal and electrical
conductivity for wide bandgap semiconductor packaging. The company will build on
its IP portfolio of fluxing adhesive binder systems to formulate polymer fluxes
suitable for low-temperature, lead-free solders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
development of cost effective, high performance packaging systems will hasten
the adoption of wide bandgap semiconductor components for high power electronic
and optoelectronic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
