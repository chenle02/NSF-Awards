This project addresses the control of multiple interconnected mechanical
systems. Such systems have applications ranging from robots in factories to
spacecraft with multiple appendages. The research objective is the development
of an efficient computational algorithm for minimum time control synthesis of
such systems, and the feedback implementation of such systems. Current
approaches to controlling this class of system suffer from time consuming
computational difficulties in convergence to the optimal solution. This project
attempts to refine the current method and increase the algorithmic efficiency.
The research comprises four steps, including (1) development of an efficient
computational algorithm for open loop minimum time control synthesis using
continuation methods and bifurcation theory, (2) development of closed loop
implementation schemes for executing the resulting minimal time trajectory, (3)
validation of these methods by both simulation and experimentation, and (4)
exploration of the possibility of generalization to flexible body systems and
problems with state constraints.
