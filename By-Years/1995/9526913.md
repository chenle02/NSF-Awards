Abstract 9526913 Murcray This project makes use of the infrared absorption and
emission characteristics of important atmospheric constituents, especially many
of those which are involved in the chemical destruction of stratospheric ozone.
Examples include both chlorofluorocarbon-11 and 12, ozone, nitric oxide, nitric
dioxide, nitric acid, nitrous oxide, chlorine nitrate, hydrogen chloride and
many more. A very high resolution Michelson interferometer will be operated at
McMurdo which will make measurements of some 30 chemical species in absorption
using the sun as a source of infrared radiation. Another Michelson
interferometer, with higher sensitivity but lower resolution, will continue to
be operated at South Pole in the emission mode, which allows it to measure a
number of important trace species throughout the entire year, especially during
the long winter darkness. This is especially important for understanding the
conditions leading up to the annual ozone hole. This project is jointly
supported by NSF's Divisions of Polar Programs and Atmospheric Sciences and by
NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth, ***
