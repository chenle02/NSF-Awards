Professor Gordon will continue to investigate problems in the topology of low-
dimensional manifolds, especially those related to knot theory. A particular
topic that will receive attention is Dehn surgery on knots and links, a
construction that is relevant to many fundamental questions concerning the
structure of 3-dimensional manifolds. The structure of three-dimensional
manifolds, very natural geometric objects of the same dimension as the space in
which we live, remains an important and surprisingly mysterious subject for
mathematical investigation.
