This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of electroanalytical chemistry research. Professor Dennis C. Johnson
will examine new methods for electrochemically analyzing for organic amine
compounds following their separation by liquid chromatography. Studies on the
fundamental mechanisms by which organic amines undergo electron transfer
reactions at gold and platinum electrodes will be done so that new methods of
electrochemical analyses for these compounds can be developed. This knowledge
will then be used to devise pulsed voltammetric schemes that will minimize the
fouling of these electrode surfaces that is seen when single applied potentials
are used. Continuous analyses of organic amines following liquid chromatographic
separation will then be possible.
