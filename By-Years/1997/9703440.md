This research is on design methodologies for low power VLSI design. Research
activities include the following. First, developing an understanding of low-
power I/O encodings and their application to practical problems. The approach is
to obtain new practical Limited-Weight codes, and extend low-power coding
methods to other data distributions (e.g. Gaussian data) and to other bus models
(e.g. with cross-coupled capacitance). Second, extending a locally developed
prototyping tool to system-level power estimation, and developing a prototyping
test-bed for validating theoretical advances and as an education tool. Finally,
an exploration of implementing low-power codes in real applications is being
undertaken with industrial partners in order to improve the practical relevance
of theoretical results.
