The efficient and timely delivery of urban freight is a key factor in
determining the economic health and sustainability of urban centers and their
surrounds. Urban freight consists of both large shipments needed to replenish
retail inventories and small parcels that fulfill electronic and telephonic
commerce initiated by individual consumers. This study will develop new urban
freight transportation planning and pricing tools that recognize the intrinsic
uncertainty of freight demands, costs and delivery times. A family of
mathematical models in the form of stochastic dynamic games, and their robust
counterparts, that exploit recent advances in revenue management and nonlinear
pricing theory will be created to describe a variety of urban settings. Fixed
point algorithms, descent in Hilbert space and agent based simulation will be
employed to solve these models for hypothetical data and, thereby, develop
rules-of-thumb to guide urban planners and freight company operators in
configuring urban freight networks and pricing urban freight services.

This research will provide models and algorithms that can be integrated with
evolving information technology and decision support systems for influencing
urban and suburban traffic congestion. Urban freight planning that directly
considers the risk to shippers of untimely deliveries, the risks to carriers of
penalties for violating quality of service guaranties, and the risks to private
vehicles of excessive congestion will be possible, for the first time. Moreover,
the results of this research will allow planners to quantify the advantages of
restricting truck-based deliveries to particular times of day or particular
routes, including the possible assignment of a unique time and route to each
specific truck. Additionally, time-of-day tolls and auction-based strategies
that charge delivery vehicles for access to congested areas will be facilitated
by tools developed in this study.
