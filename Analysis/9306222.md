Penney will continue his investigation to determine what aspects of the
harmonic analysis of Hermitian symmetric spaces generalize to non-symmetric
situations. Particular questions yet to be resolved are (a) how to characterize
the Poisson integrals of hyperfunctions on the boundary and (b) how to treat
unbounded domains. The first step will be to determine if there exist on a
bounded homogeneous domain a system of differential operators which annihilates
the Gindikin-Poisson kernel. The basic idea behind Penney's project can be seen
already in the motion group of the line, which consists of translations and
reflection about zero. The quotient of the motion group by the reflection
subgroup is naturally isomorphic to the line. Similarly, more general geometric
objects can be realized as the quotient of a transformation group by a certain
subgroup. This introduces natural classes of group invariant operators on the
geometric space, and analysis is developed using eigenfunctions of the group
invariant operators.
