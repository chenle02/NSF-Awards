Recursive query languages such as Datalog make "knowledge-base" systems highly
expressive. However, such languages are difficult to compile into efficient
code. This project will combine work on high level program transformations with
techniques developed for logic databases to produce a Datalog compiler that will
give cleaner and more efficient code than has been currently reported. In
particular, transformations will be used that translate systems of fixed point
equations into procedural programs that are further improved by finite
differencing (a transformation that uncovers and implements critical
invariants). The resulting code would then be amenable to more conventional
optimization techniques. Two other related problems will be investigated, (1) to
give the compiler the capability to analyze performance mechanically; and (2) to
incrementally compute relations recursively defined in Datalog clauses.
