Serotonin, a compound found throughout the central nervous system of mammals,
is involved in the transmission of impulses between nerve cells. Though small in
number, serotonergic nerve cells have been implicated in many important
phenomena such as sleep, control of food intake and pain. The aim of this
research is to develop a method to isolate serotonergic nerve terminals,
purifying the cells in an intact, functioning state. This investigation entails
of developing a complete set of specific fluorescent markers for serotonin
neurons. Dr. Wolf will utilize high affinity serotonin analogues which will
incorporate a sulfhydryl group to the primary amino group of serotonin.
Fluorescein, a fluorescent marker, and other suitable markers, can be coupled
through the sulfhydryl group to the analogues. The markers are absorbed by
serotonergic neurons which become visible under a fluorescent microscope. The
results of this exploratory study will advance our understanding in the
regulation and the biochemical basis of serotonergic neurotransmission.
