The Universtiy Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) proposes to continue
to operate the NSFNET Network Service Center (NNSC) for a period of 10 months.
The NNSC is operated through a subcontract with Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN)
who will continue to work with other agencies providing network information
services to the internet but providing unique functions for the NSFNET
community. These functions include end-user services such as maintaining and
disseminating on-line information, operating a hotline, presenting short
courses, seminars and workshops in support of end-user services. The NNSC will
also provide public information services which are focused on the needs of
NSFNET users and their technical support staff. These include publishing
newsletters and bulletins, managing mailing lists, assisting authors in writing
about NSFNET and disseminating promotional materials. ***//
