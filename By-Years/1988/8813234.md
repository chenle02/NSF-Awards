Dr. Kidd will continue his work to collect, preserve, and analyze DNA from a
large series of anthropologically significant populations. Through collaboration
with field anthropologists who will provide blood samples, Dr. Kidd will
preserve material as Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines.
The DNA of these samples will then be studied for several DNA polymorphisms
(RFLPS). One goal of this work is to construct a data bank from as large a
number of populations as possible. Because the number of highly polymorphic
RFLPs is much greater than the number of classical genetic markers, they provide
a much improved tool for determining the affinities between different
populations. Secondly, Dr. Kidd will pursue three related goals: 1. estimation
of genetic distance between all populations in order to infer the phylogenetic
relationships among the groups, 2. investigation of the amount and nature of
variability within and between groups for the purpose of inferring population
demographic history, and 3. investigation of the possibility of observing the
operation of natural selection in human populations. Prehistorians and
historians are interested in tracing the movements of human populations.
Unfortunately, written records appear only late in the human record, and
archaeological evidence is often ambiguous. Many provocative hypotheses have
been proposed about the relationships of different groups but with traditional
data these are difficult to prove or disprove. Through analysis of DNA RFLPS,
Dr. Kidd's research should help to provide answers.
