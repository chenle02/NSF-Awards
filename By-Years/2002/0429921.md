ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0429921&lt;br/&gt;Hassoun, Soha&lt;br/&gt;Tufts
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scaling of CMOS technologies has delivered
astronomical increases in transistor density and performance,&lt;br/&gt;leading
to more chip functionality at higher speeds. Several problems are expected to
plague nanometer designs:&lt;br/&gt;robustness to process and operating
variations; long-term reliability due to electromigration and soft errors; and
power density, with static power density approaching or exceeding the dynamic
one. Novel solutions spanning materials, devices, circuits, microarchitectures
and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools are required to overcome these
problems.&lt;br/&gt;We focus in this proposal on CAD tools for double-gate
devices, novel transistor structures with more than one gate terminal to control
the transistor channel. Compared to MOSFETs, double-gate devices promise
substantial improved control over leakage current and short channel effects
while delivering high drive currents.&lt;br/&gt;
