A three-day workshop will be conducted to synthesize information and evaluate
critically important unresolved issues, the means for pursuing those issues and
the logistics and support needed to improve our understanding of the Arctic
Ocean sea ice-snowpack-atmosphere interactions. The Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice-
Interactions (OAII) Scientific Steering Committee, a component of the ARCSS
science program, endorsed this workshop. A primary goal of the workshop is top
plan a series of field campaigns, model development studies and laboratory
studies aimed at understanding air-snow-ice-water chemical exchange and how this
influences climate. Key scientists in the relevant sub-disciplines will be
involved and will bring together investigators that would not normally interact.
Linkages and leverages to the U.S. effort will also be identified. The workshop
product will be a preliminary research plan defining the objectives and
logistical needs for field, laboratory and modeling work. The meeting will
further address the wider ARCSS goals pertaining to OAII type research and
address the implementation issues in the context of the new thematic phase of
ARCSS.
