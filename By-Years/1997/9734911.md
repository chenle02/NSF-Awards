Current theory does little to predict, explain or analyze the empirically
observed success of search and optimization heuristics for some domains of NP-
complete problem and their failure for others. Without such a theory,
implementers of heuristics have no guidance as to whether a particular heuristic
method is suitable for a particular problem domain, what kind of performance to
expect, or how to set the various parameters for better performance.
Implementation is often done in a haphazard way based on little more than guess-
work or trial-and-error. The following inter-related lines of theoretical
research will be explored to address this gap: (1) Extending average-case
complexity to consider reductions to and between problem distributions that
arise naturally ( in real-life, testing, cryptanalysis or combinatorics). (2)
Extending average-case analysis techniques to a more general characterization of
the relevant combinatorial properties of random problem instances from naturally
arising distributions. In particular, the properties of associated search spaces
for such problems. (3) For experimentally successful heuristic methods, identify
the combinatorial characteristics of problem instances that determine their
performance. (4) Investigate more efficient worst-case algorithms for NP
complete problems, identify those NP complete problems with nontrivial worst-
case algorithms, and explore the connection between lower and upper bounds.
Although the techniques used are solely mathematical, the motivation and
justification come from the experimental literature.
