Bird The award will support the renovation and replacement of Marine Organism
Culture facilities at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The
institution has a growing program in marine biology and is considered to be the
lead campus within the Consolidated University System of North Carolina for
growth in this area. The Marine Culture facilities support the current research
of ten faculty members and fifty seven students in the Masters' program, as well
as a number of undergraduates. A doctoral program in marine biology is currently
under discussion, and renovation of the ten-year old facility, which is limited
by the effects of corrosion and inadequate temperature control and air handling
systems, will be an important element of program growth. NSF support will
address required renovations in five areas of the seawater system including
improved water flow, distribution, filtration and temperature control;
replacement of the larviculture facility; provision of dry lab work space for
the benthic ecology projects; improvement of the marine plant tissue culture
facility; and restoration of the marine organism holding room.
