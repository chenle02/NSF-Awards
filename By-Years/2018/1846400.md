This workshop will bring together an international community of experts from
multiple disciplines to take action on the outcomes and recommendations from
Tephra workshops in 2014 and 2017, and seed the implementation and use of cyber
based tools and technologies in tephra studies. Tephra studies relate a unique
volcanic product that helps researchers to understand volcanic behavior, past
eruptions, and the effects of volcanoes on climate and the environment. They
provide time markers for geologic and prehistoric human events. The workshop and
follow on activities will be useful to provide information for
paleoclimatologists, archeologists and others who study environmental change and
its impacts on society, and will provide tools for consistent evaluation of
tephra layers, which are used extensively to date climatological and
environmental transitions. The Broader Impacts of these efforts include the
increased information access to a broad scientific community, and collaboration
and communication between diverse researchers. The 50 researchers will include
participants from under-represented groups in the
geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers intend to hold a series of
focused, international tephra workshops in 2019 to 2021.The goals are to
produce: (1) publication of a consensus paper to draw attention to the demand,
and to develop a coordination plan for creating comparable datasets across
disciplines, (2) multiple open access products, for example, best practice
templates, data collection and processing templates with end-user oriented
minimum sets of required data, and (3) collation of databases and already built
tools/code/software for data processing. These products are linked to future
directions for the communities interested in tephra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
