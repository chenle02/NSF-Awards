With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program,
Professor Ralph Mead from the University of North Carolina Wilmington and
colleague Pamela Seaton will acquire a gas chromatograph triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer (GC-MS/MS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and
education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterization of
photoproducts generated from the destruction of emerging contaminates in
natrural waters; (b) detection, identification and understanding of the
transport of pollutants on marine plastics; and (c) structural elucidation of
tructural elucidation of triglycerides in aquaculture raised fish to optimize
growth and assess nutritional quality.

A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer vaporizes and separates a multi component
mixture which then passes into the mass spectrometer where the components are
ionized. The mass spectrometer determines the mass/charge ratio of these
particles (parent molecular ion and fragment ions). This highly sensitive
technique allows determination of the masses of the particles, their chemical
composition and enables one to deduce the structure of the substances in a
complex mixture. The tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) involves multiple steps
with some form of fragmentation occurring between stages. The instrumentation
provided by this award will allow faculty and students the opportunity to pursue
research projects of environmental importance at the University of North
Carolina Wilmington. It will advance the training of many students in the use of
this important and widely used analytical technique.
