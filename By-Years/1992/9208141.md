This award will support a series of annual Workshops on Writing Skills for
Young Investigators. These workshops will be held at annual meetings of the
Institute of Mathematical Statistics or the American Statistical Association.
The goal of the workshop is to improve the technical writing skills of junior
investigators by their interactions with senior investigators and editors of
journals. This award will support a series of annual Workshops on Writing Skills
for Young Investigators. The first of these will be held in Boston,
Massachusetts in August, 1992. There will be two more workshops, one held in
each of the subsequent years in various locations.
