The effective thermal treatment of solid waste materials requires an
understanding of the physical and chemical phenomena which interact in a variety
of combustion environments. The objective of this research program is to define
the rate controlling steps and the heat and mass transfer limitations to
advanced incineration designs and to increased efficiency for existing systems.
The desorption of naphthalene and pyrene for soils will be studied in particle
and bed characterization reactors, and in a rotary kiln simulator. A circulating
fluidized bed combustor will be constructed to complement the reactor studies.
The relation between the operating temperature, gas environment, and the fate of
metals in incinerators will be investigated using GC/MS, ICP, and ESCA
analytical techniques. Computer simulation of the various reactors will
compliment the experimental work. The problem of organic and inorganic hazardous
waste disposal has become critical to the public and to the industrial
organizations responsible for their management. A systematic study of various
aspects of hazards elimination through combustion processes is essential to the
development of a safe technology for waste treatment.
