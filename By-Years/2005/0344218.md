Garlic mustard is an exotic invading species that is a pervasive problem in
northeastern forests. By monopolizing the forest understory and changing soil
biochemistry, it is known to limit biodiversity of both plants and animals. This
project is designed to reveal how water, nutrient and light availability
influence the growth rate of garlic mustard populations. Observations of more
than 40 populations growing in different environments will be used to construct
a model revealing how these resources influence seed production, germination,
and plant survival and thus the net population growth rate. This model will be
tested in a manipulative field experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing a
method to mechanistically link environmental variation to the growth rate of
populations is important not only for controlling exotic invasive species and
but also for preserving rare and endangered species. Results of this work will
help land managers selectively deploy different control strategies for garlic
mustard on the basis of environmental conditions and focus monitoring efforts on
areas where it is most likely to grow rapidly. Because this work is being
conducted at a small undergraduate institution with a student body composed of
at least 37% first-generation college students, it will provide hands-on
research experience for students typically underrepresented in the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
