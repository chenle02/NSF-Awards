DNA is wrapped around histone proteins within the nuclei of non-bacterial
organisms. Histone modifications are linked to a variety of nuclear activities.
The molecular mechanisms by which histone modifications function remain largely
unknown. In this work, a novel method was developed which allows the
identification of protein-protein interactions involving protein modifications,
including acetylation. Using this method, several novel acetylated histone
binding proteins were identified, implicated in a variety of functions,
including chromatin assembly, transcriptional regulation, meiotic recombination,
histone methylation, DNA damage repair, and mRNA metabolism. These results
suggest that the individual molecular functions of histone acetylation may be
unveiled by the studies of their interacting proteins. Given that histones
contain more than 30 acetylatable lysines, it is tempting to speculate that many
more chromatin functions are exerted via recruiting specific interacting
proteins for differently acetylated histones. In this project, an array of
acetylated histones for screening will first be created such that different
binding proteins that respond to the corresponding acetylation events can be
identified. Further functional analyses of such proteins will help reveal the
molecular functions of histone acetylation at a global scale. Furthermore,
chromatin functions are dynamically regulated via multiple modifications
including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. An
increasing number of reports also demonstrates the interplay between different
histone modifications. The current studies will provide both technical and
intellectual framework for studies of these other histone modifications.
