A Center for Learning and Teaching in Technology Education would provide a focus
for educating teachers and teacher educators who could implement the ideas of
technology education as described in the recently produced Standards for
Technological Literacy, as well as in the AAAS Benchmarks and the National
Science Education Standards. This planning grant is for the collaboration of the
technology teacher education community and research communities in science and
technology education. The planning determines a structure for graduate education
in science and technology education, creates an agenda for research into how
students learn technological concepts and how to use the information to
implement the ideas of technological education in classrooms, and develops a
technology teacher education curriculum.
