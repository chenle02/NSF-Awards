0106029 Heller 0106223 Dethier Widespread remnants of Cenozoic sedimentary rocks
in the central Rocky Mountains may indicate the former presence of a large post-
Laramide basin fill that has subsequently been largely removed. If such a
regional basin fill can be demonstrated, it would provide a regional marker for
determining the extent and rate of sediment removal and provide a marker for
vertical tectonic movement during the late Cenozoic. This project will combine
mapping fission-track and cosmogenic nuclide geochronometry to attempt to
determine the former extent and continuity of the post-Laramide basin fill, and
to search for possible tectonic or geologic causes of the observed changes.
Results will help clarify the competing effects of tectonic verses climatically
driven uplift.
