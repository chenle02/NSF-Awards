In addition to its presence in filarial nematode worms and several non-insect
arthropods, the bacterium Wolbachia infects more than one million insect
species, or about two-thirds of all described insect taxa; by virtue of its
widespread distribution alone, it is the most common intracellular bacterium on
earth. Wolbachia also has profound ecological and evolutionary effects on the
reproduction of its animal hosts, as well as other important biological
consequences. The primary means of transmission of Wolbachia from host to host
is vertical (hereditary) transmission, through passage from the adult female
host ovary to the offspring via the egg; there is also evidence of horizontal
(non-hereditary) transmission of Wolbachia among hosts. Given the biological
importance of this symbiotic bacterium, both for basic research and for its
applied potential in insect control, it is remarkable that so little is known
about the mechanism by which Wolbachia infects insect host cells. The aim of
this project is to elucidate this mechanism. In earlier research, the
investigator has shown that Wolbachia targets specific cell types in the insect
ovary, particularly the cellular environment supporting the stem cells (aka stem
cell niche) of insect ovaries during both horizontal and vertical transmission.
Bringing a suite of novel imaging and molecular tools to bear on the problem,
the investigator now plans to characterize the detailed mechanism by which this
targeting (tropism) of stem-cell-niches occurs. In addition to its strong
importance for understanding the biology of Wolbachia and the dynamics of
hereditarily-transmitted symbioses in general, this project also will contribute
fresh perspectives on the biology of stem cells. The project includes research
training and education on stem-cell and symbiosis biology for students from
high-school through graduate levels, including outreach workshops specifically
targeted to high-school girls and students from under-represented minorities.
