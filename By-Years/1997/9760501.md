*** 9760501 Deliwala There is a growing appreciation among biologists for high-
resolution microscopy that can rapidly image three-dimensional biological
samples of living tissue in real time without the need to slice the sample into
thin cross-sectional sections. Science Research Laboratory proposes to develop a
new method of optical microscopy, coherent nonlinear microscopy (CONM), that is
based on sample illumination by a series of femtosecond laser pulses. CONM
combines high resolution (better than 80 nm) with rapid three-dimensional
imaging and no requirement for oil or water immersion. The capability to rapidly
produce a high-resolution nonlinear image represents a major improvement over
both scanning confocal microscopy and the scanning interference microscope.
Phase I will demonstrate the soundness of the new microscopy concept, while
Phase 11 will be a proof of principle that will be based on a working laboratory
prototype. With its capability to perform real-time, high-resolution imaging, an
instrument based on coherent nonlinear microscopy will find numerous
applications in the three-dimensional biological imaging of living tissue, such
as genes and neurons, thereby providing a new technique that will enhance
genetic mapping and allow cell structure to be monitored in real time.
Additional commercial applications include the rapid measurement of critical
dimensions of microlithographic wafers and mask inspection for lithography. ***
