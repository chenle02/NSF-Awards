AST-0407125 Weinberg

Dramatic improvements in the observational data and advances in the theoretical
tools for describing the potentially complex relation between galaxies and mass
now allow us to test theories of galaxy formation and cosmological models
simultaneously. The theoretical side of this project focuses on the statistics
of galaxy clustering and the underpinnings of the halo occupation distribution
(HOD) framework. Additional theoretical work will use hydrodynamic and N-body
simulations to investigate the dependence on dark matter dynamics and on galaxy
type, redshift, and cosmology. Different clustering statistics carry
complementary information, and since the combination of a cosmological model
with a specified HOD determines all aspects of galaxy clustering, in principle a
large redshift survey can reveal the cosmological and galaxy parameters,
independently. The techniques developed will be applied to data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), yielding insights into galaxy formation physics and
tightening constraints on cosmological parameters.

The most direct broader impacts will come through student training and graduate
and undergraduate teaching, but the principal investigator is also involved in
public outreach and significant community service. The research will also help
to maximize the scientific return from the large investment in the SDSS, a major
national resource.
