In this project, the PI will integrate experiment and theory to measure and
understand the relationship between fluctuations of various observed quantities
and the responses of a living system to designed (pulsatile) perturbations. The
approach centers on a unique technology that the PI has developed and
implemented, combining microfluidics, single-cell imaging, quantitative
analysis, and stochastic modeling of growth and division of Caulobacter
crescentus. The project seeks to employ this approach to evaluate models for
growth control and the degree to which cells trade energy, speed, and accuracy;
identify relations constraining the statistics of cell-cycle periods under
steady and changing conditions; and engineer a system in which the interactions
between cells in a population can be modulated to study spontaneous symmetry
breaking. These goals are important for establishing the fundamental physics of
systems far from equilibrium. They also provide examples as to how scaling and
fluctuation relations can be used to provide direct constraints on regulatory
dynamics. In this way, these studies complement common biological methods for
assembling information about molecular concentrations and interactions. The
investigator seeks to bring core concepts of the project, such as the importance
of going beyond averages to study statistical distributions, to a broader
audience interested in living systems. To this end, the PI will develop a summer
course to introduce high school teachers to basic concepts in probability,
energy, and entropy in biological systems through hands-on experimentation and
self-guided web-based tutorials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being
jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of
Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
