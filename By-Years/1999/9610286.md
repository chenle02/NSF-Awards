9610286 Fried Optical elastomers, formed by cross-linking of polymeric liquid
crystals, possess important properties, such as stress-induced optical
switching, stress induced shifts in phase transition temperatures,
piezoelectricity, etc., that make them promising candidates for industrial
applications such as in integrated optics. The response of these materials under
biaxial loading is experimentally investigated in this project. The observations
from these experiments are being used to develop predictive tools that will
enhance the understanding of mechano-optical behavior of these materials and
thus the ability to effectively use these materials in industrial setting. ***
