This project establishes a microcomputer laboratory for Psychological Statistics
and Experimental Psychology. It increases the sophistication of data analysis
and simulation possible in Statistics and it enriches the research experience of
students in Experimental Psychology. It makes the microcomputer and its
associated technology central to the undergraduate experience in Psychology. A
cluster of 5 work- stations, a physiological data acquisition system, laser
printer, and the hardware to link the cluster to the campus- wide network as
well as statistical, simulation, and research software is provided by this
grant. The project ensures that undergraduates in Psychology receive rigorous
training in statistics, methodology, and experimental design. The computer-based
experience provides the foundation and the framework needed for advanced study
and research.
