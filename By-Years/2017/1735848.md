Science plays a critical role in informing the multi-trillion dollar investment
needed to rebuild and modernize American infrastructure to better serve societal
needs. This science policy research report will address the science-to-action
gap for infrastructure by identifying how public investments can be better
managed to produce information to inform the next generation of infrastructure
design, construction and operation. This review will help guide science policy-
makers on investments best suited to inform the rebuilding and expansion of
modern, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure critical to support U.S.
businesses, communities, and citizens in the 21st
century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing upon pertinent and critical evidence on
science and boundary organizations, and related practitioner expertise, this
research utilizes innovative and robust methods to advance fundamental knowledge
about the science-action-gap for infrastructure investment. The collaborative
research team will identify evidence-based science policy ideas through a series
of input gathering methods, including expert elicitation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
