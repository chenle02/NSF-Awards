Agnostoid tribolites are proving to be among the best indices for global
correlation of Cambrian strata. A taxonomic monograph of the Middle Cambrian
agnostoids of North America and Greenland is in progress, and is an
indispensable foundation for concurrent synthesis of a global agnostoid
zonation. Continuing taxonomic a study will be based on numerous agnostoid
collections already in hand, new collections to be obtained, and many
collections of the Canadian, Greenland, and United States geological surveys.
Collections from a representative, agnostoid-rich, Middle Cambrian section in
central China are being studied for comparison. Arrangements have been made to
begin a similar biostratigraphic investigation of poorly known agnostoid faunas
in Argentina. Results of the project are expected to be of value to a working
group of the Cambrian Subcommision, whose goal is the establishment of a
meaningful biochronological division of Cambrian time. An ancillary project is
the continuing description and analysis of associated fossils of extraordinary
interest, especially soft-bodied animals and non-calcareous algae.
