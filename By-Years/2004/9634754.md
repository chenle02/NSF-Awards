ABSTRACT CTS-9634754 Geoffrey L. Price Cu-exchanged zeolites (MFI and Beta) will
be characterized by chemisorption, TPD, TPR, IR, and EXAFS/XANES. The mechanisms
and kinetics of reactions of amines to nitriles and imines oligomers and isomers
will be studied over those catalysts. The role of the various types of oxides
and oxidation states of Cu, the zeolite structures, the amine structure, and the
presence or absence of hydrogen gas, will be identified, with the objective of
better characterizing the catalytic properties of these materials.
