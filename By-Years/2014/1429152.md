Conduct problems in childhood increase risk for school failure, adolescent
substance use, and criminality in adulthood. Little is known, however, about the
early antecedents of childhood conduct problems in prenatal through late toddler
stages. To address this research gap, this project examines family influences on
the development of self-regulation, specifically executive functions and
behavioral self-control, in early childhood. The key broader impacts of this
research include new knowledge about mechanisms that increase risk for conduct
problems and insights into ways to prevent these problems from developing into
poor lifetime outcomes.

In this study, the researchers will follow a sample of 400 expectant mothers and
their partners over three years and collect a variety of data on physiology,
behavior in structured interactions, and executive function and emotion
regulation. A major innovation of the project is its focus on the role of stress
and stress hormones in the development of both parents and children. The
researchers are interested in ways in which high levels of stress hormones in
the expectant mother influence the child prenatally through effects on nervous
system development and also on mother-child, mother-father, and father-child
interaction in infancy through toddlerhood. A second innovation of this project
is a focus on fathers and the ways in which fathers may decrease or increase
risk associated with maternal factors. A third area of innovation concerns the
international nature of the sample, which will include 200 expectant mother-
father pairs in the United Kingdom and 100 each in the United States and the
Netherlands. This aspect of the proejct will allow the researchers to conduct
cross-country analyses and assess the generalizability of the findings and
perhaps suggest how cultural factors impact development.
