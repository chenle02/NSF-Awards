The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
mathematics between Dragoslav Herceg of the University of Novi Sad and Eugene
Allgower of Colorado State University is to investigate numerical solutions of
nonlinear algebraic and differential equations. The complementary strengths and
expertise of the U.S. and Yugoslav investigators in this field could lead to
some innovative work. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board
on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds
are involved. The grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to
the principal Yugoslav institute. Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to
Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living
expenses in the U.S.
