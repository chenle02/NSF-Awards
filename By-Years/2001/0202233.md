The investigators will use line-of-sight (LOS) velocity drift measurements from
the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) to characterize the statistical
nature of velocity variability in the high latitude ionosphere. They will use
the existing SuperDARN dataset to determine the temporal variability in LOS
measurements on 100X45 km spatial scales and 1 minute time scales over the
entire high latitude ionosphere. It has been shown that variability in the
convection electric field is a significant factor in determining the amount of
Joule heating in this region. General circulation models of the thermosphere use
statistical or averaged convection electric fields which contain no information
about the small-scale variability and thus seriously underestimate the amount of
Joule heating. The wide coverage of the SuperDARN radars will allow
determination of the relationships between velocity variability and
magnetospheric features. The resulting comprehensive characterizations of the
electric field variability will facilitate more realistic inputs to global
models and better understanding of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.
