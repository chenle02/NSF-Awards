Quantum computers hold the promise of transformative improvements to our ability
to solve hard data processing problems by taking advantage of quantum mechanical
phenomena including superposition states and entanglement. This project will
continue experimental development of a quantum information processor based on
qubits encoded in Rubidium atoms, and quantum logic gates that are mediated by
interactions between highly excited atomic Rydberg states. The experimental
approach uses laser cooled Rubidium atoms stored in optical traps. Ensemble
qubits that use many atoms instead of one for storing quantum information have
advantageous properties for transmitting quantum information. In this project
ensemble qubits subject to Rydberg atom interactions will be studied and their
use for single atom loading, fast quantum measurements, and efficient light-atom
quantum interfaces will be demonstrated. The broader impacts of this work are
twofold. First, this research will contribute to the development of a large
scale quantum processor that exceeds the capabilities of conventional classical
computers. The availability of such a device would have far reaching impact on
numerical mathematics, information security, and problems in the simulation of
quantum systems related to the development of new, technologically valuable
materials. Second, the research program will contribute to the training of
students and postdoctoral researchers for careers in science and engineering.
People from diverse backgrounds will be educated and trained in modern
experimental science, and will be equipped to bridge the boundary between
physics and information science. Training will occur via curriculum enrichments,
and through direct participation in the University based research program. We
will also inform the local community about the importance of physics to
information technology, and new developments in the area of quantum information
science. Outreach to the public will be facilitated by public visiting days at
the Physics department, laboratory tours, and faculty visits to local schools.
