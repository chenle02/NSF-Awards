9714882 Mackie This is a proposal to continue research begun under a one-year
pilot project for investigating upper mantle electrical conductivity structure
under the North American continent and urrounding oceans using very long period
magnetotelluric (MT) data. A reanalysis of existing long period data sets
collected primarily near oceans and on islands will be complemented with the
acquisition of new MT data sets in continental areas, for which there is
currently a paucity of data. The PIs propose to use telephone lines connected to
buried electrodes near magnetic observatories for recording the electric field
data, which will be combined with the magnetic data from the observatory to
compute MT response functions. Under the pilot project, they have successfully
instrumented the Tulsa, Oklahoma magnetic observatory, and they plan to
instrument the Boulder, Colorado observatory in early 1997. This continuation
grant will provide funding to instrument two additional observatories, and to
continue the recording over a period of three years in order to obtain stable
estimates of the long period MT response functions. ***
