9500468 Stebe The equipment grant provides funds to purchase equipment to
construct a photon-counting total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF)
apparatus and a TIRF microscope with video- digitization and photobleaching
fluorescence recovery capabilities to establish the Laboratory for
Bioengineering at Interfaces (LBI). TIRF methods are non-invasive, non-
destructive, and well suited for kinetic studies, as real time data can be
gathered on time scales ranging from seconds to hours. The fluorescence methods
will be used to study dynamic events at interfaces in three research area: 1)
interactions of proteins and block copolymers with engineered bilayers, 2)
cellular adhesion and aggregation to biomimetic surfaces, and 3) protein
adsorption at hydrogel-polymer interfaces in synthetic membranes. The work
carried out as described is expected to produce fundamental knowledge in the
field of molecular and cell dynamics at interfaces, and lead to new discoveries.
