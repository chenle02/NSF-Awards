This project will bring 10 undergraduate students to the University of Nebraska
for 10 weeks during the Summer of 1991 to do research into databases,
information retrieval, and expert systems. The format of this ten week summer
program includes formal instruction (lectures and seminars) in the morning and
active research in the afternoon. Sample projects include: "Inference Mechanisms
Based on a Multivalued Scale of Certainty", "Techniques for Dealing with
Imprecision, Uncertainty, and Information Incompleteness in Query Processing",
"Integrating Database Management Systems with Information Retrieval Systems" and
Incorporating a System-User Adaptation Mechanism into the Pure Boolean
Information Retrieval Process.
