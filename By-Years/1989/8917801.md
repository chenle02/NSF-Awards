Chlorofluoromethane measurements will be made during a cruise to examine the
interaction between the Deep Western Boundary Current and the Gulf Stream as
they cross near Cape Hatteras. The levels of CFCs will be used to determine the
boundaries of the DWBC and the average flow through ageing of the sampled water.
This is a cooperative project with the U. of Rhode Island which will do the
hydrographic and transport measurements.
