The objective of this program is to develop a new architecture for high-speed
phosphorescent devices based on the dynamic control of light emission at sub-
lifetime speeds. Direct, sub-lifetime modulation of light emission promises to
enable the development of compact, high-speed phosphorescent devices. Such
devices would have a transformative impact on communication, display, and
lighting technologies as well as applications in biological and chemical
sensing. The educational aspects include development of a laboratory-intensive
Photonics course that will emphasize the design of dynamic and reconfigurable
optical systems; development of a new Advanced Spectroscopy Workshop for
researchers, students, and teachers in Rhode Island; expansion of the
SearchLight Project to help promote the new Design Workshop maker space in the
Laboratory for Engineering, especially to train and support local community
members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual significance is
centered on the investigation of a new method for modulating the slowly decaying
emitters that form the basis for many modern optoelectronic devices. Rather than
modulating the excited state population, the goal is to modify the local optical
environment and directly modulate emission rates into different modes within the
excited state lifetime. The approach involves a program to demonstrate an
electrically-modulated light emitting device based upon the sub-lifetime
modulation of erbium emission near the telecom-wavelength of 1550 nm. In
addition, a new material platform for high-speed modulation based on leveraging
the electronic and vibronic emission from transition-metal phosphors will be
investigated. This program will enhance the understanding of dynamic processes
in both light emitting and phase change materials.
