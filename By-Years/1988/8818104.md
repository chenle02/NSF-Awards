The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the roles played by plant
chemistry in the ecology and evolution of a single taxon of herbivorous insects,
namely the butterfly family Papilionidae. Emphasis is placed on the chemical
basis of plant recognition by ovipositing females. Identification of contact
oviposition stimulants for the black swallowtail, Papilio polyxenes (tribe
Papilionini), will be extended from carrot, Daucus carota, to other
umbelliferous plants to assess the specificity of chemical response profiles in
one insect species. Identification of contact stimulants will also be carried
out with two subspecies of a close relative, P. machaon, which show apparent
steps in a host switch from the Apiaceae to the Asteraceae (genus Artemisia).
Identification of contact stimulants from Aristolochia species for Battus
philenor, a more distant relative (tribe Troidini), will be completed and
followed by similar studies with Eurytides marcellus, an Asimina-feeding species
belonging to yet a third tribe (Graphiini). These comparative studies will
permit testing of the long-held hypothesis that the adaptive radiation of
swallowtail butterflies has been constrained by preadaptation to particular
chemical compounds that are used as behavioral cues in host recognition.
