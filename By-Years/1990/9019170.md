The Second Biennial Mammalian Developmental Genetics Workshop will be held Bar
Harbor, 11-15 September, 1991. This second meeting builds on the highly
successful workshop held in Bar Harbor in 1989. Emphasis will be placed on the
mouse as a model species, with sessions on mouse developmental mutations,
imprinting, the genetic control of gametogenesis, the genetic control of
morphogenesis, the genetic control of lineage determination and functional
analysis of developmental genes through gene targeting. There will be an
informal afternoon discussion of the Genetic Control of Implantation led by an
invited speaker. Keynote presentations will focus on genes that control
development in insects and mammals, and on the genetics of human development.
Each session will begin with an invited 60 minute presentation providing an
overview of the research problems and progress for the subject of that section.
These overviews will be followed by three 20 minute more narrowly focused,
complementary presentations. Participation of graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows is encouraged.
