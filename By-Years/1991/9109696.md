Economic reform in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has attracted great
attention in the past year. Reforming governments have sought advice about how
to lay the foundations for the operation of capitalist market economies. A
necessary precondition for the proper functioning of capital markets is
implementation of clear and enforceable definitions of property rights, of which
bankruptcy laws are an important component. It is precisely these rights and
laws that are currently lacking in Eastern Europe. Although previous researchers
have produced legal or historical comparative studies of bankruptcy laws or
financial institutions, no modern analysis or theory exists for the transition
from socialism to capitalism. This research examines the problems of design and
implementation of bankruptcy laws and the link between bankruptcy statutes and
capital markets during the transition from centrally planning and largely state-
owned economies to market-oriented economies with private ownership. The study
is comparative, not only among the several East European states themselves, but
also regarding capitalist economies with longstanding bankruptcy systems. The
research methodology employs a combination of formal, mathematical modeling,
economic analysis of legal and financial developments, and gathering of data
regarding design and enforcement of bankruptcy laws in these two sets of
economies. This research should enhance our understanding of the role and
functions of law and of economic behavior under conditions of rapid social
transformation. It will contribute to the development of aspects of the theory
of financial reform necessary for the move from nonmarket to market economic
systems. Also, it is likely to advance knowledge about the economics of law and
the optimal strategies and policy options for legislative reform regarding key
economic laws such as bankruptcy.
