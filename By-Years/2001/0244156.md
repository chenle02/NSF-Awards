Site for Pervasive and Mobile

University of Alabama - Tuscaloosa&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EIA -
0244156&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joel Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a
collaborative effort of two Computer Science departments in two universities to
establish an REU site in Pervasive and Mobile Computing. The collaboration
supports 16 undergraduate students per year at the two campuses who would not be
otherwise exposed to research. This Site builds on complementary expertise of
the two institutions and on existing collaborative research projects in
pervasive and mobile computing. One university contributes expertise in wireless
systems and in minority student education, and the other will contributes
expertise in emergency reporting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-university
pervasive and mobile computing project is developing a system architecture for
integrating information appliances such as PDA's and 3G mobile phones into
first-responders' operations in emergency situations. The goal of the research
in which the undergraduates participate is to define not a particular
&lt;br/&gt;system but a framework for public-sector mobile data systems based on
empirical data derived from ongoing development of such systems.
