This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish
the performance of the Plasma Flow Source for stripping and residue cleaning of
photoresists on 200 mm semiconductor wafers without producing any
environmentally-damaging waste streams. In particular, it will determine the
effect of process conditions and gas chemistry on stripping rate and uniformity.
Measurements will be performed on standard and heavily implanted photoresists as
well as on patterned wafers following reactive ion etching. The novel Plasma
Flow Source system produces a large flux of oxygen atoms at low-temperatures and
pressures between 10 and 1000 Torr. It has been shown that this source strips
photoresists from 100 mm wafers at rates of up to 0.9micron/min at 120 C and 3.0
micron/min at 250 C, with excellent uniformity. The high ash rate observed at
120 C shows promise for removing heavily implanted resists and hardened residues
from reactive ion etched substrates. Moreover, operation at higher pressure
reduces gas consumption and dramatically decreases pumping requirements.

The knowledge gained from this study will establish the potential of this
exciting new technology for environmentally-benign, photoresist stripping of
wafers for next-generation semiconductor devices.
