This is a US-Polish collaborative research project on new possibilities for
Higgs physics and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). The principal
investigator is Dr. John Gunion from the University of California at Davis. His
Polish collaborator is Dr. Bohdan Grzadkowski from Warsaw University.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will focus on exploring new possibilities
for WESB and Higgs physics as well as on means for testing these new ideas using
forthcoming accelerator data.&lt;br/&gt;Progress made in this research area
could have profound impact on interpreting new accelerator data in such a way
that fundamental progress in the construction of an ultimate theory of
elementary particle/fundamental interactions will be possible. This project will
also provide US graduate students opportunities to enhance their experience and
familiarity with the global science and engineering
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in physics fulfills the program
objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern
Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
