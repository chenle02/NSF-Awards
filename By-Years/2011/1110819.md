A central goal of evolutionary biology is understanding how ecological diversity
arises and is maintained in natural populations. White Creek, in Yellowstone
National Park, is home to a population of the cyanobacterium, Mastigocladus
laminosus, which grows along a thermal gradient of 37 to 55ÂºC. While genetically
identical for much of the genome, the population has members that have
specialized and adapted to live at different temperature zones along creek. This
study takes an innovative approach using genomic data to identify strong
candidates for genes responsible for natural variation within the population and
that are temperature associated. Genes thus identified can shed light on the
type, function, and number of genes involved in thermal adaptation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental questions regarding how ecological niches
develop in populations are: 1) what kind of genes are involved, regulatory or
protein encoding? 2) What do the genes encode? and 3) How many genes are
involved? This study's unique focus on a natural population facing a well
defined environmental gradient, allows a robust analysis of associations between
genetic makeup and the environmental variable. Undergraduate researchers in the
University of Montana's Introductory Multicultural Summer Undergraduate Research
Experience and the HHMI supported Montana Integrative Learning Experience for
Students have had and will continue to have opportunities to work in the lab on
this study. An educational module on microbiology and evolution will be
developed from this study for use by Ecology Project International, which draws
high school students from all over the U.S. and Latin America to Yellowstone NP.
