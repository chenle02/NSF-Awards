9405354 Landau This grant is in support of a Workshop on Recent Developments in
Computer Simulation Studies in Condensed Matter Physics to be held at the
University of Georgia February 28 - March 4, 1994. The workshop provides a
"hands-on" environment to discuss new research results in condensed matter and
materials physics, present new computational methods and to test new hardware.
Attendence of young scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral associates is
encouraged. The workshop is particularly important in promoting the use of
massively parallel computers with the computational materials and condensed
matter physics communities. %%% ***
