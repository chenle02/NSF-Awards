9514402 Weiss A U.S.-Latin American workshop will be given May 25-27, 1996 at
the Universidade Federal de Rural, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on problems in the
area of time-resolved experiments in photochemistry, photophysics, and
photobiology. Invited participants include scientists from 9 U.S. states, Puerto
Rico, and 3 South American countries. The workshop will be coordinated by
Richard Weiss from Georgetown University, and Frank Quina of the University of
Sao Paulo, with the cooperation of the Inter-American Photochemical Society
advisory board and president. Moreover, 2 additional U.S. participants will be
selected competitively from junior faculty and post-doc applicants. The
organization of the workshop, including the selection of participants, promises
a healthy interaction and the potential for establishing new long-term
collaborations between U.S. and South American scientists. Because of recent
equipment acquisitions in several South American photochemical research
laboratories, this is an especially appropriate time for establishing a baseline
for where the field is and where it is going. As much of the workshop focus will
be on methodology, this also provides a forum for interchange of experimental
methods necessary for the proper use of the sophisticated equipment. ***
