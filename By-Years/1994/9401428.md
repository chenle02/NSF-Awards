9401428 Hochster This award supports research in commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. The principle investigator will continue investigating
several long standing questions in the theory of Noetherian rings, to explore
the relationship of these questions with the burgeoning theory of tight closure,
including its relationship to absolute integral closures and to achieve a better
understanding of the geometric significance of the condition on a ring that all
of its ideals be tightly closed. The faculty associate will study primary
decompositions of ideals, tight closure, mixed multiplicities, joint reductions
and ideals generated by monomials in a system of parameters in a local ring.
This research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families of
polynomial equations. One can either study the geometry of the solution set or
approach problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the
solution set that form what is called a commutative ring. This dual perspective
creates a close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
