This research will enable important advances in sustainable agriculture and food
security to be achieved. The project investigates how disease-causing microbes
deploy groups of molecules to damage plants. The information gleaned will be
used for college curriculum development. Furthermore, it will be disseminated to
scientists through peer-reviewed publications and the general public through
discussions at public community festivals. Diverse students will receive cutting
edge training as they work to achieve the goals of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bacterial plant pathogens translocate into plants
effector proteins that form physical and functional networks that suppress plant
defenses and thus damage plants. A new perspective is that effectors encounter
each other in multiple compartments (microbe and host). Emergent functions of
effector consortia include additive and antagonistic behaviors that arise from
interactions between the effectors, some of which lead to posttranslational
modifications (PTMs). The goal of this research is to determine whether effector
network biochemical interactions events occur in bacteria as well as in plants,
and to further characterize network interactions, with a focus on whether
effectors form higher order complexes. The approaches include mass spectrometry
to detect effector-catalyzed PTMs and binding experiments to investigate
effector-effector interactions and the impact of PTMs on
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
