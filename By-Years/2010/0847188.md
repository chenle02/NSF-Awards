This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this CAREER award the PI will
develop and test general theories of cytoskeletal organization, and thereby
obtain an understanding of the architecture and dynamics of the metaphase
spindle. The project will use fluorescence and polarized light microscopy, in
conjunction with magnetic tweezers and biochemical approaches, to study the
spindle's internal fluctuations, structure, and response to perturbations. The
results of these quantitative experiments will be compared with predictions from
coarse-grained models of cytoskeletal behavior. The educational component of the
project will bridge the gap between physical scientists and biologists. This
will be accomplished by promoting interdisciplinary research, developing an
undergraduate course to teach cell biology to physicists and engineers, the
creation of an interdisciplinary, graduate level, project based laboratory
class, and will incorporate basic quantitative methods into biology education at
the high school level.
