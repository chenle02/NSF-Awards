9522743 DeVries The general goals of this research are the development of bases
for better performance predictions, improved reliability of design methods and
to explore processes by which structure might be altered to enhance polymer and
composite material performance. This project will study the combined effects of
stress and common industrial environmental agents on the structural integrity of
polymeric materials. It also will explore and interrelate the fracture/failure
phenomena from the microscopic scale to the macro level. It is noted, for
example, that the rate of degradation is particularly severe for many very high
strength oriented polymers. ***
