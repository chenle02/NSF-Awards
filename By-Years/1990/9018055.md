This award will support an investigation of transverse geologic structure within
the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM), a major intracontinental mountain belt that
developed along the crustal boundary between the subcontinents of East and West
Antarctic. The TAM appear to be a rift-margin uplift related to extensional
tectonism within the Antarctic Plate during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Offsets
in the TAM suggest an along-strike structural segmentation analogous to that
seen in other continental rift systems. In contrast to other rift systems,
however, there is no change in tilt direction between segments, and transverse
structures in the TAM are associated with physiographic troughs that may
represent tensional "pull apart" zones. Kinematic analysis will establish the
displacement direction(s) associated with these structures, and provide a test
for models invoking extension and translation between East and West Antarctica
during rift development. Documentation of the positions and character of these
transverse structures will provide a 3-D picture of the rift system that will
constrain process- oriented models of rift development and TAM uplift.
Comparison of TAM segmentation with that of other rift systems will serve to
evaluate controls on along-axis rift propagation as continental lithosphere is
stretched prior to breakup.
