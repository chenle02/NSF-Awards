This project will study the the ecological effects on posture and locomotion in
two very different primate species inhabiting the same lowland rain forest area
in Madagascar. The two species differ in body size, dietary adaptations and
reproductive patterns but are both day-active, live in the ame area, and are
closely related.. Therefore, the differences between the two species may be due
more to adaptation than to differences in their evolutionary history. The
hypothesis to be tested here is that differences in diet, the distribution
pattern of food in the environment and through the seasons, patterns of
reproduction, and body size differences have determined the major differences in
the manner and ways the animals move through the environment. The project is
especially worth-while because one of the species, in particular, is endangered
- this has major conservation ramifications.
