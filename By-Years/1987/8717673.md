The complexity of the structure and reactivity of the folded protein molecule
presents a formidable challenge to theoretical analysis. Theoretical research in
protein chemistry must respond to this challenge in two ways. First, tools must
be developed for inquiry specifically designed for the complex, three-
dimensional, inhomogeneous and aperiodic nature of protein structures. Secondly,
new theories must be forged which realistically treat specific proteins
currently under experimental investigation and which will provide results which
biochemists and biophysicists can use. Dr. Kuki will apply path integral Monte
Carlo techniques to the quantitative analysis of electron transfer interactions
in proteins and protein complexes. Electron transfer proteins are crucial
components of many bioenergetic pathways in oxidative phosphorylation and
photosynthesis. He will develop new theoretical procedures based upon path
splicing algorithms, combining density functional theory and quantum path
integrals, and pseudopotentials specifically designed for hole-mediated
tunneling as well as electron-mediated tunneling.
