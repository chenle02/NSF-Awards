Abstract: Bleher's project focuses on basic problems in the theory of random
matrices and random polynomials, and on related problems in the theory of
quantum chaos and statistical mechanics. The unifying theme of these problems is
a number of different conjectures about universality. The major topics of
investigation include: (i) universality of the double scaling limit in random
matrix models near critical and multicritical points, its relation to integrable
hierarchies and Painleve transcendents, and applications of random matrix
models; (ii) universality and scaling for random sections of powers of positive
line bundles, especially SU(m+1)-polynomials and universality of eigenstates
statistics in the theory of quantum chaos; (iii) almost periodicity of the
spectral function for integrable systems in quantum mechanics, trace formulae,
and probability distribution of the error function; (iv) the Thouless effect and
superpolynomial scaling in classical spin systems with long-range interaction.

The concept of scaling and universality is a fundamental principle in different
theories of modern mathematics and physics, from probability theory to the
physical theory of quantum chaos, and from mathematical analysis to the theory
of phase transitions and critical phenomena in statistical physics. In rough
terms, the concept of universality states that many mathematical and physical
phenomena display remarkable universal features on the scale of very small or
very large distances. The major goal of the current project is to consolidate
the different concepts of universality that arise in various contexts and, in
particular, to investigate scaling and universality in mathematical theories of
random matrices and random polynomials with a view toward applications to the
theory of quantum chaos and to statistical physics. This award is jointly funded
by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the
Mathematical Physics Program in the Division of Physics.
