9223070 Zachos This is an equipment grant, to assist in purchase of a stable
isotope mass spectrometer for analysis of oxygen and carbon isotopes in
calcareous material. Data will be used to infer changes in ocean temperature and
salinity, productivity, and watermass properties for past climatic conditions,
including the glacial periods and the warm early Cenozoic. Two young faculty
members, both with prior experience and with excellent credentials, will operate
the machine, which will be available to other faculty members from two
departments.
