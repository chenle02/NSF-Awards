Dr. Wasserman is using genetic, molecular, and biochemical techniques to define
the intracellular signalling pathway that establishes dorsoventral polarity in
the Drosophila embryo. Initially, he has focussed his interests on the molecular
analysis of two genes, tube and pelle. A cDNA clone for tube has been identified
by its ability to direct in vitro synthesis of RNA that, upon microinjection,
can phenotypically rescue embryos lacking tube activity. A cDNA clone for pelle
will be obtained by a similar route. Patterns of gene expression and of post
translational modification will be characterized as a means of exploring the
mechanism of signal transduction. Deduced functional sites and domains in the
tube and pelle proteins will be disrupted by mutations engineered in the cDNA
sequences; transcripts generated in vitro from the altered cDNAs will then be
assayed for activity in the microinjection bioassay. Existing or newly induced
mutations for each gene will be used to generate null allele combinations for
phenotypic analysis. Lastly, gel filtration chromatography and immunoblotting
will be used to look for stable interactions that may define functional modules
in the signalling pathway.
