This planing grant will lead to a proposal from Elizabeth State University
representing schools in the northeastern region of North Carolina. The PI has
demonstrated that the students do not get an adequate education in mathematics
creating an even greater problem since the state standards for college admission
have been raised. Through their summer work with students funded by the
Department of Energy, the staff feels that when specific adjustments are made to
provide support for the students, the students can and do learn mathematics.
With this grant, they will begin extending their work with the local school
districts, assess the needs, and draft a formal proposal for funds to retrain
the teachers in the region. This proposal specifically addresses the needs of
the African American students in the region and is administered by an HBCU. It
uses the community resources to support the development process and strives to
involve parents in the homework with the students, learning along side of their
children.
