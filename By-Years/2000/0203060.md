Experimental Computer Science: Automating Development of Interactive Distributed
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive distributed applications (IDAs)
are software applications that involve direct interaction with users and are
distributed across a computer network. IDA development is complicated by
application characteristics such as interactivity, concurrency, non-determinism,
heterogeneity, and severe resource constraints. Current software development
tools address some of these complications, but development environments
supporting integrated use of IDA development tools are lacking. The postdoctoral
research associate will work on the integration and validation of Meridian, a
collection of tools designed to help automate the development of IDAs.
Specifically, the associate will 1) research the automated generation and
integration of analysis tools that are easily and efficiently integrated into a
comprehensive environment, and 2) perform case studies of different classes of
IDAs and populate class-specific IDA information repositories for
reuse.&lt;br/&gt;
