DMS-9520102 Kenney The Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (HRUMC)
is a meeting of students and faculty from colleges and universities in the
Northeast. The conference serve as a welcome for students to the professional
life of the mathematician and contributes to the evolution of a regional
community of students and faculty mathematicians. At such a conference, students
from all four undergraduate classes experience, as presenters or as audience
members, a professional meeting designed primarily with the students in mind.
Student and faculty talks are included in each session, and incorporated in our
program are not only talks that would appeal to specialists but also talks that
are accessible to freshman and sophomores. Presentations involve research (by
students, by faculty, and by student-faculty teams), original expositions of
known results, or description of student projects. The first HRUMC was held at
Siena College in April, 1994, and the second is planned for April, 1995, at
Siena college. In 1996, HRUMC will be held at Skidmore College.
