This PFI: Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) Technology Translation (TT)
project focuses on translating controlled drug delivery technology to fill the
need for faster and better wound healing. The controlled delivery of growth
factor is important because it keeps the growth factor active longer in the body
so as to accelerate wound closure and potentially reduce scar formation as well.
The project will result in a prototype of a wound dressing. This dressing will
protect the bioactivity of growth factors and control their release. These
features provide the following advantages: accelerated wound healing, reduced
dressing changing frequency, reduced cost of care when compared to the leading
competing wound dressing based on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).
Furthermore, the one-time therapy can be easily used by patients or their family
care givers, thus reducing cost compared to products that require professional
handling such as vacuum therapy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses
the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward
commercial application: 1) Deciphering the polyvalent interactions between the
components of the controlled release system. 2) Knowledge on how to regulate the
release kinetics using ionic interactions. 3) A delivery system that can protect
the bioactivity of a wide range of proteins in various biotechnological and
biomedical applications. These gaps will be bridged by 1) Varying the polycation
of the controlled release system. 2) Adjusting the composition of the controlled
delivery vehicle and the dosage of the growth factor. 3) Using heparin in the
delivery system, thus allowing the controlled release of greater than 200
heparin binding proteins including heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, PDGF
and fibroblast growth factor. In addition, graduate students and post-docs
involved in this project will receive technology translation experiences through
participation in the "Benchtop to Bedside" and the "Academic Entrepreneurship"
courses and University of Pittsburgh Big Idea Competition.
