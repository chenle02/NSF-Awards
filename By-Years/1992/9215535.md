This grant is to assist the support of an international symposium on
probabilistic structural mechanics and advances in structural reliability
methods during June 7-10, 1993, It is to be held in San Antonio, Texas, USA
under the auspices of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied
Mechanics (UTAM). The aim of the symposium is to appraise the state-of-the-art,
exchange information and views, and set direction for new research. It will
facilitate a dialogue between engineers and scientists working in mechanics and
materials, structural mechanics, structural engineering and construction
engineering, and will simulate new developments and areas of research in the
field. The symposium will result in an authoritative high quality proceedings
volume which will serve as a basic reference on the subject of probablistic
structural mechanics and structural reliability.*** //
