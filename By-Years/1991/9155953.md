This project proposes to alter the philosophy and approach to laboratory
training in biology at the introductory level. Changes in the laboratory
component in the first semester of a two-semester sequence will allow students
to participate in a small number of non-traditional, investigative laboratories
in evolutionary, environmental and behavioral biology. Each module directly
relates to and prepares science majors for modern research-oriented upper-
division courses. The intent of these modules is to (1) expose students to basic
questions in biology, (2) give direct experience with scientific methods
including statistical analysis and use of modern research technologies, and (3)
increase expertise in evaluating primary, as well as secondary publications in
science. During the final week of each module students will interpret data and
draw conclusions and in selected modules will design their own original
investigations based on previous experimentation, observation and data
collection. This project more clearly parallels modern research than the
traditional weekly menu- driven laboratory. The time/space flexibilities and
increased student/faculty/staff contact will accommodate individualized learning
and will address the needs of a student cohort with disparate secondary school
educations and socioeconomic backgrounds.
