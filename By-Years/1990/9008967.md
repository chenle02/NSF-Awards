One of the principal aims of magnetospheric research is to understand how solar
wind particles and energy are transported throughout the magnetosphere. The
magnetotail plays an important role in this transport. The region at about a
radial distance of 8-10RE has recently been observed to be in the so- called
current disruption region which may be a signature of the onset of a
magnetospheric substorm. This grant is to investigate the role the collisionless
tearing instability plays in the current disruption process. The research will
focus of the verification of the analytical theory of tearing modes by particle
simulations and the development of a nonlinear theory of such modes. ***
