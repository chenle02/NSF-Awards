Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;This project pioneers an innovative methodology
that increases the effectiveness of formal methods courses by providing students
with sophisticated tools for understanding and proving program correctness.
These tools are based upon Z, the common and powerful specification language and
include type checking, specification animation and proof obligations. A separate
tool is used for code generation. All of the tools provide research quality
support to students learning to program in a formally correct
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student performance is evaluated via tracking
experimental and control groups through the core curriculum; the control group
enrolls in similar courses but does not use the tools. We will measure and
report two important factors: task completion time and error count.
