This Americas Program award will support the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) in a partnership with three scientific
organizations in Latin America to showcase the achievements of distinguished
U.S. women scientists to wide audiences in Latin America. Organized by Marina
Ratchford of the AAAS Department of International Programs, the initiative seeks
to increase both the visibility of U.S. women scientists' careers, and the
participation of women in the scientific enterprise in Latin America.

The AAAS will organize three panels, each composed of three U.S. women
scientists interested in sharing their experiences with Latin American
colleagues. Panelists will be selected, not only on their outstanding scientific
careers, but also on how their experiences furnish compelling strategies to
overcome the challenges of pursuing scientific careers. It is expected that the
selected panelists will serve as role models for women in the U.S. and Latin
America.

Selected panelists will develop lectures and visual materials to be presented at
the Annual Meetings of the Brazilian Society for the Progress of Science (SBPC);
Costa Rica's National Council for Scientific and Technological Research
(CONICIT); and the Panamanian Association for the Advancement of Science
(APANAC). These venues will gather a diversity of participants that include
scientists, educators, students, policymakers and journalists. AAAS will work
with host associations to arrange additional activities to take place around the
Annual Meeting lectures, including visits to local universities, schools,
museums, and research institutes. Lecturers will provide a report about their
interaction with Latin American colleagues, including suggestions to increase
the participation of women in science and international cooperation among women
scientists.
