Funding is provided to acquire a single-collector high-resolution double-
focusing magnetic sector-field mass spectrometer for paleoclimate and
biogeochemical research. The mass spectrometer will help enable high-precision
measurement of elemental concentrations and isotope ratios in inorganic and
organic solution matrices for a wide range of natural waters and geochemical
applications. Such applications include high resolution paleoclimate records
from speleothems, sulfur isotope variability in Antarctic and Greenland ice
cores, and carbon cycling and biogeochemistry of vegetation and
soils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve using the mass
spectrometer to address fundamental research question in climate change and
elemental cycling over various time scales as well as helping to further the
career of a promising female scientist early in her career.&lt;br/&gt;
