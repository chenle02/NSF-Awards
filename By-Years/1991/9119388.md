The X-ray Crystollography Group in the Department of Biological Sciences at
Purdue has pioneered a variety of methods, techniques and computer software for
the determination of the structures of the macromolecules. It has achieved major
advances in the study of virus structures and, over the years has developed a
foundation of computer programs for film processing, phase determination, model
building, structure refinement, and so on, leading to the solution and
investigation of macromolecular structures. Computing is currently one of the
bottlenecks in this research. The gap between the computing resources needed and
the ones available increases as new radiation sources for X-rays become
available. This group can maintain its position as the leader in the field by
migrating their work to parallel supercomputers such as Touchstone Delta
machine. The principal research issues we plan to address are: 1. Development
and analysis of parallel algorithms for film processing, multiple small least
squares problem, and huge (one million plus variables) sparse least squares
problems. 2. Development of data structures suitable for macromolecular
computations and which can be partitioned for parallel methods. 3. Development
of geometric based methods for problem partition and mapping computations onto
MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data) computers. This work will not only
advance the understanding of parallel computing but it will also provide a
practical tool to enable an order of magnitude increase in power for the
computational biology. We expect this will lead to a qualitative improvement in
the computational macromolecular biology.
