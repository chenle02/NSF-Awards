This project addresses several problems in algebraic topology. Peterson's first
problem involves the cohomology of the classifying space of elementary abelian
2-groups, and his second problem involves the loop space of the group SU(n). Kan
plans to apply the obstruction theory for realizing a diagram in the homotopy
category by means of a diagram of spaces to the problem of realizing an unstable
algebra over the Steenrod algebra as the cohomology of an actual space. Another
of Kan's projects is an investigation of the cohomological approach to unstable
Adams spectral sequences, and a third problem concerns the category of
simplicial spaces.
