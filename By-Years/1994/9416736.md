This document is a proposal to continue work which was initiated by Professor
Manos while he was head of the Atomic Beam Studies at the Plasma Physics
Laboratory of Princeton University. The neutral beam source at Princeton, though
developed for studies of spacecraft materials, was quickly shown to be promising
for fine-line, low-damage processing of semiconductors 1, a subject that has
been under aggressive study in Japanese corporate research laboratories. The
Princeton source, because of the way in which it was configured during design,
was not suitable to examine a wide range of semiconductor process variables. To
continue these semiconductor studies at William and Mary develop tools for
wafer-scale production. This proposal is for a three year program of study which
will integrate plasma measurement, experimental surface characterization, and
computational modeling of low-energy, low-damage processing steps involving
neutral atoms and molecules (and ions). The work will be performed at the
College of William and Mary with close collaboration with a number of outside
advisors from industry.
