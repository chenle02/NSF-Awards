Four investigations of quantum aspects of light will be undertaken: (1) an
examination of a natural multimode generalization of higher order squeezing, (2)
calculation of bounds on the deviation from classical behavior of light from
nonlinear optical interactions, (3) study of third and higher order subharmonic
generation processes, and (4) examination of the effect of a phase-smeared pump
beam on the nonclassical nature of the states it produces. Such studies of the
quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are needed to understand the
noise properties in the output of nonlinear optical devices and in fields of
macroscopic intensity.
