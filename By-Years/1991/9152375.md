This project develops a digital signal processing laboratory to support three
courses within the Electrical Engineering Department at the Rochester Institute
of Technology. The proposed laboratory consists of a MacIntosh IIci host
computer connected to a Motorola DSP56000 signal processing computer. The
combination provides a system which is useful in demonstrating principles and
techniques of real time digital signal processing. Two of the three courses are
required courses within the EE program. In these two courses, the laboratory is
used mainly to permit the students to develop software and hardware to
demonstrate DSP techniques and principles. They are expected to simulate DSP
using the C programming language and using MatLab. The third supported course is
an elective course and this laboratory permits students to design, test, and
demonstrate real-time digital signal processing techniques and make full use of
the Motorola DSP56000 computer.
