This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use Particle
Image Velocimetry wherein a sample sheet volume is illuminated by laser diodes.
A high speed camera takes pictures of precipitation illuminated in the sample
volume. The proposed data analysis software would use object and pattern
recognition algorithms combined with statistical analysis packages to generate
output data from the input pictures. The output data would classify the
precipitation into four output types with size and velocity distributions.

The successful development of this instrument will be of significant help to
researchers within government, academia, and the private sector that aim to
measure, characterize, and understand precipitation and how it plays in the
overall environment. Use within research would also make data available for
students, teaching, and other training purposes. In time, the principle
components of PICS would become less expensive and the system could serve as an
additional sensor on domestic and international weather stations. Operational
use in this manner would advance weather data assimilation and forecast model
prediction.
