For the understanding of the biochemical phenomena of enzyme activity data at
the molecular level is one of the most vital needs. Dr. Banaszak is performing
an X-ray crystallographic study of L-3 hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenase (BHDH),
cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (sMDH) and fumarase. Although these structural
studies are at different stages, the long range objectives in each case are
similar. Structural investigations of the type proposed are fundamental to
understanding the mechanism of catalytic activity these enzymes which carry out
essential steps in a number of fundamental biochemical pathways.
