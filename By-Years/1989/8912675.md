The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. Access to X-ray
crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists to
carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at the University of
Wyoming will use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help
acquire an automated X-ray diffractometer. The areas of chemical research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition are as follows: 1) Design and synthesis of
binuclear manganese complexes 2) Design and synthesis of new inorganic clusters
3) Ligation properties of chelating fluoroalkylphosphines 4) Asymmetric
alkylation of carbamate alpha-oxocarbanions 5) Vesicles derived from cleavable
double-chain surfactant- based vesicles 6) Photooxidation of sulfur-containing
protein.
