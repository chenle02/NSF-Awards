PROJECT ABSTRACT:

In physical sciences, economics, and finance many realizations of discrete time
series exhibit long memory, i.e., their autocovariances as a function of lag
decrease to zero at a hyperbolic rate as the lag approaches to infinity. Such
processes have unbounded spectral densities at the origin. A part of this
proposal is concerned with developing asymptotically optimal and robust
estimators for heteroscedastic, non-smooth, non-linear time series models in the
presence of regression or explanatory covariates that may have long memory, in a
semi-parametric setting. In particular, it is planned to obtain the limits of
the experiments generated by the non-smooth autoregressive models when there are
long memory explanatory variables present in these models and when the error
distributions are unknown. In the second part, the PI/Co-PI propose to develop
asymptotically distribution free tests for fitting a parametric autoregressive
mean and/or quantile function to a heteroscedastic stationary ergodic time
series. These tests are expected to be functions of certain martingale
transforms of a partial sum processes that do notinvolve nonparametric curve
estimation. PI/Co-PI also plan to carry out a comparative study with some of the
existing tests. The results obtained will be used to estimate parameters of
interest and test theories relevant to problems in financial economics.

A data set is said to have long memory if an association between distant
observations is slowly decaying but persistent, as the distance between
observations increases. A data set observed over a period of time is called a
time series. A heteroscedastic time series is one where the conditional
variability of an observation at the current time, given the past, depends on
the past. Such data often arises in economics, finance, and physical sciences.
In particular, an important example of long memory heteroscedastic time series
is the volatility process in spot returns. It is also known that this volatility
increases with bank interventions in currency markets. This intervention process
is highly non-smooth time series since it is zero most of the times with certain
bursts over some times. Part of the emphasis of the proposal is on developing
optimal inferential procedures in a class of non-smooth non-linear
heteroscedastic time series models. Another part emphasizes application of the
results obtained to develop new tests of market efficiency and estimates of time
dependent risk premium in financial economics and high frequency data mentioned
in the proposal pertaining to German Mark and Swiss Frank vs. US Dollar exchange
rates and commodity prices.
