The California Institute of Technology is being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
for outstanding undergraduate students under supervision of experienced research
chemists. The program will support 9 students for the summer of 1987, of which
almost half will come from other institutions. The Research activities will
include: o Hydrogen-Atom Transfer to and from Binuclear Platinum o Chemical
Applications of Ion Cyclotron Resonance Spectroscopy o Structural and
Mechanistic Organometallic Chemistry o Simulation of Biological and Surface
Processes
