*** 9760586 Perlov This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project aims
to develop a new approach to the growth process of and characterize as-grown
single crystals of Pb(Znl/3Nb2/3)03-PbTiO3 (PZN-PT) and Po (Mg,/3Nb2/3) 03
-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT). These materials have unique properties that include very high
longitudinal coupling coefficient (>90%), large dielectric constants
(1000-5000), low dielectric loss (<0.01), and exceptionally high piezoelectric
coefficients (d33 > 2000 pC/N). and (d33 > These exceptional properties have
established PZN-as very attractive materials for low frequency acoustic
transduction, ultrasonic biomedical imaging and actuation. However, large single
crystals of good quality are not available. Applications of PZN-PT and PMN-PT
single crystals will include low frequency acoustic transduction (hydrophones,
passive listening devises), ultra sound sensors for biomedical imaging and
electromechanical actuators (laser optics, precision machinery and small
motors). ***
