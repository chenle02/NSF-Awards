This project is establishing a collaboration, called Project Sun, among Brevard
Community College (BCC), the Florida Solar Energy Center, Brevard Public
Schools, the University of Central Florida, and the Astronauts Memorial
Foundation. It increases the number and diversity of prospective K-12 teachers
at BCC by providing opportunities to improve technological literacy, strengthen
science and mathematics preparation, transfer seamlessly to a four-year program,
and connect with business and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of
the project are to:&lt;br/&gt;(a) improve the technological literacy of 150 pre-
and in-service teachers by providing them an opportunity to learn technology
applications in a hands-on workshop called the Sun Academy.&lt;br/&gt;(b)
increase the knowledge of these pre- and in-service teachers about the use of
workplace technologies in the classroom through follow-up learning opportunities
during the academic year.&lt;br/&gt;(c) increase by 10% the number of
prospective K-12 teacher enrolling in the community college while also
increasing diversity.&lt;br/&gt;(d) facilitate a smooth and seamless transition
for community college students to four-year teacher preparation programs through
articulation partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the academic year,
participants work in elementary school classrooms, evaluating how students learn
from Solar Matters, an online solar energy curriculum unit, and the Sun Kids
Website. An Inquiry Group is forming an online discussion group, developing
mentoring relationships, posting lessons and observations to the Website, and
meeting annually to review the effectiveness of student learning. Participants
also visit the Florida Solar Energy Center and the University of Central Florida
Instructional Technology Resource Center.
