The project addresses critical user needs around learner experiences related to
the use of small wireless computing devices and the NSDL by building a prototype
service and evaluating its educational impact on informal and structured mobile
learning in both K-12 and Higher Education, with a focus on grades 9-14 (high
school and lower division undergraduate) and use of PDAs, cell phones and
music/video players. As the goal is to improve accessibility of the NSDL to
diverse populations, evaluation test sites include inner city schools and
outreach programs in Oakland/Berkeley. The project is (1) providing metadata
recommendations for STEM education digital resources that utilize mobile
devices; (2) implementing and testing user profile, personalization features and
aspects of the local environment to support small mobile devices to interface
with NSDL collections; (3) implementing personalized workspaces, search and
metadata browser for small window form factors and aspects of the local
environment; (4) testing prototypes in both structured and informal mobile
learning activities in grades 9-12 and with lower division university students;
(5) developing pedagogically-sound use scenarios of mobile learning with NSDL
content; and (6) providing recommendations for mobile device services for the
NSDL community that emerge from our prototype testing and evaluation.
