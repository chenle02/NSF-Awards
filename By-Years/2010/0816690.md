The PIs will investigate recognition of self and kin in an amoeba, Dictyostelium
discoideum. These single-celled amoebas come together to form a multicellular
fruiting body, but they do so primarily with members of their own genetically
identical clone, rejecting genetically different clones. The researchers will
study the costs and benefits of recognition, particularly how it protects
against exploitation by foreign clones. They will also investigate whether
recognition simply involves avoidance of other clones, or whether it also leads
to attacks on the foreign clone, analogous to tissue rejection. Finally, they
will also identify the genes that cause recognition.

Recognition systems are vital to life. For example, self-recognition is what
allows humans to detect and attack pathogens, and it also plays a critical role
in organ transplantation. D. discoideum is a good single-celled lab organism,
has a sequenced genome, shares many genes with humans, and has many molecular
and genetic techniques developed for it. Therefore these investigations will
result in a valuable model system for the study of recognition, leading to
insights into general questions of how recognition works and evolves, that are
not easily addressed in other organisms.
