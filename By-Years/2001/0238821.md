A long-term objective of the research in this laboratory is to understand how
extracellular cues influence the growth and pathfinding properties of developing
neurons. In this project, the role of the enzyme CaM kinase II (CaMK-II) will be
characterized during neurogenesis. CaMK-II activity is increased by transient
elevations of intracellular calcium. Calcium levels transiently rise at
different times and locations in developing neurons. Activated CaMK-II then
modifies other proteins by a process called phosphorylation. Which of the four
CaMK-II genes is expressed determines the proteins that are phosphorylated. In
early embryonic neurons, one of these CaMK-II genes (delta) encodes the majority
of the CaMK-II proteins. Later during development, CaMK-IIs are also encoded by
the beta CaMK-II gene to supplement delta CaMK-IIs. In this project, the
capability of beta and delta CaMK-IIs to interact will be investigated. This is
important because the interaction of CaMK-IIs can influence their location and
their choice of protein targets. Some of these targets will be identified. The
function of beta and delta CaMK-IIs will then be examined during neurogenesis.
Functional studies will be conducted in a mouse embryonic cell line (P19)
because P19 cells can be differentiated into neurons in vitro and naturally
express beta and delta CaMK-IIs. Levels of CaMK-IIs can be increased or
decreased in P19 cells and the effect on neurogenesis can then be analyzed. This
research will help to better understand the level of protein diversity that can
be achieved through alternative gene expression and protein interaction. The
research will also contribute to an understanding of the principles of protein
assembly and targeting. Finally, this research will provide new insight into the
mechanisms by which neurons are formed.&lt;br/&gt;
