Following the Horizon Well oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico that occurred in
2010, Dillard University proposes a RAPID project for students and faculty to
participate in the sampling and biomarker analysis of air, water, and sediments
from oil-impacted shoreline and from pristine shorelines under various
meteorological conditions. Sampling will be conducted to assess the effects of
weathering as well as seasonal changes in surface temperature. Archival samples
will be collected and analyzed on bioarerosal culturing assays, by quantitative
microscopy, by testing of the genotoxic effect of the particulate matter.
Airborne particulate matter will be analyzed for its total carbon content and it
total biological load (carbohydrate, protein, phospholipid, and DNA). The
project will seek to assess the effect that weathering hydrocarbons and
dispersants from the oil spill will have on increasing the numbers of particles
which can penetrate the human respiratory system and the toxicity potential that
those particles will carry over aerosols generated in their pristine
counterparts.
