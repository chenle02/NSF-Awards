Contemporary problems in science, engineering and technology increasingly demand
the analysis of highly complex systems that feature both high-dimensional random
dynamics or interactions and a large amount of observed data. In order to obtain
reliable predictions in such systems, it is essential to exploit large-scale
stochastic models and observed data in an integrated fashion. The goal of this
proposal is to initiate a systematic study of how conditioning on observed data
affects the properties of large-scale stochastic models such as interacting
particle systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and Markov random
fields. Research will focus on developing the foundations of a conditional
ergodic theory for infinite-dimensional Markov processes and of conditional
infinite Gibbs measures; on the investigation of probabilistic phenomena such as
conditional phase transitions; on developing connections with problems in
measure theory, statistical mechanics, and high-dimensional probability; and on
potential applications to the design and analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms for
filtering and prediction in high-dimensional systems, where classical methods
are known to fail.

Large-scale forecasting problems arise in a myriad of important applications
such as weather forecasting, geophysical and oceanographic data assimilation,
image analysis, traffic forecasting, and prediction in networks. Such problems
have a direct impact on our daily lives, and arise in crucial areas of our
society such as national security, energy resource management, climate
prediction, and medical imaging. The broad goal of this project is to develop a
systematic understanding of the interplay between complex models, randomness,
and observed data that lies at the heart of any forecasting problem. By focusing
on the fundamental structures that are common to a diverse range of
applications, mathematicians can provide unique insights and new directions to
complex problems and provide an impetus for developing interdisciplinary
connections. At the same time, a strong workforce in the mathematical sciences
is of crucial importance to the future of technological innovation and
education. An integral part of this project is formed by a range of educational,
mentoring and outreach activities aimed at increasing student interest and
diversity in the mathematical sciences across pre-college, undergraduate and
graduate student levels, and at training the next generation of researchers and
educators.
