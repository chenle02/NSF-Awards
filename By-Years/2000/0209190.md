This project will study databases that are distributed among a set
of&lt;br/&gt;sensors that communicate without a fixed network infrastructure.
This architecture is motivated by new types of emerging wireless broadcast
networks such as Mobile Ad-hoc Networks, "smart dust", and sensor networks.
Smart dust and sensor networks consist of processors that may be the size of a
dust particle, and the processors may be sprayed or parachuted from an
airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two environments are considered. In the first one
the sensors are static,&lt;br/&gt;and in the second one the nodes are mobile,
and their locations are not always known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
explore the following paradigm, called "geographic&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of
data", for processing queries, triggers and updates. The paradigm calls for
dividing the geographic area into cells. Each data item in the database is
associated with a cell, and resides in that cell, i.e.&lt;br/&gt;in the set of
processors that are currently located in the cell (note that&lt;br/&gt;this set
may vary over time). Each cell is considered a node of the distributed database,
and queries/triggers/updates are processed by sending them to the appropriate
cells. Note that in contrast to the traditional cellular architecture, the
proposed one is infrastructureless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
