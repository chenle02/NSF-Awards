The University of Massachusetts Lowell and the University at Albany will partner
with three urban school districts (Lowell and Methuen, MA, and Schenectady, NY)
to build a researcher and practitioner partnership to create inclusive,
culturally-responsive, and sustainable computer science programs at the middle
school level. The project will use best practices from research-practice
partnerships, including the SCRIPT framework from the CSforALL Consortium. The
project will engage stakeholders from across school districts in building their
commitment to computer science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
