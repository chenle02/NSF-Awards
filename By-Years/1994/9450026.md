9450026 Cid This project, United Connecticut for Women in Science, Engineering,
and Mathematics, is directed toward making permanent changes in women's and
girls' access to, and participation and achievement in science, engineering and
mathematics (SEM), especially among economically disadvantaged and under-
represented minority populations. It will develop and implement systemic change
strategies reaching parents, teachers and professors, guidance counselors and
other school and college administrators, school board members, community
leaders, and students (K-18), building on existing resource and advocacy efforts
by professional organizations, stakeholder groups, state and local education
agencies, and institutions of higher education. The project has four components:
(1) a Clearinghouse for statewide resource building, research, symposia and
conferences, and dissemination of project products; (2) a public awareness
component infusing Women in SEM issues in the state's Statewide Systemic
Initiative public awareness campaign and also creating local "equity
partnerships"; (3) a "self- esteem building" component offering three different
approaches to supporting girls and women in SEM at the elementary, secondary,
and college levels; and (4) a pre-service and in-service component developing
new curricula addressing Women in SEM issues for future and practicing teachers,
respectively. ***
