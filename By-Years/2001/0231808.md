This project will study learning and teaching processes in several exemplary
science curricula in different subject areas. All of them use new approaches to
teaching that are unique in the way that they foster active learning of
conceptual models on the part of the student. At present many of the general
principles underlying the learning that occurs in these lessons are poorly
understood. However, advances in cognitive science have produced a very
promising new theory of model-based learning which can help to analyze and
describe these teaching techniques. The investigators will use a combination of
qualitative and quantitative methods to study these innovative units and analyze
them using these new cognitive science concepts. The overall goal is to find
principles of instruction for developing students' visualizable models in
science. Central to the project will be case studies of skilled teachers who are
adept at fostering model construction by students. The problem is to identify
the strategies by which teachers are able to do this. The project will analyze
teaching strategies and resulting student learning processes in detail using
protocol analysis techniques. Follow up studies will make quantitative
comparisons between groups that complement the qualitative case studies, and pre
and post testing will measure the size of learning gains in different areas. In
a second part of the project, key elements of model-based learning theory will
be elaborated via the analysis of expert learning protocols. Similarities and
differences between expert and student processes will be examined that highlight
new ways of understanding student learning processes that suggest new teaching
strategies.
