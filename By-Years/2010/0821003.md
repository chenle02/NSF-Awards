Understanding the mechanisms of speciation allows us to understand how
biological diversity has been generated in nature. This research will unravel
the genetics of speciation by studying populations of the intertidal copepod
Tigriopus californicus. This species is an excellent model system in which to
study the early stages of reproductive isolation, because it has populations
that are dramatically genetically differentiated but can be crossed in the lab.
Thus, they show only partial reproductive isolation and speciation is not yet
complete. Two specific genetic systems will be examined, both of which play
central roles in metabolism and energy generation in animals. The study will
probe how interactions between genes can reduce fitness in hybrids and
contribute to reproductive isolation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the
genetic basis of reproductive isolation in Tigriopus contributes to
understanding of speciation in general and improves understanding of the
mechanisms by which interactions between proteins can change between diverging
groups. The research includes both graduate and undergraduate training and will
seek to involve underrepresented groups and females in the research process.
