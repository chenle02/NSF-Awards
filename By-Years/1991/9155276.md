The Discovery Center is a "hands-on" science museum with a mission to provide
the public with a basic science literacy. The proposed HOFPP project is an
outreach program that will take an informal science education activity to
disadvantaged parents and children in the facilities of four (first year)
collaborating "parents": The Urban League, the Spanish Action League, the North
American Indian Club and Girls Inc. of Central NY. The purpose of the program is
to encourage and enable parents of disadvantaged school children to play an
active role in their child child's education. Phase I of the program is
implemented as a series of ten weekly classes in which parents and children will
work together on hands-on science activities; Phase 2 follows with a science
club program. Graduates will be informally channeled into an inner-city magnet
school for science and math. Past Discovery Center outreach programs have
already demonstrated ability to attract disadvantaged parents. The proposed
program will touch 1,000 disadvantaged persons during the initial three-year
period. During the third year the HOFPP project will be transported and
implemented at a Science museum in another New York State community. A three
year cost-shared NSF project is proposed that will be later sustained by The
Discovery Center operating budget with local donations. A professional outside
evaluation will be performed to measure program success. Program reports,
materials and consultation will be propagated to other interested organizations
to gain maximum impact.
