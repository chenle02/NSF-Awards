The history of paleoclimate in East Africa is poorly known. Continental rifting
in this region has produced a series of large lakes that span many climate
regimes. If these lakes are shown to contain useful paleoclimate records, then
much important information about the history of earth's climate could be
obtained. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential of Lake
Turkana, Kenya, for paleoclimate reconstructions. Sediments in this lake are
accumulating at high rates, often in laminations that reflect the annual cycle
of productivity and sedimentation. Thus the lake has the potential of allowing
reconstruction of the history of climate in this region on annual to century
time scales for the last 5000 years. This research is important because it will
provide a high resolution climate record from which to study climate processes
and change.
