This research investigates how robots can plan effectively in dynamic settings.
The focus is on spatio-temporal ocean monitoring with autonomous underwater
robots. Such monitoring and sensing allows scientists to gain a greater
understanding of the planet and its environmental processes. For autonomous
operation in the ocean, robots need to make decisions in spite of extensive
uncertainty in ocean currents that change both spatially and temporally, and are
often strong enough to alter the vehicle's motion significantly. The algorithms
developed in this work are tested in the underwater domain with oceanographic
phenomena of interest (e.g., algal blooms). Tests are performed on multiple
datasets available at USC from prior field trials with underwater robots.
Through the use of both robot testing and simulated testing, the methods
developed in this work are validated across a wide range of applications and
scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When planning for a long-range and long-term
environmental monitoring task, an accurate planner requires a forecast of ocean
currents at the destination and intermediate way-points in order to determine
corresponding actions. A drawback of state-of-the-art decision making
methodologies lies in the fact that they rely on a known uncertainty description
that is a "snapshot at a certain moment in time." In this research, the focus is
on the design of new mechanisms that generalize state-of-the-art decision-making
methodologies to overcome this limitation. The goal is the creation of a general
methodology to compute control policies that consider not only a fully known
(current and past) stochastic description, but also a (possibly uncertain)
prediction of future dynamics. The stochastic transition dynamics are considered
as a noisy or uncertain function that varies with some parameter such as the
time. To solve this problem, a new and efficient value propagation mechanism is
developed involving two processes that evolve in both spatial and temporal
dimensions.
