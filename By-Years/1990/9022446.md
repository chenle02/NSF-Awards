This project is an effort to construct, install and operate a monostotic Very
High Frequency (VHF) wind profiling radar at the Peruvian Antarctic Base on King
George Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. Similar wind profilers have operated
successfully in other remote areas in the western equatorial Pacific, and in
equivalent polar latitudes in Alaska. The system will provide nearly continuous
measurement of the total wind vector through the troposphere and lower
stratosphere, and is capable of expansion to make observations of the horizontal
wind in the region from 70 km to 100 km altitude. The project will be carried
out cooperatively with the Peruvian Antarctic program.
