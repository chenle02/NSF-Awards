The investigator develops efficient algorithms, as well as additional
techniques and methodologies, that can be used to solve the noncommutative
algebraic components of problems in analysis and engineering. The noncommutative
algebraic component of such a problem consists of solving a collection of
equations where each of the variables represents a matrix or bounded linear
transformation. Solving such problems involves manipulating this collection of
equations until it is amenable to numerical solution or until the manipulated
collection has some desirable property. Methodologies based on noncommutative
Groebner basis were developed in a paper by J. William Helton and the
investigator in 1998 and these techniques are effective for solving a short list
of problems. Several directions of study for the current project include
removing the need for additional "invertibility assumptions," removing redundant
equations, and finding appropriate changes of variables. The new approaches
should widen the range of problems that can be solved. Ordinary arithmetic is
commutative: 2 times 5 is the same as 5 times 2, and in fact A times B is the
same as B times A for any numbers A and B. The arithmetic of matrices --
rectangular arrays of numbers that can represent, for example, the forces on
diferent parts of a bridge or airplane -- is not commutative: A times B is not
always the same as B times A. The development and implementation of algorithms
for solving collections of polynomial equations spurred a great amount of
activity in commutative algebra. In an analogous way, the development of
algorithms and methodologies for solving collections of matrix equations can
have a dramatic impact on solving engineering and analysis problems that have
noncommutative algebraic components, where the order in which components of the
calculation are arranged can change the answers. With currently developed
techniques, some computations that arise commonly in engineering require a
considerable amount of time to perform by hand, but can be done very quickly on
a computer. The development of new methods for noncommutative algebra should
significantly increase the number and types of problems that can be solved
efficiently with the assistance of computers.
