This is a mathematical research project on core models and their fine structure,
which is a subfield of set theory that was pioneered by Jensen. Core models are
generalizations of Goedel's constructible universe, L, that arose in the the
study of large cardinal axioms. The field today builds on the fundamental
discoveries of Dodd, Jensen, Martin, Mitchell, Steel and Woodin. The project is
on pure core model theory as well as its interactions with other areas, such as
descriptive set theory, infinitary combinatorics and forcing. Several of the
research problems are on combinatorial principles such as Diamond and Square,
which were isolated by Jensen in his work on L. They are among the most commonly
used tools in set theoretic constructions and have applications in neighboring
fields such as model theory and topology. Other research problems have their
origins outside of core model theory. These include open questions about forcing
axioms, generic embeddings, singular cardinal combinatorics, canonical sets of
reals and cardinal invariants of the powers of uncountable cardinals.

The axioms of set theory are the underlying assumptions of all of mathematics.
Core model theory addresses some of the fundamental unresolved questions in set
theory in direct and sophisticated ways. Beyond its foundational concerns, core
model theory is connected to other areas, for example, cardinal arithmetic (the
arithmetic of infinite numbers) and infinitary combinatorics (the combinatorics
of infinite structures such as graphs and trees). The research problems
addressed in this project lead to new core model theoretic techniques and
applications.
