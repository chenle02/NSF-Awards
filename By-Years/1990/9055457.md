This project is a four year program that will provide a one week seminar each
summer at the Bronx Zoo for secondary science teachers. The purpose of the
program is to stimulate teachers' creativity, improve their instructional skills
and to give them proficiency in the use of wildlife exhibits to motivate
students to study science. The seminars will be based on the Bronx Zoo's award
winning curriculum, Survival Strategies. Developed with NSF funds, Survival
Strategies has been recognized as an effective program by the U.S. Department of
Education; the New York State Department of Education; and the Johns Hopkins
University Center for Research on Effective Schooling for Disadvantaged
Students. Each summer, beginning in 1992, an intensive 5 day seminar will
accommodate 35 science teachers of grades 7-11, selected from secondary schools
throughout the United States. Following completion of the seminar, each
participant teacher will offer in-service training for other science teachers
from their local area.
