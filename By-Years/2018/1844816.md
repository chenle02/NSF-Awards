The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improved care
for premature and at-risk infants, and consequently providing a cost savings to
the healthcare system. Providing care for the at-risk neonates and those with
developmental delays earlier will prevent negative avoidable outcomes and enable
the growth of these fragile individuals to become the most that they can. The
Neonur provides the ability to monitor the neurological status of the neonate
using an oral feeding based developmental biomarker. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
I-Corps Neonur project utilizes technology invented and patented at the
University of Pennsylvania through three National Institutes of Health R01
grants. This technology has been used to benchmark the link between neonatal
neurological development and the coordination of oral feeding skills. This skill
set may sound simple but enables the infant to orally feed and simultaneously
protect their airway, all while critically minimizing the caloric utilization to
complete the task. Over 600 infants have been studied providing clear population
level guidance. The technology subsequently has been used to study populations
at risk due to maternal drug use, diabetes, and the correlation between
bilirubin, and a clinical intervention. All of the studies to date have looked
at the data from a research and population basis. This I-Corps project will
enable us to understand how to translate this data into a useful clinical tool
for the provider, and the parent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
