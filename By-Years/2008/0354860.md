This amends an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by making an award to the
U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) for
engineering services to the United States Antarctic Program's (USAP) IceCube
Project.

The following tasks are included:

Performance of a ground penetrating radar survey at the South Pole during the
austral summer season 2003 - 2004.

Similar services have been provided by CRREL and their contractors for many
years. The services have always been timely, cost effective, and professional.
It is expected that this work will be accomplished in a similar manner. CRREL is
a government agency, not associated with the NSF or the support contractor.
CRREL has no interest in the support contract that could constitute a conflict
of interest.

For the reasons stated above it is in the best interest of the NSF for CRREL to
continue with the ongoing tasking. This award is recommended for the amount of
$49,000 as estimated by CRREL to be funded from the IceCube MREFC project
budget.
