It is proposed a collaborative interdisciplinary research program, between the
MIT Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory, the Chemistry Department of Brown
University, and the Physics Department of Tufts University for a study of the
physical behavior and crystal chemistry of semimagnetic semiconductors. They
plan to study stannite crystals with Mn, Fe, Ni and Co, II-VI compounds with Fe
and Mn, and Mn- chalcopyrites, with emphasis on the following problems: i) Large
polaron effects in stannites. ii) The metal-insulator transition. iii) Magnetism
and polaron formation in Fe-alloys. iv) Nonlinear properties and novel states of
HgCdFeSe. v) Crystal chemistry to determine when and how magnetic ions are
incorporated in covalently- bonded semiconductors. These problems will be
investigated with a variety of techniques including Raman scattering,
magnetoreflectance, luminescence, magnetization, susceptibility, electrical
transport, and nonlinear optics at NML and/or Tufts. Crystal chemistry studies
will be performed at Brown University.
