This award will provide partial support of an international conference at the
International Pacific Research Center, Honolulu, Hawaii on November 11-14, 2002
entitled "The Hadley Circulation: Past, Present, and Future."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of the conference is to bring together an
international group of climatologists, modelers, and paleoclimatologists to
share the latest ideas on Hadley Circulation, paleoclimatic records that
describe past dynamics of the Hadley Circulation, and ideas as to potential
future changes in Hadley Circulation as a result of increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations. The participants will include seasoned researchers, new
investigators, and students. A conference volume synthesizing and summarizing
the conference proceedings and findings will be published.
