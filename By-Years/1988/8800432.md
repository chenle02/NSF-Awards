The Devonian Period was a time of diversification among early land plants, and
the Gaspe Penninsula of Canada and Maine hold a rich fossil record of these
primitive groups. Dr. Patricia Gensel has requested continued support for her
efforts to collect, prepare, and describe representatives of several of the
early lineages of land plants found there. Electron microscoy and computer-aided
3-dimensional synthesis of thin sections will be used to study and reconstruct
tissue structures. Variability will be studied in order to better delimit the
species and genera present. The proposed work has important implications beyond
the samples to be described. Her descriptive work will add significantly to our
understanding of the anatomy and growth of these plants, and of their ecological
circumstances and evolutionary relationships. These observations will lead to
more sophisticated analyses of ancestor-descendant relationships, and they have
potential to reshape the current classification of early land plants.
