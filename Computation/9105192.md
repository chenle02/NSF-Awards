The research activity in this project will utilize concepts of linear matrix
algebra to design fast computational algorithms for signal processing. In the
last decade, concepts from linear matrix algebra have acquired a central
position in the development of signal processing algorithms. The solution to
many practical signal processing problems can be obtained in terms of ranks of
certain matrices and corresponding subspaces. In fact, the importance of
subspaces in signal processing is motivation for developing tools from the
algebra of subspaces, multilinear algebra. Some important application areas for
linear and multilinear algebra include direction of arrival estimation,
frequency estimation, signal detection, seismic and geological exploration,
dynamic analysis of structures, biomedical signal processing, system
identification, chemistry and economics.
