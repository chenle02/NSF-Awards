This project explores an approach to image compression that is based upon
extention of ideas successfully employed in the losslesss compression of
one.dimensional textual data; e.g., the Lempel-Ziv text-compression algorithm.
The extentions involve the fact that image and video data can be regarded as
two- and three- dimensional data sets and also that lossy compression can be
used in order to achieve higher compression ratios. A key feature of this
research is the consideration of hardware implementation issues. By using a
massively parallel systolic architecture, it is anticipated that a VLSI
implementation of real-time compression of high definition video signals can be
achieved.
