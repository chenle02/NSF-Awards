9704143 Wudl This project will develop a new approach to extended-network, very
high strength organic polymeric materials. Some of these materials will be
ultrahard, others will be "organic zeolites:. Three approaches will be pursued:
(a) preparation of new polymers and copolymers where pleiadene (a hydrocarbon
which becomes reactive at ca 220 degrees C) is a pendant group, (b) preparation
of new polymers in which pleiadene undergoes cycloaddition polymerization to
form the backbone, and c preparation of new extended network polymers based on
reversible Diels Alder polymerizations and on the pleiadene cycloaddition
dimerization reaction and multiple cycloaddition to C60. Once prepared, the new
polymeric materials will have their mechanical, optical and electronic
properties determined using the latest techniques in materials science and
experimental condensed matter physics. %%% These novel polymeric materials
should have potential applications as structural materials of strengths
approaching diamond as catalyst supports, etc., and may open the door to new
families of rationally designed, three-dimensional extended solids. ***
