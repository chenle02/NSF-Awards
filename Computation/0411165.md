The project is aiming at solving polynomial systems numerically by the homotopy
continuation method. Over the years, practical evidences have been given that
the homotopy method is efficient, reliable and much powerful in solving
polynomial systems. Recently, modeling the sparse structure of a polynomial
system by its Newton polytopes leads to a major computational breakthrough
called the polyhedral homotopy method. Based on it, a source code HOM4PS,
produced by the PI and his students, leads all the other existing codes for
solving polynomial systems in efficiency and storage requirement by a great
margin. Nonetheless, there are numerous models of large polynomial systems in
application still do not have a satisfactory line of attack. And it has become
apparent that the numerical techniques for following homotopy paths are far from
thoroughly developed for large systems. The essence of the project is the
advance development in all aspects of the solver HOM4PS based on the conduct of
further research to greatly enlarge the scope of its applications, especially
applications to large systems.

The problem of solving polynomial systems arises very frequently in various
fields of science and engineering, such as formula construction, geometric
intersection, inverse kinematics, robotics, power flow problems with PQ-
specified bases, vision and the computation of equilibrium states of chemical
reaction equations, etc. This topic has been an important research subjectin
Europe. In the last decade, a considerable research effort involving seven
countries and twenty universities had been directed to this problem in two
consecutive major projects, PoSSo and FRISCO, supported by European Commission.
As mentioned above, the code HOM4PS developed by the PI for this problem is far
more advanced and the ultimate goal of the current project is a more complete
high-quality block-box software which will incorporate the best state of the art
to provide the general scientific community a reliable source for solving
polynomial systems on a wide variety of advanced architectures.
