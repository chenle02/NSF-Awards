The primary objective of the proposed research is to produce an accurate model
of trap generation and leakage currents to develop effective models of breakdown
and to maintain a certain level of performance as the dimensions of nonvolatile
memory transistors are scaled. The research strategy involves parallel efforts
on trap state generation, annealing of stress-induced damage, and the
development of a theoretical analysis utilizing second order trapping kinetics
theory for the analysis of key phenomena which are characteristic of dielectric
breakdown failures.
