This project is focused on characterizing biological aerosol particles or
bioaerosols (e.g. fungi, bacteria and pollen) in the atmosphere. Bioaerosols
affect the physical and chemical properties of atmospheric aerosols and play a
crucial role in various climate-relevant atmospheric processes, such as the
formation of cloud and ice nuclei. This study will improve understanding of the
atmospheric chemistry of bioaerosols as well as yield insights on the
parameterization of bioaerosols in regional and global climate
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will address the following questions: (1)
What is the chemical composition of atmospherically-relevant biological species
(fungi, bacteria and pollen)? (2) How do bioaerosols affect atmospheric aerosol
mass? (3) How do chemical properties of bioaerosols change as they age in the
atmosphere? The analyses will determine chemical composition and changes due to
photo-chemical aging using an oxidation flow reactor. Collected ambient
bioaerosol samples will be analyzed for biological constituents using high-
resolution microscopy and DNA sequence-based techniques, while organic compounds
will be quantitatively analyzed using analytical techniques to identify tracer
compounds representing primary and oxidized bioaerosol
compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project results will help: (i) identify organic
tracers specific for bioaerosol genera, (ii) determine the contribution of
bioaerosols as well as primary and aged organic compounds to atmospheric organic
molecular composition, and (iii) obtain source profiles for bioaerosols to be
used in Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) receptor modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
