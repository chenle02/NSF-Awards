Dr. Schubert will pursue four areas of inquiry regarding tropical cyclones.
First, many aspects of hurricane dynamics are poorly understood, including
spiral bands, polygonal eyewalls, and the oscillatory or looping paths
hurricanes take. An attempt will be made to develop a unified dynamical
understanding of these phenomena using simple theoretical models and numerical
simulation. A second intriguing problem involves the phenomenon of twin tropical
cyclones. These paired storms occur exclusively in the west Pacific and Indian
Oceans and play a role in the dynamics of El Nino. These systems will be
investigated in a series of modeling studies. Another interesting phenomenon
which has been observed primarily from satellite observations is the development
of undulations in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) cloud patterns and
the subsequent formation of one or more tropical cyclones, depending on the
degree of curvature. Dr. Schubert will study the cyclone formation processes
within the ITCZ in a series of modeling studies. In all of the modeling studies,
he intends to investigate the role of moist physics. Finally, the recent
development by the principal investigator of a new coordinate system based on
vorticity for use in models opens the possibility of formulating a three
dimensional nonlinear balanced theory for vortices. Dr. Schubert will also
pursue this possibility. All four topics represent important research problems
that are critical to improving understanding of the formation and behavior of
tropical cyclones. ***
