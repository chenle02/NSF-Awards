This interdisciplinary research will investigate the mechanical behavior of
model joints in metal matrix composites and its relationship to defects and
microstructural features developed during processing. Research will focus on
joint geometries commonly found in designing with advanced materials, including
both composite-composite and composite-monolithic combinations. Fiber coatings
will be used to control the interfacial characteristics of the composites and to
develop an understanding of end effects in weakly and strongly bonded systems.
Particular emphasis will be placed on the evolution of defects and relevant
microstructural features during diffusion bonding, and their role in deformation
micromechanics and properties of the joint. Tests will be conducted at elevated
and ambient temperatures under various loading conditions and the results
related to emerging constitutive laws developed for monolithic and for composite
materials. This research should assist in the construction of predictive models
for the behavior of joint systems using the principles of micromechanics and
processing science.
