9509097 Csernansky Protein kinase C (PKC) is an important enzyme involved in
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in many cells. Preliminary
experiments were performed examining the subcellular localization of PKC
isozymes in mouse pure neuronal cultures deprived of serum, a model of
apoptosis. One isozyme, PKC-delta, is selectively translocated to the nucleus
during serum deprivation injury in neurons. The hypothesis that translocation of
PKC-delta is an early, and possibly critical event in the development of serum
deprivation injury will be tested. Immunoblots will be performed on total and
nuclear protein fractions from pure neurons to confirm that translocation of
PKC-delta protein is observed when PKC-delta immunoreactivity appears in the
nucleus. PKC kinase activity will be evaluated for the total and nuclear
neuronal protein fractions to determine whether there is a change in nuclear PKC
activity during serum deprivation. Nerve growth factor deprivation-induced
apoptosis in PC 12 cells will be used to determine whether translocation of PKC-
delta is critical for the development of apoptosis in other model systems.
