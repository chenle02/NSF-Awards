This research program is concerned with the analysis, development and testing
of finite difference methods for convection-diffusion problems in two and three
dimensions based on the theory of monotone matrices. The algorithms developed
will provide high accuracy, oscillation free, approximate solutions to these
difficult problems in partial differential equations. The results of the
research program will have direct applications in fluid flow, combustion and
related problems.
