The Department of Mathematics at California Polytechnic State University, San
Luis Obispo will provide opportunities for summer research for up to six
undergraduates. Recruitment will take place nationwide, but our recruitment will
be focused on students from universities in California. The research emphasis
will be in the fields of operator theory and topology. The students will attend
seminars with participating faculty and work individually with faculty, many of
whom have experience doing research with undergraduates. The students will also
have the opportunity to work collaboratively with and give talks to their peers,
as well as write a final report with their research results. The program will
run for eight weeks, and should be compatible with both a quarter system and a
semester system.
