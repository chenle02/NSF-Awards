In recent years, the Biology Department has undergone considerable
modernization, including the acquisition of new equipment for courses in
cellular-molecular physiology. Through this project, a course is being
established to enable undergraduates to study basic cellular and molecular
processes in physiology using modern instrumentation. As part of the class,
students are performing a variety of critical experiments to help them
understand how to approach problems in physiology using modern equipment. After
mastering the instrumentation through supervision, students are designing their
own research projects based on a survey of the literature. The final examination
in the course is an oral presentation given to and evaluated by a group of
peers. In addition to technical knowledge, students who enroll in this class are
developing skills in experimental design and hypothesis testing. The new
equipment is being shared with physiology, development, and cell and molecular
biology courses. For students pursuing summer research opportunities, the
equipment is being made available for their training prior to the experience. It
is enriching the curriculum in biomedical education for about 340 students. *
