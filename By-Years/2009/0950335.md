Support is provided to partially cover the travel expenses of selected US
participants of the 2010 International Symposium on Flexible Automation, which
will be held in Tokyo, Japan on July 12-14, 2010. The funds will support a total
of about 20 researchers from the US to attend the symposium. The Symposium will
consist of three days of technical presentations and keynote speeches, followed
by post-symposium technical tours to major university research laboratories and
industry production facilities in Japan. This grant will stimulate the technical
discussion among researchers in the field and foster future collaborations. The
benefits to the U.S. researchers attending the symposium will include the
knowledge gained from the technical presentations and discussions on various
processes and systems and underlying principles of flexible
automation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Japan is one of the world leaders in nano-
manipulation, nano-machining, robotics and control, sensors, system analysis and
integration, the support will enable many researchers (faculty, post-doctoral
fellows and graduate students), scientists and engineers from U.S. to gain the
first-hand knowledge of research, development, and implementation of flexible
automation technologies in Japan.
