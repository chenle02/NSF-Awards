Investigators from the University of Texas Arlington and Florida International
University have received funding to investigate physiological processes of
arctic tundra vegetation during the winter. The study will increase our
understanding of physiological processes of arctic tundra vegetation under snow
during the cold season and increase our knowledge of how these processes
contribute to the carbon cycling and climate change. The project will
investigate cold season plant physiology, carbon acquisition under snow, carbon
turnover, sources of water for the plants during the cold season, mortality, and
respiration rate sensitivity to predicted changes in temperature. The results
are expected to provide new insights into plant physiology and carbon dynamics
of two tundra ecosystems during the cold season.
