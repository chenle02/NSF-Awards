This research will develop methods for proving lower bounds on the complexity
of general Boolean circuits for computing specific functions. Several directions
appear promising. One is the topological approach of Sipser, where infinitary
analogs suggest ways to apply concepts from descriptive set theory. The second
is an approach suggested by Karchmer, Raz and Wigderson for obtaining high depth
complexity by composing hard functions. The third is a method suggested by
Razborov as a generalization of the approximation method he used to obtain
monotone lower bounds.
