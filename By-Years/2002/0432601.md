AST-0432601&lt;br/&gt;Inst: AURA, Inc&lt;br/&gt;PI: William
Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for a
workshop on Future Large-Scale Projects and Programs in Astronomy and
Astrophysics as a result of a charge from the Global Science Forum of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This is the second
of two workshops and will bring together approximately 60 representatives of the
international astronomical community to meet in Arlington, VA on 5-6 April 2004.
The discussion of the means by which international partnerships and cooperation
in large-scale astronomical instruments can be forged and the report that will
be issued by OECD as a result of these two workshops are timely and could be
valuable for policy makers, national or multi-national observatories, and
project offices. The intention of the workshop is specifically not to endorse or
prioritize specific projects but rather to help to lay a groundwork on which
international collaborations can be built.&lt;br/&gt;
