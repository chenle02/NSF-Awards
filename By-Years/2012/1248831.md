This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a low
cost&lt;br/&gt;and durable ice-release coating to mitigate icing-related
problems encountered by air&lt;br/&gt;transportation, power transmission, wind
energy industries, and appliances such as&lt;br/&gt;refrigerators, freezers and
air conditioners. Current de-icing products include&lt;br/&gt;environmentally
problematic de-icing fluids, energy inefficient electrical heating,
and&lt;br/&gt;deicing coatings with high cost but poor mechanical toughness. The
proposed coating is&lt;br/&gt;based on (1) a recent fundamental study that
revealed a heretofore unrecognized&lt;br/&gt;combination of critical parameters
controlling ice adhesion, (2) a novel hybrid coating&lt;br/&gt;model that
includes nanoscale and mesoscale contributions to weakening ice
adhesion,&lt;br/&gt;and (3) a ?soft surface / tough bulk? coating that utilizes
strong mechanical properties of&lt;br/&gt;a conventional, low cost polymer and a
low surface energy polymer modifier. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed coating product will
reduce costs and mitigate damage to energy,&lt;br/&gt;communication and
transportation industries as well as reducing maintenance
on&lt;br/&gt;refrigeration appliances. ?Green chemical engineering? is targeted
for minimum VOC&lt;br/&gt;and short chain fluorocarbon constituents that are
environmentally benign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project include (i) de-
icing&lt;br/&gt;applications in ground and ocean transportation, such as easy
ice release for automobiles&lt;br/&gt;and ships, and in housing to prevent ice
accumulation, for example on roofs; (ii) easy&lt;br/&gt;release of hard fouling
for ships and ocean platforms;. Potential customers include&lt;br/&gt;Department
of Defense for US Air Force and Navy, transportation and energy
industries,&lt;br/&gt;and the petroleum industry.
