The T4-like Myoviridae are a large group of bacterial viruses that resemble the
Escherichia coli phage T4. Their DNA genomes range in size between 169,000 and
250,000 base-pairs and are believed to contain a record of the extent of genetic
diversity in the microbial world. The broad host range of these phages and the
mosaic organizations of their genomes suggest that they have played important
roles as vehicles for lateral transfer of genetic cassettes between organisms in
the biosphere. This project will result in the sequencing of 15 highly diverged
members of this group, including the genomes of T4-like phages that infect
Aeromonas, Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, Vibrio and marine bacterial species. It
is expected that results of this project will yield clues about the factors that
create, maintain and exploit microbial diversity during evolution. The methods
of analysis to be used include novel DNA sequencing strategies that generate
data quickly and at low cost. Automated computer programs are then used to
assemble sequence data and to predict the structures and biological functions of
the gene products (RNA and protein molecules) that are encoded by each of these
genomes. Information from this project is being deposited in a publicly
accessible interactive genome browser on a computer server at Tulane University,
as well as in the NCBI database, GenBank. Between them, the Tulane and NCBI
databases allow a wide variety of interactive evaluations of project data by the
scientific community at large. In addition to providing information about gene
swapping in nature, the project is yielding numerous clues about the structures
and functions of the proteins and nucleic acids that determine individuality
(specificity) of DNA replication and gene expression (transcription and
translation) in different organisms. Thus, this project is expected to have a
broad impact on scientific discovery and understanding of molecular evolution.
