Two problems are considered. The first concerns the stability of periodic
solutions to delay equations with negative feedback. These equations arise in
such fields as population biology, physiology and optics. The second problem
concerns the study of heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits representing traveling
wave solutions of reaction-diffusion equations. These equations arise in the
study of nerve impulses, flame propagation and phase transitions
