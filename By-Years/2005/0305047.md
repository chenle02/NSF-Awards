ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;TOPICS IN DISCRETE GROUPS AND
GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richard Schwartz plans to continue his
research in&lt;br/&gt;geometry and discrete groups.&lt;br/&gt;One of his main
goals is to explore the connections&lt;br/&gt;between three dimensional real
hyperbolic geometry&lt;br/&gt;and four dimensional complex hyperbolic
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Schwartz observed that certain complex
hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;deformations of the reflection triangle
groups&lt;br/&gt;lead to complex hyperbolic four-manifolds whose&lt;br/&gt;ideal
boundaries are real hyperbolic three-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;As the angles in the
triangle group change, the&lt;br/&gt;ideal boundary appears to undergo Dehn
surgery.&lt;br/&gt;Schwartz also plans to study quotients of the
circle,&lt;br/&gt;based on patterns of geodesics in the
hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;plane which are invariant under the action of
a&lt;br/&gt;surface group. The idea is to make &lt;br/&gt;topological models for
the limit sets which could&lt;br/&gt;arise in connection with deformations of
surface&lt;br/&gt;groups into Lie groups and then use the models&lt;br/&gt;to
study actual deformations of surface groups into&lt;br/&gt;Lie
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, Schwartz' research deals
with&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of infinite repeating patterns.&lt;br/&gt;A crystal
lattice is an example of an infinite&lt;br/&gt;repeating pattern in Euclidean
space. Analogous&lt;br/&gt;patterns exist in curved spaces, and
often&lt;br/&gt;the curvature of the space allows for the&lt;br/&gt;existence of
more exotic and geometrically rich patterns.&lt;br/&gt;Schwartz is interested in
the studying these&lt;br/&gt;exotic patterns when they are generated by a
simple&lt;br/&gt;mechanism which has a finite description.&lt;br/&gt;For
example, one can place several mirrors in&lt;br/&gt;a curved space and look at
the pattern generated&lt;br/&gt;by the images of an object which is
reflected&lt;br/&gt;endlessly in the mirrors.&lt;br/&gt;The central question is:
When does the finite&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of generation lead to an
infinite&lt;br/&gt;discrete pattern?
