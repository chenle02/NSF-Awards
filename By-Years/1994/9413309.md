This project emphasizes practical as well as theoretical aspects surrounding
the application and implementation of algorithms for computing stationary
probabilities of discrete Markov chains. Special attention is devoted to
applications in which discrete models are used to understand and analyze the
dynamics of large systems comprised of a collection of loosely coupled
subsystems such as in the study of queuing models and networks,
telecommunications, computer performance evaluation, stochastic automata
networks, and economic modeling and forecasting. Algorithmic facets concern the
development and analysis of parallel multilevel methods based on
aggregation/disaggregation techniques---both direct and iterative--- and some of
these techniques are applied to problems involving stochastic automata networks.
An architectural aspect involves the identification of features of vector and
parallel computers that are best suited for implementing Markov chain
algorithms. Theoretical components involve studying properties of Markov chains.
These ideas are then used to generate error analyses aimed at understanding the
convergence and stability properties of multilevel aggregation/disaggregation
algorithms.
