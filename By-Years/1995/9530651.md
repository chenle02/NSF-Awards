CTS - 9530651 Christodoulos Floudas Princeton University ABSTRACT The project
deals with the analysis, design and synthesis of non-ideal separation systems.
Global optimization techniques based on the minimization of Gibbs free energy
and the tangent plane stability criterion will be used. The stability criterion
will be applied to systems with many components and chemical reactions.
Objectives include determination of azeotropes for both homogeneous and
heterogeneous systems, and evaluation of the effects of different fugacity
models and equations of state on phase equilibria. Parameter uncertainty will be
incorporated into the design. Also, azeotropic distillation systems will be
analyzed by combining residue curve maps with optimization methods. The results
may lead to improved separation techniques for manufacturing chemicals.
