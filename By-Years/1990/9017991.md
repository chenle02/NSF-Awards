The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of research vessels,
operated by academic institutions, provides support services to those NSF
sponsored researchers who require time at sea to complete their investigations.
All of these ships use oceanographic wire rope as part of this research support.
Arrangements have been made which allow bulk purchases of wire rope resulting in
considerable cost savings. Twelve reels of torque balanced wire rope will be
purchased. The wire rope is stored until needed by ship operators at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography on the west coast. Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine
Operations Coordinator, WHOI, will manage this project.
