Auxin is a hormone in plants that governs many basic physiological processes
including cell growth. A special transport process moves auxin from cell to cell
through plant organs. Understanding how this happens in detail, at the molecular
and physical levels, has been a long-standing goal in the field of plant
biology. If the auxin transport process were better understood, it could be
possible to manipulate it to improve the growth of crops and other plants on
which society depends. The project will use a biophysical technique called
patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine how proteins belonging to the B
subfamily of ATP-Binding-Cassette Transporters, contribute to the auxin
transport process. Previous research has shown such proteins are required for
auxin transport, but exactly what makes them necessary is not known, because it
is not known if they actually transport auxin by themselves, assist other
proteins, or in some other way are necessary for the process. By expressing such
ABCB transporter proteins in animal cells, which do not possess auxin transport
capability themselves, and then using the patch clamp technique to measure the
flow of ions (electrically charged atoms) across the membranes of the animal
cells, with and without auxin being present, the investigators will learn how
ABCB transporters function, and this will lead to new, testable ideas about how
auxin moves from cell to cell. The patch-clamp technique has not been used to
study auxin transport before, so this project represents a new combination of
biophysics and plant genetics. One expected result is a direct recording of the
electric current caused by the charged auxin molecule as it passes through the
ABCB transporter, or a definitive demonstration of its absence. A postdoctoral
student will be trained to work at the interdisciplinary interface of biophysics
and plant molecular biology during this project.
