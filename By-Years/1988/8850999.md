Phase Two of Operation Physics continues this national project to improve the
teaching and learning of basic physics concepts in the upper elementary and
middle school grades. Thirty-six three-member leadership teams, geographically
distributed throughout the United States will participate in an intensive
activity-oriented three-week training program held at San Diego State
University. This team, consisting of a teacher, a supervisor or administrator
and a college/university person from the local region, will focus on the physics
content typically identified for inclusion in the K-8 curriculum, current
methods and materials appropriate for teaching physics to elementary and middle
school children, recent research related to learning theory and teaching
practice using especially designed workshop kits developed during the first
phase of the project. The teams will also receive training and assistance in
using these kits to plan and conduct a required number of inservice workshops in
their own area. The Operation Physics teams will be assisted in their
dissemination efforts through the services of the Education Division of the
American Institute of Physics and the Operation Physics State Facilitators.
These State Facilitators will coordinate the implementation and dissemination of
the Operation Physics programs in the state. The cost-sharing for this project
represents a significant part of the total cost. Contributions from the school
districts, San Diego State University, and AIP represent an amount equal to 49%
of the NSF request. //
