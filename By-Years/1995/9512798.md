9512798 Boyanovsky This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research effort will study
dynamic properties of certain systems out of equilibrium; in particular, the
non-equilibrium dynamics of phase transitions and transport phenomena of
solitons and vortices. The collaboration between Daniel Boyanovsky of the
University of Pittsburgh and Carlos Aragao de Carvalho of Universidade Federal
do Rio de Janeiro will focus on real-time descriptions of the systems, including
the dynamics of reheating and thermalization. The work will also extend to
tunneling and thermal activation, developing methods that can be applied to
nucleation and quantum tunneling in condensed matter, particle physics, and
cosmology. The proposed work is timely and innovative, addressing issues of
concern in several overlapping fields. The collaboration is supported in Brazil
by CNPq, and both sides will include graduate students and post-docs in the
research and travel. The visiting senior scientists will interact with graduate
students to provide special educational experiences. ****
