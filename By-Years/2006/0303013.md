The scientific objective of this project is to investigate all-optical
approaches to atomic Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The recent demonstration
of all-optical BEC by this group provided the first new path to achieving
quantum degeneracy in atomic gases since the pioneering demonstrations in 1995.
The method is surprising simple and an order of magnitude faster than standard
BEC experiments. In the new investigations being undertaken in the present
project, efforts will concentrate on examining the mechanisms behind the
remarkable loading properties of these traps. Additionally, the considerable
flexibility provided by tailoring the optical trapping potential will be
exploited to explore alternative trapping geometries, allowing for formation of
multiple condensates in large-period lattices. This capability, combined with
spin-independent nature of these traps, will make it possible to explore many
fundamental issues of multi-component (spinor) condensates. In a broader scope,
the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases has created
a new frontier of research in AMO physics with significant overlap with
traditional areas of condensed matter physics. Given the potential of the field,
it is important to explore different methods for reaching BEC, particularly
methods that offer new capabilities, simplicity, or speed. Research efforts will
be accompanied by the training of students to work in this emerging new field.
