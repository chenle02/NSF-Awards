This is a cooperative research project between the University of Missouri (UMR)
and the National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan, to study the seismic
behavior and design of reinforced concrete low-rise shear walls and building
systems with openings. NCKU will perform experimental and UMR will conduct
analytical studies. The objectives are: 1) mathematical formulation of load-
deflection of walls with coupling deformations of bending, shear, axial,and bond
slip, 2) evaluation of stiffness reduction of walls and structural systems after
cracks, 3) development of hysteresis models for bendings, shear and axial, based
on coupling behavior, 4) evaluation of damping coefficients at various
deformation stages, 5) statistical studies of design parameters of reduction
factor, ductility and damage index, 6) correlation of the analytical and
experimental results. Recommendations for building code revisions/improvements
will be made for engineering practice.
