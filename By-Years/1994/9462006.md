In this proposal, we describe the development of a new epitaxial growth
technique, suitable for the deposition of a wide variety of thin films of
organic materials. The new method, Organic Vapor Phase Deposition, (OVPD), is
based on the principles of the Organo-Metalic Vapor Phase Epitaxy, (OMVPE),
which is currently the most widely used method for the growth of epitaxial films
of inorganic electronic and photonic materials. The method will be applied to
growth of light emitting organic films such as PTCDA, NTCDA, TPD and Mq3.
Organic LEDs will be made and their optoelectronic characteristics will be
evaluated. In Phase II full color displays as large as 6OOcm2 will be made. This
completely new proposed growth technology builds on a substantial demonstrated
expertise in the vacuum deposition of such organic materials, where the
consultant to this SBIR (Prof. S. Forrest, Princeton University) is well-known
pioneer in the field of organic thin film growth, and Dr. Vladimir S. Ban, (PI
), who is an expert in design of epitaxial reactors and epitaxial growth.
