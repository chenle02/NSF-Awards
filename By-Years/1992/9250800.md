The project will establish a laboratory-based, discovery- curriculum in Learning
and Behavior, an intermediate-level course commonly offered within undergraduate
psychology curricula. The intent is not simply to introduce laboratory work as a
component of the course; rather, it is to reverse the usual relationship between
lecture and laboratory work so that laboratory investigation becomes the primary
route through which students come into contact with the discipline. This course
may then serve as a model through which other standard psychology courses may be
reorganized within a discovery curriculum framework. The requested equipment
will permit the rapid changeover between experimental configurations, and will
allow students with minimal pretraining to program a wide variety of animal
conditioning procedures.
