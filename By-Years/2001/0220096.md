This project, which is a collaborative effort between the University
of&lt;br/&gt;California at Riverside and Los Angeles, focuses on processor
and&lt;br/&gt;system architecture issues for Web Switches. Web switches are
network&lt;br/&gt;processing elements that modify network traffic based on
content.&lt;br/&gt;These devices are frequently used to provide load balancing
between&lt;br/&gt;functionally equivalent servers as well as cryptographic
services; in&lt;br/&gt;in the future will be used for a host of new applications
including&lt;br/&gt;active security and multimedia trans-coding. This project
will begin&lt;br/&gt;by developing a benchmarking framework that can be used to
evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the performance of Web switches. The research will then use
advanced&lt;br/&gt;processor simulation tools to study architectural tradeoffs
in the&lt;br/&gt;face of the benchmark workload. In particular, the researchers
will&lt;br/&gt;focus on the efficacy of hardware accelerator blocks that have
been&lt;br/&gt;proposed. Finally, work will be completed to implement the
workload&lt;br/&gt;and capitalize on acquired knowledge in the context of an
existing&lt;br/&gt;test bed for network processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
