With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
Davis will acquire an ultrahigh-resolution vacuum ultraviolet laser system. This
equipment will enhance research in the following areas: a) high-resolution two-
color IR-VUV and VUV-IR photoionization and pulsed-field-ionization-
photoelectron studies of simple polyatomic molecules, including selected amino
acids; b) studies of the dissociation dynamics of carbon disulfide and carbon
dioxide and to determine product branching ratios; c) development of high
resolution VUV microscopic techniques for characterization of carbon and silicon
in nanomaterials; d) VUV resonance Raman spectroscopic studies of the dynamics
and spectroscopy of radicals; e) studies on the surface structures of absorbed
molecules and their activities; and f) analysis of airborne pollutants,
aerosols, and biomolecules. The existence of this multi-user laser facility will
not only induce future cooperative projects between these groups, but also
provide a positive learning environment for graduate and postdoctoral students
in the Chemistry Department to familiarize with various frontier research areas
in physical, analytical, atmospheric and biophysical chemistry. A comprehensive
ultrahigh-resolution VUV laser system such as this does not currently exist in
the US or Canada. The application of this laser system represents a frontier in
many important research fields, such as spectroscopy of ions, thermochemistry of
reactive intermediates, mass spectrometry for analytical and atmospheric
sampling, and microscopy for materials studies.
