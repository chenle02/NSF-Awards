Many mountain belts are characterized by late stage normal faults and bimodal
igneous activity, both considered to be reflective of orogenic collapse. This
proposal will address a classic example of such activity, the Donegal granitic
suite of northern Ireland by collecting a suite of very high quality radiometric
ages on igneous rocks and fabric-forming minerals in shear zones believed to
related to plutonism. The ages of plutonic rocks coupled with ages of activity
on major shear zones will provide critical data needed to evaluate various
mechanisms which produced the late stage activity.
