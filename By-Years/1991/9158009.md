It is generally acknowledged that progress in computational engineering is
contingent upon the development of a reliable three- dimensional discretization
scheme. This is the goal of this Presidential Young Investigator grant to
construct a mesh generator and to integrate it with a commercially available
drawing tool. The area chosen as specific applications will be the simulation of
electromagnetic field phenomena; low frequency nonlinear electric and magnetic
field systems and continuum electromechanics. The new automatic mesh generation
routine is based on Delaunay triangulation and an implementation scheme
incorporating efficient matrix solves and error controls in the boundary element
formulation.
