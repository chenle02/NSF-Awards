The project seeks to establish effective methods and infrastructure to transform
an individual long-term ecological research (LTER) site data into a shared
resource that would be accessible to a wide range of researchers. The scientific
community needs to transform data management into information management
practices that incorporate interoperability and metadata (data about the data)
standards. The work with prototype tools will take place within the
computational framework at San Diego, centered on existing metadata standards,
such as the Morpho software, in collaboration with the national Center for
Ecosystem Analysis and Synthesis (CEAS) at Santa Barbara. New versions of Morpho
will enable the installation and testing of modules as an integrated component.
Similarly, bibliographic software will be implemented using the Palmer
(Antarctic) site bibliography as a test dataset. The third type of prototype
will involve tools for organizational documentation, such as surveys and other
communication vehicles.
