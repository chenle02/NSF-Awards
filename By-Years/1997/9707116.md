Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology which allows for visual interactive
analyses of large data sets; essentially, VR displays interactive three
dimensional worlds in near real-time. Haptics is the field which studies human
computer interaction. Several type of haptic devices currently available are
also capable of also delivering forces back to the user through a handle, or
"joystick." The Finite Element Method (FEM) is an established computational
method which allows engineers to study the deformation of physical bodies
subjected to external force and displacements. It is feasible to combine these
established technologies to create a platform for Physically-Based Virtual
Reality (PBVR). This project will design and experiment with such a PBVR
platform, consisting of a PC-based data-acquisition system, a haptic-feedback
joystick, and a UNIX-based immersive visualizer.
