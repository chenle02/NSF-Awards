9723671 Martienssen In a few years, the DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis genome
will be known. However, there will be many coding regions for which we do not
know a function and the developmental context and location in which they are
expressed will not be known. The goal of the project is to generate new lines of
Arabidopsis each carrying a gene trap or enhancer trap transposon and to
sequence the genomic DNA flanking a number of the trapped insertion sites. This
work will form the basis for a larger database which can eventually be merged
with the genomic sequences, to provide data on cell-specificity and
developmental specificity of unknown genes. The collection will become a
powerful resource for fine-mapping and positional cloning as well as for local
saturation mutagenesis.
