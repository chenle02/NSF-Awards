Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pollution of water can negatively affect the
use of water for drinking, household needs, recreation, fishing, transportation
and commerce. The events of 9/11 have redefined the concept of risk and
uncertainty, and water security is of national importance. In order to prepare
for catastrophic events, water utilities need to detect and minimize the risk of
malicious water contamination in distributed water networks. Integration of
adequate numbers of sensors at appropriate places in water distribution networks
can provide an early detection system where appropriate control measures can be
taken to minimize the risk. The focus of this project is to include estimates of
risk, uncertainties in the problems of finding optimal sensor placement and
quality control of water networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem will be
posed as a two-stage mixed integer stochastic programming problem. Customized
and efficient algorithms will be developed in order to address real world
problems. The methodology will be assessed for applicability to large scale
problems related to water security and its possible extension to other
infrastructure security problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad
Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the obvious importance to homeland security,
the project will also benefit women as the PI plans to target them for
participation in the research. The PI is a faculty advisor for the Society of
Women Engineers (SWE) and a mentor in the Women in Science and Engineering
(WISE) program.&lt;br/&gt;
