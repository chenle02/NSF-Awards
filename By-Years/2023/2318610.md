Scientific research is vital for technological advancements in firms, yet the
commercial utilization of scientific knowledge faces significant challenges.
Despite the availability of scientific knowledge, it often remains trapped in
the ivory tower, if it is ever applied commercially. This project focuses on the
diffusion of scientific information to firms, and the barrier created by the
complexity of scientific papers tailored for experts. This complexity hampers
comprehension and effective utilization by non-experts and the public.
Simplifying scientific information and communicating it to a broader audience
can potentially enhance the commercial diffusion of science. To explore this,
the researchers investigate the role of media coverage (supported by scientific
press releases), which have been underemphasized in the literature on the
commercialization of science.

The project addresses three key research questions: (a) What is the causal
impact of media coverage on driving commercialization, and to what extent? (b)
Which types of scientists and firms benefit from media coverage? and (c) What
are the mechanisms through which scientific media coverage drives commercial
diffusion? To answer these questions, the researchers have compiled a unique
dataset that matches scientific press releases from over 100 US research
institutions with scientific articles in the field of biology and patent-to-
paper citations related to commercial applications. They employ an innovative
research design for causal inference, leveraging capacity constraints at
university press information offices to generate random variation in press
release likelihood for articles of similar quality. By examining how and when
media coverage can facilitate diffusion, this project will contribute valuable
insights to addressing the challenge of limited scientific commercialization.
