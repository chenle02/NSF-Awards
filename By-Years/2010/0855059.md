In the Information Age, processing and representation of multidimensional data
has gained critical importance. The goal of this project is to train students at
Northern New Mexico College in effective use of the power of parallel computing
in processing and visual representation of large volumes of data. The High
Performance Cluster of computers will be used for both and research and
educational projects. At least, ten of the faculty at the College will actively
use the cluster for research. The PI will model the nanotechnology of
semiconducting materials like gallium arsenide and its applications to solar
devices. Dr. David Torres, Co-Principal Investigator, will conduct simulations
of incompressible fluid flow and surface tension. Surface tension is important
in many industrial settings, including casting, fuel injection sprays and inkjet
printers. Dr. Cathy Berryhill and Mr. Jean Constant will team up with the PI to
conduct research on scientific visualization, including the study of novel ways
of displaying information and the effective use of visualization software in the
classroom. Dr. Claudia Aprea will use the cluster for research in Earth and
Planetary Science and Environmental Science, including work on mapping the
subsurface of Mars, on creating a 3-dimensional geophysical model database for
the state of New Mexico, and on the mapping the surface of the Earth for
scientific or prospecting purposes. Research areas of interest to other faculty
include a database of local pollen counts, the design of feedback control
systems, the performance of solar photovoltaic systems, and the reliability of
computer storage systems. The project will facilitate research, teaching and
outreach activities at the host institution.
