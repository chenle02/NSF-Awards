The method of optimal prediction has been developed recently. It gives the best
approximation to non-linear equations assuming that the higher modes are random.
It is suited for computing complicated flows, when the information about the
initial data is incomplete. The proposer will study the convergence of the
optimal prediction method applied to the cubic Schrodinger equation. Such
equations occur in quantum mechanics. In addition the method will be used to
study the flow of incompressible and inviscid fluids in three dimensions. The
complicated behavior of such fluids is part of the problem of turbulence.

Turbulent flows typically consist of a slow, large scale motion, and a lot of
small, but fast, eddies. Instead of computing the flow by a single numerical
algorithm, the investigator will treat the small scale motion as a random
component, and incorporate its influence on the large scale motion
approximately. The goal is to develope faster and more robust computational
schemes for turbulent flows.
