The Bulldog Connectivity and Research Network (BCR net) project at South
Carolina State University (SCSU) creates a network infrastructure to accommodate
increasing research activities in STEM and non-traditional areas such as the
library, visual arts, museum and the planetarium. The campus enterprise network,
plagued with bandwidth bottlenecks, supports only administrative, and academic
needs, which competes for simultaneous use of limited resources. Disparate silos
of unconnected computing resources have supported research computing in research
labs with little scalability to the evolution of research needs. The BCR net
provides a frictionless redundant design dedicated to research computing that
delivers high-speed connectivity. Its design focuses on isolating high-
throughput research functions through data paths on operationally efficient
high-speed connections to research partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BCR net,
separate from the campus enterprise network, gives SCSU researchers access to
on-demand high bandwidth science DMZ connections to sharable storage of research
data connected to high throughput data transfer nodes with secure digital
connections. Transfers of large datasets and instructions will be enabled under
projects such as the Robotically Controlled Telescope Consortium, the NSF
Partnership in Observational and Computational Astronomy (POCA), the NSF SCI-
STEPS INCLUDES Project. Other areas affected include; the Physics and Chemistry
computational labs for astrophysics and cancer research, the digital media lab,
the historical collection and archiving Orangeburg massacre collection, applied
radiation sciences lab, the Nuclear Engineering program reactor simulation lab,
and the computer science security lab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
