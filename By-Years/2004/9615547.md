9615547 Burr The NSF funds provided to this project of the Southern Illinois
University's fluid collection of vertebrate animal specimens will be used to
hire a Collection Manager for two years (after which time the position will be
made permanent by the University), to move the collection into 3500 square feet
($518,000 value that incorporates environmental controls and room for growth) of
new space recently constructed by the University (which, in addition to the new
space, has provided $31,000 in shelving, computers and other equipment), and
purchase basic curatorial supplies to improve and expand the relocated and
centralized SIUC fluid collection of vertebrate animals. The SIUC collection has
been heavily used as a regional resource, and contains unique and valuable
materials used in systematic and ecological research and training, and in
environmental analysis and monitoring of changes in biodiversity. The funding
for the overall project, clearly, is an excellent example of partnership between
the Southern Illinois University and the NSF. THIS ABSTRACT IS IN "TEXT ONLY"
