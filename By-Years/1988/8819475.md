The Chlamydomonas Genetic Stock Center serves as a central repository to
receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute stocks of nuclear and chloroplast
mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other Chlamydomonas
species in which extensive genetic analysis has been done. The Center also acts
as a clearinghouse for genetic and molecular mapping data on Chlamydomonas,
continually updates an extensive bibliography of pertinent references, and
provides information to users on culture methods, techniques for genetic
analysis, and other aspects of Chlamydomonas research. Genetic mapping data are
compiled by the Center for publication every two years. During the next five
years, the Center will also begin collecting and maintaining clones of
Chlamydomonas nuclear and chloroplast DNA. This project will provide partial
funding for the Chlamydomonas Center for the next five years.
