This is a U.S.-Taiwan Joint Seminar on plant biochemistry-molecular biology
organized by Dr. Joseph Key, University of Georgia and Professor Chu-Yung Lin,
National Taiwan University. This seminar plans to discuss a broad base of
subject matter, approaches, and modern technologies used in plant molecular
biochemistry. The goals of this seminar are to increase cooperation between
scientists from the U.S. and Taiwan and to use multiple approaches -
physiological, genetic, biochemical, and molecular -to gain full insight into
the biology of particular plants.
