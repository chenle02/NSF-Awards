9320498 Finney This project supports the dissertation research of a student
from the University of Hawaii, studying resource conservation by a fishing
community in the Solomon Islands. The student is testing the theory that
traditional peoples are natural conservators of their environmental resources.
By conducting participant observation, time allocation analysis and economic and
household surveys, the student will test the hypothesis that fishermen stop
exploiting particular resource locations when the yields decline to the average
yield for the area (thus leaving a given location or "patch" before it is
degraded, and so conserving it). This project is important because it will
advance our understanding of indigenous knowledge in tropical marine
environments; it will evaluate the role of territoriality in conserving aquatic
resources; and it will contribute to our understanding of human foraging
strategies as they relate to resource management and conservation. This sort of
knowledge will be valuable to add to our repertoire of resource conservation
strategies in a world of threatened environments. ***
