Experimental studies of nucleon structure functions are proposed for the Laser
Electron Gamma Source (LEGS) facility at Brookhaven National Lab and the large
acceptance detector at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF).
The experiments at LEGS focus on the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule, a sum rule
of fundamental importance, and utilize a polarized photon beam and a polarized
target. The experiments at TJNAF utilize the newly completed CLAS detector to
measure the four structure functions which describe kaon electropoduction. These
in turn will provide tests for models of both the production process and the
structure of the nucleon resonances.
