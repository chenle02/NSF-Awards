9529749 Nelson The chemistry of calcium and the carbon dioxide-carbonate system
of the world ocean are intimately related by processes of production and
dissolution of calcium carbonate. The calcium carbonate- carbon dioxide system
is in fact one of the major geochemical features of the marine environment.
Recent data strongly suggest that variations in calcium concentrations in the
ocean are not quite equal to those one would expect based on the corresponding
variations in alkalinity. This means that there is something about this major
marine geochemical system that we do not understand. In this project, scientists
at the University of Washington will carry out a detailed study of calcium and
alkalinity variations in the oceanic water column with two ends in mind. First
they will characterize the calcium-alkalinity discrepancy on a global basis by
surveying waters of the Northwest Pacific, Northeast Pacific, Southeast Pacific,
and the North Indian Ocean. Secondly, they will also make high-precision
measurements of magnesium and lithium concentrations and lithium isotope
distributions on a global scale to test the hypothesis that the Ca- alkalinity
discrepancy can be explained by hydrothermal input of ocean ridges.
