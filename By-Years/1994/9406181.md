"Remagnetization and Environmental Rock Magnetism: Clues to Records of Past
Geodynamics and Global Change" for a group of about 50 participants, including
approximately 16 graduate students and postdocs. The workshop will feature a
number of invited speakers and will address questions of how magnetic signatures
can provide information on past climate change. ****
