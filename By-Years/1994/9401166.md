9401166 Langsetmo This career advancement award supports mathematical research
in the field of topology. The work continues studied in homotopy theory
involving the relationship between periodic homotopy and higher Morava
K-theories. In particular, work will be done in extending the construction of
Dyer-Lashof operations and calculating the Morava K-theory of infinite loop
spaces. The calculation of the Morava K-theory of various finite loop spaces and
determining the when the cobar (base to fiber) spectral sequence converges will
also be carried out. Further study of the relationship between stable and
unstable localization in the case of non-connective homology theories and the
relationship between unstable periodic homotopy and periodic homology theories
via unstable localization and mapping telescopes are planned. Finally,
applications to related fields such as representation theory will be considered.
Topology is the study of spaces in which shape and distance become less
important while qualities of connectedness and deformability. Homotopy, in
particular, focuses on the development of a mathematical structure which
measures the extent to which curves may or may not be deformed into one another
while constrained to stay on a particular surface or within a given space. ***
