This award provides support for eight minority middle and high school teachers
to work with eight principal investigators at Georgia Tech in the fields of
Engineering, Computer Science, Astronomy, Physics, and Atmospheric Sciences. The
teachers will spend eight weeks during the summer of 1991 working on NSF-funded
research projects. This activity is funded in response to the Research
Opportunity Awards description in the most recent NSF Guide to Programs.
