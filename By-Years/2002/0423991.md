Plants integrate information from physiological and environmental signals during
growth and development. The regulatory networks that have evolved to generate
the appropriate cellular responses in answer to these signals often include a
transient increase in intracellular calcium which transduces the sensed signal
to the molecules that interpret the stimuli. This change in intracellular
calcium takes place through the combined activities of proteins that allow
calcium to enter the cytoplasm after perception of a signal and those that
ultimately remove calcium from the cytoplasm to restore cellular homeostasis.
The proposed studies are focused on identifying one of the proteins responsible
for increasing cytoplasmic calcium levels in response to physiological and
environmental cues. Identification of this protein at the molecular level will
be critical for understanding the specificity of calcium signaling in plants and
ultimately for designing strategies to modify plant growth and development.
