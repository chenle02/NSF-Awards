Novel computational methods for quantum statistical models, including models of
solid helium 3 and other frustrated spin systems, models related to Boson
localization relevant to superfluid helium 4 in porous media, and models for
strongly correlated electronic materials including the High Temperature
Superconductors. In the Boson localization problem the study of thermodynamics
and dynamics will include utilizing known algortihms but with implementation and
optimization on massively parallel computer architectures. Finally, for the
strongly correlated electron problems work on the "marriage" of Monte Carlo and
many body theory methods to avoid the problems of the restricted parameter and
temparature regime to which fermion Monte Carlo applies. Overall, studies will
utilize methodologies ranging from improved path integral Monte Carlo algorithms
to new variational methods and methods based on generalizations of the decoupled
cell Monte Carlo method. The hardware will include both pipelined and parallel
supercomputer architectures.
