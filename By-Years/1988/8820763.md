Funds are requested to upgrade a Model 470A gas-phase peptide sequencer to
allow on line analysis of PTH derivatives. This upgrade is requested so that
sensitivity of the instrument will be increased and to automate parts of the
analysis that are now done manually. At least five investigators will make
extensive use of the upgraded instrumentation. The projects that will make use
of this instrument include projects that are designed to establish structure-
function relationships in proteins. In some experiments, the sequence analysis
will be used to confirm the results of mutagenesis experiments, i.e. to
demonstrate that a given recombinant DNA gives rise to the expected protein
sequence. In other experiments fragments of proteins will be generated for
sequence analysis to establish the nature of fragmentation occurring after
limited proteolysis. Another type of experiment will involve sequence analysis
of peptides that have been modified to allow identification of phosphoserine
residues, which cannot be identified by sequence analysis of the unmodified
peptides. Proteins that will be studied include glycogen synthase from rat
skeletal muscle and from yeast, protein kinases, dihydrofolate reductase from
several sources including forms that are generated by site-directed mutagenesis,
folate binding proteins, myofibrillar proteins, various mutants of transforming
growth factorbeta obtained from cultured cells, and fragments of soybean
lipoxygenase. For many of these experiments, high sensitivity is critical since
only limited amounts of peptide or protein will be available. The requested
upgrade of the peptide sequencer will provide this increased sensitivity needed
for these experiments.
