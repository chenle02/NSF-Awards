The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
includes the need for 1) student engagement in social-emotional learning, 2)
coordinated and consistent ways for counselors, teachers, and students to
support the mental health of students, and 3) student connection during times of
isolation. The transition from elementary to middle school demands new social
skills in a larger and more intricate environment with an increased probability
of peer conflicts. Paradoxically, this point also marks a need for more stable
and intimate relationships with peers. In other words, the point of highest need
with respect to relationships coincides with opportunities for the most turmoil.
All of these challenges now exist in parallel with COVID-19, which has caused
school closings, food scarcity, parental unemployment, social isolation, and
destabilized support systems. The project will develop a scalable tool for
supporting teachers, counselors and after school/out of school facilitators
engaging students in social-emotional learning. Within the web-based system,
students will be able to actively and consistently track and reflect upon their
thoughts, feelings, and emotions; teachers/counselors will have a dashboard with
a view of studentsâ€™ challenges and customized suggestions for students to engage
with social-emotional learning activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project will develop an intelligent online self-tracking system to support
social-emotional growth for middle school students. The key technical challenges
we must resolve include: defining and refining a user experience that
teachers/counselors will find educationally compelling and with which learners
will engage; designing a curating process for remote learning content that will
ensure safety and security of all users; designing algorithms to support
tracking of student social-emotional well-being; and creating a recommendation
system that determines the best interventions to suggest to students based on
previous interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
