Rohrer A piecewise linear circuit timing simulator that is robust and efficient
in the approximate transient analysis of lumped circuits is being developed. To
better simulate the highly nonlinear bipolar and biMOS circuits, a simulation
strategy to work with piecewise linear rather than piecewise constant table
approximations of nonlinear device characteristics is being explored. Inductance
is being included on an equal basis with capacitance. The steady state solution
computation is being made more efficient by solving for its conditions
explicitly, prior to seeking the transient response that may attain it. Thus,
circuit simulation is to be invoked only to obtain successive steady state
conditions, but not for intermediate transient time points. To maintain
transient simulation computational efficiency, explicit integration strategies
that allow the exploitation of both temporal and spatial latency are being used.
To insure the stability of explicit integration approximations, the computed
steady state conditions are being employed to limit step size. This is intended
to overcome the stiff systems problem. The above strategies are being embodied
in the SPECS (Simulation Program for Electronic Circuits and Systems) software.
