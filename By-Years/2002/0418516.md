Under the supervision of Dr. Anthony Woodbury, Ms. Malavika Shetty will work
towards documenting the Tulu language spoken in South India for her doctoral
dissertation. Tulu is a Dravidian language largely spoken in the South Kannara
region in the state of Karnataka in India. There are an estimated 1.5 million
speakers of Tulu located in and around the South Kannara region. The main
research methodologies that will be used for this project are (i) the analysis
of texts based on audio and video recordings of historical, mythological, and
religious narratives and folk songs that have been collected and archived at the
Regional Resources Center for Folk Performing Arts in Karnataka (RRC) located in
South Kannara; (ii) the analysis of audio and video recordings of naturally-
occurring speech events; (iii) consultation with other native speakers. The
product of the project will be a text-based grammar of the common dialect of
Tulu.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The dissertation will provide a description of the
more widespread and relatively- unstudied common dialect of the language by
using a textual and discourse-centered approach for data collection. The grammar
produced by this project will provide valuable linguistic data to assess Tulu's
place in the South Dravidian language family and will be useful for the
reconstruction of Proto-Dravidian. The grammar will be accessible to native
speakers, linguists, anthropologists, sociologists, educators, and curriculum
planners and will provide a foundation on which to base future pedagogical
materials that will aid in the preservation of the Tulu language. Since language
is a central aspect of culture, documenting minority languages like Tulu and
providing a basis for creating pedagogical materials are crucial for language
maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
