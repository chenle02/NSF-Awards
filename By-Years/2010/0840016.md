This planning activity will produce a prototype film on Spanish horses and
conduct 10 focus group discussions to determine: audience interest, background
knowledge, what viewers would like to see in this documentary, language
barriers, cultural barriers, and how the film could be structured to help the
public and teachers interact with children. The focus groups will target the
follow groups: (1) middle school teachers, (2) elementary school teachers, (3)
families with young children, (4) Hispanic families, (5) American Indian
families, (6) youth ages 13-19, (7) horse lovers and those involved in horse
activities, (8) senior citizens and individuals with disabilities, (9)
documentary, museum exhibit and website production professionals, and (10) media
and museum marketing professionals.

The effort is intended to guide development of a PBS documentary, an interactive
website, a companion book, and a museum exhibit on the origins, evolution,
migration and impact of Spanish horses. STEM content in mathematics, genetics,
paleontology, chemistry, evolution, and animal behavior, integrated with
history, will be incorporated into the scripts for this diverse array of media
platforms. The project also presents an opportunity to present in a very
interesting and real sense the scientific process used for discovery.

In addition to producing the prototype film and conducting focus group
discussions, this planning grant will help to: clarify the responsibilities of
all of the participants, especially the international participants; clarify the
contributions from each discipline and scientist; plan in detail ways to achieve
the greatest understanding with the anticipated diverse audiences; select the
best geographic region, graphics, media, and animation; and establish realistic
budgets and elements for production and post-production.
