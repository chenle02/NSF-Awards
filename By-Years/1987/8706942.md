This study will examine the relationship between ion absorption rate, relative
growth rate, and the soil nutrient dependence of a suite of forest tree species
that vary widely in both relative growth rate and canopy gap colonization
ability. It is hypothesized that: 1) Gap colonizing species with high relative
growth rates will have higher maximum ion absorption capacities than slowly
growing species; 2) Shade tolerant species with low relative growth rates will
have higher root absorption capacities at low nutrient concentrations than fast
growing, gap colonizing species; 3) These differences will be greatest for soil
mobile ions such as NO3 and K and less for soil immobile ions such as PO4 and
NH4; 4) Nutrient uptake rates will be greater for seedlings acclimated to low
nutrient conditions than to high nutrient conditions, and that this plasticity
will be greater for species with high relative growth rates; 5) In the field,
gap colonizing seedlings will be more responsive than slowly growing, shade
tolerant species not only to increased light availability in gap sites but also
to increased nutrient availability in fertilized sites. Six tree species of the
eastern deciduous forest will be grown from seed. Three of these species
represent gap colonizing species with high relative growth rates (Prunus
serotina, Quercus coccinea, and Betula populifolia), and three represent shade
tolerant species with low relative growth rates (Fraxinus americana, Carya
ovata, and Quercus borealis). Three separate experiments will be performed to
test the hypotheses.
