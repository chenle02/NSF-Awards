9605072 Eberly Description: This award will initiate a collaborative program
between the University of Rochester, New York and the Physical Research
Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, India under the direction of U.S. PI Joseph Eberly
and Indian PI G.S. Agrawal. The subject of the research is Quantum and Nonlinear
Optics of Strongly Interacting Systems and Effects of Atomic Coherences.
Professor Agrawal, the newly appointed Director of the PRL, is leading a buildup
of activities in quantum and nonlinear optics which provides the opportunity for
Indian scientists to initiate research collaborations with U.S. scientists
having similar interests. The topics of research are: Atomic Coherence-
Controlled Optical Physics; Quantum Theory of Phase Conjugation and Phase
Conjugate Lasers; Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics; Methods for Reconstruction of
States of the Field, Radiance Functions--Generalized Tomography. Scope: The PIs
are highly accomplished physicists who have made many important contributions to
the field. Under their direction, this initiative linking their institutions
should lead to new and interesting discoveries in all the proposed research
topics. Students and post-docs at both institutions will be involved in the
opportunities afforded by this new initiative. ***
