This award to City College of the City University of New York is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement Program, a program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate
instructional instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds
needed to acquire the computer hardware and software for near real-time data
acquisition and processing of meteorological data. The institution is committed
to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The instrumentation will be
used to enhance the undergraduate meteorology curriculum and to provide the
opportunity for students to acquire and process meteorological data first-hand.
