9502957 Levine The proposed project is to add additional hardware infrastructure
to provide low latency and high bandwidth connectivity between the vBNS and
supercomputers at each supercomputing center. It will also connect network-
attached disk arrays to provide very short term storage buffering for running
the distributed applications. These added components will integrate the four
independent supercomputing centers into a single distributed teraflop computing
facility. This integration will provide a testbed for a number of development
and development projects in applied computer science and computational sciences.
