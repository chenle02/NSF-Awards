Abstract

A number of pathogenic bacteria responsible for diseases like listeriosis,
meningitis and gas-troenteritis hijack the protein machinery of the infected
cells to form a filamentous actin comet tail that propels them within these
cells. A physical understanding of the forces that lead to this motion can
provide a means to control spreading of infections and to design biomimetic
systems with applications in drug delivery. The objective of this proposal is to
develop quantitative models to predict how the filament-level properties
determine the macroscale motion of bacteria and biomimetic cargo. The proposed
work has two main themes. The first theme is to measure and analyze the motility
of various actin-propelled biomimetic systems and to study how structural and
mechanical properties of actin networks and the shape and size of biomimetic
systems influence their trajectories. The second theme focuses on the
development of a mechanics-based model for motility where the actin comet tail
is assembled by stochastic and load dependent growth of actin filaments.

If successful, the results of the proposed work will allow us to tailor the
motion of biomimetic systems by varying the molecular properties of the actin
networks such as the statistical distributions of the filament lengths and
orientations, degree of cross-linking and kinetics of polymerization. Since
actin-based networks are ubiquitously used to generate mechanical forces in
cells, elucidation of the relationship between molecular structure and
microscopic motion will also have important implications for understanding cell
motility, wound healing, filopodial extensions and morphogenesis. The results
from this project will be included in the courses on computational methods and
experimental techniques the PIs have developed. The PIs will participate in the
Research Experience for Teachers (RET) outreach program and provide middle and
high school teachers with software modules and experimental data that they can
use in their classes.
