This award will provide partial support for a summer school focused on the
theory and phenomenology of relativistic scattering and its practical
implementations in data analysis of modern experiments in hadron physics. The
organizers propose to bring together experts in hadrons spectroscopy and
interested students, post-docs, staff and faculty for a series of lectures and
laboratory sessions. The lectures given at the school will be recorded and used
to develop online resources that can be used for future training
purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Summer School is intended to address a
critical need in the community with respect to the training of a new generation
of physicists in advanced scattering theory in response to the specific needs of
data analysis at experimental programs at facilities such as the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven and the Jefferson National Laboratory. The data
sets generated of these facilities are of unprecedented quality and will demand
a qualitatively new level of sophistication in analysis never before achieved.
As such, the summer school will provide an unique opportunity for scientists in
the field of hadronic physics to enhance their training by interacting with
recognized experts in this field.
