The goal of this research is to understand the performance characteristics of
fundamental algorithms that are likely to be broadly applicable. The primary
focus is on analytic techniques that can result in precise performance
predictions, on essential characteristics of specific implementations and their
impact on practical situations, and on tools that can help uncover important
properties of algorithms. Not all algorithms can be analyzed to the point that
we can accurately predict their performance (indeed, most cannot). It is
precisely for this reason that much algorithm design is done at the "complexity"
level, where characteristics of machines, implementations, and input models can
be ignored in the search for an algorithm with good or "optimal" worst-case
performance characteristics. Research from this approach has mushroomed in
recent years: scores of fundamental new algorithms for a wide variety of new and
old applications have been devised. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that
such algorithms are not useful in practice, because they have intricate worst-
case avoidance mechanisms that add to overhead. This research will continue the
study of methods that prove empirically to be useful in practice, to focus
design efforts on improving the performance of such methods or devising
demonstrably better methods, and to focus analysis efforts on techniques that
can accurately predict performance.
