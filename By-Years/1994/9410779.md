9410779 Friesen Many animal movements result from precise coordination between
body parts. The two wings of a flying bird, the four limbs of a trotting mammal,
and the undulations of a swimming fish are all common examples of the elegance
of organized rhythmical movements. Coordination of limb movements and body
musculature results from internal coordination between sets of neuronal
oscillators that control individual appendages or segments. Neuronal oscillators
are sets of nerve cells that interact with each other to generate rhythmic
changes in the electrical signals of these nerve cells. Neurobiologists have
learned a lot about how these individual neuronal oscillators work, but know
little about how the oscillators work together to produce rhythmic movements.
This proposal is to study how the interconnections between neuronal oscillators
in the leech produce intersegmental coordination during swimming. Mathematical
and computer models of intersegmental coordination of this well-characterized
swim neural network will be developed. Because of the fundamental similarity of
rhythmic movements in all animals, insights gained from this study on a complex,
yet tractable, nervous system of a lower animal should be applicable to the more
complex and less tractable nervous systems that produce rhythmic movements in
higher animals.
