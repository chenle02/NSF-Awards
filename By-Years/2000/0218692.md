This project systematically investigates the value of pedagogical agent features
(*image: character, realism, gender, ethnicity; *animation: task-related,
expressive; and *pre-defined agent roles: expert, motivational advisor, co-
collaborator) in supporting learning-related outcomes. Using Multiple
Intelligent Mentors Instructing Collaboratively (MIMIC) as the research
environment, the standard experimental research design includes multiple factors
and will be analyzed primarily via MANOVA. Additional micro-genetic data from
logged agent-learner interactions and supplemental case studies triangulate the
findings. All participants are individually randomly assigned to treatment
conditions with large sample sizes (125-200 students), including educational
technology undergraduate students from both a state university and a
historically black university. The instructional content focuses upon the ill-
structured domain of instructional planning with diverse learning outcomes,
including metacognition, cognitive strategies, attitude/motivation, as well as
traditional performance. Through extensive dissemination of results to the
relevant multi-disciplinary communities, this project proposes to: a) illuminate
principles of learning with pedagogical agents, b) facilitate computer
scientists in prioritizing areas of future development for pedagogical agents;
c) inform teachers of the most desirable characteristics of agent-based
applications for their&lt;br/&gt;students; d) refine key features for
pedagogical agents within distance learning course nvironments; and, e) advise
instructional systems designers in developing training systems for industry and
government.
