A "matrix group" is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all
products and inverses of its members. Typical examples include SU(2), the group
of 2x2 unitary complex matrices, and O(3,R), the group of orthogonal 3x3
matrices with real entries. Broadly speaking, the subject of representation
theory deals with how such groups can act on a complex vector space via linear
transformations. One can then ask what happens if we replace the complex numbers
by a finite field (or the algebraic closure of a finite field). Modular
representation theory is concerned with matrix groups with entries in such a
field, acting on vector spaces over the same field. This research will use
geometric methods to make advances in modular representation theory. Many of the
anticipated results are motivated by known facts in complex representation
theory, but new tools and techniques must be developed in the modular case. In
connection with this research, the P.I. will also undertake research-training
activities aimed at Ph.D. students and other early-career researchers. The past
few years have seen the emergence of powerful new tools for applying geometric
methods to the representation theory of algebraic groups in positive
characteristic, including "parity sheaves" and the "mixed modular derived
category." This research will build on these developments with projects on three
different topics: (i) the topology of global Schubert varieties; (ii) Kazhdan-
Lusztig cells, tensor ideals, and tilting modules; and (iii) "silting" complexes
of coherent sheaves. Topic (i) has connections to number theory and to a
potential "modular ramified Satake equivalence". Topic (ii) has the most direct
links to classical questions in representation theory, while topic (iii) is
expected to lead to new avenues of research in K-theory and categorification,
for instance in the context of symmetric spaces.
