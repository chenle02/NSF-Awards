ABSTRACT 9407897 Datta Brain growth require careful regulation. Too much
uncontrolled growth is characteristic of cancer or neuroblastoma. Too little
brain growth results in birth defects such as spina bifida or anencephaly. To
understand how brain growth is controlled, Dr. Datta is studying specialized
cells that can make more brain cells. The body regulates brain cell production
by turning activity on and off by these cells. It is important to know which
genes are involved in controlling when and where stem cells make brain cells to
understand how the body regulates this process. gene has been identified that
turns on the ability of the stem cells to make brain cells. Now she wants to
know what kind of protein this gene makes and how it turns on the stem cells.
