This project significantly improves the teaching of modern chemistry by
incorporating advanced Fourier-transforrm nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR)
instrumentation, theory, and techniques throughout the department curriculum.
The speed of FT-NMR can be used as a tool by general chemistry students to
analyze kinetic data. Organic students are exposed to the instrument's ability
to obtain carbon-13 spectra as an aid in the identification of organic
structures. Analytical students learn multidimensional FT theory and techniques
and gain practical knowledge of the operation of FT-NMR spectrometers. Physical
chemistry students use FT-NMR technology to investigate first hand the phenomena
involved in spin-lattice relaxation and other electric and magnetic properties
of atoms and molecules. Inorganic students can better analyze mrganometallic
synthesis products using carbon-13 and COSY techniques. In addition, the
students can remotely process and manipulate their FT-NMR data, freeing up the
instrument for use by other classes. The addition of this equipment and its
associated teaching techniques to the department better prepares students by
creating an environment where chemical principles, theory, and analysis are
learned through first-hand experience. *
