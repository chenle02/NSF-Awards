This dissertation examines how a nation's defense posture influences its efforts
and successes at achieving social policy objects. The maintenance of large
standing armed forces amounts to a significant state intervention in labor
market outcomes, influences the need for and commitments to public social
programs, and confers the politically-salient status of "citizen" on large
segments of the population. Despite such connections between military personnel
policies and public policy, however, the military component of the welfare state
has received little scholarly attention. The project addresses this gap by
examining how the size of the military and the level of defense spending affect
public spending for social security and family benefits. The data come from two
sources: published figures from19 advanced industrial nations over the period of
1960-1994, and from national and state-level data for the United States over the
period of 1945-1995.
