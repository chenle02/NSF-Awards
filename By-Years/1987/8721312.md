This research is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. It will develop the methodology for a potentially very general route
into polycyclic structures. These are found in many of the complex molecules
used in modern medicine and agriculture. This research will develop the
manganese (III) based oxidative free radical cyclization into a reliable and
versatile method for the synthesis of highly functionalized cyclic and
polycyclic compounds. The research program will focus on the following
questions: (1) the scope of initiating groups; (2) the type of double bond
substitution patterns that can be tolerated and whether endocyclic or exocyclic
radicals are formed; (3) the ring sizes that can be formed; (4) the functional
groups that can be tolerated on the double bond; (5) the functional groups that
can be tolerated elsewhere in the molecule; (6) the scope of the aromatization
reaction; (7) the effect of additives on the nature of the reaction; (8) the
scope and limitations of the oxidative termination with Mn(OAc)3.2H2O and/or
Cu(OAc)2.H2O, LiCl and LiX; and (9) the scope and limitations for the formation
of a second or third ring.
