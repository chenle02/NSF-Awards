*** 9732276 Stwalley The summer undergraduate research program (an NSF REU Site)
will continue in the Department of Physics at the University of Connecticut.
This summer program will expose a diverse group of talented undergraduates to an
exciting research environment and inform them in weekly seminars about the
frontiers of physics and about careers in physics. Departmental social
gatherings, a final poster session for presentation of research results, and
assignment of a graduate student mentor as well as a faculty advisor are
included to enhance the participants' sense of community with the other members
of the department. We plan to focus on a balanced program attracting on a
nationwide basis talented women and both underrepresented and other minority
undergraduates, especially from primarily undergraduate institutions with less
access to a comprehensive research environment. ***
