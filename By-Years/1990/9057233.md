This research involves exploiting the biodegradability, chirality, and spatial
order of biopolymers for the construction of important new materials. The
bacterial polyesters, cellulose, and lysozyme have been selected for this work.
Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate), PHBV, derived from bacterial
fermentation is being used to obtain materials which have identical compositions
but differ in the crystalline lattice structure, crystalline perfection,
spherulite size, and percent crystallinity. Synthetic analogues of bacterial
polyesters are being synthesized by carrying out a ring-opening polymerization
of enantiomerically pure n-alkyl lactones. PHBV is being blended with other
polymers to develop different morphologies. The microbial degradability of these
samples will then be studied using variable biological environments. In this
way, fundamental relationships between polymer structure, morphology, and
degradability will be established. Cellulose derivatives will be used to form
liquid crystalline polymeric materials where the cholesteric pitch will be
highly sensitive to external signals. By synthesizing cellulose derivatives
which have photo- and electroresponsive groups attached at controlled sites
along the chain, relationships between polymer design, the aplied external
signal, and the optical rotatory properties of the material will be established.
This concept will be extended to other chiral biopolymer based systems to
explore the effects of chain dynamics on response time. The insertion of photo-
and electroresponsive groups at selective sites of the protein lysozyme will be
used to initiate research into the modulation of enzyme conformation, and
therefore activity. The goal of this work is to explore methods which allow
enzymes to essentially be turned on and off in response to external signals
which alter the spatial arrangements at protein catalytic sites. These proteins
may provide novel routes for the transmission of light and electrical signals.
