The investigators undertake an interdisciplinary project to test nonlinear
population theory, incorporating the construction and analysis of mathematical
models, the design and implementation of biological experiments, and the
development and application of statistical techniques for the analysis of data.
They use flour beetles of the genus Tribolium as the experimental organism. In
the first part of the project they identify appropriate models and estimate the
parameters that control the detailed behavior of the models. In the second part
they document transitions in the qualitative behavior of the demographic
dynamics. They use combinations of reproductive rates and adult mortality rates
that span boundaries in parameter space from stable equilibria, to invariant
cycles, to chaos. In the third part they test hypotheses concerning the
existence of these unusual demographic phenomena and develop methods for
identifying the phenomena in experimental data. Understanding the observed
fluctuations in animal numbers is a central question in population biology;
indeed, it has far-reaching impacts ranging from food production to the
conservation of species diversity. In the past ten years or so, the recognition
that simple equations can generate complex dynamics has led to an outpouring of
fascinating theoretical possibilities for the explanation of population time
series data. This project aims to explore the possibility that populations can
exhibit chaotic behavior similar to that seen in other physical phenomena. As
indicated above, such behavior would have significant consequences.
