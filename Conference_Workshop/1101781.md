CombinaTexas 2011

CombinaTexas: a Combinatorics Conference in the South-Central United States, is
an annual regional conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing. It
is dedicated to the enhancement of both the educational and the research
atmosphere of the community of combinatorialists and graph theorists in Texas
and surrounding states.

CombinaTexas 2011 will be held at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville,
Texas on April 16-17, 2011. The special focus of CombinaTexas 2011 will be
algebraic combinatorics. The following researchers have agreed to participate as
invited speakers: Federico Ardila (San Francisco State University), Chris Godsil
(University of Waterloo), Gregg Musiker (University of Minnesota), Michael
Orrison (Harvey Mudd College), Rosa Orellana (Dartmouth College), Bernhard
