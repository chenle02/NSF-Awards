This project involves a comparative study of social and economic factors
affecting food production in four Micronesian societies. Cultural
anthropologists will study interactions among food production, consumption, and
exchange within households in two female farming societies (Yap and Palau) and
two male farming societies (Kosrae and Marshall Islands). Communities within
each of the four societies vary with respect to level of food production,
economic and political articulation with the world system, the importance of
cash, and the degree of urbanization. Data will include in-depth interviews as
well as community surveys of social and economic behavior. Case history
materials on household activities will be collected from a sample of households.
Formal analyses of the relations between attitudes, goals, and economic behavior
will be done. This research is important because adequate food production in
local communities is a cause of concern in much of the world, and a comparative
study like this one will advance our understanding of the social and cultural
causes of variations in food production.
