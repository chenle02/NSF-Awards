The Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) is an international program to
advance the understanding of the transfer of energy and mass through the solar-
terrestrial environment. STEP involves ground-based, aircraft, balloon, rocket
and satellite experiments; theory and simulation studies; and dedicated data and
information systems. The program will take advantage of results obtained by
spacecraft missions and related programs such as NSF's GEM, CEDAR, and MAX91,
research and monitoring activities of NOAA/SEL, and various research activites
supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and other key sponsors of solar-
terrestrial research. The framework of STEP consists of Priority Areas, each one
with a goal of understanding the processes controlling energy and mass transfer
between specific regions of the solar-terrestrial system. The scientific
research in STEP is organized into a limited number of well- defined cooperative
projects proposed by the scientific communities of the participating countries.
To define, plan and implement the research coordination, Working Groups for each
Priority Area have been established. STEP is the key international coordination
effort, fully inclusive of various research modes, active during the first half
of the 1990's. This grant provides partial support of the STEP Symposium on
initial results from STEP facilities and theory campaigns to be held August
24-27, 1992, at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Additional
support for this symposium is anticipated from NASA, NSF, NOAA, and ONR.
