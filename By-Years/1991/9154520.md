The American Association of State Colleges and Universities has requested a
Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) for a 10- month research project to
examine three issues which appear relevant to affecting mid-career moves into
science and mathematics education. (1) The attitudes of program participants and
school personnel about each other and how have those attitudes changed through
participation in the nontradition or mid-career program. (2) The organizational
changes sustained in the process of establishing a nontraditional or mid-career
program. (3) How the supply pressures and the development of responsive program
affected the larger political and social context in which policies and processes
for teacher training are established. Outcomes of this study will include: (a) a
set of case studies describing the programs both qualitatively; (b) guidelines
to support the relationship between the private sector and education; (c) an
annotated guide to resources and programs. The private sector partner in this
project will be Digital Equipment Corporation which will not only provide
hardware and software but also professional staff expertise in research design,
analysis, and reporting.
