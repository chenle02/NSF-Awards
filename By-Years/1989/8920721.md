Recent advances in liquid crystal technology make it possible to construct
tunable birefringent filters operating over the range 3500-20,000 Angstroms,
with passbands as narrow as 100 Angstroms. The center wavelength of the filter
can be selected electronically, in a few milliseconds, with no moving parts.
These filters should be relatively inexpensive to produce ($2-3K). When liquid
crystal elements are placed in series with fixed retarders made of birefringent
quartz or calcite, one can construct filters with narrower passbands, ranging
from 30 Angstroms to as narrow as 0.25 Angstroms. The fixed retarder provides
the high resolution while the liquid crystal performs the tuning action. The
filter that results is highly selective, and agile. Optical quality in these
instruments is determined by the fixed retarders, and only mild restrictions are
placed on the liquid crystal elements. In Phase I the performance of individual
liquid crystal elements was measured. Under this Phase II award, complete
filters of two types will be constructed and tested in ongoing solar and night-
time programs.
