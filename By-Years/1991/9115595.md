Thoretical research will be conducted in the general areas of nonlinear science
and condensed matter physics. Specific topics include pattern formation in
hydrodynamic systems, the scaling properties of dynamical systems, and the
theory of well-developed turbulence. Specific applications include such topics
as the mathematical structure of the equations describing the swirling behavior
of fluids, the motion of two-fluid boundaries, and the structure of avalanches.
%%% Theoretical research will be carried out on nonlinear science and its
application to problems of interest to condensed matter physics. Research on
nonlinear science is developing rapidly and its implications on condensed matter
systems are only just being probed.
