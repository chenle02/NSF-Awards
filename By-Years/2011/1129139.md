This proposal establishes the Four College Biomathematics Consortium: a
collaboration among four undergraduate institutions (Smith College, Mount
Holyoke College, Amherst College, and Hampshire College) with a long tradition
of excellence and a commitment to research-centered education. Two of these
institutions are women?s colleges. All four have a demonstrated commitment to
expanding opportunities for women, underrepresented groups and first-generation
students in scientific fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Consortium will help
train the next generation of biomathematicians. A two-year research-intensive
program will be developed, building on a strong existing infrastructure for
cross-campus collaborations, in which student teams move through a series of
curricular offerings and mentored research opportunities. The emphasis
throughout is on: a) a succession of developmentally appropriate courses and
research opportunities; b) a team-centered approach that unites student teams
and mentoring teams in several multi-year research collaborations; and c) the
creation of a multi-layered cohort of biomathematics students at various stages
of training. Led by mentoring teams composed of both life scientists and
mathematicians, the students will explore problems at all scales of biological
organization, ranging from the intricacies of protein folding to the
complexities of water and material flows in forest ecosystems. These projects
share a unifying theme,the consideration of potential and realized shape spaces,
and emphasize geometric approaches to the exploration of biological problems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program advances the national STEM agenda by training
50 undergraduates in biomathematics and by generating online pedagogical
materials (curricula, exercises and training modules) that can be exploited by
the broader community. The program will also serve as a potential exportable
model for multi-institutional collaboration in the training of undergraduates in
biomathematics and other emerging scientific fields.
