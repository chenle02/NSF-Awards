During development, gonadal steroids (androgens and estrogens) confer permanent
sex-specific differences (sexual dimorphism) onto the organization and function
of the brain. This sexual dimorphism in the brain, in turn, leads to production
of behavior that is different in male and female animals. The estrogens and
androgens act during a very specific and limited period in early development to
induce these permanent sex-specific differences in brain structure and in
behavior. The best studied brain structure which is both sexually dimorphic and
is known to be critical in mediating sex-specific behavior is the hypothalamus.
We know that much of the information transfer in neurons in the hypothalamus
depends upon the presence of a class of proteins called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric
acid) receptors. The goal of this work is to determine if androgens and
estrogens act during this critical period in early development to alter the
types of GABA receptors that are expressed in the hypothalamus and to determine
if steroid-dependent changes in GABA receptor expression lead to changes in sex-
specific behaviors in adult animals. The results from this study may help us to
understand how development in the brain is regulated to produce sex-specific
behaviors.
