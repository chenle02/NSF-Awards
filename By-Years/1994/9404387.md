This award is made under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program to contribute to the funding of a workshop on a research agenda for risk
communication that is responsive to the needs of practitioners and agencies
which conduct risk communication activities. A national symposium for invited
researchers and practitioners will be held to consider a research agenda to
pursue communicating with different social and cultural groups, approaches to
environmental decision making, and evaluation of risk communication. The
symposium is exploratory and innovative because it brings together the
researchers and the practitioners in an area of study that is in high demand
institutionally although it is just beginning to develop scientific methodology
and techniques. The U.S Environmental Protection Agency is also contributing to
this workshop.
