This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support for research on carboranes and metallocarboranes by Dr. M.
Frederick Hawthorne of the Chemistry Department, University of California at Los
Angeles. Diverse structural atomic arrangements such as "carboracycles" and
"carborods" will be linked into large "supramolecular" structures. By
controlling the size and shape of these clusters, cages of many different sizes,
shapes, and electronic properties which can be used for capturing small ions and
molecules will be constructed. Some of the most challenging target molecules
will have "holes" of the appropriate size to contain three transition metal
ions. In addition, the reactivity and acidity of carboranes of lanthanide metals
will be investigated. The binding capabilities of electrophilic mercuracarborand
hosts will be studied in a variety of new compounds in order to obtain selective
anion carriers. Supramolecular structures with specific chirality and binding
power will be prepared. Large new molecules of regular geometry which contain
boron, carbon, and metal atoms will be synthesized. The structures are
sufficiently large that they can "capture" other atoms or small molecules.
Because these structures are attractive to negatively charged ions and because
the size, shape, and strength of the traps can be controlled, they have great
potential as "ion channels" which can transport ions in living systems. They
also could be effective as analytical probes or as acid catalysts. This basic
reseach is relevant to molecular recognition, homogeneous catalysis, chemic al
sensor fabrication and biomolecule modification. # # ! ! ! F # # ( Times New
