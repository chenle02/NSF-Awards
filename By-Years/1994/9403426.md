9403426 Lessard This project will investigate the bioenergetics, growth and prey
preferences of representative heterotrophic dinoflagellates and ciliates in
batch cultures to define the trophic roles of each group and to determine how
these two groups of potential competitors coexist in the marine plankton. A
systematic investigation will be done on the bioenergetics and food preferences
in a large number of representative heterotrophic dinoflagellates and ciliates
using a 14C-radiotracing method which will include direct measures of egestion
and excretion of organic matter. Information on gross growth efficiencies,
maximal growth rates, and the effects of temperature and food quality will be
obtained under strictly comparable conditions. Careful evaluation of the carbon:
volume relationship of thecate and athecate dinoflagellates will also be
undertaken, as this is an important but uncertain parameter, which greatly
affects estimates of gross growth efficiencies and biomass estimations.
