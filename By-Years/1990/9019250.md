A specific DNA structure, the Holliday junction, is an intermediate in all
recombination and may repair processes in the cell. Experimental evidence has
been accumulating which indicates that the structure of the Holliday junction is
sensitive to the DNA sequence at the branch points and that this has important
biological consequences. In this project Dr. Chazin proposes to examine the
physical structure and biological properties of synthetic immobile Holliday
junctions by using an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach involving
molecular biology, time resolved fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, and
molecular modeling/computer graphics. Time resolved fluorescence will be used to
gain information on the global structure of the junctions, using fluorescence
energy transfer experiments to determine the relative distances between the four
arms of the junctions. NMR spectroscopy will provide detailed information on the
local structure. A comparative analysis of the internal dynamics of these
junctions will be made by fluorescence depolarization and NMR measurements.
These data taken together will be used to solve the three-dimensional structures
in solution of a series of related Holliday junctions and thereby determine how
the sequence determines the geometry of the junction. These systematic studies
will provide critical insights into formation of Holliday junctions, their
propagation along the DNA duplexes, and the subsequent steps of junction
recognition and resolution.
