ABSTRACT There is little prospective scientific research on the development of
individual differences in positive orientations toward other people. This
orientation can be conceptualized as predispositions along one dimension. At one
end of the dimension, some individuals appear to have an enduring predisposition
toward altruism, kindness, social warmth, and cooperativeness. At the other end,
some individuals appear to be predisposed toward behaviors that have been
labeled hostile, aggressive, and cold-hearted. An interlocking program of
research will examine this individual difference dimension in children and
adolescents. Socialization patterns may be systematically related to its
development. This research will conduct basic foundational work upon which later
work can build. The first part of the research program will focus on reliability
and validity, using computer assessments to obtain self-ratings from children
and adolescents. This evidence will be compared with adult and peer ratings of
the same children for the convergence in assessments. In addition, an
observational study will focus on parental socialization of emotional self-
regulation. The research is designed to build basic links from personality
toward developmental and social psychological approaches to social interaction.
