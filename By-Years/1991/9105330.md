Viable cell density is one of the most important parameters in fermentation
processes. Many indirect methods of determining cell density have been
introduced in the past. However, these methods suffer for non-specificity. A
sensor is proposed for rapid and explicit measurement of viable cell number
density in culture media. In the proposed method, viable cells are distinguished
from other inert particles by using the characteristics of living cells. The
speed in measurement is achieved by fast counting. The sensor is usable in
single cultures without calibration. Off-line as well as on-line sensors are to
be constructed.
