Institution: U of NC Chapel Hill Title: Processing Massive Noisy Data with
Hidden Structure Abstract: This research involves a few inter-related
statistical problems ranging from processing images and finding informative
structure from massive data, to analyzing survival data, evaluating the success
of a business advertisement and understanding the home range of animals. In
contrast with traditional approaches, the methods do not assume any restrictive
form, and are flexible enough to detect fine structures. This project covers a
wide array of statistics methodological developments and foundational research.
The new developments enhance the availability of statistical tools, and can lead
to significant improvements on existing methods for extracting information from
noisy data. Specific objectives are develop new statistical methodologies and
investigate their foundational properties for flexible statistical modeling in
processing high-dimensional data, nonparametric confidence intervals, mode
detection and signal processing. Many scientific disciplines depend in some way
on extracting structural information from noisy data. Fields ranging from
processing noisy images and evaluating business marketing, to analyzing survival
data and forecasting economic climates, which are universes apart in their
backgrounds, nevertheless have the common problem of drawing conclusions via
processing noisy signals. Such problems may be abstracted as a statistical
function estimation problem and can be analyzed by various techniques in this
project. The objective of this research is to develop and evaluate flexible
statistical modeling techniques. These techniques can be applied in the Federal
Strategic Areas such as monitoring environmental and global changes via
processing massive collected data where informative structures can hardly be
detected by traditional approache s, and building statistical modeling for
economic and business activities in the civil infrastructure. The investigators
will take advantage of modern computing facilities, and use statistical
knowledge to avoid unnecessary data mining and hence reduce significantly data
processing time. Thus, the knowledge gained in this study will also be useful in
high performance computing of a federal strategic area.
