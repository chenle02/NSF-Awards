Yarus This award will support the renovation of a 22-year old, 100,000 square
foot laboratory building that houses the research and research training programs
of the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at the
University of Colorado at Boulder. This building supports the research and
training efforts of 27 faculty, 92 research associates and postdoctoral fellows,
73 graduate students and 50 undergraduate students. The renovation project in
progress will make appropriate this buildings infrastructure and support
facilities, consolidate shared central facilities and upgrade lab spaces. The
heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems will be modernized as well as
adding new fume hoods and an up-to-date mechanical system. The research to be
performed in the renovated spaces ranges from basic nucleic acid biochemistry to
complex developmental events in nematodes, flies, and mammalian cells. This
department is well known for its emphasis on model systems that aid in the
solution to major biological problems.
