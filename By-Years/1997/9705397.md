9705397 Goldman The Institute for Research on Learning is undertaking a
multifaceted effort to help parents become more involved in the mathematics
education of their children. This project establishes a Design Consortium;
develops new materials and collaborative activity structures; provides outreach,
training, and technical assistance to communities; and disseminates these
products to the educational community. The design consortium creates contexts
for raising parent participation in communities where it is most needed and uses
these contexts to plan and construct mathematics materials based on issues
parents face in everyday life. The outreach activities include planning support
and workshops for schools, community organizations, and parent groups.
Dissemination is done through presentations and talks and through research
articles.
