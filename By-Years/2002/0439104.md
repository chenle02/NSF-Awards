On March 4, 2004, the Library of Congress released more than 1,576 boxes of
documents containing the papers of the late Justice Harry A. Blackmun. Blackmun,
who served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1970-1994, was a critical jurist
during the Warren and Rehnquist Courts, and his papers offer a wealth of
information to researchers studying the Court. The proposed research will
utilize the recently released papers to investigate the changes on the
decisional dynamics associated with the ascension of William Rehnquist to the
position of Chief Justice in 1986. In particular, the research examines the
changes that have taken place on the decisional processes of the Rehnquist
Court. The PI proposes that the changes in the Rehnquist Court -- including its
moves toward multiply "in-part" case dispositions, and its corresponding move to
what Sunstein has called a jurisprudence of "judicial minimalism" -- are both
the results of an increased shared tendency toward (a) individualism in opinion
writing, and (b) a collective view of the judiciary as the authoritative
interpreter of statutory and constitutional doctrine. This SGER will support the
PI during that data collection enterprise during summer, 2004.
