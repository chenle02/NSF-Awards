Foraging behavior and its interactions with the environment are complex and
multidimensional. Simulation holds the promise of helping laboratory biologists
and field ecologists work with data and theoretical models and gain insights
into behavioral mechanisms. The increasing power of desktop computers has
brought computer simulation technology to anew level of accessibility. The use
of simulation in foraging behavior research is in its infancy; there is great
potential for its use in representation and interpretation of actual and
simulated experiments. It is clear that with appropriate behavior simulation
models, biologists and ecologists could make significant advances in
understanding foraging processes. The goal of Phase I is to evaluate simulation
techniques for a prototype foraging behavior simulation model. The approach will
be to develop a shell program that will allow users to specify foraging tactics,
habitat structure, etc., and to set up simulated factorial experiments. We will
evaluate simulation techniques and algorithms for their specific application to
behavioral processes. This project will require original research on the
question of how to simulate phenomena such as decisions and spatial behavior.
