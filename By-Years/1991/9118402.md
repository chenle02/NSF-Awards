This award provides one-half the funds necessary for the acquisition of a used
electron microprobe to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth,
Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. MIT is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for this
acquisition. The instrument was not used much by its previous owner, the
Polaroid Corporation, is in excellent condition, and is expected to provide the
analytical capabilities needed for a fraction of the cost of a comparable new
instrument. The microanalytical capabilities of the probe will be used primarily
by researchers at MIT and at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to analyze
geological samples.
