This award provides for partial support for a conference to explore the
feasibility of a national engineering information service. International
competition in the technological arena has progressed to the point where less
than optimal exploitation of our engineering know-how puts the Nation at a
severe disadvantage in the marketplace. This conference renews serious
consideration of actions needed to be taken to establish such a service.
