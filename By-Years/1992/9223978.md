The Grand Valley State University requests support from NSF for an upgrade of
their slow speed connection to a medium speed connection of its campus network
to NSFNET via MICHnet, Michigan's regional network. MICHnet will provide
operations and network information services and it will provide Grand Valley
State with a high speed connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million
bits per second) National Backbone network. The University needs greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
