This award will enable a group of researchers headed by Professor Keith Hodgson
of Stanford University to collaborate with researchers under the direction of
Dr. Jun-ichi Chikawa at the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics in
Tsukuba, Japan over a two-year period. Investigators will take advantage of
recent advances in the production of synchrotron radiation, coupled with
advances in x-ray detectors, to carry out new experiments on the structure of
materials. X-ray detector systems, developed by Japanese researchers for x-ray
diffraction and scattering applications, will be coupled with a very high
brilliance source of photons developed at Stanford laboratories to study thin
films, time-resolved changes in structure, and the structure of biological
molecules. This program of structural studies of materials will continue many
years of scientific and technical exchange between the U.S. and Japanese
laboratories in areas of monochromator and instrument design, wiggler and
undulator insertion device development, and machine operation and improvements.
