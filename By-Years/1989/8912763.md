Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy allows chemists to conduct
extremely precise, high resolution studies on materials containing unpaired
electrons (paramagnetic compounds). Such studies reveal information on molecular
structure that is unavailable by any other technique. The Department of
Chemistry at Texas A &amp; M University will use this award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program to help acquire an EPR spectrometer. Among the areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are included the
following: 1) Surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis 2) Radical species
in reactions of electron-rich transition metal hydrides, acyls and thiolates 3)
Novel approaches to the study of metal complexes in enzymes 4) Stuctural studies
of copper (II) bis-2'2'-dipyridylamines as models for active centers in copper
proteins 5) Aminyl radicals and aminium cation radicals 6) Oriented single
crystal studies of transition metal compounds.
