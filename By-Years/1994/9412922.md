9412922 Baker This planning grant award is oriented to the investigation of a
knowledge-based scientific visualization assisting system with the purpose of
providing intelligent assistance to a user upon the description of the type of
data, the analysis of the task, and the system environment for the visualization
project for which the advice is sought. The paradigm of task-directed
visualization involves the automatic construction of the visualization for the
task that has been described. This planning investigation involves understanding
the types of tasks for which scientists use visualization, as well as the
relation between the task and the effectiveness of different visual displays.
Empirical studies are carried out as part of this planning to determine the
relative effectiveness of different visualizations of different tasks from a
collection of tasks reflecting common analysis goals of the visualization-user
to be incorporated in the rules of the automated visualization assistant.
