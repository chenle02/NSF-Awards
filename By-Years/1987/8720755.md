Duplexes in thrust fault systems are defined as a series of imbricate
contraction faults which end at, or curve into, a roof and floor thrust. These
duplexes are common in deformed sedimary basins, and much of the work on these
features has been done on thrust systems in the lower grade, external parts of
orogens. This proposal targets a well-exposed example of a duplex in central
Australia developed in the deeper, more internal zone of a thrust belt where a
more heterogeneous and isotropic basement is ductilely deformed. In addition to
determining the geometry of detachment surfaces, finite strain will be
determined, and these data used to construct a balanced cross-section. Results
will provide important data to test various models for ductile deformation in
internal zones of orogens.
