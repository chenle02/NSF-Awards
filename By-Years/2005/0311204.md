CCR-0311204&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Security Policies&lt;br/&gt;Stephan A.
Zdancewic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research concentrates on the theoretical
foundations and implementation of dynamic security policies--security policies
that describe how confidential or high integrity data should be handled by
computer systems in an environment that is unknown when the system is built. The
key idea is to extend well understood static type systems that express
information-flow security policies with dynamic mechanisms that capture security
policy information available only at run time. Such policies are important to
the design of secure systems that can cope with change in the environment and
that can evolve over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives are: (1) To
design a type system and an accompanying soundness proof for a security-typed
language that includes first-class principals, authentication, first-class
confidentiality labels, and mechanisms to construct and inspect these policy
components at run time. Part of this work is to extend previous research on
downgrading. (2) To implement these ideas in the Jif compiler, a security-typed
language based on Java. (3) To validate the approach by developing a suite of
programs that stress-test the implementation. Most of these programs will be
small benchmarks that test corner cases, but the intent is to have students
develop larger applications.
