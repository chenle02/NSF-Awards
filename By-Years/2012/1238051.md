PI: Joseph Kieber (University of North Carolina - Chapel
Hill)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: G. Eric Schaller (Dartmouth College) and Ann
Loraine (University of North Carolina -
Charlotte)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate many
traits of agricultural importance, including the control of grain size and
yield. In this project, genomic approaches will be used to uncover how cytokinin
regulates growth and development in rice, using this plant species as a model to
understand the regulation of grain size and yield in all cereals. Computational
approaches will be used to interrogate and integrate the datasets generated by
these studies. It is expected that these studies will illuminate the role of
cytokinins in panicle development, and will provide specific information on how
cytokinins regulate grain development in an agriculturally important crop.
Because of conservation of gene sequence among cereals, information obtained
from the study of rice may be applied to other agriculturally important species
such as maize, wheat, barley, rye, and sorghum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by providing
training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral
researchers. A computation workshop will broaden the ability of the research
community to use genomics resources. In addition, through partnerships with
local groups including the Montshire Museum of Science (http://montshire.org/),
programs aimed at fostering science education in grades K-12 will be created and
maintained. Data will be made available through a public database
(RiceCytokinin.org) as well as through long-term repositories such as the NCBI
Short Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) and the Gene Expression
Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Germplasm generated in this project
will be available upon request and through the USDA Genetic Stocks - Oryza
(GSOR) Collection
(http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/site_main.htm?docid=18992&amp;page=1).
