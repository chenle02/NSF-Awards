This research will consider several problems associated with the asymptotic
expansions of functions defined by integrals. Realistic error bounds will be
constructed for uniform asymptotic expansions of associated Legendre functions
of large degree and fixed order directly from the integral representations of
these functions. The classical method of Chester, Friedman, and Ursell will be
generalized by mapping phase functions into rational functions and logarithms.
The derivation of computable error bounds will be emphasized. This work has
applications in the area of special functions. Such functions arise quite
naturally in a variety of physical contexts in both fluid dynamics and solid
mechanics.
