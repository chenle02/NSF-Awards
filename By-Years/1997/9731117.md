9731117 Krug The goal of this meeting is to bring together molecular biologists
and structural biologists investigating prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA-binding
proteins in a forum designed for efficient information exchange and in an
environment that can stimulate future research and collaboration. Approximately
1/3 of the participants will be graduate students and postdoctorals. Speakers
will include a mix of experts and young investigators in the areas of molecular
biology and structural biology of RNA-binding proteins. This unique meeting will
bring together an interdisciplinary group of experts and young investigators in
a format conducive to scientific discussions, thereby spawning new interactions
and collaborations between molecular biologists and structural biologists.
