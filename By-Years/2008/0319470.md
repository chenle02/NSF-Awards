This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I proposes to develop
antibacterial surfaces and textiles for commercial applications. A series of
novel potent dendrimer biocides has been identified, which can be used alone to
kill microorganisms, or bound to polymer substrates to produce non-leaching
biocidal polymers. The aim of this program is to chemically graft these potent
microbiological agents to a polymer backbone and optimize these polymer systems
using electrospinning techniques to fabricate inherently antimicrobial
microfiber webs. Electrospinning can be performed on a small scale, to produce
webs with a high surface area to volume ratio. This optimizes the exposure of
the grafted biocide at the surface, where it can exert its microbiological
effects. Physical and biological characterization of the resulting webs will be
performed.

The commercial applications of this project are to develop materials for use
where bacterial contamination and infection controls are required, including but
not limited to food and beverage handling, water treatment, medical devices,
textile manufacture and antimicrobial filters.
