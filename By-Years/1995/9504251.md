9504251 SANSONE This team of investigators will study the biogeochemical
processes associated with the decomposition of organic matter within
(approximately) the upper framework of a coral reef just offshore of Oahu,
Hawaii. Particulate and dissolved organic matter originating at or near the reef
surface is hydraulically transported into this upper part of the reef where
organic moieties are broken down in a suboxic or anoxic environment by
heterotrophic bacteria. These studies should lead to a better understanding of
nutrient cycling in coral reef ecosystems in many part of the world ocean. Also,
because the suboxic reef environment is vertically extensive (about 1 meter
deep), this system will afford the opportunity for detailed proxy study of
suboxic decomposition processes that are common in other benthic environments,
such as soft sediments, but which cannot be carried out in the latter because of
the small spatial scale (typically several millimeters).
