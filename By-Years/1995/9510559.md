Abstract Nomura CTS-9510559 The PI proposes to use this research planning grant
to enhance her knowledge and experience in the area of Large Eddy Simulation
(LES) and subgrid-scale modeling in order to better formulate an effective
program aimed at the application of LES to the study of turbulent combustion.
Specific objectives include: (1) determination of the current state of
development of LES for reactive flows, (2) initiation of a development effort in
subgrid modeling, and (3) the preliminary assessment of the use of LES to
combustion applications. A major effort will be expended toward the development
of effective subgrid-scale models describing scalar mixing and reaction. To this
end Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) will be used in the model development by
providing a database with which to compare and verify the subgrid models. DNS
capabilities will be extended to include nonequilibrium chemistry and will be
carried out with and without chemical energy release taking place. Where
possible LES will be applied to large scale "practical" problems and comparisons
will be made with existing experimental data.
