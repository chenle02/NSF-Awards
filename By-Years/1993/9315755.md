9315755 Welsch Arrays of pinning centers (microstructural fences) are introduced
to pin grain boundaries by introducing dopant below the surface by ion
implantation. Bulk materials are created by laminating the implanted layered
material according to desired patterns for achieving high strength materials.
The research involves ion implantation, structural characterization by
transmission electron microscopy, and mechanical testing. Several parameters are
explored related to the fences that are created in the layers. These include
implantation concentration, species, temperature, and post annealing treatment.
Studies include bubble pinning point determination, bubble and grain growth
kinetics, and grain size (related to Hall-Petch strengthening). %%% A benefit of
this research could be creep-resistant metal alloys for high temperature use.
Improved low-temperature fracture toughness could also be a product from the
research. ***
