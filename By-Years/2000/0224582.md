ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unifying Chronostratigraphic Databases
Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Keane and Steven
Stanley&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0224582&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Geological
Institute proposes to convene a workshop to bring together a number of the
groups working on chronostratigraphic databases. The primary goal of the
workshop is to establish the framework for a consortium of scientific entities
that will undertake a sustained effort to continually recalibrate the time
scale, while simultaneously reassessing its relationship to a wide variety of
geologic data and temp[oral patterns through a coordinated data system of
geologic time. Through the workshop, participants will identify the nature,
similarities, and issues facing each chronostratigraphic effort currently
underway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well calibrated, properly applied geologic
time scale is essential to our understanding the evolution of the Earth,
including the ages of rocks and fossils, timing of major events in earth
history, and rates of natural processes. The workshop will examine the needs of
a range of end-users of a coordinated data system dealing with geologic time. By
establishing a list of primary end-user needs as well as issues facing each
organization, an effective plan for building a coordinated data system of
geologic time can be effectively constructed. &lt;br/&gt;
