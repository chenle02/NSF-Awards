9310594 MILLERO The principal investigator will share with another collaborating
scientist the task of making core measurements of the seawater carbon dioxide-
carbonate system during the pelagic processes cruises of the Arabian Sea Process
Study. Two of four measurements -- total dissolved inorganic carbon, the partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), total alkalinity, and the pH -- are necessary
for characterizing the entire carbonate equilibrium system. On some occasions.
However, full sets of measurements will be made to "overdetermine" the system as
a check on internal consistency. Both atmospheric and surface water pCO2 will be
measured continuously along the cruise track. This kind of information is
fundamental to understanding carbon dioxide dynamics at the level of sea-air
exchange and on a global scale.
