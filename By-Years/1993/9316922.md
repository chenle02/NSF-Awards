9316922 Wassall This award will support the travel of Dr. Stephen Wassall of the
Department of Physics, Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis,
for a three-month visit to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Bruce Cornell
and Dr. Frances Separovic in the laboratories of the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Division of Food Science and Technology
located in Sydney, Australia. The project will establish the feasibility of
employing rotational-echo, double resonance (REDOR) nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) to ascertain the confirmation of an isotopically labelled peptide bound to
a phospholipid model membrane. Elucidation of peptide and protein structure
within membranes presents a daunting challenge. The techniques of solid state
NMR are likely to be extremely useful. The goal of this research is to
investigate REDOR NMR spectroscopy as a method of measuring interatomic
distances between labelled sites in melittin bound to a phospholipid membrane.
The collaboration will bring together two research groups with a common interest
in magnetic resonance of membranes.
