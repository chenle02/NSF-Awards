This workshop brings together the top international researchers in the plasma
physics of non-neutral plasmas for one week, June 16-20, at Columbia University
in New York City (http://www.apam.columbia.edu/NNP08/). The conference will
include dusty plasmas, positron plasmas, strongly-coupled plasma, and
accelerator plasma physics. The organizing committee includes broad
representation from US universities, Japan, and Europe.

The meeting will be held over the course of 4 days, and will consist of invited
talks in the morning and early afternoon, followed by poster sessions at the end
of the day. Papers from each of the invited talks will be published in an
edition of AIP Proceedings.
