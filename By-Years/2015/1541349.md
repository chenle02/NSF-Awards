Research in data-intensive fields is increasingly multi-investigator and multi-
institutional, depending on ever more rapid access to ultra-large heterogeneous
and widely distributed datasets. The Pacific Research Platform (PRP) is a multi-
institutional extensible deployment that establishes a science-driven high-
capacity data-centric 'freeway system.' The PRP spans all 10 campuses of the
University of California, as well as the major California private research
universities, four supercomputer centers, and several universities outside
California. Fifteen multi-campus data-intensive application teams act as drivers
of the PRP, providing feedback to the technical design staff over the five years
of the project. These application areas include particle physics,
astronomy/astrophysics, earth sciences, biomedicine, and scalable multimedia,
providing models for many other applications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PRP
builds on prior NSF and Department of Energy (DOE) investments. The basic model
adopted by the PRP is 'The Science DMZ,' being prototyped by the DOE ESnet. (A
Science DMZ is defined as 'a portion of the network, built at or near the campus
local network perimeter that is designed such that the equipment, configuration,
and security policies are optimized for high-performance scientific applications
rather than for general-purpose business systems'). In the last three years, NSF
has funded over 100 U.S. campuses through Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Network
Infrastructure and Engineering (CC-NIE) grants to aggressively upgrade their
network capacity for greatly enhanced science data access, creating Science DMZs
within each campus. The PRP partnership extends the NSF-funded campus Science
DMZs to a regional model that allows high-speed data-intensive networking,
facilitating researchers moving data between their laboratories and their
collaborators' sites, supercomputer centers or data repositories, and enabling
that data to traverse multiple heterogeneous networks without performance
degradation over campus, regional, national, and international distances. The
PRP's data sharing architecture, with end-to-end 10-40-100Gb/s connections,
provides long-distance virtual co-location of data with computing resources,
with enhanced security options.
