9354006 Feiner This project involves the development of undergraduate faculty in
the new scholarship on the economics of women and minorities. The five-day
workshop is expected to help develop a full curriculum for teaching and
assessing student learning of this scholarship. More specifically, seminar
participants are instructed in recent developments in the scholarship on women
and minorities by scholars contributing these developments. They also work in
teams to modify courses to incorporate the new scholarship, critique and refine
these modifications, and will develop techniques to assess the impact of these
changes on student outcomes. Follow-up activities and a dissemination conference
is scheduled, and proceedings will be published in an edited volume. It is also
expected that the incorporating of this new scholarship will encourage greater
numbers of minority and female undergraduates to pursue economics. ***
