An advanced sonagraph with accessories including computer interface establishes
an acoustic analysis workstation for use in undergraduate laboratories and field
ecology projects. The equipment is used by four components of the biology
program: 1) General Zoology (required for biology, environmental science,
secondary and elementary education majors), 2) Animal Behavior and Vertebrate
Zoology, 3) Directed Study and Senior Thesis and 4) pooling with other
institutions through MEDUSA (Maine Undergraduate Marine Science Consortium). The
PI is incorporating elements of his NSF funded research directly into the
introductory level laboratory. Dissemination will be through MEDUSA.
