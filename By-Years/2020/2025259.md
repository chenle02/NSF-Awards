The goals of this capacity building institute are (a) to introduce participants
to rigorous and novel applications of advanced methods to STEM education
research, (b) to provide them with continuous methodological support in research
planning, data analysis, and publication, and (c) to create a community that
prepares emerging scholars for taking leadership in advancing STEM education
research. This capacity building award initiates an institute in quantitative
and computational methods for STEM education research through a collaboration
between researchers at the University of Chicago and those at Michigan State
University. Through launching a national campaign of recruitment, the team will
select a diverse cohort of NSF Fellows of STEM Education Research among early-
and mid-career scholars, especially those from under-represented backgrounds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructors and Fellows will critically evaluate existing
STEM education research throughout six courses over the summers in year 1 and
year 2. Institute training will focus on (1) research designs and causal
inference, (2) measurement, (3) social network analysis, (4) multilevel
modeling, (5) causal mediation analysis, and (6) computational methods for
analyzing qualitative and social media data. Structured discussions of Fellowsâ€™
ongoing studies will be supplemented by guest speaker presentations and round-
table discussions. Fellows will present their capstone projects and further
develop research collaborations in the summer of year 3. A customized website
will disseminate to the broader STEM education research
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research institute is funded by ECR (the
core research program of the Education and Human Resources directorate) and
attends specifically to critical aspects in research capacity
building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
