The Physical Science Department of the Albany College of Pharmacy has
significantly enhanced its instrumental holdings by the recent acquisition of a
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The availability of this system
is providing undergraduate students in pharmacy (forty per cent of whom are
women) with practical experience in using NMR spectroscopy in several courses,
including introductory organic chemistry, honors organic chemistry, drug
analysis, and undergraduate research.
