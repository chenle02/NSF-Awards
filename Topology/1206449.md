The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will host a conference, October 6--8,
2012, celebrating the mathematical impact and legacy of the late Daniel Quillen.
The conference will bring together researchers in the many areas of current
actvity that Quillen either founded or profoundly influenced, including
algebraic K-theory, cyclic homology, rational homotopy theory, abstract homotopy
theory, group cohomology, and modular representation theory. There well be
thirteen main talks, leaving ample time for interaction among participants. The
diverse topics covered by this conference are united by the vision of their
creator, and we anticipate that the conference will result in fruitful
collaborations as they reconnect. Every effort will be made to bring together
researchers otherwise separated by geography, age and rank, and field.

Daniel Quillen (1940--2011) was one of the of the greatest American
mathematicians. A winner of the Fields Medal (the highest award given in the
field) in 1978, Quillen had a deep and unique insight into the nature of
mathematics. He established the foundations of two major branches of mathematics
now being pursued by hundreds of mathematicans around the world today -
algebraic K-theory and abstract homotopy theory - and profoundly influenced the
development of several other fields. With some two hundred participants
expected, this three-day conference will hear from leading researchers in these
areas and bring them together with young and aspiring mathematicians from the US
and abroad. A significant portion of the grant will guarantee that otherwise
unfunded or underfunded young researchers can attend and to ensure the
participation of women and traditionally underrepresented minority populations.
The accessibility of the conference will be augmented by the creation of a web
page which will distribute the contents of the presentations on the internet.
