This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Progam award will develop new
methods for design, control, performance analysis, and pricing of differentiated
services in technologically advanced service operations. Service differentiation
is fundamental to the operation of most modern service systems as it allows
diverse requirements of businesses and customers to be met by means of service
classes with varying quality grades. In addition, it supports the economic
viability of such services. Examples of key questions that will be addressed by
this proposal include the following: 1) How many agents should be used to staff
a large telephone call center to meet service level constraints across multiple
customer classes? 2) How should pricing of Internet-based information services
account for standard quality grades (e.g., ``best-effort'' and ``guaranteed''
connections)? 3) How should web-hosting service providers verify and monitor a
heterogenous mix of service levels dictated by their e-business clients? This
investigation ranges from fundamental formulation and analysis of models, to
more applied work in collaboration with industry partners. The research agenda
is broad and interdisciplinary, integrating ideas from statistics, economics,
stochastic control, queueing theory, optimization, and simulation. Methods
developed in this award should lead to managerial insights and improved problem
solving techniques that can potentially affect the competitive advantage of
enterprises operating in the service sector. Important synergies with related
scientific fields should produce contributions in the areas of applied
probability, statistics, risk management, and revenue management. Results will
be incorporated into teaching materials and new courses, and will be widely
disseminated to academia and industry. In addition to supporting the PI's
research, this project will also support doctoral students and foster research
interactions with industry.
