Partial support is provided for the American Association of Engineering
Societies as the U.S. institutional member of the World Federation of
Engineering Organizations (WFEO) and Pan American Federation of Engineering
Associations (UPADI). The purpose is to allow U.S. engineers to participate in
internatational activities of mutual interest. The aims of WFEO are primarily to
address major engineering problems in a global perspective. UPADI is for the
purpose of cooperation in science and technology, through engineering, for the
benefit of the people in the Americas.
