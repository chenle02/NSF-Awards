9634142 Yeh This action is to support a small reconnaissance team to learn from
the February 21, 1996 Peru earthquake and tsunami, in order to gather and study
perishable inundation data. On February 21, 1996, a large earthquake struck
under the sea off the northern coastal region of Peru, triggering a tsunami
which swept into the port of Chimbote with 3 to 5 meter waves, destroying fish
processing plants and more than 50 houses, and which was recorded by tide gages
at Easter Island (60 cm) and Hawaii (25 cm). The information gathered to date
point to it being a "tsunami earthquake" -- a term resulting from the 1994
Nicaragua earthquake to indicate an earthquake which is unusually efficient in
producing tsunamis. A thorough investigation of "tsunami earthquakes" and their
effects is critical in terms of hazard mitigation, and valuable in light of
recent theoretical developments in fault rupture mechanisms. The reconnaissance
team will gather essential tsunami-effect information including runup, flow
patterns and velocities, tide-gage records, structural damage, scouring effects,
sediment transport, intensity of ground shaking, the effect on estuaries and
nearby lakes, and any secondary effects caused by this earthquake and its
associated tsunami. The team will attempt to follow the recommendations for
survey methodology and procedures established at the 1995 Tsunami Measurement
Workshop in Estes Park, Colorado, as well as the 1995 Tsunami modelling Workshop
in Friday Harbor, Washington. Because international tsunami researchers are
currently involved in a reconnaissance of another large tsunamigenic earthquake
(Mw 8.2) that occurred along the northern coast of Irian Jaya, Indonesia, on
February 17, 1996, this Peru tsunami reconnaissance team will be relatively
small. However, the findings of this team will be announced widely through the
Tsunami Bulletin Board -- an Internet mailing list initiated and maintained by
the NOAA Pacific Marine and Environmen tal Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle.
Immediately after the survey, a brief report will be disseminated via the
Tsunami Bulletin Board, with the final results being published, and also posted
on the University of Washington World Wide Web tsunami home page. All the
gathered data will be available upon request. ***
