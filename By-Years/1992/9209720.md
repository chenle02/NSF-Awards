This grant investigates how ordinary citizens act against and/or in accord with
totalitarian states imposing societal control through the use of terror.
Specifically, the project focuses on the role that ordinary German citizens
played in struggling against and complying with the system of terror that
operated in Nazi Germany. It is based on rigorous quantitative and qualitative
examination of thousands of previously unexamined arrest and court records in
three German cities. Analysis of these data enables differentiation between
which types of people supported Nazism and which did not. Further, it will allow
for empirical analysis of whether and how the Gestapo-led system of terror was
dependent on ordinary citizens for its success in stamping out potential
collective resistence to the Nazi regime. In addition to filling in an important
empirical gap on how ordinary citizens responded to and interacted with this
system of terror, it provides a general model for investigating the
politicization of crime and the judiciary as an instrument of social control.
Also, this model will have wide relevance to scholars interested in totalitarian
societies, their maintenance, and their breakdown as an internal dynamic.
