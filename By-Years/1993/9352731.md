This project is directed at the design and development of a coordinated group of
instructional laboratory apparatus to be used in student-conducted experiments
to demonstrate and measure the operating characteristics, both steady-state and
dynamic, of various types of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning control
units and systems used in the HVAC systems of commercial buildings, auditoriums,
schools, and other large- scale installations. This project is an extension to
an initial effort, under local funding and industry support over the past two
years, to develop a laboratory set-up for a student-conducted experiment to
demonstrate and measure the steady-state and dynamic behavior of a typical
single-loop control system controlling static air pressure in an air duct. This
effort will allow completing the design of the single-loop control system for
air including adding a microprocessor-type control unit and the extension of the
same approach to two other HVAC systems, specifically (a) A single loop control
system for a hot-water coil and (b) A single-zone economizer cycle. This project
should result in the attainment of a capability to challenge HVAC design
students at the undergraduate level to apply basic control theory to the
measurement and analysis of system behavior, using closed- and open-loop tests
in both the time- and frequency-domains. An advisory board comprised of
educators, members of appropriate technical societies, and industrial
representatives will guide the conduct of the project and actively participate
in its evaluation. The results of the proposed project will be the subject of a
two- day workshop on improved instruction in HVAC design, particularly with
respect to control theory, to be hosted by the project management team.
Publication of project results will be made at annual meetings of the American
Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and
the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE).
