Americans depend on the existing Emergency Communications Systems (ECS) to save
lives, either via 911 calls to ambulance, police and fire services or via the
broadcast Emergency Alert System. The existing Emergency Communications Systems
(ECS) infrastructure is becoming increasingly outdated due to the migration of
voice and video services to Internet-based technologies. The Network Slicing for
Emergency Communications (NSEC) is a prototype US Ignite demonstration project
that will utilize GENI slices to create a demonstration system of a robust,
reliable, and scalable alternative to existing ECS. This demonstration will use
network slicing to provide priority and dedicated bandwidth and cloud services
to simplify operations, create sustainability and maintain extensibility. The
GENI slicing framework will also provide isolation from Denial of Service
attacks. The City of Ammon (Bonneville County), Idaho, Albion Telephone Company
(ATC), an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) with territories located in
Southern Idaho and Northern Utah, and Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure
Agency (UTOPIA) with serving territories throughout Utah will support this
effort. This proposed effort will document technical and organizational issues,
serve as the initial demonstration of the feasibility, and provide the initial
building blocks for an open standard implementation of a next generation ECS.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses critical needs in emergency
communications, a national priority issue; provides a path forward for
communities and agencies desiring to address current ECS deficiencies, and
provides a small scale transportable system for on-location demonstrations; and
establishes an extensible open source ECS capable of supporting continued
research and development without affecting current emergency communications
systems operations.
