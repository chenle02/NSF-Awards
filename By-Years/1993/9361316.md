Wafer scale, nonvolatile, magnetorsisitive memories with parallel search
capability and caching capability are being analyzed and experimentally verified
in this project. Because magnetoresistive memories are nonvolatile, are very
dense, and can be made very fast, they are well suited for storage of large
nonvolatile files such as those in data bases. The inclusion of searching
hardware on each active die of a wafer can speed up search by a factor of
10,000. In addition, on-board caching can speed up general purpose read-write
operations, allowing the wafer scale memory to replace all components of a
contemporary memory hierarchy. In this project, an optimum allocation of chip
area to memory, cache, and search hardware is being determined. Power and bus
performance for a typical system is being verified experimentally.
