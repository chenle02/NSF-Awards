1133908&lt;br/&gt;Yu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at engineering
fluorinated paramagnetic complexes (FPCs) as imaging agents for multi-chromic
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It has three objectives: i. Fabrication of
FPCs; ii. In vitro testing of FPCs; iii. In vivo testing of FPCs. Each FPC is a
molecular complex formed between a fluorinated symmetric dendrimer chelator and
paramagnetic metal ions. One fluorinated chelator can be paired with different
paramagnetic ions to generate 19F signals of different resonant frequencies.
Thus, only one synthesis is needed for the fabrication of a set of FPCs. Four
FPCs, each with a characteristic 19F resonant radiofrequency, will be made.
Technical specifications on the performance of FPCs in terms of signal frequency
and relaxation times, solubility, serum stability and in vivo elimination half-
life are proposed. In vitro and in vivo testing will be conducted to evaluate
whether the FPCs meet the performance specifications. In vivo testing will be
conducted in mice using a 3T clinical MRI scanner. Fabrication and testing will
be conducted iteratively. In addition to FPC development by the PI's group, 19F
MRI techniques will be developed by the co-PI's group. Such techniques allow the
collection of 19F/1H dual images at multiple 19F frequencies and can rapidly
determine 19F relaxation times in vivo. The novel concept proposed in this
project is to construct a symmetric intra-molecular paramagnetic shield around
the MRI signal emitter. The paramagnetic shield has two functions: to modulate
the MRI signal to generate multi-chromicity ("color"), and to insulate the MRI
signal from the fluctuations of surrounding magnetic field. The generation and
stabilization of resonant frequencies are critical issues in the engineering of
imaging agents for multi-chromic MRI.
