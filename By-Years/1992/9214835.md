The objective of this research is the measurement of lightning over the
equatorial regions of the western Pacific Ocean; the experiment will compliment
the TOGA COARE program operating in the same region. The characteristics of
lightning to be measured, using 3 magnetic direction finders, include time,
location, number of strokes, and the polarity and peak signal strength of the
first return stroke. Observations from a "slow antenna" will enable an
evaluation of the direction finder's ability to discriminate amongst intra-cloud
flashes, the detection efficiency of the direction finder, and the ratio between
ground strokes (i.e. ocean) and intra-cloud lightning. Finally, for flashes
within 100 km of the "slow antenna", the charge lowered in each stroke can be
estimated.
