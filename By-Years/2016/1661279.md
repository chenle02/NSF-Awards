The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM (science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics) education research that will generate foundational knowledge in
the field. This project will examine ways to broaden participation in STEM for
science education faculty of African ancestry and science education Latino/a
faculty. Research shows that science and science education faculty and students
from these populations regularly face intentional and unintentional acts of
racial microaggressions that often negatively impact whether they remain in the
STEM pipeline. Since many of these acts of racial microaggression come from
administrators, colleagues, and peers, this project will serve as an important
step in directly addressing this issue. The research will (a) identify actions
or activities that might be precursors of or lead to microaggressions; (b) seek
to better understand why the microaggresssors might be aware or unaware of their
acts; and (c) collect data about approaches and policies that have been used by
colleagues and administrators to minimize racial
microaggressions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Critical Race Theory will be used as
the lens to frame the study. Questionnaires, an Implicit Attitude Test,
interviews, and other archival documents will be used as sources of data for
this study. These sources will allow the exploration of gaps in the literature
where prior research focused almost exclusively on faculty and students of color
within science education rather than on performers of microaggressions. This
investment will support a risky, yet, potentially transformative venue for
theory development relative to reducing racial microaggressions in science
education. The outcomes will assist in the development of an instrument that
will reliably measure implicit bias that will be of benefit to the at-large
scientific community.
