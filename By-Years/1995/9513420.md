9513420 Thompson Two major types of cells are contained within the nervous
system: neurons, which are the cells that generate, conduct and transmit
information to other cells; and glia, which are the cells that surround and
support the neurons. Glial cells are important in the repair of nerve tissue
after injury; one class of glia, the Schwann cells, assist in regeneration of
damaged axons (nerve fibers) by extending long processes that then serve as
substrates along which the new axons re-grow. If some of the many motor axons
that innervate a muscle are damaged, the remaining axons begin to send new
"sprouts" to make new connections with the denervated muscle fibers. During
sprouting, the surrounding Schwann cells appear to extend processes that induce
the growth of nearby axons, and guide those growing axons to denervated fibers.
This project uses physiological and immunohistochemical techniques to determine
the roles that muscle activity and gene expression of particular molecules play
in the guidance of axons, with particular emphasis on cell adhesion molecules.
Results from this work will be important in understanding how the other cells of
the nervous system influence the specific targeting of sprouting nerve cells
during development and regeneration, and will have an impact on developmental
biology and cell biology as well as neuroscience.
