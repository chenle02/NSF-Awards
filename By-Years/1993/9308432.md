9308432 Bean Through support by NSF and several companies, the researchers have
developed, over the past year, two powerful genetic-based codes for solving
jobshop scheduling problems and bounded variable integer programs. In a matter
of minutes one can solve problems such as 400 job, eight machine, total
tardiness scheduling problems, or 5000 variable multiple-choice integer programs
to within two to three percent of the best known solutions. The codes are
currently in research prototype form. The researchers will refine and document
the codes during the summer of 1993 so that they can be deployed in three
manners: given to students in the courses IOE 472 (Introduction to Operations
Research, undergraduate), IOE 5443 ( Scheduling, master's) and IOE 614 (Integer
Programming, Ph.D.) ; give them to representatives of MasPar Computer and
General Motors who will use them on current manufacturing projects; and place
them on an ftp bulletin board set up by the genetic algorithm community.
