9308118 Elimelech This is an award to support research, the objective of which
is to study the influence of interfacial hydrodynamics on deposition of
particles in porous media. The investigator plans on conducting well-controlled
particle deposition experiments to test theoretical predictions and to use these
observations in delineation of the mechanisms under which fluid flow and
interfacial forces affect collision efficiencies that have an influence on
particle deposition in porous media. This is a renewal of research previously
conducted under NSF Grant No. 90-09233. The results of this research are
expected to provide a better understanding of the role that fluid flow
characteristics play in the process by which particles are retained within
porous media. The fundamental nature of this work is expected to have
significance in engineering design of filtration processes used for water and
wastewater treatment, chromatographic separation and other processes that
involve particle-surface interaction phenomena.
