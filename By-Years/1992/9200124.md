The deterioration of the nation's water distribution systems is of vital concern
to all communities. This project will develop a model to assist decision-makers
in their efforts to determine repair, retrofit or replacement activities. The
model will include the effects of pressure at various points and the effect of
valves and pumps in the total system.
