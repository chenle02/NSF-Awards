Abstract EEC-9711732 "An Opportunity for Supplemental Education Initiative
Funds to an Engineering Research Center" The Ohio State University Taylan Altan,
PI; Gary Kinzel and Jerald Brevick, Co-PI This award funds the Engineering
Research Center at Ohio State University entitled Net Shape Manufacturing to
develop modular educational materials on topics related to net shape
manufacturing, with emphasis on metal forming (forging and sheet metal forming)
and die/mold design and manufacturing. These materials will present both theory
and practical applications based on the Center's research in net shape
manufacturing, experimental facilities, and industrial applications. These
materials will be produced using modular architecture in an interactive CD-ROM
multimedia format. The modules will be appropriate for continuous education and
training of upper level undergraduate and graduate students and practicing
engineers of diverse backgrounds and levels of manufacturing knowledge.
