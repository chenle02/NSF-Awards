In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, investigations are being carried out to elucidate the
mechanisms of photodissociation, geminate recombination, and vibrational
relaxation of diatomic negative ions imbedded within molecular clusters. These
ions include diatomic halogen anions solvated by carbon dioxide molecules. The
methods of electron transfer theory are being combined with molecular dynamics
simulations to study the interplay between charge localization and solvation.
%%% Molecular ions in the gas-phase can become "solvated" by surrounding neutral
molecules in much the same way as metal ions become "solvated" by water
molecules in aqueous solution. In this study theoretical and computational
methods are being used to characterize such clusters and their interactions with
light.
