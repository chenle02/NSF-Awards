Professors Regitze and Robert Vold have been awarded a grant from the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for research using very large magnetic
fields to study the structure of solids and "ordered" liquids. This work will
allow us to better understand the underlying principles of the structure and
dynamics of condensed matter. This project focuses on several topics of current
interest e.g. the mechanism of alkyl chain motion in channel clathrates,in
layered intercalation compounds and alkylated clusters; the effects of specific
interactions such as hydrogen bonding on internal rotations in molecular
crystals; and the molecular reorientation in liquid crystals. Advantage will be
taken of recently developed techniques for comparing the individual spectral
densities of motion obtained from experiments with those obtained from molecular
dynamics calculations. Particular advantage will be taken of a new magnetic
resonance technique developed by the Volds called frequency stepping in order to
greatly reduce the usual line broadening problems associated with isotopes whose
nuclear spin average is greater than one half.
