In this RUI proposal from the University of Puerto Rico, Humacao, funded by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Alegria will
study the photochemistry of quinones in aqueous phase. The specific goals are to
determine the structural characteristics of quinones necessary for water
photooxidation; to measure relative quantum yields for these systems; to
determine the role, if any, of hydroxyl radicals in the photooxidation; to
determine whether superoxides are formed during the photooxidation; and to
determine the mechanistic implications of the presence of oxygen on the
photooxidation. All experiments are to be of the classical photochemical type
using Hg-Xenon lamps for irradiation and EPR for product determination. Quinones
are natural products which play important roles in bacteria, the photosystems of
green plants, and cell mitochondria. Models with quinone have been created to
mimic photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The results on these studies of
the photochemistry of quinones should be useful in understanding naturally-
occurring and artificial light conversion and storage.
