This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Yale University acquire a 300 MHz spectrometer which
will be used in research investigations which range from synthesis of natural
products and other biologically active compounds to elucidation of reaction
mechanisms, determination of energies and conformations or organic molecules and
development of organometallic reagents for sterocontrolled synthesis. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the
chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
