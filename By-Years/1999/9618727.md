9618727 Bhattacharjee The PI will personally recruit more than 50% of a group of
90 teachers to participate in the Biotechnology Program, Miami University,
Miami, OH. The program will run from 1997 through 1999 at a cost of
approximately $7500 per teacher. The PI will give special attention to the
recruitment of teacher- teams from inner city sites. However, teacher
recruitment from private, suburban and rural schools will occur, as well. The
format of follow-up sessions enables teacher-participants to invite site
colleagues to attend. The hope is that colleague attendance at follow-up
sessions will encourage registration in subsequent summer workshops, and
generate site-support for currently registered participants. At least two
follow-up sessions will enable teachers to network, engage in proposal writing,
share ideas/supplies, and provide opportunities for identifying and assessing
various resources and mentors. The PI will maintain avenues of contact with
participants and assist them with classroom implementation upon request.
