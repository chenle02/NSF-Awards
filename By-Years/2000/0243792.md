The Association of American State Geologists will provide undergraduate students
in geoscience with field-oriented research experiences. The objectives of the
program are to train students in scientific field techniques (particularly
geologic mapping) and to excite and encourage students to pursue careers in
geoscience. This program will enable these students to work side by side with
experienced geologic mappers, field geologists, and geophysicists conducting
field investigations. The mentors serve as not only teachers and mentors but
also as scientific collaborators. State geological surveys in all 50 states and
Puerto Rico are eligible to hire students through this program; students contact
state geological surveys directly to inquire about this and other mentoring and
intern programs. Most student projects run during summer months, but some
include field activities during other parts of the year.
