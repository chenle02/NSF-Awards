Technological change is often assumed to be closely related to a country’s
modernization and development, particularly in developing countries. However,
the assumption that technology determines outcomes has not only led scholars to
miss numerous global narratives of technological change in practice but has also
obscured the agency of adopting nations in shaping and designing the use of
imported technology. This research critically examines notions of technology
transfer and the agency of technology-importing nations to alter, rearrange, and
interpret technological projects and artifacts in ways that differ from
designers’ social imaginaries by balancing local and transnational values and
traditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on recent Science, Technology and
Society (STS) scholarship, this research treats non-inventing nations as active
and creative actors in the technological development process. It moves away from
following linear modernization narratives of technological development to focus
on older, supposedly outmoded technologies, like satellite television for
distance learning, and explores the maintenance of their complex technological
development network. Archival research of satellite television for distance
learning reveals how technological change and usage are intertwined with social
and economic geographies in different national contexts. Supposedly obsolete
systems like satellite television not only have a significant role to play in
some areas but also continues to be adjusted and developed. Through conducting
oral history and archival research, this project contributes to the history of
technology by focusing on technology-importing nations and their role in
technological development so as to improve science, technology, and innovation
policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
