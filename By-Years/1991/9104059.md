Hydrous components have been identified in a variety of upper mantel minerals
normally considered to be anhydrous. In this study, the concentration of these
hydrous components will be determined in co-existing major rock forming minerals
from the upper mantle, and inter-mineral partitioning of OH will be determined.
The bulk of OH content of the nominally anhydrous mineral reservoir of mantle
hydrogen and its geological importance in different upper mantle regimes will be
assessed. This work should help in the better understandint of processes of
magma genesis and the global geochemical cycles.
