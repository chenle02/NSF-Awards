Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles that originated in the mid-Triassic
and rapidly diversified into all of the large-bodied terrestrial vertebrate
ecological niches in the Late Triassic and dominated this landscape for 150
million years. One of the largest controversies surrounding the dinosaurs were
whether they were "warm-blooded" (high metabolic endotherms) or "cold-blooded"
(low metabolic ectotherms). This study is to determine the thermal physiology in
terrrestrial vertebrates, using oxygen isotopes to unlock the thermal physiology
of Permian and Triassic terrestrial vertebrates.
