The investigators will use mathematical analysis and computation to investigate
neural processing in the auditory brainstem and midbrain. The project has four
main topics: (1) Mathematical development of a model for azimuthal localization
in the lateral superior olive based on intensity differences; (2) Development
and analysis of computational models for azimuthal localization by the medial
superior olive and avian analogues based on phase differences; (3) Models for
the neural processing of echoes in the lateral lemniscus of the bat and
mathematical questions of signal reconstruction; (4) General principles of
neural processing. The purpose of this project is to understand the basic
organizational principles of parts of the brain that analyze sounds. These parts
are made up of small signaling devices called neurons, which are organized and
connected so that they perform specific functions (for example, to determine the
location of a sound based on the fact that the sound will be louder at the ear
more closely directed toward the sound source). Progress in understanding these
principles of organization may make possible the design of artificial hearing
devices that could be used in industrial robots or could be used to improve the
hearing of humans with serious hearing deficiencies.
