This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant to investigate the
behavior of bimetallic catalysts bound to an inert carrier in the absorption and
reaction of nitrogen in industrial fixation. Answers to the following questions
will be asked: 1. Will additional of a second metal to monometallic catalysts
promote or inhibit nitrogen reduction to ammonia? 2. How are the nitrogen
binding sites affected by the second metal? 3. How does nitrogen bind to these
sites? 4. Does nitrogen exhibit preferential absorption on one of the metals? 5.
How does hydrogen absorption influence nitrogen activation? The PI plans to do
the following during the planning period: 1. The construction and testing of a
catalyst evaluation apparatus. 2. The synthesis of bimetallic cluster compounds
to be used as catalysts precursors. 3. Preliminary studies of the heterogenous
catalytic behavior of bimetallic catalysts for nitrogen reduction to ammonia. 4.
A literature survey for methods applicable to the synthesis and characterization
of dinitrogen containing bimetallic cluster compounds. 5. Interaction with
senior scientists and the National Science Foundation regarding the proposal
preparation process.
