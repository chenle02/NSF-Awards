0109922&lt;br/&gt;Cowan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This twelve-month award will
provide support for Darrel Cowan of the University of Washington and seven co-
principal investigators to plan a cooperative research project with Dr.
Francesco Dramis at the University of Rome III on Apennine tectonics. The
objective of the project is to review the US and Italian current and past
research in the northern Apennines, formulate specific collaborative projects,
and make a field excursion from Rome to the Bologna Apennines, to give all the
co-PIs the opportunity to view together the terrain, rocks, and structures of
their study area. With the cooperation of the Italian researchers, the
subsequent joint project, "Retreating-trench, extension, and accretion tectonics
(RETREAT): a multidisciplinary study of the northern Apennines," has the
potential to be a world-class study area with important broader implications for
other tectonic systems. &lt;br/&gt;
