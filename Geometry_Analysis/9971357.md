Abstract

Award: DMS-9971721 Principal Investigator: Kevin Corlette

The principal investigator proposes to work in two directions. The first is a
study of equivariant harmonic maps and other variational problems by means of
Morse theory. There are certain situations where a symmetric but singular
solution of a geometrically defined variational problem exists. Under suitable
circumstances, techniques from Morse theory can be used to deduce the existence
of additional nonsingular solutions of the same problem. The second direction is
is related to the problem of finding complete hyperkahler manifolds. There are
results of Bando-Kobayashi and Tian-Yau which give the existence of Ricci-flat
Kahler metrics on quasiprojective varieties realized as complements of suitable
anticanonical divisors in Fano varieties. It appears to be a very restrictive
condition on these metrics that they should be hyperkahler. However, if one
relaxes the smoothness conditions on the divisor, one knows nontrivial examples
exist. We propose a search for nontrivial Poisson structures on projective
varieties which might be associated with complete hyperkahler metrics.

The work in the first part of the proposal was motivated by a question asked by
a physicist who works on the theory of gravity. There are certain special
solutions of the system of equations describing gravity in the presence of a
Yang-Mills field which have attracted a great deal of attention over the past
decade because they have no singularities, i.e. no black holes. There is an
infinite family of solutions to this system of equations, and they approximate a
black hole solution in the limit. The question asked was whether or not one can
explain the existence of these solutions based on the symmetry in the problem
and the "shape" of the space of candidate solutions. This problem is very
difficult, but there is an analogous problem involving harmonic maps between
spheres (trying to fit one sphere inside another as efficiently as possible)
which is more accessible. The second part of the proposal involves an attempt to
find examples of geometric spaces called hyperkahler manifolds. These have been
objects of intense interest over the past 20 years or so, for a number of
reasons. They arise in algebraic geometry, but also are related to issues in
classical and quantum mechanics, and have made an appearance in various
formulations of string theory.
