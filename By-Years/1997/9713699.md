DMI-9713699 Sampath This research is to investigate the physical vapor
deposition (PVD) source and to increase the understanding of the vapor source
and process monitoring for the Air to Vacuum to Air (AVA) high throughput vacuum
deposition of thin films process. The research focus involves modeling both the
vapor source flux uniformity and on uniform source charge depletion to gain an
increased understanding. The vapor source control strategy will also be studied
to understand in-situ sensor requirements for process control. These
quantitative models will be experimentally verified through the deposition and
study of semiconductor thin films for thin film devices and photovoltaics. This
research in understanding of the PVD vapor source has potential applications in
a large number of thin film industries, including flat panel display and
photovoltaic industries. In addition, the proposed research on improved film
uniformity and uniform charge depletion and in-situ temperature measurement
would have direct benefits to many vacuum deposition industries. This is
especially true for bigger wafer size in the future.
