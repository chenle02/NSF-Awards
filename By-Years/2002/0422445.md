The project is awarding twenty two-year scholarships each year for three years
for students enrolled in an engineering transfer program. The fourth year of the
project is being used to finish out the last group of students in the program. A
unique feature of the project engages students in a learning community that
culminates in a service-learning project within a linear algebra class. The
scholars are organized into eight to ten member "pods" to provide a linkage with
the faculty mentors through counsel, friendship, and constructive example. The
scholars are being provided with tutoring in the Center of Independent Study and
are participating in extracurricular student activities and organizations such
as an engineering club. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty members, staff, and
administrators working together in groups of about eight people called "Huey
Teams" are developing and implementing action work plans to improve and focus on
retention of the scholars. Underrepresented classes of students are being
recruited through an outreach program to area high schools that have high
concentrations of Hispanic and African-American students. &lt;br/&gt;
