A central question in the study of plant-insect interactions is why herbivorous
insects tend to restrict their feeding to a limited range of hosts. The goal of
the proposed research is to address this question of specialization by comparing
a generalist herbivore's performance on several possible hosts in terms of both
host quality and the rate of attack by natural enemies. Preliminary
investigations have demonstrated that Vanessa cardui's growth is poor on its
preferred host relative to other available hosts, suggesting that host quality
is relatively less important than other ecological factors in determining its
host preferences. The potential role of natural enemies in determining host
preferences has been forcefully stated but remains relatively depauperate of
experimental study. The possibility of a latitudinal gradient in importance of
natural enemies is suggested and will be investigated by comparing variation in
V. cardui's host preferences and the rate of attack by natural enemies in
several sites. A generalist herbivore has been chosen for this study to obtain
an unobscured view of the herbivore's performance on a variety of hosts before
the herbivore has had significant time to adapt to its host in multiple
dimensions.
