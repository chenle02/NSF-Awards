The Research Experience for Undergraduates Site Program, Integration of Biology
and Materials in Chemical Engineering, at Penn State University aims to engage
undergraduate students in a stimulating summer research experience with a dual
focus on life sciences and materials. Research integrating biology and materials
will contribute to advancements in the fields of medicine, environmental
remediation, energy, and homeland security. Research interfacing materials and
the life sciences will enable the development of specialized materials and
processes aimed to meet critical national needs such as clean water, energy, and
healthcare. The research, educational, and career mentorship provided by the
program is intended to inspire the students to pursue careers in academic
research or industrial innovation. Social activities as well as the use of
pairing of students to work on joint projects will promote collaboration and
teamwork amongst the students. Recruitment to the program will target students
from institutions where research opportunities are limited and will focus on
creating diverse communities during each REU session.

This REU site is hosted by the Chemical Engineering Department at Penn State
University. Undergraduate students selected from institutions across the nation
will conduct ten weeks of academic research bridging materials and the life
sciences. Undergraduate students will work collaboratively with another
undergraduate student and with a graduate student mentor on a project sponsored
by two faculty mentors. Technical activities will increase student awareness of
careers and graduate school and will enhance students' analytical,
collaboration, and communication skills. Mentorship training will increase the
leadership skills of graduate students. Thus, the program will train the next
generation of scientists and engineers to contribute to the nation's scientific
output and to advancements in healthcare, energy, environmental remediation and
security.
