9625768 Beilinson The project deals with a geometric version of Langlands'
correspondence in which the role of automorphic forms is played by D-modules on
the moduli space of principal bundles on a complex curve, and that of Galois
representations, by the local systems on the curve. It appears that the theory
of chiral algebras provides a powerful method for constructing the 'automorphic
forms' corresponding to the 'Galois representations,' which may eventually lead
to complete understanding of the Langlands conjectures in the geometric
situation. The Langlands conjectures appear to be among the deepest visions of
modern number theory; at the moment there seems to be no clue to understanding
them in full generality. However, the parallel statements in the geometric
situation (technically, with the number field replaced by the field of rational
functions on a complex curve) seem to be much more manageable, because of the
machinery of chiral algebras (originated in mathematical physics). These
parallel statements are to be addressed in this project. ***
