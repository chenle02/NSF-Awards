A visual programming language allows the expression of a computation by
combining graphical elements such as icons, lines, and symbols. A visual program
is a diagram specifying a program. Flowcharts and dataflow diagrams are common
examples of visual programs. Visual programming has emerged as a key approach to
enhancing computer utilization, particularly by allowing users not familiar with
computer technology to create programs. This research is on the underlying
theory and technology required to develop compilers and programming environments
for visual programming languages. Currently, visual language compilers and
visual programming environments are constructed ad hoc, at great difficulty and
expense. A goal is to automate this construction using a grammar specification
of the visual language. Two key problems in generating a visual language
compiler are syntactic and lexical analysis of visual programs. There are three
tasks: development of specialized parsing algorithms for restricted classes of
visual language; development of incremental parsing algorithms; and development
of a model and mechanism for lexical analysis of visual programs. These will
lead to a better understanding of the fundamental nature of visual languages,
which are not yet well understood.
