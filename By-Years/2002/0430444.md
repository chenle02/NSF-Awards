ForNet: Design and Implementation of a Network Forensics
System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nasir Memon, Polytechnic University of
NY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award
0430474&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes
to address the lack of effective tools for aiding investigation of malicious
activity on the Internet and other private IP based networks such as corporate
and government networks. The broad goal of this project is to study and
demonstrate the technical feasibility of building an appropriate network
forensics system and establish the technical foundations for such an
infrastructure. Although the vision and motivation behind a network forensics
system may be compelling, the algorithms and techniques that will make it
possible are challenging endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A proof of concept
prototype network forensics system will be built. The prototype system will
consist of forensics modules called SynApps that will create and store
intelligent synopses of packet traffic entering and leaving a network. Multiple
such forensics modules will be networked via a Forensics Server. The Forensics
Servers are then networked across an intranet or the Internet to result in a
Forensics Network (ForNet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the project
will be carried out in co-operation with experts in criminal justice, and a
small prototype system networked between the communities will be built and
deployed. The Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Laboratory at
Polytechnic University will be used as the vehicle for integration of the
proposed research activity into class projects and undergraduate research
projects done on the security testbed in ISIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ForNet
will be able use synopsized network traffic to answer questions in
investigations of many varieties of attacks against networks and
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
