In this project the principal investigator will study various problems in
pluri-potential theory that have applications to complex analysis. The ultimate
goal of this work is to construct an invariant boundary theory for
plurisubharmonic functions and holomorphic functions. In particular, the
principal investigator will study boundary properties of pluri- subharmonic
functions with respect to the Green-Martin topology, the decomposition of
plurisubharmonic functions into potentials and maximal functions, the analytic
structure of polynomial hulls and Wermer compacta. The theory of subharmonic
functions occupies a special place in complex function theory because of its
inherent beauty and because it is important to various other areas such as the
theory of partial differential equations. In this project the principal
investigator will continue working on an analogous theory for what are called
"plurisubharmonic" functions. Plurisubharmonic functions arise in many different
contexts, and a knowledge of their properties will help us understand a number
of problems in differential geometry and complex function theory.
