This project aims to develop a new, bistable electroactive polymer that combines
large actuation strain and energy density with variable stiffness and bistable
deformation. The technical approach of the project involves: (1) synthesizing
new polymers comprising interpenetrating polymers network to achieve stable,
high-strain actuation; (2) investigating ultrathin carbon nanotube coatings for
fault tolerance and enhanced operation reliability; (3) reducing the driving
voltages of electroactive polymers to around 200 V by synthesizing new polymers
with high dielectric permittivity as well as by developing processing techniques
to produce high-quality polymer thin films; and (4) fabricating compact modular
actuators that can be readily integrated into robotic systems. The potential
transformative technical impact of this project is a radically new actuator
material that can reproduce the structural, actuation, and sensing functions of
muscles, and can be inserted into a broad range of robotic systems for
locomotion and manipulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a
new actuator material based on a bistable electroactive polymer that behaves
like an artificial muscle, and offers a combination of attributes that future
robotic systems demand including power output that outperforms human skeletal
muscle, flexibility, quietness, and biocompatibility. Actuators based on the new
polymer material enable the design of robotic systems that interact with people,
such as assistive prosthesis or assistive devices for people with disability,
humanoid robots for elderly in-home care, and surgical robots to save lives. The
material can also be used for industrial automation for increased production
efficiency. This project includes significant outreach and educational
activities. It will provide summer research intern opportunities for under-
represented minority high school students each year. Undergraduate and graduate
students will participate in the proposed research to gain hands-on research
experience, as well as analytical, communication, and inter-personal skills.
