This is a Career Advancement Award to support research activities which would
establish a molecular biological track record for Dr. Bennett and her
laboratory. Dr. Bennett's goal is to use the technique of DNA microinjection and
other molecular genetic manipulations in order to study germline determination
in developing nematodes, with particular emphasis on the role of cyclin B. By
expanding her expertise in this way, Dr. Bennett will be poised to make
important and timely contributions to the field of Developmental Biology. The
results to be obtained from this research are anticipated to significantly
enhance Dr. Bennett's career.
