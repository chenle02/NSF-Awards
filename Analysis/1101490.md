This project will use Banach space theory to investigate some problems that are
motivated by applications to data compression. It will improve the recent
explicit constructions of matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)
so as to match more closely the optimal efficiency of probabilistic
constructions. RIP matrices are used in compressed sensing to reconstruct a
sparse signal by a measurements vector of much smaller dimension than that of
the signal. A vector contained in a Banach space can be approximated by finite
expressions involving the elements of a basis or a redundant dictionary such as
a frame. Typically these approximants are selected by a greedy algorithm such as
the X greedy Algorithm or the Thresholding Greedy Algorithm. Convergence results
for these algorithms depend on geometrical properties of the Banach space such
as uniform smoothness. They also depend on unconditionality properties of the
dictionary. An important related open problem in Banach space theory to be
resolved is to show that the family of constants (Elton constants) corresponding
to the nonlinear projection of a vector onto sets of large coefficients is
uniformly bounded. Closely connected to this is the quantization problem of
replacing arbitrary real coefficients by a finite alphabet of coefficients. The
existence of dictionaries with good quantization properties will be related to
the geometrical properties of the Banach space. Quantitative results will be
obtained in the finite-dimensional setting.

A Banach space is a collection of objects called vectors which can be added
together or multiplied by numbers to form other vectors. There is a concept of
distance between vectors which is analogous to the familiar notion of distance
between the points in the three-dimensional world which we inhabit.
Mathematicians have found that Banach spaces provide the correct framework in
which to formulate major areas of mathematics such as Functional Analysis and
Partial Differential Equations. Banach spaces are also used by scientists and
engineers to model problems in applied areas such as fluid mechanics, signals
processing, and finance. There are many different Banach spaces which can be
distinguished from each other by geometrical properties such as smoothness and
convexity. An individual vector belonging to a Banach space is usually
identified by an infinite string of numbers called coefficients. An important
problem in data compression is to find a method to select the most significant
coefficients so that the resulting finite string vector is a short distance from
the original vector. The project will concentrate on this and other problems
involving geometrical properties of Banach spaces.
