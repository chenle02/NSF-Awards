This two-year project seeks to improve the teaching of middle school
mathematics to Chapter I (economically disadvantaged) students in the City of
Baltimore. During the first summer of the project, forty teachers of such
students from eight middle school will participate in a four-week institute that
empahasizes problem-solving and the use of computers to teach mathematics. The
same teachers will return for a second four- week workshop during the following
summer. NSF support is being sought only for the summer institute since
initiation and follow-up activities are being funded by the Maryland State Board
of Higher Education. The university and the State of Maryland are contributing
an amount equal to 37% of the NSF award.
