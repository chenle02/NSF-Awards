ABSTRACT Mark A. Mchugh Johns Hopkins University CTS-9500489 The production of
new copolymers for specific market applications depends not only on an intimate
knowledge of the kinetics of copolymerization, but also on a firm understanding
of the solubility behavior of these copolymers in process solvents. The
copolymers that represent potential new market products. While it would be
highly advantageous economically to produce these copolymers using well-known,
and existing, high-pressure polyethylene polymerization technology, there is a
considerable challenge to producing these new products reliably and reproducibly
since there is little available information on the solubility of these
copolymers in ethylene and ethylene-cosolvent mixtures. Therefore, the major
focus of this proposed study is the experimental determination of cloud-point,
or solubility, data for ethylene-based copolymer-solvent and copolymer-solvent-
cosolvent mixtures.
