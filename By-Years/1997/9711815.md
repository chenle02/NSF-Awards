Lise K Nelson University of Washington The doctoral dissertation research will
examine the origins and character of political change in the context of neo-
liberal economic and political restructuring. In order to explore this question,
the research will emphasize the gender and ethnic dimensions of emerging
citizenship discourses in Mexico, through in-depth analysis of how political
identities develop and become embedded within political practice at the
community level. The empirical analysis of the relationship between citizenship
and political practice are approached through a comparative investigation of
community development politics in the Meseta Purhepecha, Michoacan. The two
objectives are to examine the emergence of citizenship discourses in the context
of personal experiences with political activism and to explain how community
members translate narratives of citizenship into particular practices that
engage local state officials. Fieldwork in two communities will emphasize in-
depth interviews of life history and participant interviews and observations.
