This award will provide support for travel by students and young faculty to the
1990 Sensor and Actuator Workshop to be held in Hilton Head, SC. This is one of
two key workshops for this area of research, and it is important that students
and faculty have the opportunity to attend. The PI will convene a panel of
senior individuals to review applications for support, and awards will be made
with the following priority: (1) graduate students who are presenting papers,
(2) researchers less than five years from the PhD who are presenting papers, and
(3) other researchers having a proven record of productivity in the area and who
can justify a genuine need for travel assistance.
