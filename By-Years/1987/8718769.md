This award to the Institute for Development Anthropology, a non- profit research
organization, will allow three senior anthropologists to oversee the prototype
research to establish linked longitudinal field research sites wherein
anthropologists can test hypotheses about economic development and social
change. Extensive work by two of the PIs over the past 30 years has established
a rich database on four Tonga villages in the Gwembe Valley, Zambia. The present
research will computerize the data into an annualized time-series, process the
most recent (1981/2) census and extend the database to 1988. They will also
construct an exogenous factor database of world economic changes which have
impacted this region (including wages, commodity prices, and ecological and
environmental data). They will use remote sensing data to construct an allied
database of environmental data. This research is important because it is a
beginning in a long- term procedure to create a comparative theoretical and
factual framework. Studies in isolated villages in distant regions of the world
can be productively compared against a framework of quantitative measurements of
world processes. Theories about causes and consequences of economic development
will be able to be tested quantitatively with reference to a wide range of
economic, social, environemtal and ecological variables.
