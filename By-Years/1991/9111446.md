The mammals in the carnivore family Procyonidae all live in the New World and
all are arboreal (tree-climbing) to some extent. Up to four of the five living
genera coexist in the same forests in Central and South America, but little is
known about their habitat requirements or the way the forest is apportioned
among them. The P.I. has studied the limb anatomy and limb kinematics of these
animals in an attempt to understand the diversity of biomechanical solutions to
be problems of food acquisition, escape from predators, and movement through a
complex, three-dimensional habitat. These lines of inquiry have led to several
hypotheses regarding the functional and ecological significance of procyonid
locomotor patterns, limb proportions, and food-handling behaviors that require
field work to test. Studies of muscle structure and measurement of museum
specimens are not sufficient to elucidate the radiation of this taxon into a
wide range of adaptive types. This planning grant is designed to investigate the
feasibility of locating, radio-tracking, and capturing the lesser known
procyonids to obtain data on (1) movement patterns and habitat use in the field,
(2) limb use behaviors (locomotion and food handling) of wild animals under
field and laboratory conditions, and (3) the extent to which differences in
locomotion and food-handling abilities prevent overlap in habitat use by
procyonid genera and species.
