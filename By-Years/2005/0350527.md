This project examines geographies of environmental conflict by investigating the
importance of spatial patterns of citizen opinion and political activity in
shaping dissent related to natural resources and environmental conditions. The
proposed project examines the case of oil-rich Azerbaijan. That country would
appear to be a clear case where resource abundance, coinciding with resource
scarcity experienced by much of the populace, would be expected to lead to
resource-related dissent or conflict. Based on a pilot public opinion survey
conducted in the spring of 2002, four hypotheses structure the research
questions and methodology of this study. These hypotheses are 1) that a lack of
political freedom will stifle environment-related dissent, 2) that environmental
dissent may be eclipsed by other priorities of day-to-day life, 3) that a
minimum population threshold must be met to sustain environmental dissent and 4)
that dissent requires an object of focus. This study posits that spatial
patterns of citizen opinion and activity will help to explain the unexpected
lack of environment-related dissent in Azerbaijan. Findings from this
investigation in Azerbaijan will be useful in generating theories about the
roles of space and scale in environment and resource-related conflict more
generally and in other contexts. A two-part data collection strategy combining a
nation-wide public opinion survey and smaller scale, in-depth interviews will
generate two complementary data sets. The broader impact of the proposed project
will be its contribution to work on resource conflicts by theorizing the spatial
role of political activity related to resource issues. The intellectual merit of
this study is the argument that conflict, as a social process, is not solely
determined by resource scarcity, abundance, distribution or other
characteristics as argued in previous work on resource conflicts, but also by
geographic factors shaping citizen response to resource-related concerns.
