The present proposal is directed toward the acquisition of virtually
continuous, concurrent biogeochemical-physical- optical data at a site (0, 140W)
in the equatorial Pacific as part of the JGOFS program. Presently,
meteorological, current, and temperature data are being collected from a mooring
at the site by Dr. Michael McPhaden of PMEL/NOAA. Dr. McPhaden's measurements at
that site will be complemented in this effort by placing Multi-Variable Moored
Systems (MVMS) at 4 depths within the upper 120m on this mooring. The data
collected from the MVMS units will include: currents, temperature, conductivity,
beam attenuation coefficient, stimulated and natural fluorescence, dissolved
oxygen, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), spectral upwelling
radiance, and spectral downwelling irradiance. Derived variable products from
the MVMS units and the PMEL current meters and temperature recorders will
include: stratification, mixed layer depth, mixing time scales, and current
shears. Additional MVMS products will include: the spectral diffuse attenuation
of light which can be used for computation of the penetrative component of solar
radiation as well as for bio-optical models, particle concentrations, pigment
biomass, primary production (using several methods), integrated pigment biomass
and primary production, oxygen respiration and utilization, the flux of oxygen
across the air-sea interface, and the advection and flux of particles and
pigments. The MVMS units would provide virtually continuous time series for
about 6 months per deployment, thus complementing and spanning the planned
JGOFS/NOAA shipboard studies.
