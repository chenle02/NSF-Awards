Models of chemical processing systems may be affected by varying degrees of
error. In many substances reasonable bounds on the extent of the errors can be
determined quantitatively. In particular, ellipsoidal confidence regions--
certainty models-- can be generated as a by product of efforts to model process
plants. This project addresses the design of robust controllers capable of
satisfying performance and stability specifications for a normal plant as well
as for all plants belonging to a neighboring ellipsoidal uncertainty region. The
objectives of this research are to (1) develop a comprehensive methodology for
analyzing the robustness of systems with ellipsoidally uncertain plants, (2)
produce tools for synthesizing robust controllers for such plants, and test and
evaluate the resulting control strategies via simulation studies. The analysis
of robustness will be carried out by extending the results of a frequency-domain
technique which leads to a simple necessary and sufficient condition for robust
stability. New synthesis methods are planned using generic control structures as
well as specialized designs such as pole-placement. Computer simulation studies
of chemical engineering systems will be used to critically evaluate the new
control strategies using systems of relevance to the chemical processing
industry.
