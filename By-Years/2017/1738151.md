The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the
displacement of many battery applications with an alternative technology based
on a Thin Flexible Fuel Cell (TFFC). Initial target markets include the many
applications in which long-life, compactness and high performance are important.
Based on the needs for portable storage filled by batteries at present, a
technology that increases lifetimes between charging by ten times will impact
multiple applications including smartphones, tablets, test equipment, medical
instruments, and small autonomous vehicles. The result will be greater
flexibility and versatility imparted to the various systems impacted, and
greater utility and benefit to their users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project leverages a recent discovery in hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Thin
Flexible Fuel Cell (TFFC). The structural components of the TFFC are constructed
completely from soft materials, rather than rigid and more dense metals,
plastics or composites. The result is that the device is ultra-thin (&lt; 1 mm),
sheet-like, and may be bent into almost any arbitrary shape. It is also
extremely light and has among the highest recorded power densities on a mass or
volume basis for compact, air-breathing, fuel cells. The fuel cell was
discovered through research on the implementation of low-cost two-dimensional
device fabrication involving nano-imprint lithography. The device was found to
have five times the power density (W/kg) of state-of-the-art commercially
available ultra-light, compact fuel cells. Moreover, the TFFC is completely
passive with respect to oxygen supply and thermal management, needing no extra
sub-systems for these functions.
