Web-Aware Multi-User Virtual Environment for Studying On-line Collaboration SRI
International has been awarded funding in the amount of $149,318 for a period of
12 months. SRI and several San Francisco Bay Area K-12 science professional
development providers (six Lawrence Hall of Science programs, Life Science
Program, California Science Project, and the Science Education of the Bay Area)
will jointly develop a new vision of on-line professional development activities
in a place where teachers with diverse interest, skills, and backgrounds can
meet and learn from one another on any given day; where teachers can be exposed
to not one but many education reform concepts and approaches; where teachers can
find quality resources in minutes rather than hours; and add and annotate
resources that they find useful. The goals of this project are to (a) scale up
from prototype to implementation and (b) to conduct the research needed to
assess the utility of the concept and technology and inform the development of
future collaborative on-line learning communities.
