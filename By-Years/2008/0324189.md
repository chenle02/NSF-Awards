The College of Engineering Scholars Program (CESP) program promotes increasing
the level of student majors and level of retention and matriculation in several
CSEMS related disciplines. The CESP program supports 20 summer-enrolled first
time freshmen. Fourteen additional freshman to senior recipients are selected
from the following discipline areas: Computer Science, Computer Engineering
Technology, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical
Engineering, Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering Technology.

The implementation of this program promotes success through recruiting freshmen
better prepared than the average incoming freshman in the College to undertake
the four-year targeted degree programs, recruiting community college and junior
college students who are better prepared than the average current transfer
students to undertake the targeted degree programs at mid-level, with no more
that three years planned to degree completion and by monitoring and advising
CESP scholarship recipients to ensure compliance with program requirements,
promote optimal progress, and help identify and resolve problems so that
retention is improved. CESP provides a tutor/mentor to assist the scholarship
recipients. This tutor joins the other tutoring and mentoring services in the
college to help improve the retention rate in the college, and consequently
increase the enrollment in the targeted degree programs. The program contributes
to the final objective of increased total number of baccalaureate degree
graduates in the targeted degree programs.
