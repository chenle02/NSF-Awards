Scott Reid of Marquette University is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to investigate (i) the vibrational and unimolecular reaction
dynamics of molecular free radicals at chemically significant energies and (ii)
the excited electronic state dynamics of prototypical organic free radicals,
with a focus on competition between multiple photochemical pathways. Radiation
sources based on seeded optical parametric oscillators will be developed in
concert with a variety of spectroscopic and time-resolved methodologies,
including nonlinear spectroscopies based on laser-induced gratings (e.g.,
degenerate four-wave mixing) and new linear spectroscopies (e.g., cavity ring-
down spectroscopy). The education phase of this CAREER award involves (i)
undergraduate curriculum development, (ii) initiatives for promoting research
opportunities for undergraduates and (iii) implementation of novel classroom
assessment methodologies.
