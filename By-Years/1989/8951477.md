The use of NMR spectroscopy to study molecular structure and dynamics is now an
essential element of an effective undergraduate chemistry program. The Chemistry
Department at Connecticut College purchased a 250Mhz FT-NMR which is integrated
throughout the curriculum. Students at the freshman level are introduced to FT-
NMR in general chemistry with the hope that this introduction to this exciting
technology will stimulate the students to continue to study sciences. Specific
applications exploiting the full capabilities of the FT-NMR are incorporated
into organic chemistry, spectroscopic methods, instrumental methods,
biochemistry, physical chemistry, and the new course on synthesis and
characterization of inorganic compounds. These applications enhance the
understanding of theoretical concepts already introduced into the classroom.
Also, undergraduate participation in faculty directed research is strong and
expanding. The availability of FT-NMR enhances the ability of the students to
carry out successful projects. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
