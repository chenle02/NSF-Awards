A Hewlett Packard Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer is being purchased for the
use in five areas of chemistry. By teaching the principles and operation of a
modern microprocessor driven separation and identification technique, students
are learning chemical principles as well as data techniques. Specific
experiments have been designed in the classical chemistry areas. For example,
the analysis of branched fatty acids of the human skin surface is being
considered in biochemistry. In instrumental analysis the detection of zeranol
and zearalenone, used as the fattening agent, in cattle is being used to
acquaint the students with some practical approaches to GC/MS. The department
also teaches a course in criminalistics and the use of GC/MS is being used to
illustrate the wide applicability of the technique in this area. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
