This award, which is co-funded by Systems and Synthetic Biology/MCB, and
Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering/CBET, will support a
symposium that highlights the recent advances in genome editing technologies.
These technologies have enormous implications for advancing fundamental research
in Molecular Biology, and applications in Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology.
The meeting brings scientists from the field of genome editing together with
practitioners in molecular and cellular biology, synthetic biology and
biotechnology to (1) accelerate the further development of these tools for
specific applications. (2) hold community discussions about ideas, methods,
problems and solutions; (3) foster the initiation of new multidisciplinary
projects and collaborations to advance modern science.

The Symposium will be held in Big Sky, Montana, January 11-16, 2015. Over 75
prominent scientists and leaders from academia and industry are part of the
organizing committee and speaker list, with an overall attendance to be expected
of around 200. The organizers have made a genuine effort to ensure balance in
terms of demographics and representation from underrepresented group, as well as
participation from academia, industry, government and non-profit organizations.
The Symposium program includes Keynote addresses, scientific talks, short talks
selected from abstracts, poster sessions, andtwo workshops to encourage
communications between junior and senior scientists and engineers.
