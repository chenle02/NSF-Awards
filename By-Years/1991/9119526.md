This is a proposal to develop a transposon tagging system for Arabidopsis, based
on the maize transposon Activator. It is proposed that an Ac-derived tagging
vector will be developed based on the novel concept of a suicide Ac element.
Transposition of suicide Ac will be limited to a single event in post-meiotic
pollen of a primary transformant, thus individual progeny of the transformant
will contain a single element at a unique genomic location. This will allow easy
assessment of distribution of element target sites. If successful, the result
would be a new and versatile tool with which insertional mutations could readily
be produced, analyzed and cloned in Arabidopsis.
