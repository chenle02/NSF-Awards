Building Mathematical Base for Environmental Studies Curricula This a planning
project to develop a proposal for a State- wide program to enable mathematics
teachers to help initiate and support environmental studies programs in grades
6-12. More specifically, the purposes of the planning study are: (1) to
establish data bases of already existing projects and activities that integrate
mathematics with environmental studies; (2) to organize a 3-day conference to
pool experience and ideas from people already active in this field; and (3) to
create a network of interested teachers and educators. Since environmental
problems are inherently global in nature, an international component is
included-- specifically cooperation with two specialized science schools in
Russia. The proper role of technology and computer software in such programs
will be explored.
