The objective of this proposed research is to develop a low cost, high
performance filtration media that exceeds the performance of that which is
presently available for the construction of HEPA filters. The basis for the
media is a low density microcellular foam process that was developed originally
at Sandia National Laboratories. This foam process will be combined with
electret formation process to create a microcellular electret foam filtration
media. The experimental program is directed towards gaining insight into the
interaction between the necessary fabrication processes and the solvent/polymer
solution required to create the foam and resolution of identified problems in
the adaptation of the foam to filtration applications. Also, the incorporation
of electret formation equipment into the fabrication process will be
investigated. The knowledge gained will be used to develop a set of guidelines
for the design and production of a microcellular foam filtration media.
