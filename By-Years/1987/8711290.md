The project will investigate the nature of the mitotic motility systems that
move chromosomes. The specific aim is to distinguish between and characterize
the different components that collectively generate motility in the aster, and
to determine which are involved in chromosome movement. The transport properties
of the aster will be examined at highest microscopic resolution, and then the
effects of metabolic inhibitors on the polewards and antipolewards movements
will be compared with the behaviour of prometaphase chromosomes. The principal
investigator will ascertain whether the higher plant spindle, with its broad
open poles, shows a response similar to the contraction of prometaphase
chromosomes induced in the radially organized, centric mammalian spindle by
metabolic inhibitors. Similar observations on the phragmoplast may show what its
transport properties have in common with astral transport. The permeabilized
cell model, successful in investigating anaphase A, will now be used in attempts
to reactivate prometaphase chromosome activity and astral transport. Studies
will examine chromosome movement, and any concurrent microtubule disassembly,by
exposing PtK cells to ATP and various analogs and inhibitors. The mechanisms
responsible for chromosome movement during cell division remain one of the least
understood, but important issues in cell biology. Results obtained during the
course of this project, on the comparative physiology of polar and antipolar
transport, should substantially contribute to our understanding of these
mechanisms.
