This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
commercialize an intelligent software power management solution for multicore-
based server-class systems. Existing open source and commercial power management
solutions place processors into low power states to save power. Unfortunately,
lower power equates to lower performance which can seriously impair the user
experience or violate service level agreements for servers deployed by ISPs and
others. Hence, in production environments, most data center facilities and end
users with performance-sensitive missions disable power management altogether.
Over the course of this project, the company will determine the technical and
commercial feasibility of multicore power management in production environments.

Data center operators require energy efficient servers in the data center. Data
centers in the U.S. and abroad provide the technological backbone for the
Internet and e-commerce. As of 2005, data centers accounted for about 2% of
total U.S. energy consumption. Data center managers cite power consumption as
their largest concern today since: 1) energy costs to run servers are now
typically greater than acquisition costs; and 2) excessive energy use produces
heat that reduces system reliability. If successful, the current effort will
provide ROI in the form of 10-35% decreased energy consumption per server for
end users without compromising service, performance or productivity. This effort
has the potential to leverage emerging multicore technologies and migrate from
research and development to the commercial, profitable marketplace.
