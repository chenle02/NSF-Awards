This work correlates the catalytic behavior of supported bimetallic catalysts
with details of their structure and local composition. This class of catalysts
is probably the most valuable from an economics point of view, although it
represents a small fraction of the catalysts in use. Why some combinations work
and others do not is still largely a mystery although some patterns are
beginning to emerge.
