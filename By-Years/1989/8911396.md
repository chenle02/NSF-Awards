This is a project to develop finite element numerical models of hydrothermal
circulation at an ocean ridge axis. The modeling will specifically focus on
along-axis circulation driven by heat transfer from a magma chamber. Various
effects such as anisotropic permeability, combined fracture and porous
permeability, variable heat input and double diffusive convection. The model
results will be constrained to the extent possible by observational and field
data from ocean ridge crests and ophiolites. %%% Hydrothermal heat transfer at
the sea floor represents approximately 30% of the earth's heat budget. The
details of the hydrothermal circulation are not well known. This project will
evaluate a number of potential factors that control the pattern and duration of
the circulation. Dr Haymon has a great deal of observational and field
expertise, which will be very useful for putting the numerical models into a
geologic context. Dr. Spera is a very able numerical modeler.
