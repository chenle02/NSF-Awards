A grant has been awarded to Dr. E. H. Peterson and four co-PIs at Ohio
University for the purchase of a laser scanning confocal microscope for
biological research. Confocal microscopy is an essential tool in modern life
science research, particularly in molecular biology and neuroscience. With it,
the investigator uses one or more lasers to illuminate tissues, and computerized
imaging to record and analyze the resulting data. The confocal microscope will
be configured with four laser lines and specialized software for three-
dimensional image reconstruction and quantification and for measurement of
physiological processes. Costs of the confocal microscope will be shared by Ohio
University and the Ohio Board of Regents. The confocal microscope will serve
several federally funded research programs including (a) biomechanics of
receptors in the inner ear, (b) molecular analyses of plant cell wall function,
(c) interactions between endothelial cells and nanoparticles that can be used
for drug delivery, (d) biochemical and physiological precess in insects, (e)
neural networks in simple biological systems, (f) transgenic tomato and tobacco
cells, and (g) calcium dynamics in epileptic brain tissues. The new confocal
microscope will serve faculty and students in three colleges and six academic
departments. It provides a state-of-the-art imaging facility for graduate and
undergraduate student training in a traditionally underserved area: rural
Appalachia. Ohio University's primary mission is undergraduate education, and
the science and engineering departments have a strong tradition of mentoring
undergraduate research through intramural programs and federal grants. The new
confocal microscope will be available to these students through their research
projects with science and engineering faculty. In addition, it will enhance
existing course offerings and research training for the university's science and
engineering graduate students.
