This starter grant award to North Carolina State University supports the
research of Professor Daniel L. Feldheim. The research focusses on
photocatalysis at isolated and aligned metal particles. Porous polymer and oxide
membranes, with pores ranging in diameter from 1 nm to 300 nm, are used as
templates for the synthesis of photocatalytically-active metal particles. The
metal particles are used for the systematic investigation of the effects of
particle composition, size, aspect ratio, and alignment with respect to incident
radiation on heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions. The research will advance
the fundamental understanding of the geometric factors that govern the kinetics
and mechanisms of photoreactions at small metal particle surfaces. The research
may lead to more environmentally-friendly routes to the synthesis of
industrially important organic compounds.
