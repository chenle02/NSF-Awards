This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
mathematical problems in continuum modeling and analysis for physical systems.
The collaboration involves the US research team led by Gui-Qiang Chen at the
Northwestern University and the French team led by Michel Rascle at the
Mathematics Laboratory of the University of Nice. The investigators will study
compressible Euler equations, entropy flux splittings, kinetic formulations,
microstructure, phase transition and metastability. The underlying mathematical
theme is that of singular limits; the unifying physical theme is that of
continuum mechanics. The project takes advantage of the complementary expertise
of the US and French investigators and will advance understanding of
mathematical underpinnings of problems in physical systems.
