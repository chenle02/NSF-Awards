9314792 Durney The Babcock-Leighton theory of twenty years ago holds that the
migration of magnetic fields across the solar surface plays a key role in the
reversal of the solar magnetic field. However, more recently, the idea that the
reversal has its origin at the base of the solar convective zone has become
widespread. This implies that the observed surface activity is irrelevant to
this question. A study will be undertaken to establish whether the Babcock-
Leighton theory is in fact viable or should be abandoned. ***
