David Hoffman and Joel Spruck will conduct research on a variety of problems in
differential geometry and mathematical physics. Hoffman will study the behavior
of properly embedded and immersed minimal surfaces in three dimensional space
and construct new families of examples. Particular emphasis will be placed upon
the development of methods of construction of examples, computation relevant to
problems in the subject, and on understanding the global behavior of properly
embedded examples of finite type and periodic examples. Spruck will study
variational problems with a large number of constraints which arise naturally in
plasma physics and other fields. Particular emphasis will be placed on
constructive methods of solution that are suitable for large scientific
computation. He will also study several important geometric problems which are
strongly related to his research on semilinear equations.
