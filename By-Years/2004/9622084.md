9622084 Deuermeyer This research focuses on the development of new simulation
theory and methods to improve the performance and effectiveness of discrete
simulation as it applies to semiconductor manufacturing. Planners and designers
are becoming more interested in using cycle time to plan equipment purchases and
scheduling policies; discrete-event simulation is the only analysis tool
currently available to support design activities. Specific improvements in
simulation methodology are needed for 1) faster execution speed, 2) methods to
obtain cycle-time estimators, and 3)special variance-reduction technology that
accounts for the increase in variability in cycle time caused by preventive
maintenance and rare failure events. Generalized Semi-Markov Processes (GSMP)
will be used as the modeling framework. This research will provide new
capabilities in generating sample paths of GSMPs, developing importance sampling
schemes for GSMPs, developing methods for computing crossing probabilities of
cycle time and developing software to demonstrate the theoretical methods. These
should contribute significantly toward solutions to the demanding problems in
analysis and design of the extremely complex processes associated with
semiconductor wafer fabs from the point of view of product cycle time and
throughput rates, and facility and machine capacity.
