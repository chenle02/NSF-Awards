This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop
prototype urine-detecting products based on enzyme-polymerization and chemical
sensing technologies for use in nursing homes, daycare establishments and
healthcare facilities. These products will include hand-held sensors, sponge
wipes, and bedding fabric pads that change color upon exposure to urine. The
strict specificity of the enzymes used in sensor formulation will provide the
sensing devices with rapid response times and great precision, thus limiting
false positive and negative signals. Having shown the proof of concept in Phase
I , the sensor optimization work in this Phase II project will focus on signal
enhancement, the development of multi-component sensors for quantitative
analysis, and improvements in the usability and the operational shelf life of
the proposed sensing products.

The commercial application of this project will be for a broad range of public
facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, daycare centers and food /
hospitality establishments.
