The University of California at Berkeley will initiate a six-week, commuter,
Early Alert Initiative in physics and mathematics for 120 students entering the
7th, 8th, and 9th grades. This summer and academic year program will emphasize
the study of mathematics, physics, and engineering concepts in ways that will
demonstrate to the participants how academic course work relates to the world
around them and how the practice of science is accomplished. Students are
presented with unusual themes such as exploring space for extraterrestrial life
forms. This leads to the study of radio signals from deep space, galactic noise,
coding systems, and structural materials. Students learn the mathematics of the
development of the Richter Scale and how earthquake intensity is measured.
