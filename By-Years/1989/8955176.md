Rutgers University will conduct a three-year program to develop a leadership
cadre of secondary school teachers in selected topics in discrete mathematics
and their applications. The project includes a four-week summer workshop for
each participant, two weeks of which are on content and two on methodology.
After implementation, follow-up, and sharing with colleagues, lead teachers will
be selected for the next workshops and for outreach. The proposal is based on a
successful pilot project, and participants will be selected from a large region,
within 200 miles of Rutgers University, to increase the outreach. This program
is a direct result of the designation of the Center for Discrete Mathematics and
Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS) as a Science and Technology Center by the
National Science Foundation. It will be conducted by the Rutgers University
Center for Mathematics, Science and Computer Education (CMSCE). Rutgers
University has contributed an amount equal to 31% of the National Science
Foundation request.
