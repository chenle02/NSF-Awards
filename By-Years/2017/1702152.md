This project concerns the deep connections between two apparently very different
areas of algebra. The first is group theory, which is the formal study of
symmetry. The second is algebraic number theory, the study of numbers which can
be constructed by algebraic processes, like taking square roots (as opposed to
numbers like e and pi which arise only through limit processes belonging to
calculus). The main link between these two fields is provided by algebraic
geometry, the geometric study of systems of polynomial equations. A key theme in
the proposed work is monodromy, which encapsulates the symmetries revealed by a
varying system as the variable follows a closed loop. Monodromy problems arise
in many guises, in both pure and applied mathematics. For instance some of the
techniques under study in this project have been used to determine which kinds
of computations can be carried out by different kinds of quantum computer.
Algebraic number theory has found important practical applications and
especially plays a key role in the development of modern
cryptosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this project is the reciprocal
relationship between group theory and algebraic number theory or arithmetic
algebraic geometry. This includes using group theory as a tool, for instance in
analyzing images of l-adic Galois representations, or Mordell-Weil groups of
abelian varieties over Galois extensions of the rationals. It also includes
studying groups, especially discrete linear groups (including finite groups),
using methods from number theory and algebraic geometry, including the circle
method, etale cohomology, and deformation theory.
