Gurevitch DEB-9634664 This study will investigate the critical initial phase of
regeneration on the Long Island Pine Barrens following a fire in August 1995
which burned almost 7,000 acres. Pine barrens are well-studied systems, but
little is known about the conditions which lead to pine or oak dominated
communities in the barrens. It is anticipated that events in the early years
following the fire will be crucial in determining community composition.
Experiments will be established which investigate the relative importance of
biotic and abiotic factors and how these factors interact. Particular attention
will be paid to the importance of seed and seedling predation by small mammals
and competition among tree seedlings in determining the trajectory of
revegetation of the pine barrens following a catastrophic fire. Revegetation of
the dwarf pine plains, a globally rare ecosystem located within the Long Island
pine barrens, will be compared with that of the burned (full stature) pine
barrens. Data on the response of dwarf and normal pine barrens to severe
following long-term fire suppression will help our assessment of fire management
options, including controlled burns, for pine barrens newly protected by the
Pine Barrens Protection Act of 1995.
