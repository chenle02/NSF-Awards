Stonehill College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus
network to NSFNET. NEARnet is the midlevel network located in the New England
region that will provide operations and network information services. It will
give Stonehill College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a
high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The
College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.***
