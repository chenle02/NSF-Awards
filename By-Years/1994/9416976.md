ABSTRACT 9416976 PUETTER, R.C. Recent work in image reconstruction using pixon
based techniques has led to the ability to remove point-spread- function
blurring of images. Initial tests have suggested that these new techniques can
provide order-of-magnitude improvements in photometric sensitivity and
resolution. These methods are now being introduced to the scientific community
and the merit of these methods are now being recognized. This project will carry
out exploratory research into pixon based methods making additional tests and
demonstrations of their potential.
