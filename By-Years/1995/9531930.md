9531930 Grujicic The objective of the proposed research is a multi-scale
analysis of the role of martensitic phase transformation in inhibiting crack
propagation. The key idea is that this mechanism of crack closure would be
better understood if one could link the stress-assisted and strain-induced
martensite formation to the state of stress imposed on the actual atoms at the
extreme tip of a crack. The modeling effort will use computer simulation
techniques (molecular dynamics and the finite element method) to analyze the
fracture behavior of transformation toughened metallic materials and the
predictions will be validated through metallic systems investigated in earlier
work. This research should help to bridge the gap between information gained at
different microstructural length scales, atomistic and macroscopic. ***
