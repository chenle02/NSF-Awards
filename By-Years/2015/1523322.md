The project will enable students to defray the costs of traveling to and
attending the 42nd International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA-42),
to be held June 13-17, 2015, in Portland, OR. ISCA is a premier forum for
presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and
techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium
brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture,
compilers, chips, and systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have two
primary broader impacts. First, the ISCA conference will be strengthened as a
result of the greater attendance that this travel support will enable. Second,
those students receiving travel support will personally benefit from the
opportunity to interact with peers and experts, as well as establish connections
that will help their professional careers. More broadly, we expect additional
indirect impacts. First, the available support will be widely advertised in
order to attract women and under-represented minority groups (through postings
on computer architecture web-sites and mailing lists). Second, by focusing on
students, the project will help foster the mentoring of subsequent generations
of computer architects.
