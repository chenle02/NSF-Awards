This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to understand how to
increase student engagement in out-of-class learning assignments such as
homework, and to develop effective methods to improve engagement. The project
engages partners from engineering and the behavioral and learning sciences to
gather initial data which on why students don't do out-of-class work and how to
identify and engage these students.

The broader significance and importance of this project is that by better
understanding why students choose not to do out-of-class assignments it may be
possible to improve how often they complete this work and the quality of work
they do complete. Since much learning in engineering programs takes place
outside of the classroom, this is an important issue for engineering workforce
development. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming
the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new
capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is
enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by
informing educational policy and practices.
