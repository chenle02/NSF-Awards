The nature of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City
demonstrates the need for understanding the interdependencies between physical
infrastructure and social networks. The benefits of such understanding may
include possible recommendations on modifying the design of the physical
infrastructures to improve their resilience to catastrophic disruptions. Models
of social networks relying on wireless and wired communication infrastructures
would allow the development and testing of efficient algorithms to determine
critical blocks in the infrastructures, whose distraction will adversely affect
the communication traffic inside of and among social networks. This research
project will use the graph-theoretic approach to model social networks and their
reliance on physical infrastructures, focusing mainly on social networks in the
New York City area and the providing infrastructures, including telephone
networks, towers for the wireless communication, transportation and emergency
services. This knowledge will be used to identify opportunities for reducing
vulnerabilities, developing countermeasures to mitigate the impact of
disruptions, and guiding actions for timely response and discovery.
