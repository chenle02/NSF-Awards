ABSTRACT P.I. Jonathan Marks SBR-9306205 The major triumph of applying
molecular techniques in anthropological systematics was the finding that humans,
chimpanzees, and gorillas are more closely related to one another than either is
to the orang-utan. Not only are they closely related, but it is now clear that
they are genetically approximately equidistant from one another, with the
majority of workers now believing that chimpanzees are more closely related to
humans than they are to gorillas - although there continues to be a debate on
the resolution of this "trichotomy." The goal of this research project is to
refine and apply the new and powerful technique of flourscent in situ
hyubridization (FISH) to the phylogenetic analysis of chromosome rearrangements
shared among the great apes and humans. Specific regions of DNA whose positions
have been precisely mapped to human chromosomes will be used as probes to the
corresponding positions on chromosomes of the apes. In this way, Marks will be
able to identify the precise nature of chromosomal rearrangements that have
taken place in the course of hominoid evolution, and may help to resolve the
"trichotomy." *** P:\anthro\jfried\9306205.abs erved. ICONBARPROC SELECTION
