In response to pressures associated with sharply fluctuating customer demand,
accelerating technological innovation, acquisitions or joint venture
arrangements, and the emergence of global markets, many large organizations are
replacing hierarchical and matrix forms of management with a `dynamic network'
design. Dynamic networks are a combination of functional-organization and
flexible structures such that the major components of the organization can be
assembled and reassembled in order to meet complex and changing competitive
conditions. The University of Minnesota and Texaco Inc. propose to undertake a
joint study of the role of group decision support systems(GDSS's) and related
information technologies in facilitating a corporation's transition to a dynamic
network form. The project will involve:(a) design and implementation of GDSS
prototypes for use in decision rooms and in local and wide-area networks; (b)
studies of GDSS use within and between work teams; and (c) studies of GDSS
impacts on individuals, teams, and larger business units. GDSS will be studied
as one aspect of a larger set of change approaches, including quality programs,
self-managed teams, and advanced information technologies (specifically,
electronic mail and group conferencing systems). Several propositions related to
GDSS design, use and impacts will be explored. This project builds on a base of
GDSS design, theory development, and laboratory research conducted at Minnesota
and field work conducted in a GDSS facility at Texaco.
