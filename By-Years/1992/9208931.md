This program is a fundamental study of the microstructure derived from rapid
solidification processing of metals. The velocity of motion of the planar
interface that separates the liquid and solid is measured. Laser pulsing is
employed to create a one dimensional melting pattern on thin films deposited on
insulating substrates. Interface motion, undercooling, and solute trapping are
determined. The experimental data should provide a quantitative test of theories
for the interface velocity/undercooling function. %%% This research examines
non-equilibrium conditions created by rapid solidification processing
techniques, such as laser melting, ion implantation, and plasma spraying. The
goal is to develop improved predictive capabilities for the material
microstructure and chemical segregation that results from the processing.
