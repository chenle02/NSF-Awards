9302258 Parish The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate
electrodynamic coupling between the high and low latitude ionosphere during
periods of raised geomagnetic activity and to study the dynamo effects of
planetary waves in the lower thermosphere and their influence on the F-region
ionosphere. These two areas of research will be addressed by analyzing
measurements from ionosonde and magnetometer stations close to the geomagnetic
equator and, for the electrodynamic coupling study, values of the AE index will
also be analyzed. Spectral analysis will be performed on these data for the
whole of 1979 and fluctuations with periods between a few hours and two days
will be examined. ***
