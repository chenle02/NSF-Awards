This REU site award supports six undergraduate researchers working under the
supervision of two faculty advisors. The program will run for eight weeks.
Students will divide their time between experimental calculations and
mathematical analysis. Depending on their interests, students will be assigned
to one of two groups. One group will work on a project in algebraic geometry and
computer algebra. A useful tool in this effort is the Macaulay software which is
available and not difficult to learn. The other project will be in analysis and
representation theory. Students will be required to produce written reports at
the end of the program and summarize their work in oral presentations to the
other students and Mathematics Department.
