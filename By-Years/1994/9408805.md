This is the first year funding of a two-year ontinuing award. `Distributed Group
Support Systems` embed Group Decision Support System (GDSS)-type tools and
procedures within a computer-mediated communication system, to support
collaborative work among dispersed groups of people. `Distributed` has several
meanings: temporal, spatial and technological. The group members use the system
to work together to reach a decision or complete their cooperative work over a
period of time, with each person working at whatever time and place is
convenient. The theoretical focus of this phase of the research program will be
to test propositions that will contribute to a general theory of coordination in
distributed groups, by constructing a common database of the results of at least
six experiments spanning four different types of tasks. The focus of empirical
studies will be coordination mechanisms and processes to support creative and
planning tasks, such as software design teams. The products of this program of
research will help to provide the knowledge base for effective coordination of
the work of collaborative groups using the `information superhighways` that are
currently being constructed.
