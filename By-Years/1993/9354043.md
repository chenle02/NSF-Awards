9354043 Huang Teacher Preparation Enhanced by Collaboration among Institutions
and Developing Mentorships This project aims to establish a program for
prospective math/science teachers by revising courses such that they are
relevant to an urban environment and to at risk students. The approach
emphasizes learning and teaching through investigation, critical reasoning and
problem solving. To achieve these goals New York University plans to 1) develop
a collaborative relationship with the City University of New York, several
science museums and pubic colleges in the city, and a school district. 2)
initiate a pilot program for teaches in training that will involve the formation
of a team mentoring group, 3) review current course offerings for those
preparing to be teachers, and 4) enhance the participation of science faculty
through workshops. ***
