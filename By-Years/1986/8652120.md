The National Geographic Kids Network Project is a series of exciting, flexible
elementary science units featuring cooperative experiments in which students in
grades 4-6 share data nationwide using telecommunications. Topics will involve
students in issues of real scientific, social, and geographic significance.
Combining basic content from typical school curricula and guided inquiry
learning, the Network Project can be used to supplement textbooks and existing
materials or to form complete year-long science courses. Technical Education
Research Centers will produce six units and software for sending, processing,
and displaying data. The National Geographic Society will develop at least four
additional units, publish all the materials, and provide teacher development
assistance. Materials and telecommunications will be designed for practicality
in partnership with experienced classroom teachers and administrators. The
telecommunications will be software-controlled for ease of use and reliability.
The National Geographic Society and a network of professional organizations,
state education agencies, and museums will widely disseminate information about
the program. Local support and technical assistance will be generated through
industry members of the Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education,
school boards, and community groups. This project is a superb response to the
Solicitation, Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction, issued by the
Instructional Materials Development Program. The project has high potential for
bringing about a meaningful change in elementary school science learning and
teaching. The project director, through training and experience, is eminently
qualified to conduct activities. His track record speaks well for the success of
this project.
