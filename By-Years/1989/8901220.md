The Synthetic Organic Program supports the work of Dr. Patrick. Patrick,
professor of chemistry at SIUE, is carrying out research on the project,
"Monofluoro Reagents for Organic Synthesis". The replacement of a hydrogen atom
by a fluorine can have remarkable effects on the chemical and biological
behavior of the molecule. Methods for carrying out these changes have been
difficult. Patrick is developing new ways to incorporate the fluorine atom into
organic molecules. Patrick is developing several new reagents for incorporating
fluorine into relatively complex organic molecules. This is accomplished
primarily through the preparation of unique fluorinated synthons that can find
general application in the development of synthetic strategies. Specific target
intermediates include fluorinated oxazines and oxazolines, masked carbonyl
compounds that contain fluorine, and a fluorinated butadiene. Successful
completion of the preparation of these targets will provide a supply of general
and versatile reagents that can be applied to the synthesis of fluorinated
analogs of natural products.
