The XVth International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems
will be held in August, 1992 in Israel. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is now
one of the central techniques in biology and medicine. Both ESR and NMR have
provided essential information on the structure-function relationships of
proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and membranes. Especially noteworthy are
the recent developments of NMR techniques for the determination of the three-
dimensional structure of proteins in solution and the powerful combination of
NMR with the methods of in-vitro mutagenesis. At the same time, one of the most
exciting recent advances has been the application of magnetic resonance methods
to living organisms, providing for the first time a direct, non-invasive monitor
of biochemical events in selected, spatially localized regions of living animals
and humans. The program planned will reflect this broad range of applications of
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
