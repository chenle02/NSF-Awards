9314549 Gordon This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in earth sciences on problems of global plate tectonics and reconstructions. The
U.S. scientists are Richard Gordon, Northwestern University, Charles DeMets,
University of Wisconsin and a graduate student. The French scientists are Jean-
Yves Royer of the Underwater Laboratory, Villefranche-sur-Mer and a graduate
student. The investigators will examine plate reconstructions in the Indian
Ocean with applications to the kinematics and tectonics of the deforming zone
between India and Australia. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise in quantitative analysis of plate motions as applied to problems of
global tectonics. This complemented by the French investigator, a marine
geologist with expertise in plate reconstruction techniques and its application
to marine tectonics. Studying the unique plate deforming zone in the Indian
Ocean is important for continental studies of plate tectonics and their
capabilities in predicting earthquakes. ***
