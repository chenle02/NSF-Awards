Modern medical devices increasingly incorporate connectivity mechanisms that
offer the potential to integrate devices via network/middleware technology into
larger systems of cooperating devices. Initial integration efforts in the
industry are focused on streaming device data into electronic health records and
integrating information from multiple devices into single customizable displays.
This proposal provides a research foundation for engineering and verification of
these safety critical systems through creating an open source Medical Device
Coordination Framework (MDCF) which includes: 1)middleware for integrating
medical devices and electronic health records, and 2) a model-based development
environment that implements medical device coordination applications (apps for
short), enabling a systems of systems paradigm for medical devices.

The project has substantial broader impact via tools and techniques for
verifying the integration of medical systems that are compatible with the
Integrated Clinical Environment standard. In addition, the proposer includes
extensive interaction with FDA specialists who are looking to transition these
methods into their validation and verification processes for their regulatory
mission.
