Environmental politics poses challenges to the decision making process:
Environmental problems transcend political boundaries, and often resemble a
zero-sum game played out between interests for environmental protection and
conservation and economic development. Regional environmental policies have been
proposed, but it is not clear that existing interstate compacts can cooperate to
offset collective action problems found in environmental policy. This project
involves the analysis of several case studies with a goal of developing a
typology of environmental regional forms of collective action.
