Through this project, the Mechanical Engineering (ME) Department is developing
an advanced Integrated Design, Manufacturing, and Materials Laboratory for the
improvement of its undergraduate curriculum. The improvement plan includes the
introduction of four experiments that will enhance eight required and two
elective ME courses in computer graphics, computer-aided manufacturing,
materials engineering, and concurrent- engineering-related courses. The ME and
Art Departments together with private industry are implementing the experiments
collaboratively. The experiments integrate design, manufacturing, materials, and
concurrent engineering. The four selected experiments test: (1) the application
of rapid prototyping and CAD to produce wax models for investment casting; (2)
the use of investment casting to form Al-base alloy components (e.g., turbo
impellers); (3) the use of tensile testing to evaluate material properties and
optimize casting variables; and (4) the use of teamworking to satisfy user
requirements for producing robust designs. The major new equipment includes a
rapid prototyping machine and computers, investment casting equipment, and
video-related equipment. This project is important because it will provide
approximately 140 engineering students with practical skills in product design.
This can improve their performance, increase their retention rate, and enhance
their attitude toward the profession of engineering. The project is also
significant because improved laboratory facilities can enhance the University's
engineering curriculum and prepare a future generation of U.S. engineers to
compete effectively in the global marketplace.
