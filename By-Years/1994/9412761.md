This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of changes in ethnic identification among white ethnic
groups and the impact of such identification on the labor force participation of
women. Census data from the 1910, 1940, 1950, 1970, and 1980 censuses will be
used, with a focus on English, Italian, Polish, and Jewish women. Census data
from 137 different American cities will be examined through time to see how
features of the local economy and population composition affect the labor force
participation of women in the chosen ethnic groups. Previous research has viewed
the ethnic identification of immigrants as gradually receding as a result of
prolonged exposure to the American melting pot. More recently researchers have
recognized that ethnic identification and distinctive forms of behavior
associated with that identification can be either strengthened or weakened,
depending upon features of the local social structure in which members of a
group live. Yet to date few studies have rigorously investigated how this
"emergent ethnicity" works, and by doing so, this project will make an important
contribution. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the
research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in
completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the
future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next
generation of social scientists.
