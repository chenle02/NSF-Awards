The site of Salibiya I, located in Israel, was inhabited by Natufian peoples at
approximately 9,500 B.C. Excavations conducted there in 1987 by Dr. Crabtree and
her colleagues yielded a stratified sequence of at least eight distinct Natufian
layers which were rich in both lithic and faunal remains. Dr. Crabtree will
analyze the later materials. She will identify the animal species present in the
Salibiya I faunal assemblage and estimate their relative abundances. For
abundant species, such as gazelle, she will also determine ages at death. The
data will be examined to discern possible changes through time, and comparisons
will be made with other Natufian sites. The research will examine three
questions. First, what was the range of animal species hunted by the Natufians
at Salibiya I and to what extend did they specialize in gazelle hunting? Second,
to what degree were the Natufians exerting hunting pressure on gazelles and how
might this have affected other subsistence activities? Third, can one discern
regional and chronological variations in Natufian hunting practices? This
research is important because of the light it may shed on the origins of the
domestication of plants and animals. The Natufians, although they were hunters
and gatherers and not herders of domestic animals, lived at a time just prior to
when this occurred. Their society shows signs of the increasing complexity which
accompanies domestication in other parts of the world, and archaeologists have
posited that the processes which led to the Neolithic revolution elsewhere were
also at work here. They argue that these Natufians tried to treat gazelles as
domestic animals but failed because the species is not amenable. Thus, this may
provide a unique instance in which the process failed. Through this study
archaeologists may gain insight into the processes which lead to complex
societies such as our own.
