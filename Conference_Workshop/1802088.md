This award supports participation in the 2018 and 2019 KUMUNUjr Conferences, to
be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during April 21-22, 2018 and April
2019. This is part of an annual conference series designed to promote
interaction among junior researchers in commutative algebra and related
disciplines (including homological algebra, algebraic geometry, K-theory, and
coding theory) at Midwestern schools. The conference series is anchored by the
Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri - Columbia (MU), and Nebraska - Lincoln
(NU). The gathering will provide an opportunity for young algebraists to
interact and establish research connections with each other. This interaction
will help to lay a foundation for fruitful research collaborations as the
participants advance in the field.

The goals of the conference are to foster collaboration among young researchers
in commutative algebra from Midwestern institutions, and to expose commutative
algebra students and postdocs from Midwestern institutions to the current work
being done in their fields at neighboring institutions. The primary impacts of
the conference are its enrichment of the research careers of the participants
and the dissemination of recent ideas in commutative algebra research at the
graduate and postdoctoral levels. In particular, the interaction and exposure to
the work of their peers will benefit students from universities with small
commutative algebra research groups, those who will become faculty at small
institutions, women, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. In
addition, participants will take ideas and collaborations initiated at the
conference to the institutions where they eventually establish careers.
