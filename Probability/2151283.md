The project addresses fundamental research directions overlapping with the areas
of probability, combinatorics, statistical mechanics and optimization. The
technical challenges include acceleration of random walks on discrete structures
such as graphs, optimal analysis of classical random walks restricted to special
subsets of lattices, and developing new combinatorial enumeration techniques
from graphs to hypergraphs. The resulting methods have potential for
applications in statistical physics. Some of the applications, such as the
Traveling Fireman Problem, are inspired by practical challenges and would have
important societal impacts. The project provides training opportunities for
students. The PI will continue to host expository lecture series as well as
working group activities that feature and support junior researchers, including
those from underrepresented minorities.

The project includes efforts to speed up random walks for faster sampling,
inspired by acceleration techniques in Langevin dynamics and continuous
optimization; tight estimates on the mixing time of constrained random walks on
distributive lattices, a study originally motivated by dynamical aspects of bond
percolation on the square lattice; and the development of cluster expansion and
zero-freeness of independence polynomials arising from hypergraphs. A
fundamental question raised focuses on whether sampling using traditionally
first-order Markov chain dynamics from a discrete finite set with a prescribed
distribution can be accelerated, using certain second-order dynamics. While the
initial investigation suggests such a speed-up of spectral gap is feasible, it
is unclear how to simulate such a process in the context of discrete (or
continuous)-time random walks on a discrete space. A second topic addresses a
quest for a deeper understanding of sampling and counting independent sets in
hypergraphs. As direct counting of these objects is well-known to be
intractable; probabilistic aspects by way of cluster expansion and zeros of
hypergraph polynomials are considered as potentially fruitful directions.
