Professors Bramson and Griffeath propose to further the rigorous theory of
various random and deterministic complex systems in the area of interacting
particle systems and random cellular automata. These include systems of
annihilating random walks and billiards, random and deterministic growth models,
and random and deterministic interface dynamics. The methodology for studying
these processes often combines traditional rigorous mathematical analysis with
interactive computer visualization. Professors Bramson and Griffeath study
random processes known as interacting particle systems and random cellular
automata. These are "toy universe" models that evolve over time, e.g. on a
computer graphics display, offering insights into the behavior of complex
dynamics from many areas of applied science. The investigators have two main
objectives: to understand the kinds of aggregate behavior that such dynamics
manifest, and to explain how these behaviors arise by using the traditional
analytical techniques, theorems and proofs of mathematics. The phenomena they
study include such fundamental physical processes as contagion, clustering,
turbulence, and nucleation.
