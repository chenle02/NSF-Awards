9503481 Kevrekidis This Americas Program award will support a collaborative
research project between Dr. Yannis Kevrekidis, Princeton University, and Dr.
Ramiro Rico-Martinez, Instituto Tecnologico de Celaya, Mexico, on the long-term
dynamical properties of neural network-based models . They will study the
qualitative properties of the long-term predictions of the constructed models
and propose to explore another intrinsic model feature , noninvertibility, to
clarify its role in the loss of model predictive capability and its impact in
adaptive identification and control applications. In addition, they plan to
develop, implement, and test new approaches , and study the properties of phase-
space reconstruction procedures. Special emphasis will be placed on the
development of computer tools for the parallel implementation and analysis of
the models. The proposed research will benefit from the combined skills of Dr.
Kevrekidis on non-linear dynamics, and Dr. Rico- Martinez in neural networks.
