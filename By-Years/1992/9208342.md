Mudge This project supports a rapid prototyping facility that allows researchers
in computer architecture to prototype their designs and obtain accurate
performance measurements. The equipment in the facility are available nationally
over the Internet, and staff are employed by the facility to assist remote users
in prototyping their designs and in connecting custom hardware to the facility's
equipment. The major component of the facility is a Quickturn Enterprise System
that can prototype logic netlists of a target system in a network of FPGA's. It
can emulate the target with a slowdown of only a few hundredfold, which is fast
enough to exercise the design with significant benchmarks, test functionality,
and take performance measurements. A built-in logic analyzer and stimulus
generator permit detailed performance measurement and functional testing.
