The core of Macroeconomic policy analysis is understanding the impact of
unexpected events, news, and variation on core economic variables including GDP,
inflation, wages, investment, and employment. Applied macroeconomic research
focuses on estimation of these impacts known as "impulse response functions".
Current estimation methods are less precise than desirable, and are difficult to
implement with a large number of variables. This project develops new methods
which produce sharper and more precise estimates of these effects, allowing for
more precise understanding of the macro economy and economic policy. The methods
are based on combination (or ensembles) of simpler methods. The new method can
be much more precise than existing simpler methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project explores impulse response function (IRF) estimation in vector auto-
regressions (VARs) by model combination. Estimates from lower-dimensional models
(VARs and ARs of lower order) will be combined by standard model averaging
methods. The IRF is a non-linear function of the VAR coefficients. The
investigator develops a large-sample (asymptotic) approximation to the
distribution of the combination IRF. Using this asymptotic approximation, this
research calculates the approximate mean-squared error (MSE) of the combination
IRF, and shows how to estimate the MSE using an appropriate information
criterion which is similar to a Mallows criterion or Focused information
criterion. The combination weights can then be selected to minimize this
criterion function, resulting in a practical combination estimator. The goal of
the project is to study the statistical properties of this combination method
and extend its application to high dimensional contexts.
