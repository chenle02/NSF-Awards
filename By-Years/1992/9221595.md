Collaborative Project: Independently Determined Distances to the Magellanic
Clouds. Dr. Moffett, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Barnes at the University
of Texas, will carry out an observational project to determine distances to the
Large and Small Magellanic Clouds by means of the surface brightness technique
applied to Cepheid variable stars. Existing and new photometric data will be
combined with existing high quality radial velocities in a surface brightness
analysis to obtain individual distances and radii for all twenty two
extragalactic Cepheids. These individual distances will establish mean distances
to the Magellanic Clouds independent of other astrophysical distance scales and
independent of the interstellar reddening of these Cepheids.
