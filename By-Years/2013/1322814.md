The project (a three-day conference) addresses the question of language change,
and in particular, how the pronunciation of words changes over generations.
Pronunciation is associated with social identity and group membership but the
factors that underlie changes in pronunciation may be general cognitive and
phonetic mechanisms that are not under direct control of speakers. This topic
relates to general questions of how social organization emerges from individual
behavior that are relevant to many different types of social organization
(including political and economic systems). The linguistic system, as compared
with other types of social organization, is more directly tied to sensory and
motor systems and thus the factors that shape the system are more directly
observable. The conference brings together researchers in linguistics,
sociology, cognitive science, and computer science to exchange results and
refine methods.
