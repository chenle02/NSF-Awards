The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to improve modeling and treatment for various disorders. The initial
application is to personalize footwear. This project uses a smartphone camera to
determine the size and orientation of feet and gait. It combines computer
vision, image processing, machine learning, material science, and anatomy and
physiology to develop a virtual solution to fit shoes. This enables a new low-
cost method for evaluating physiological conditions with potentially
straightforward consumer solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports
a novel data-analytics solution that provides accurate footwear recommendations
based on static foot shape and dynamic foot function, using only a smartphone to
capture images. This project will develop the algorithms using machine learning
and statistical modeling for a user to evaluate the potential utility of a
comfortable shoe. This project will evaluate the prediction accuracy of a
prototype system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
