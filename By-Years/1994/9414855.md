With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Breslow of Columbia
University will develop methods that cause organic reactions to occur in water
solutions. Organic molecules will be incorporated into cyclodextrin cavities and
these complexes will be dissolved in aqueous solutions. This technique will
allow the study of the effects of water on normally hydrophobic reactions of
organic compounds. Cyclodextrins will be modified to contain by covalent bonds
biphasic organic catalysts whose ability to accelerate certain organic reactions
in the presence of metal ions will be studied. The use of selected cyclodextrins
will also allow the determination of specific geometry requirements that are
anticipated to occur in selected organic reactions. The goals described in the
proposal are applicable to the area of environmentally chemically benign
synthesis. This research will use the unique shapes of naturally occurring
cyclodextrins, found in plants rich in starch, as miniature containers in which
certain organic reactions will occur while the entire mixture is dissolved in
water. Many organic substances resist interacting with water and exhibit
hydrophobic behavior. The use of cyclodextrins as containers which dissolve in
water will allow a unique study of the hydrophobic reactivity of organic
compounds in a water environment. This research represents an important
development of environmentally benign chemical synthesis studies that can help
to reduce pollution from manufacturing processes in the chemical industry.
