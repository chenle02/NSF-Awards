ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory award is directed to
consideration of there being sufficient energy released during the accelerative
bubble compression and rarefaction of natural oceanic bubble fields to allow the
conversion of the acoustic kinetic energy of liquid motion into sufficiently
highly localized heat and pressures excessive enough to provide a unique means
of driving chemical reactions. Under conditions of direct application of high
enough levels of ultrasonic energy into liquids, including water, salt solutions
and seawater, both sonoluminescence and sonochemical transformations are well
described physical and chemical phenomena resulting from the process of acoustic
cavitation: the formation, growth and implosive collapse of gas bubbles in a
fluid. The occurrence of sonochemical processes in the marine environment
remains largely conjectural although bubble cavitation itself is known to be
associated with breaking waves, impacting raindrops and other turbulent flow
regimes found in the ocean and a range of aqueous environments. This study
combines the expertise of marine chemists and a sea-surface physicist at the
University of Connecticut Marine Sciences Department in a focused attempt to
delineate whether cavitation energy levels actually present in surface ocean
conditions and specifically of natural bubble fields could, or could not, be
sufficiently energetic to call for additional consideration of any direct
chemical consequences. &lt;br/&gt;
