Professor Michael J. S. Dewar is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop a new semi-empirical self consistent
field molecular orbital treatment which is capable of being extended to
transition metals. The proposed "fourth generation" semi-empirical
parameterization has already been successfully applied to the elements C, H, O,
and N. It will now be extended to the halogens, and eventually to the transition
elements which involve d atomic orbitals. The improved semi-empirical
parameterization will be applied to a variety of important chemical problems
including: mechanisms of pericyclic reactions; studies of substituent effects;
properties of nitro compounds; reactions of singlet oxygen; phosphorous and
sulfur chemistry; and chemistry of non-transition metals. %%% With the advent of
supercomputers coupled with continued developments in theory, the field of
chemistry is rapidly approaching a time when computed chemical properties will
be reliable enough to substitute for experimental measurements. Nevertheless,
the computational costs involved with reliable ab initio molecular orbital
calculations remains high for all but the very smallest molecules. Semi-
empirical methodologies of the type developed by Professor Dewar continue to
offer a practical alternative to chemists who must deal with large molecules
such as those encountered in the pharmaceutical industry.
