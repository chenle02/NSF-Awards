9528113 Agnew This grant provides partial support for the costs of constructing
a second, semi-portable, laser- based, long-baseline strainmeter to make
measurements of tidal strains orthogonal to an existing strainmeter situated at
the southern termination of the San Andreas fault system. These measurements
would be used in an attempt to model the 3-D elastic inhomogeneities and
inelastic responses that are important in determining the mechanical behavior of
earthquake prone regions. The use of two instruments provides a novel approach
to measuring crustal strain near faults. ***
