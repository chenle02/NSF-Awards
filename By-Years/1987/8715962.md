A World Ocean Circulation Experiment is planned for the 1990's to improve our
description of the global ocean circulation. This ambitious program will
provide, on a global basis, observational data to improve our modeling
capability and assist the assessment of climate variability. This project will
provide funds to the planning effort, including the Science Steering Committee,
and a number of workshops in support of the multi-faceted field program. This
year, the implementation plan will be completed for the U.S. contributions to
the program. Finally, the plan will be presented at the International WOCE
Congress in Paris.
