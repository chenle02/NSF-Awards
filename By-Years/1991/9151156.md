The addition of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (gc/ms) will improve
instruction in chemical principles and the receptivity of students in learning
these principles. The gc/ms will be used in the organic lab to convincingly
identify compounds. The new experiments employing gc/ms support concepts taught
in the lecture part of the course. The physical chemistry laboratory curriculum
will apply the theory of gas phase unimolecular reactions to the decomposition
of ions in the mass spectrometer. Instruction in instrumental analysis, advanced
laboratory, and undergraduate research will also benefit from this acquisition.
The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
