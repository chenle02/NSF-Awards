This project focuses on the eocene climate, around 50 million years ago, when
the world was much warmer than at present. A suite of numerical modeling
simulations with a general circulation model will be carried out to resolve a
major disparity between paleoclimate data interpretations and previous modeling
results. The data indicate that the interiors of continents enjoyed mild
climate, while previous model simulations suggest that the interiors of
continents experienced high seasonality. Latest version of the NCAR Community
Climate Model, coupled to a sea-ice/oceanic mixed-layer model, will be used in
this work. This work is important because it will yield insights into the
physical processes important during previous warm epochs and could lead to
further refinements of models of the climate system.
