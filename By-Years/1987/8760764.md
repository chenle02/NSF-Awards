The objective is to develop a detector to measure the energy of ultra-
relativistic charged particles. By measuring the angular distribution of x-rays
emitted when a charged particle passes through a stack of foils (transition
radiation) the efficiency of the detector and energy determination can be
improved over simply counting the number of photons. The linear accelerator at
the Naval Postgraduate School in Monteray California will be used to explore the
angular resolution to separate the transition radiation from the incoherent
radiation. The coherent radiation would be a source of x-rays for ultra-
relativistic electron detection.
