This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by
Professor Timothy H. Warren at Georgetown University to carry out fundamental
studies on the generation and interconversion of nitric oxide (NO) and its
biochemical relatives S-nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitroxyl (HNO) at copper ions.
Despite the established importance of NO and RSNOs in biochemical signaling
pathways leading to physiological responses such as vasodilation along with a
rapidly growing interest in HNO, enzymatic pathways for the generation and
interconversion of these molecules connected to the biology of nitric oxide are
not clearly delineated. A synthetic modeling approach will allow for the
detailed examination of transformations among these various NO-derivatives
promoted by copper ions in nitrogen-rich coordination environments related to
those found in biology. Variation of the copper site along with mechanistic and
spectroscopic study will reveal specific factors that promote or inhibit these
processes. The straightforward synthesis of copper complexes explored in this
work will allow students with very limited synthetic experience, or none at all,
such as first year undergraduate (or even high school) students, to contribute
to the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will lay a firm foundation upon
which to assess the role of copper ions in the biological formation and
interconversion of NO, RSNOs, and HNO from naturally occurring precursors such
as hydroxylamine (H2NOH) and N-hydroxyguanidines. The heme-free approach will
illuminate roles that metal ions other than iron play in the biological
processing of nitric oxide and its molecular relatives which are involved in a
myriad of physiological events.&lt;br/&gt;
