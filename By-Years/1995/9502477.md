9502477 Leonard This grant supports a program for integrated research and
education activities that address important and challenging engineering problems
while at the same time foster a dynamic learning environment in which research
motivates and vitalizes education, and education inspires fresh ideas for
research and nurtures future leaders. The research centers on nonlinear control
of dynamical systems with reduced control authority and application to
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). The results of the research will have a
significant impact on the efficiency and reliability of AUV's which are
increasingly in demand as they are expected to play a central role in
scientific, environmental, industrial and military underwater missions. At the
same time, control of dynamical systems such as AUV's provides an exciting new
topic of research that attracts the interest of students and can be used inside
and outside the classroom to motivate fundamental learning and to introduce
undergraduate and graduate students to innovative research. The goal of the
proposed research is to develop a framework for synthesizing control laws to
govern the motion of dynamical systems which have a reduced number of
independent control inputs as compared to typical usage (also referred to as
under-actuated dynamical systems). The reduction in control authority may be the
inadvertent result of an actuator failure or the deliberate result of an
economic design choice. Accordingly, this research will provide solutions for
(1) improving system fault tolerance by exploiting built-in system redundancy
and enabling systems to adapt to changes in control authority such as an
actuator failure and (2) choosing the number and types of control actuators and
actuator configurations in control system designs to best achieve desired
performance results. The research is applicable to AUV's as well as to other
systems including spacecraft, mobile robots and vibratory actuators. ***
