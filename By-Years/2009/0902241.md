ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Komlos, Janos

Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;Title: Some problems in Arithmetic Combinatorics and Graph
Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to investigate the structure of sets
of integers without long arithmetic progressions and to extend these questions
to cosets of subspaces in finite fields. They also propose to find sharp
estimates for the size of sum-sets in various sets and for sum-product estimates
(both 2-fold and k-fold) for integers and prime fields, as well as to describe
the structure of sum-free sets. The graph theory part of the proposal contains
questions about triangle-free graphs, the Burr-Erdos Conjecture, and the Komlos-
Sos Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop new tools to
deal with some challenging and important classical problems of Discrete
Mathematics. The PIs have extensive background and experience related to these
questions, some of the advanced tools used today in Discrete Mathematics were
originally developed by the PIs. The proposed topics in additive numbers theory
and in graph theory are applicable in mathematics and the sciences, especially
in Fourier analysis and in practical algorithms, in number theory, in geometry,
in graph theory and combinatorics, and in designing and analysing efficient
computer algorithms (complexity theory). The subject of Discrete Mathematics is
the investigation of finite mathematical objects and their structures. Discrete
Mathematics is a rapidly growing area of mathematics with many theoretical and
practical applications. Arithmetic Combinatorics is a field investigating the
interplay between Number Theory and Discrete Mathematics, using deep
combinatorial and Fourier analytic methods to understand additive structures of
sets of positive integers. Graph Theory is the study of networks, modelling
connection patterns in various mathematical and applied settings.&lt;br/&gt;
