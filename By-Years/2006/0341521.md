Biological Science (61). This CCLI Educational Materials Development proof-of-
concept project addresses the need to engage forest ecology students, including
non-majors and future teachers, in activities that require critical thinking and
scientific reasoning. It does this by building inquiry-oriented materials that
approach forestry as an environmental mystery, asking students "Why are there no
middle sized trees in this well developed forest?" "How often and which species
of trees were logged?" and "How long ago was this beaver pond abandoned?" The
software automatically records and analyzes students' observations, data and
hypotheses and helps students draw inferences and revise hypotheses. The
software works on a desktop computer and on a Personal Digital Assistant so
students can record data and perform data analysis during field trips. The three
forestry cases developed are tested for their effectiveness in a variety of
post-secondary institutions and secondary schools, examining how and if inquiry
learning is supported by the materials. Evaluation includes assessment of the
software's usability and the consequent changes in student attitudes towards
scientific reasoning. This work incorporates artificial intelligence,
interactive multimedia and web-based technology in a rich, reliable and
authoritative collection of teaching materials, thereby addressing the need for
instruction appropriate to students of different learning styles and genders.
