Project ASK: Applying Student Knowledge (ASK) for Success in Computer Science is
an S-STEM project that increases the number of academically talented and
financially needy students graduating with undergraduate degrees in Computer
Science. A cohort of 20 students, composed of incumbent sophomores and transfer
students, are identified and selected to be ASK Scholars. The acronym, "ASK",
refers to the use of shared student insight into problem-solving, teamwork, and
leadership. The ASK Scholars participate in weekly workshops, seminar series,
and closely interact with the co-PIs, senior personnel and other faculty members
who provide academic advising, general guidance, leadership, professional and
research experience. The student leadership experience comes from participation
in professional student organizations as well as local and regional programming
contests. Coupled with research experience from participation in faculty
research programs and/or professional experience gathered from participation in
the existing cooperative education program, these experiences provide a basis
for overall intellectual growth and promote increased student confidence for
post-graduate employment or continued education. The use of teamwork, small
class sizes, collaboration and student-motivated question and answer sessions
positively supports recent research in the field of computer science regarding
educational impact and effective retention strategies. The effects are
professionally evaluated and disseminated to the public through academic venues.
Additionally, ASK Scholars are prepared to enter the scientific workforce or
graduate school as competent, highly trained individuals with a background in
teamwork and research.
