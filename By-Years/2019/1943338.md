Fog computing is distinguished from Cloud computing by not using resources
contained in large remote data centers, but instead leveraging computation,
storage, and network resources that are available as close to the user as
possible. These computation resources may be, for example, a part of the
communications network (Edge resources) that the user is connected to, rather
than using that network simply to connect to the Cloud. For rapid situational
awareness to first responders during large-scale disaster incidence response,
Fog computing-based response systems can be more effective than Cloud-based
systems because of this proximity. However, design of effective Fog-based
systems for disaster response is non-trivial as generic Fog computing methods
and models assume Cloud-like environment which cannot be applied for disaster
scenarios. This project proposes fundamental research, design, and development
of a Fog framework that is novel in tackling the unique challenges of Fog
resource management for disaster incidence response. These will benefit: 1)
disaster management efforts by the first responders, 2) incident response
management planning and policy makers, 3) cloud, cyber infrastructure, network
management, and future Internet research communities, and 4) faculty and
students in cloud and network management classrooms and labs. The educational
activities will help motivate and train students at Hunter College and The City
University of New York (CUNY) to pursue computer science where the student body
predominantly consists of women and first-generation college
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Fog framework will be resilient
against an unpredictable system environment and agile in provisioning resources
for mission-critical and real-time applications. The project will use a novel
sociological based organizational theory for emergency management inspired
schema to characterize the fluctuations and their impact as adversarial and
trust models. Using adversarial queuing theory, the project will shift the
paradigm from traditional long-term cloud and edge resource optimization towards
transient fog utility optimization under challenged environments. At the same
time, the project will generate genetic algorithms and deep learning algorithms
that aim to optimize fluctuation avoidance without compromising limited fog
resources. The outcomes of such optimizations in terms of algorithms will be
implemented through design and development of a software-defined fog
architecture with unified resource broker services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
data generated in this project will initially be stored in the CUNY Institute
CoSSMO data storage computer, and, after publication of the results, will be
made available through digital repositories such as FigShare.com and
drum.lib.edu. The project related algorithms and software tools will, after
publication, be made available under an open source license on GitHub.com. The
proposed Fog testbed will be made available to the broader cloud research
community through integration with NSF supported COSMOS testbed. Published
scholarly articles will be made available through web repositories such as
arXiv.org. All project related resources can be access via project

and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
