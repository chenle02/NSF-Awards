The project aims to produce a documentary film that would chronicle the return
to Antarctica after 50 years of two men who first deployed to Antarctic as part
of the original Deep Freeze missions in the late 1950's at the dawn of the
scientific era of Antartctic exploration.

Photographer Morton Beebe--who as young naval officer served as Press Officer to
Admiral George Dufek, commander of the U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze I, II and
III--and New Zealand author and journalist Geoffrey Lee Martin--who covered the
historic Commonwealth Trans Antarctic Expedition, as well as Operation Deep
Freeze and the International Geophysical Year (IGY) for The (London) Daily
Telegraph, the New Zealand Herald--will produce the film as a personal
reflection on the technological and scientific advances made in Antarctic
exploration and experimentation since the IGY.

The two will interview key researchers and scientists, reflect on their own
early expeiences on the continent, and offer insights into the critical role
that Antarctic exploration and scientific research continues to play in human
efforts to understand and cope with climate change on Earth.

The film will be produced from the perspective of two men who were involved in
Antarctic exploration during its infancy with the intent of educating young
people about the changes that have taken place between the IGY and the recently
completed International Polar Year (IPY).

The film is designed to reach an audience that is largely made up of younger
generations who increasingly get their information from the web and from
television specials aimed at delivering a large amount of information in a
relatively short period of time.
