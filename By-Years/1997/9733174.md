The focus of this research is the elucidation of the calcium binding properties
and domain organization of calbindin D28K, a protein abundant in specific
nervous tissue and one of the larger EF-hand members, containing six putative
EF-hands. The strategy involves the synthesis of each EF-hand as a 33-residue
peptide sequence, which can then be characterized individually or in
combinations with other EF-hands. Methodology for the for connecting the EF-
hands to provide fragments comprising more than one EF-hand is also described.
The focus of the educational activities involves the the education of students
through laboratory experience and through course and curriculum development in
organic chemistry. With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and
educational activities of Dr. Karin S. Akerfeldt of the Department of Chemistry
at Rutgers University, Camden. Professor Akerfeldt will focus her research
efforts on protein structure-function relationship studies using a synthetic
approach that will delineate calcium binding properties and domain organization
of the EF-hand proteins. This class of proteins is present in eukaryotes and is
involved in a vast number of physiological processes. Dr. Akerfeldt's
educational activities are involved with course and curriculum development.
