Interest in glycoproteins arises from their central role in biological
recognition and their highly specific antigenicity. A series of cyclic
glycopeptides will be synthesized and their structural characteristics
determined using circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The nature of the interaction between
the peptide backbone of the protein and the carbohydrate will be investigated.
These studies should enlarge our knowledge of glycoprotein specificity and the
role of glycoproteins antigenicity and other biological recognition phenomena.
