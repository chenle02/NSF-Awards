9320728 Engel This research investigates real exchange rate behavior in several
industrial countries. The main objective is to get a better understanding of
which of the real exchange rate theories explain the movements of relative
prices. The study uses a large data set covering a wide range of goods and
countries. The data take into account transportation costs, marketing costs, and
industry structure. In the empirical work, the investigator proposes a series of
econometric tests that would allow him to examine whether his earlier findings,
that the variability of the relative prices of some goods across countries is
larger than the variability of relative prices within a country, holds when the
additional factors alluded to above are taken into account. The results from the
project are of considerable interest because they will provide a valuable
contribution to the empirical real exchange rate literature. Also, the results
may have ramifications for how relative price behavior is expected to change
under European and North American market integration. ***
