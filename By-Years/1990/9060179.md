A catalyst system consisting of highly dispersed gold on a titanium suboxide is
being developed. This is intended for use in an electrochemical hydrogen
peroxide generator that also employs gas diffusion electrode technology. The new
system will be lower cost and require much less power for operation than present
state-of-the-art peroxide generators. On-site generation of hydrogen peroxide is
already used in many industries, including paper, textiles, and chemicals. In
addition, a lower-cost generator would be attractive for many other
applications, including water disinfection, that currently use environmentally
undesirable oxidizers.
