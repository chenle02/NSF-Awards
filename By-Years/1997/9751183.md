The curriculum of the Chemistry Department is improved by introducing a new set
of material-science experiments in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
atomic force microscopy (AFM) into the Physical Chemistry laboratory thereby
significantly enhancing the education and training of graduates. Materials
science, a relatively new, very important, and rapidly developing
interdisciplinary field of science remains, for the most part, unexplored at the
undergraduate level of instruction at this and most other institutions. Recent
developments make STM and AFM affordable and accessible to the undergraduate
laboratory and thereby provide the department with a straightforward method for
teaching the fundamentally important concept of quantum mechanical tunneling and
related STM and AFM technologies of piezoelectric positioning, vibration
isolation, etc. This new set of experiments is incorporated in the Physical
Chemistry laboratory, a gateway course for undergraduate chemistry majors. The
curriculum also includes an American Chemical Society certified option in
materials science. This equipment is the cornerstone of a materials science
laboratory within the Chemistry Department. These courses can eventually support
the university's materials program in the Mechanical Engineering Department. *
