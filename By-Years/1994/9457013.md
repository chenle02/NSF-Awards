9457013 El-Halwagi This is an NSF Young Investigator Award (NYI) for research
which focuses on waste reduction though chemical process synthesis. This
approach provides a systematic framework to efficiently tackle pollution-
prevention problems. In order to address the problem of waste recovery through
recycle/reuse units, the PI has introduced several new problems and developed
tool for designing recycle/reuse systems. These concepts include the synthesis
of mass-exchange networks, "MENS", membrane-hybrid systems and heat-induced
separation networks "HISENS". A wide spectrum of separation technologies for
waste management (e.g. adsorption, absorption, solvent extraction, ion exchange,
reverse osmosis, pervaporation, condensation, crystallization and drying) can be
tackled through these design tools. Economic and environmental benefits can also
accrue as a result of using these design tools. The PI's teaching objective is
to prepare a new generation of practicing engineers who are familiar with waste-
reduction design tools and concepts. The PI has been working on incorporation
systematic tools for the optimal design of environmentally-acceptable plants
into the curriculum. In addition to teaching these concepts in the classroom,
the PI has started to write a textbook on "Systematic Design Tools for Pollution
Prevention". The book contains various educational tools and industrial
applications on the design and assessment of environmentally-acceptable chemical
plants. ***
