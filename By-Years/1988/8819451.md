The proposed work has four aims: (1) to use the mathematical scheme of
orthogonal operators to analyze experimental data on energy levels of atoms,
identifying the effects that atomic states belonging to different configurations
have on one another; (2) to use group theory methods to develop higher
dimensional analogs of angular momentum, so that N electron systems can be
treated as through they consisted of four quasi-particles with no statistical
constraints; (3) to develop a self-consistent complex coordinate method to study
lifetimes of decaying atomic states; and (4) to study non-linear processes in
the interactions of intense electromagnetic fields and atoms.
