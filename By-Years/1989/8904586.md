This proposal examines how legged animals move on land. By studying the
energetics and mechanics of a diverse group of animals, the findings will: 1)
provide the general "rules" that animals follow for terrestrial locomotion; 2)
aid in delineating the various ways in which muscles have been engineered; 3)
lead to new questions in the integrated control of locomotion based on whole
animal mechanics; 4) supply much needed data for ecological models focusing on
the genetics and developmental aspects of locomotion; and 6) help reconstruct
the origins of legged terrestrial locomotion. The applied benefits of the
research include: 1) new designs for micro-machines and robots; 2) improvements
on the design of vehicular legged-walking machines; and 3) generation of useful
metabolic data for environmental impact studies and pest management.
