This research program is focused on three inter-related questions concerning
regulation of muscle contraction: the molecular basis for calcium-dependent
control by myosin, the role of protein phosphorylation and filament architecture
in regulating long-lasting contractions, and the structure and dynamics of the
calcium-pumping protein assembly in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. In each
case, the goal is to relate the detailed structure and properties of individual
protein molecules to the architecture and dynamics of the native protein
assemblies in muscle. Drs. Vibert and Cohen have established that certain
invertebrate muscles are especially suitable for these investigations, and that
their structural and regulatory properties are of general significance for
contraction in many muscle types, including those of vertebrates. In the next
phase of this program, application of advanced methods of electron microscopy -
especially cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified samples - should provide images
of higher resolution and fidelity than have been produced in the past. Coupled
with the use of proteins altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and of specific
antibodies, these structural approaches should allow them to integrate findings
at the molecular level into a picture of regulation in whole muscle. Knowledge
of the structure and switching of the protein assemblies that regulate muscle
contraction involves understanding inter-related control systems at a higher
level of organization than any yet achieved.
