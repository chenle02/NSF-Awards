0121354&lt;br/&gt;Van Veen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characterization of propagation
in the near THz band has been limited to scalar absorption measurements having
low spectral resolution. As with cellular and PCS bands, this level of knowledge
is grossly inadequate to assess communication system performance and design. The
PIs will perform initial measurements and modeling of transmission, multipath
scattering, and fading effects in the near-THz band to set the stage for a more
comprehensive proposal and effort to develop communications techniques that
exploit the unique and substantial opportunity this band offers. The proposed
measurements will help them identify suitable environments and ranges for
communication using the near THz band. They also expect to gain insight on the
nature of transmitter and receiver structures that will be required to obtain
acceptable performance.&lt;br/&gt;
