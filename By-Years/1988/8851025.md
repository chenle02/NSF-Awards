Mentor scientists from industry and academia, secondary school science
teachers, and museum educators and exhibit designers will collaborate to develop
and implement a new student science research and public demonstration program.
In a two year pilot program 30 teachers and 60 students will be paired with the
mentors, predominantly active private sector researchers, to allow each student
to develop and carry out a research project. Project topics will be chosen to
relate to the museum's unique regional emphasis on the Thames River Basin while
simultaneously matching student/teacher interests and mentor expertise. Each
student will be involved for a two-year period. During the first year, she/he
will focus on developing and completing the project, which will be monitored by
the teacher and guided by the mentor, who will provide technical guidance and
facility/equipment support. In the second year the student will work with museum
staff preparing materials and explaining/demonstrating her/his project for
public and school audiences. Project M. E. is designed as a demonstration of how
a regional science museum can bring together students, teachers, and the private
sector to enhance science education for students and promote public
understanding of science and technology. Cost sharing by the partners will total
20% of the NSF funding.
