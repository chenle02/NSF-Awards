Abstract A closed-loop hydraulic loading and electronic data acquisition system
will be acquired. The system will provide the the capability to conduct load-
controlled or displacement-controlled tests on structural materials and
structural members under static, cyclic, or dynamic loading conditions. The data
acquisition system will be used in conjunction with the hydraulic loading system
and will allow for the simultaneous monitoring of eighty channels of data
(strain, load, displacement, etc.). The equipment requested represents a
significant upgrade from the testing systems currently used by the PIs. The
current loading system is limited to static testing, and load can be applied but
not controlled via the manual open-loop system. Current data acquisition
equipment is limited in scanning speed and precision, and cannot accommodate
dynamic testing.

The College of Engineering is implementing a seven year strategic plan, and
Structural Engineering is categorized as a thrust area on which emphasis will be
placed with respect to support and development of infrastructure. In conjunction
with this plan, a new 9500 square foot experimental laboratory for research and
teaching in structural engineering is scheduled to open on campus in 2004. The
testing system requested in this proposal was designed with this in mind, as the
equipment will be usable in both the existing laboratory and the new facility.
The systems designed are also easily upgradeable to accommodate long-term needs.

Through a variety of mechanismsl, undergraduates will have the opportunity to
use the requested equipment to conduct research. Underrepresented groups will
benefit as a result of the continued commitment the College of Engineering
toward providing opportunities for these groups in engineering education.
