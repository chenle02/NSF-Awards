With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Scott R. Gilbertson, of the Department of Chemistry at Washington University, is
studying the synthesis of P,N-based ligands for application in catalytic
asymmetric reactions. Professor Gilbertson is developing synthetic routes for
new phosphine-oxazoline ligands which are chiral at phosphorus and position the
phosphorus at the bridgehead of a [2.2.1] bicyclic ring system. In order to
expand the range of accessible chiral ligands containing P-C bonds, Gilbertson
explores the catalytic conversion of vinyl tosylates to vinylphosphines and
thence to new ligands. New ligands are screened for their ability to assist in
the catalysis of a mechanistically diverse range of reactions, including
palladium catalyzed pi allyl addition, the Heck reaction, asymmetric
hydroboration, and rhodium catalyzed [4+2] cycloisomerization.

Many of the organic compounds discovered to possess desirable properties (e.g.,
as pharmaceutical compounds) exist in two forms, related to one another as a
right hand is to a left - i.e., as mirror images. Not infrequently, only one
such isomer of a compound will display the desirable properties, while the other
is at best an inactive contaminant and at worst displays harmful activity. The
development of new techniques for the selective synthesis of only a desired
compound and not its mirror image remains a crucial area for investigation. With
the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Scott
R. Gilbertson, of the Department of Chemistry at Washington University, is
developing novel classes of compounds designed to function, together with
various metal ions, as catalysts for a variety of reactions affording such
selectivity.
