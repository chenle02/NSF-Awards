The mechanism for differential evaluation of men and women judges has not been
specified. This project hypotheses that implicit bias could shape the evaluation
of judges in judicial performance evaluations. Implicit bias mobilizes people's
images of who should be holding a position, allowing non-normative people in a
position to be evaluated more harshly because they do not fit a stereotype.
People may unconsciously penalize judges who do not fit the normative image of a
judge. They may frame their evaluations of certain characteristics like
courteousness, knowledge, and efficiency based on stereotypes, for example.
Unconscious bias would result in lower scores for women and minority judges in
judicial performance evaluations, regardless the race and gender of their
evaluators. Previous research has not evaluated discrepancies in performance
evaluation scores controlling for objective measures of job performance. This
project assembles data from judicial performance evaluations across 10 states.
It compares the scores of female and minority judges with those of their white
male counterparts. It also looks at the relationship between the gender/race gap
in scores and the gender and race of those who are evaluating the judges. The
results will contribute to understanding whether implicit bias could be a factor
in assessing public officials. &lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to
improving measures of performance of judges, important in the accountability of
public officials. The investigator will make the resulting data base on judicial
performance evaluations available to judges, policy makers, researchers and
state judicial performance commissions. The investigator will also present the
information to the public in an interactive website. The investigator will also
share a summary of best practices for performance evaluations with policymakers,
allowing them to revise performance evaluations based in empirical data.
