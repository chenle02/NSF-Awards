The investigators will develop and test profiling floats capable of following
currents in the Arctic Ocean at a discrete depth or on a level of constant
density. The floats will be flexible in what part of the water column they
sample. In late summer, when leads are plentiful, the floats will rise to the
surface to transmit the stored data via satellite, after which they may descend
for another year's mission, repeating this cycle for up to 3-5 years. During the
period of this grant, float and telemetry techniques will be tested as part of
the pan-Arctic Beringia 2005 cruise. The development and field test will be a
proof of concept, and upon success, will lead the way to future developments of
floats throughout the Arctic Ocean for the International Polar Year and
beyond.&lt;br/&gt;
