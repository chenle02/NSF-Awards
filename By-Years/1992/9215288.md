This grant is for support of the 1992 Soft-X-Ray Projection Lithography Topical
Meeting in Monterey, CA, 6-8 April 1992. Soft- X-Ray projection lithography is a
leading candidate technology for the fabrication of integrated circuits and
electronic and optoelectronic devices with design rules reaching ultimately
below 0.1 um. This topical meeting will highlight recent advances in critical
component technologies, such as in areas of soft-x-ray optical design, optical
component fabrication and characterization, imaging, multilayer reflective
coatings, sources, resists, registration and alignment systems, mask technology,
system integration and IC process engineering. The first meeting on this subject
was held last year at the beginning of major funding of this program by DARPA
and DOC. The support requested from NSF would be used to enable students and
postdocs field working in this field who have submitted contributed papers to
attend the meeting and present their work. This is an important emerging
technology, and the requested use of NSF funds for student and postdoc support
will be very effective in enhancing the base of trained researchers in the
field.
