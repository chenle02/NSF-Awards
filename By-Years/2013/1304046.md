Funds are provided for participant support for the 4th annual Snowbird Workshop
on Particle Astrophysics, Astronomy, and Cosmology (SnowPAC 2013), organized by
the Department of Physics and Astronomy of The University of Utah. The award
will support participation (via lodging cost subsidy) by 20 individuals who
would otherwise be unable to attend the meeting, with a particular emphasis on
broadening participation by junior researchers and groups traditionally
underrepresented in astronomy and astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SnowPAC
workshop is an international meeting that reviews recent developments in
particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, astronomy, and cosmology. It
seeks to establish new connections between these disciplines and establish new
collaborative ties between individuals working in these research
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main SnowPAC 2013 conference will be a topical
conference on "Black Hole Fingerprints: Dynamics, Disruptions &amp;
Demographics." This conference will combine an exploration of our current
knowledge of black hole demographics with a discussion of the future promise of
using tidal disruption events to expand our knowledge of the populations of
black holes in galaxies. This conference will be followed by a smaller SnowDARK
2013 workshop focusing on non-WIMP dark matter candidates.
