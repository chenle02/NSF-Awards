NOx reduction over metal oxide catalysts in the presence of ammonia is a proven
technology which has reached the commercial stage. So called selective catalytic
reduction is not however without its problems including high cost, short life,
and high disposal costs as spent catalyst is regulated as a hazardous waste.
Coal ash is chemically similar to metal oxide catalyst systems containing
significant amount os titania, vanadia, as well as iron oxide, silica, and
alumina, and other pertinent constituents. Many of these constituents have
demonstrated catalytic activity in the presence of ammonia. Coal ash is
plentiful, and inexpensive, and although it is expected to have lower surface
area and catalytic activity, its low cost allows thousands of times higher
catalyst loading and replacement. In addition, disposal is regulated as a non-
hazardous waste. The proposal work concerns the quantification of NOx reduction
activity of ammonia over coal ash in a bench scale fluid bed apparatus. A fluid
bed would allow easy replacement of deactivated catalyst in a commercial
scenario.
