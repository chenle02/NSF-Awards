The University of Pennsylvania will continue its four-week,
residential/commuter Young Scholars project in Biology, Mathematics and Computer
Science for 54 students entering grades 10 and 11. Participants are involved in
biology-related laboratory projects, directed by University faculty and assisted
by undergraduate students, and attend related lectures on DNA, hemoglobin,
hormone binding and the nervous system. Mathematics classes and problem- solving
sessions taught by University faculty explore current areas of research
including topology, networks, fractals, exponential growth and decay,
probability and combinatorics. In Computer Lab, also taught by University
faculty, students learn elements of Pascal and work on developing algorithms to
solve challenging problems.
