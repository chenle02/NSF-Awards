9522764 Wark This grant provides $52,145 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading a JEOL 733 electron microprobe (EMP) with a PC-based computer control
system, a new Be window for the energy dispersive spectrometer, digital X-ray
imaging software and two crystals for wavelength dispersive analyses. This
upgrade will allow these PI's to continue and improve their high quality an
often innovative research in igneous and metamorphic petrology, for which the
analytical capabilities of their EMP is of fundamental importance. Specifically,
the upgrades will facilitate improved ability for spot analyses of light
elements and generation of two- dimensional element distribution maps. ***
