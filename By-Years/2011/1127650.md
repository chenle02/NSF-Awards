This award supports participants to EAAI-11, The Second Symposium on Educational
Advances in Artificial Intelligence. EAAI-11 will be collocated with the Twenty-
fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-11), to be held August
7-11, in San Francisco. EAAI-11 provides a venue for researchers and educators
to discuss pedagogical issues and share resources related to teaching artificial
intelligence (AI) and using AI in education across a variety of curricular
levels (K-12 through postgraduate training), with a natural emphasis on
undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning. The EAAI symposium will seek
and disseminate contributions, such as model assignments, syllabi, projects, and
ready-to-adopt materials for teaching AI, address how to more effectively teach
AI in multi-disciplinary contexts involving subjects like biology or economics,
and how themes from AI can be used generally to enhance education and engagement
of students in Computer Science and STEM disciplines. EAAI will include a
session "How AI and AI education can improve CS education and outreach."
