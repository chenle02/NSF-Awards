This award is for renewed support of the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at
Harvard University under the direction of Henry Ehrenreich. The MRL is comprised
of 21 faculty members from the Division of Applied Sciences and the Departments
of Chemistry and Physics. The research program concentrates on collaborative,
multidisciplinary efforts in major thrust areas; in addition, outstanding ideas
from individual investigators are eligible for seed support. The MRL helps new
faculty embark on MRL-related projects and supports central experimental
facilities needed for a wide range of materials research activity on campus.
There are research links with other MRL's and with industrial and government
laboratories. There are 22 graduate students and 8 postdoctoral research
associates in the program. A research program of expanded scope concentrated in
three major thrust areas is planned. The thrust on structural and electronic
transformations in solids includes studies of phase transitions, diffusion
processes and crystal growth mechanisms in a variety of systems, and an
increased emphasis on electronic transitions. Activities in the area of thin
films, surfaces and interfaces include the intensive development of experimental
facilities, the pursuit of interdisciplinary projects involving chemistry and
physics, and planning for a surface facility to be operated jointly with the MRL
at MIT. Collaborative efforts on thin films, wetting, adhesion, reconstruction
and an expanded program of surface studies are proposed. The thrust on
micromechanics has two major components, one directed towards a theoretical
understanding of structural ceramics and the other, a collaborative effort with
the MIT MRL and research groups in government and industry, addressing
innovations in the technology of high-strength steels. The research quality in
this MRL is outstanding, and the need to work collaboratively in order to make
progress on major problems is driving most of the research proposed. The MRL
management at Harvard is successfully fostering multidisciplinary, interactive
research on the part of the faculty, and the resulting research environment for
students and postdoctoral associates is superb. Strong links to industrial and
government laboratories and to ther MRL's are highly beneficial. Central
facilities are adequate and future plans for further development of the research
facilities are very promising. This award will allow expanded scope of the MRL
research program to the three thrust areas, provide seed funding for outstanding
bew research, and provide strong continuing support for the central facilities,
with particular emphasis on the interaction with MIT in the operation of new
facilities.
