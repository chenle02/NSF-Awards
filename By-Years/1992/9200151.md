This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning April 1992, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research. Each
participant will work with an individual faculty member who has an active
research program in an area of interest to the student. Participants may choose
from at least eighteen projects in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic,
and physical chemistry. Participants will learn by work on their own project,
and by observation of other members of their research group, how to attack a
research problem from design through execution and interpretation of
experiments. Projects are designed to give the undergraduate scholar maximum
flexibility in their experimental approach and will allow an individual to work
as independently as he/she is capable of. Regular research conferences and oral
presentations (two during the ten weeks) will serve to acquaint every
participant with the nature of all of the other projects and provide a basis for
individual discussions throughout the summer.
