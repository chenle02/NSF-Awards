This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Analysis, Complex Geometry, and Mathematical Physics" that will be
held on May 7-11, 2013, on the campus of the University of Columbia.

The conference will serve as an occasion to celebrate the achievements and
impacts of the mathematician D.H. Phong, who has worked on a wide range of
fields within analysis, complex geometry and mathematical physics. Major themes
of the conference include the complex Monge-Ampere equation, the Ricci flow,
canonical metrics in geometry and integrable structures in modern mathematical
physics. There will be 30 speakers in the five days of the conference, each of
them experts in analysis, complex geometry and/or mathematical physics. The list
of well-known and distinguished mathematicians will help the conference attract
a large number of participants from all over the US. It is proposed that
priority for travel funding will be given to graduate students, other junior
mathematicians and those from underrepresented groups. The conference will be
widely advertised to attract a diverse and broad spectrum of participation.
