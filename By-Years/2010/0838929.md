The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) was established in 1990 as a
non-governmental international membership organization that encourages and
facilitates cooperation in Arctic research. Today IASC has 18 member countries,
including the United States. This award provides support for the Principal
Investigator to represent the U.S. Arctic science community in IASC. The Polar
Research Board, under the U.S. National Academies, functions as the oversight
committee for U.S. representation in IASC. The U.S. National Academies appointed
Dr. Grebmeier as the U.S. Delegate to IASC in March 2006. As a Delegate, Dr.
Grebmeier will convey the goals of the U.S. science community in international
science planning efforts. It is vital to have representation in IASC at this
critical time. The organization is responding to an external review that called
for heightened transparency, greater visibility, inclusion of early career
scientists, and enhanced interaction with international governmental bodies such
as the Arctic Council.
