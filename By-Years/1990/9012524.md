The primary goal of the RIDGE initiative is to understand the interlinked
geophysical, geochemical and geobiological causes and consequences of energy
transfer within the global ridge system through time. A key facet of this
program involves providing strong support for theoretical integration of field
and laboratory studies of ridge-crest processes. The purpose ofthe Summer
Institute is to provide an environment of progresson critical theorectical RIDGE
problems that require an inter- disciplinary approach. Topics for the Summer
Institute will reflect the range of disciplines comprised by the RIDGE
initiative. The topic for 1990 is mantle flow, melt generation, and lithospheric
deformation at ridge crests. The Institute will consist of a short course open
to all interested parties, and an intensive two-week workshop for approximately
30 researchers and students. The RIDGE Summer Institute represents a unique
contribution offered by the RIDGE initiative to integrate theoretical, sea-
going, and laboratory-based components of the community involed in ridge-crest
research.
