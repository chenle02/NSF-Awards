9361836 Bachalo Funded by an SBIR Phase 1 grant, research will be conducted on a
novel atomizer primarily for oil-fired burners. The atomizer is based on
evervescent atomization, is which air is introduced into the bulk fuel flow in
the atomizer nozzle. This concept differs form earlier research with evervescent
breakup of a liquid through differences in various details of the configuration.
The research will be useful for scaling up the atomizer for practical boiler
combustion, and through an increased understanding of evervescent atomization.
