PI will establish the first systematic analysis of northern Gondwana (North
Africa-Morocco) Devonian nautiloid cephalopods within the existing conodont and
ammonoid biostratigraphic framework. These data will provide the necessary
foundation 1) to establish correlation between four of the major marine groups
of the Devonian (nautiloid and ammonoid cephalopods, trilobites, and conodonts),
2) to help elucidate the temporal tie to coeval fish (members of the Placodermi,
Chondrichtyes and Osteichthyes) and thus provide a better understanding of
pelagic marine dynamics, 3) to understand more clearly evolutionary
perturbations of Devonian "events" by providing a detailed analysis of a third
group of augment conodont and ammonoid data, and 4) to allow, for the first
time, a definitive comparison to be made between faunas of that portion of
Gondwana juxtaposed to the southern margin of Euramerica (Baltica + Laurentia)
and those of western Australia and China, the only other regions of Gondwana
with low latitude basins containing abundant nautiloid cephalopods. This last
aspect is especially important in the continuing assessment of paleogeographic
reconstructions on the basis of biostratigraphic and biogeographic data. This
work will be done in conjunction with ongoing ammonoid projects of Michael House
(Univ. Southhampton, UK) and Thomas Becker (Free University, Berlin) in North
Africa and Australia and an existing mapping project in the Meseta, Anti-Atlas
and Tindouf regions of Morocco under the direction of the Royal Maroc Division
de la Geologie Generale (Ministere de L'Energie et des Mines).
