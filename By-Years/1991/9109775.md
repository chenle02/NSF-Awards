Functions of the nerve growth cone will be analyzed at the molecular level, in
particular, processes involved in motility and plasmalemmal growth. The proteins
associated with three different membrane subfactions of growth cones,
plasmalemmal precursor vesicles, large dense-core vesicles and the plasmalemma
will be analyzed. To study membrane-cytoskeletal interactions and their
regulation, the cytoskeletal ligand for the proto- oncogene product, pp60c-src,
and a pp60csrc-associated membrane phosphoprotein will be characterized. These
studies promise to provide new insights into the mechanisms that direct nervous
system assembly during development.
