This award will support collaborative research in atomic physics between Dr.
Thomas Morgan, Wesleyan University and Dr. Francois Wuilleumier, Laboratoire de
Spectroscopie Atomique et Ionique, Orsay, France. The investigators propose a
series of experiments for the study of the photoionization of laser-excited
atoms and the photoionization of singly and doubly-charged atoms. Information on
the properties of ions, their structure and interactions with atoms, other ions
and radiation, is important for the plasma and astrophysical sciences. In this
project, synchrotron radiation in conjunction with laser excited ions will be
used to probe the structure of atomic systems and the dynamics of the
interactions of photons with excited atoms and charged particles. Dr. Morgan
will have access to the SUPER-ACO, the world's first third generation
synchrotron radiation facility, which is just being commissioned in France. Dr.
Wuilleumier, the French investigator, is a pioneer in the use of synchrotron
radiation in atomic physics; his Orsay lab is internationally recognized.
Results of this research will be of value for the understanding of the structure
and dynamics of excited atoms and ions in the free state.
