La Selva Biological Station, a lowland tropical rain forest site in Costa Rica,
is playing a pivotal role in the United States` effort to understand and help
conserve the rapidly disappearing ecosystems of the world's wet tropics. The
station combines advanced analytical lab facilities with an unrivaled spectrum
of habitats, including large areas available for experimental studies. Findings
from the last two decades make La Selva one of the best understood tropical
sites worldwide. As the station has offered increasing support to scientists,
research has intensified and diversified dramatically - extending from a strong
base of systematics and evolutionary ecology into ecosystem studies,
physiological ecology, soil science, molecular biology, and atmospheric
chemistry. La Selva is now poised to support key work in important areas such as
global change, land use in the tropics, and biodiversity. This project is to
create complementary resources to greatly increase La Selva`s ability to advance
tropical science. An integrated database management and geographic information
system will unite and make available the wealth of information from past and
ongoing studies. This will be an intellectual research catalyst of the highest
order.
