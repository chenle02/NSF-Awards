In response to the COVID-19 national emergency, many Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site programs have cancelled their programs for the summer
2020 due to a lack of housing and travel restrictions. Some REU sites that are
funded by the Division of Ocean Sciences have created virtual internships for
students who will be able to access and analyze data remotely. The University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) will organize an on-line
professional development workshop that is designed to support about sixty
undergraduates and faculty mentors who are participating in virtual REU
internships during the summer 2020. This professional development workshop
series will ensure that students who are participating in the virtual
internships have the professional development opportunities that are normally
part of an in-person REU program.

This project will support a workshop series that will focus on two topics. 1.
Student Professional Development: providing a series of weekly professional
development seminars for students participating in the virtual REUs. These
seminars will serve the dual purpose of developing a sense of cohort amongst
students, and 2. Faculty Support and Materials: supporting faculty mentors in
preparing to run a virtual REU, providing faculty with seminars on facilitating
professional development topics, and providing some webinar recordings and
materials for guided student activities. The project will also be a model for
future virtual internship programs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
