A currently working prototype system will be extended to develop a computerized
view of metabolic reactions that includes viewpoints onto metabolic reactions
that are difficult or impossible to achieve with existing textbook or wall-chart
representations. The system will include the ability to search enzymatic
reactions by chemical groups, provide lists of all potential inhibitory sites of
a compound, and graphically output any desired segment of known biochemical
pathways. The system will provide varied access paths to information about
metabolism by removing artificial limits to thinking imposed by fixed printed
implementations currently available. The system is expected to serve the needs
of a wide variety of researchers interested in biochemical pathways, as well as
providing an educational tool for students at every level of expertise.
