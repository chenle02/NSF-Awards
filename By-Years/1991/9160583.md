This research effort is dedicated to the development of an accurate instrument
for the monitoring of temperature of molten glass. The sensor is based on the
phenomenon called the Christiansen effect. This is a phenomenon, exhibited by
glass, where the scattering and reflection of electromagnetic radiation
disappears. Thus if the radiance of a material at the Christiansen frequency is
measured, the temperature of the surface of the material can be obtained. By
utilizing shorter wavelengths, the depth of penetration into the material can be
increased and a temperature profile of the bulk of the material can be obtained
by measuring the radiance. This low-cost, accurate sensor will offer significant
benefits to the glass manufacturing processes, by improving their ability to
control the manufacturing process. It will enable the industry to improve
quality and throughput while potentially reducing the energy use in the process.
The competitiveness of the domestic industry will be enhanced as a result.
