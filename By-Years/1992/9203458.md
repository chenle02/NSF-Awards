The nature of hydrothermal venting through submarine ridges on the Juan de Fuca
Ridge will be characterized and quantified using profiles of sediment pore-water
chemistry from the very thin sediment that partially covers the outcrops. The
outcrops will be photographed to determine whether visible vents and biological
communities are present. Samples of rock,m indurated sediment and hydrothermal
precipitates will be taken. Any hydrothermal discharge to the overlying water
column presumably will be delineated.
