This project continues investigation of automatic generation of proofs of
theorems in geometry. The emphasis is on short and proofs. For this, the newly
discovered area method and new methods based on other geometrical concepts, such
as full angles and trigonometric functions, are being developed. Extension of
these techniques are being sought to geometric inequalities as well as to non-
Euclidean and higher- dimensional geometries. The techniques are being
implemented in a system with a sophisticated graphics display.
