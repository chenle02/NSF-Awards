Algebraic geometry is concerned with the study of geometric properties of
objects that can be defined algebraically. Such objects, called algebraic
varieties, are very special and have a rich structure. Consequently, techniques
from other fields of mathematics, such as Arithmetic, Topology, and Differential
Geometry, are employed in their study. Within algebraic geometry, this project
studies the geometry of moduli spaces. A moduli space is the space of all shapes
of objects with prescribed numerical invariants. The study of moduli spaces is
of central importance to several branches of mathematics and theoretical
physics. In particular, over the past three decades there were deep cross-
influences between Mathematics and Physics centered around a special class of
algebraic varieties, the Calabi-Yau threefolds, and their moduli. One of the
main thrusts of this project is the development of tools for the study of moduli
spaces of Calabi-Yau varieties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the
moduli spaces are studied from the perspective of period maps. The period map is
an essential tool for understanding the geometry of the moduli space of abelian
varieties and K3 surfaces. Beyond these classical cases, the investigation of
the period maps is much more difficult due to some non-trivial and highly
transcendental conditions (the Griffiths' transversality conditions) satisfied
by the Variations of Hodge Structure arising in the geometric setting.
Nonetheless, recent progress in the field makes possible the investigation of
some non-classical situations, especially surfaces of general type with small
invariants, and Calabi-Yau threefolds. In a different direction, several
questions about the geometry of the moduli space of K3 surfaces and hyper-
Kaehler manifolds are investigated by means of period
maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
