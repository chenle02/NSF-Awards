In macroeconomics, there are two primary intellectual benchmarks used to analyze
the effects of imposing taxes versus running a bond financed deficit to support
a given level of government expenditure. The Ricardian proposition is that
economic agents view current bond financed deficits as future tax liabilities
and hold bonds in anticipation of these future taxes. In this case the demand
for government bonds always matches government borrowing, so the way the
government deficit is financed does not matter, i.e., has no real effects. The
other position, typically associated with Keynes, holds that deficit financed
tax cuts raise disposable income. As a result, deficits lead to high real
interest rates, and crowd out private capital formation. The purpose of this ROW
planning grant is to plan and conduct laboratory experiments to test the
assumptions underlying the Ricardian proposition. Specifically, the investigator
will determine which of three existing theoretical constructs to use in her
analysis of the Ricardian proposition: an overlapping generations model, an
asset pricing model, or a game theoretic model. She will design experiments to
test the Ricardian proposition and conduct four pilot experiments. This project
could make a significant contribution to the debate about the economic effects
of government deficits. The theoretical and empirical problems encountered in
past research suggest that the type of controlled laboratory experiments
undertaken in this project should provide very useful results.
