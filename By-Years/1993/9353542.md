The New York Hall of Science requests a grant over three years to develop a
non-urban program and 18 first generation replications across the country of our
teacher training and equipment rental astronomy program, STARLAB. The project
builds on STARLAB's proven success here in New York and in urban sites trained
through our collaboration with the Lawrence Hall of Science. The target audience
include traditionally underrespresented, ethnically and economically diverse
groups. In modelling and initiating the first round of replications in non-urban
settings nationwide, the program recognizes the needs of a majority of the
nation's school children whose education takes place outside of our urban
centers.
