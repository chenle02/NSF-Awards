Many data-intensive systems, such as commercial or scientific database systems,
store vast amounts of data. Some metrics (e.g., performance) of answering user
queries on stored data can be improved by using derived data, such as indexes or
materialized views. The goal of this project is to develop an extensible
framework for designing and using derived data in answering database queries
efficiently. The outcomes of the project are expected to be general and
independent of a specific data model (e.g., relational or XML), while giving
guarantees with respect to query-performance improvement.

The approach consists of developing and evaluating mathematical models and
algorithms for designing and using views and indexes for common types of queries
on relational and XML data. The techniques will be experimentally evaluated
using an open-source implementation of a database-management systems, on
synthetic and real relational and XML databases. Expected outcomes of the
project include automated tuning of data-access characteristics in a variety of
applications, thus enhancing the quality of user interactions with data-
intensive systems.

The PI will develop and disseminate practical solutions to the problem. Expected
outcomes of the project include sequences of research-oriented exercises that
would increase novelty and excitement in the curriculum and enhance learning
experience for students. By working on the proposed project, the diverse body of
students at NCSU will obtain a unique set of skills that will position them
competitively in the modern workplace.

The PI will make the results of the project widely available, including software
she will develop.
