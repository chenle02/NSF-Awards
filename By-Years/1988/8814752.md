Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and more on computers
that are capable of handling sophisticated simulations, data analysis and
graphics software. The need to accomodate multiple users on a single laboratory
computer and multiple uses on a single chemistry department facility can be met
by a single solution: individual work stations for the majority of user needs
and, for the remainder, ready access to other types of work stations and,
ultimately, to a minisupercomputer. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to acquire, maintain and operate a multi-
access core computing facility. The areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) The chemistry of transition metal
complexes in binucleating macrocycles 2) The use of X-ray diffraction to examine
productive enzyme-substrate complexes 3) The chemistry of organometallic
compounds containing multiple metal-carbon bonds 4) Asymmetric synthesis 5)
Interactions in large molecular arrays and aggregates 6) Dynamics of small
polyatomic molecules in highly excited vibrational states 7) Modelling of
modified semiconductor surfaces.
