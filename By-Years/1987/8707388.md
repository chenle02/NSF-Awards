Mylonites form from rock flour ground up along faults. The rocks have received
a good deal of study but progress has been difficult because of their fine,
almost impalpable grain size. There is considerable current interest in
mylonites not only because they may yield information on earthquake mechanisms
but also because old faults may act as deep conduits for the flow of metamorphic
and hydrothermal fluids. The proposed research includes: (1) determination of
the sizes of domains over which chemical and isotopic equilibrium is achieved in
mylonites; (2) measurement of reaction progress and chemical metasomatism to
estimate fluid-rock ratios; and (3) adapting Rb-Sr and U-Pb isotopic methods to
dating mylonitization. These methodologies will be applied to mylonites from the
Brevard fault zone, Georgia, the Hope Valley sheartone, Connecticut, and the
Borrega Springs mylonite zone, California. The comparison of detailed studies of
mylonites from a variety of P-T fluid environments should make it possible to
isolate important factors controlling the development of mylonites.
