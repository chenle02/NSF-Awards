Over 70,000 students take organic chemistry each year in the USA with attrition
rates approaching 50% at some institutions. The obstacles to success in organic
chemistry are both the large amount of material that students are required to
learn and more importantly the unfamiliar style of problem solving and
assessment. The project has developed a method of instruction based on problem
solving from fundamental principles (e.g., Lewis acid/base theory;
retrosynthetic analysis). However, the present materials are passive (html and
pdf files). Pilot studies show that although students think they are using these
materials effectively, they are actually using ineffective methods. Their
illusion is consistent with studies of meta-cognitive and self-regulated
learning. The project develops and tests software (called a meta-cognitive
coach) that closely monitors students' problem solving so that it can offer
unsolicited advice at just the right moments to motivate students to use
specific, more effective learning strategies. For instance, the coach might
convince a student to study a problem 2 or 3 times deeply, rather than 20 or 30
times shallowly. The project will help learning scientists know how to build
effective meta-cognitive coaches for knowledge-rich domains. The project will
also yield an online practice system that may significantly improve organic
chemistry students' learning, which may reduce attrition and ultimately increase
the flow of a diversity of students through this critical scientific pipeline.
