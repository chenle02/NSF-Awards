9413222 Fine In this projct, the PI will collect and analyze samples for
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) on WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) sections, I-7N
(Arabian Sea), I-9N (95degE and Bay of Bengal), I-10 (Indonesia to Australia),
and I-5W/I-4 (25degS and 30degS) as part of the WOCE Indian Ocean Expedition
(IOE). The objective is to describe and quantify the strength of the
thermohaline circulation, using the water mass age information inherent in the
CFC distributions, to evaluate the extent of ventilation with respect to
atmospheric gases, and to constrain water mass circulation pathways, sources,
and spreading rates.
