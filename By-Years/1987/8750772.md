The Randolph-Macon physics department will improve the laboratory component of
its Introductory Astronomy offering by unifying the experience around a central
theme. The purchase of key items of laboratory and observatory equipment will
focus the educational task on the range of observing tools and techniques
available in modern visible- light astronomy. Experiments in photography,
spectroscopy, and photometry will be offered. Each method will be studied in an
indoor laboratory setting to provide sufficient skill development prior to
applying the techniques in the college observatory. The project will add
laboratory spectrometers, a telescope-mounted photometer, and a computer for
instrument control to the equipment already available.
