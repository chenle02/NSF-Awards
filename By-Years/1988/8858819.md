This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of John Daugman at
Harvard University. His research deals with information processing in both
biological and computational vision. Focusing on early mechanisms of visual
signal processing, he has used image-processing methods to simulate the basis
functions in neural laminae which extract two-dimensional image structure. The
inferred functions can be modeled as oriented, multiscale, two-dimensional wave
packets that simultaneously and optimally resolve structural and positional
information. Daugman now is developing a machine-vision processor that will
decompose images, at video rates, into oriented structural primitives using
parameters based on neurobiological recordings of the properties of cells in the
visual cortex of the brains of primates. The significance of this work is that
it is likely to lead to a better understanding of natural vision systems -- how
they extract information from images and represent it, and how they infer the
properties of objects.
