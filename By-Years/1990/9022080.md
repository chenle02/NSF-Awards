Hearing can provide remarkably good information on where a sound is in space.
Interaural cues about location of a sound source include the difference in
intensity of the sound at the two ears, and the delay time between the arrival
of the sound at one ear compared to the other. Input from both ears is important
for localizing complex as well as relatively simple sounds, but we do not yet
understand how the brain manages this binaural processing. This project
continues a computational modelling approach to how the mammalian auditory
system compares and analyzes sounds presented to the two ears. A unified theory
is being developed to describe and predict binaural phenomena in terms of how
the peripheral auditory system responds physiologically to various stimuli. The
present work will develop appropriate extensions of models to a number of
important classes of phenomena for which theoretical predictions are not yet
adequate, including perception of short duration stimuli, relation of position
perception to frequency, and application to sounds that are amplitude-modulated
(AM) or contain high-frequency noise. An important part of the work is
collaboration with a group getting experimental data on binaural listening, to
provide empirical tests of the model predictions. The results from this unique
approach will be important to a fundamental issue of auditory science and
perception, and also are likely to lead to applications in designing sensory
aids, in designing displays to simulate spatial phenomena, and in developing
systems for enhancing understanding of speech in noisy environments.
