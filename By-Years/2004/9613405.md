*** 9613405 Lave This grant provides funding for the development and testing of
a cost accounting system that identifies the full social cost impacts of the
energy consumption and environmental consequences of each raw material, process
and product internal and external to the firm. These management information
tools will be developed in cooperation with three major corporations and will
permit the internalization of a large portion of the energy consumption and
environmental impact externalities. This cost accounting system will allow
product and process designers to represent material and process costs that have
an integrated cost component for environmental consequences. This research will
provide companies with financial information that should motivate behavior to
optimize energy usage, to prevent the generation of environmental pollutants and
to minimize waste generation. This information will help companies provide more
environmentally friendly products and services while improving their quality and
lowering their costs. ***
