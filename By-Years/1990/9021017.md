Dr Mark Davis is receiving the Alan T. Waterman Award for his pioneering work in
catalysis and catalytic materials, including the first synthesis of a molecular
sieve with pores larger than one nanometer and the invention of supported
aqueous-phase catalysts; each of these accomplishments opens up a new and
potentially important area in catalytic science and technology, and also has
implications for separations technology and environmental control.
