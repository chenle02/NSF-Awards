This award provides funding for fifteen United States ecologists to participate
in the First Latin American Congress of Ecology (10-17 December 1989;
Montevideo, Uruguay) and to present research results at selected Latin American
universities. The field of ecology and the related disciplines of evolution and
behavior are undergoing rapid change. At the same time, growing national
recognition of the problems of climatic change, biodiversity, and pollution is
producing pressure for ecologically-sensible solutions, suggesting an unusually
favorable environment for research leading to environmental problem-solving in
the United States. Unfortunately, the same is not true of Latin America.
Devalued currencies and national debts have reduced the ability of ecologists to
follow international developments at the same time that their contributions are
most needed in addressing problems such as biodiversity, deforestation watershed
protection, and pollution. Such ecologists often lack access to journals,
libraries, or colleagues. There exists a need to increase the awareness of Latin
American ecologists concerning recent developments in ecology and environmental
science. Such awareness would have obvious benefits to their own countries, but
it would also have direct and indirect benefits to the United States.
