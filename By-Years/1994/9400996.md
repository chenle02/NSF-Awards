9400996 Allen Although individually small in stature, tropical mosses constitute
major portions of forest biomass and provide food and shelter to numerous
invertebrate organisms. The taxonomic inventory of mosses and understanding of
their genealogical or phylogenetic relationships are at a primitive level,
largely because so few scientists study these plants. In a project designed to
describe and classify all the mosses of Central America, Dr. Robert Allen of the
Missouri Botanical Garden continues with the second phase of a projected four-
volume inventory of tropical mosses. An estimated 200-300 species are to be
treated, with identification keys, illustrations of diagnostic morphological
features, scientific nomenclature, and notes on habitat and geographical
distribution for each. Taxonomic description and classification of Central
American mosses will provide the foundation for critical ecological and
biogeographic studies of the region. The moss flora will be published first in
English, then translated into a Spanish edition. Natural history collections at
select Central American institutions will be enhanced as well, and information
is being databased for eventual electronic transmission.
