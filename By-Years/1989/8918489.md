This award will provide partial support to the Advanced Study Institute on
Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics; St. Croix, Virgin Islands; June
14-25, 1990. This Institute has been held biennially since 1980 with the main
support from NATO. The object of the Institute is to advance the training and
instruction of exceptional young physicists in the areas of current experimental
techniques and recent developments in elementary particle physics. The course
material is concerned with the experimental tools of the field and with aspects
of current theoretical ideas and phenomenology. Topics will include lectures on
accelerator science, latest results in collider physics, hadron spectroscopy,
introduction to gauge physics and cosmology.
