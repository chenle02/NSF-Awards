High powered radio waves directed to the upper atmosphere and ionosphere can
produce changes in composition, electron density, optical emissions and other
radio waves at various frequencies. The cause of many of these effects is still
unknown and just what perturbation will occur for a given power and frequency
input is still theoretically unexplained. This project is to design a one
dimensional model of the propagation of powerful radio waves in the lower
ionosphere and compare this model to new experimental observations. An approach
based on kinetic theory will be used to discuss propagation of a single pulse ,
a series of pulses as well as a continuous wave. Calculations will be provided
for varying parameters of the radio wave such as effective power, frequency,
polarization, duration of the pulse and time between pulses. These calculations
will be done for both daytime and nighttime ionospheric conditions.
