This research program investigates the competition between dissipative
mechanisms such as frictions and the destabilizing action of nonlinearity of the
material response. The corresponding nonlinear evolution (partial differential)
equations exhibit both hyperbolic and parabolic characters. Their analysis for
the qualitative behavior of the physical system poses new and difficult
mathematical problems. Specific results from the research program are expected
to provide insight to physical problems such as shear band formation for strain-
rate dependent materials and the motion of viscoelastic materials with fading
memory.
