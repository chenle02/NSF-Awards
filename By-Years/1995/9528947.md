9528947 Morrison This grant provides $80,000 as one-half of the total costs of
two-years salary support for a stable isotope laboratory technician. This Phase
II technician support award follows the successful completion of a three-year
Phase I award and after its expiration, the technician's position will be
supported by the University of Southern California for an additional three years
at the 50% level. The technician will be responsible for the maintenance and
operation of a gas-source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer and extraction
lines and will assist with the training of graduate and undergraduate students
and develop new laboratory techniques. Further technical assistance at this
laboratory will allow the PI to continue research addressing problems concerning
crustal fluid flow, depth of penetration and fluid/wall rock interaction. ***
