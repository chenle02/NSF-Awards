This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
entire new class of LC materials consisting of unique mixtures of polar and
nonpolar nematic LCs that form an induced smectic-A phase with bilayer or
multilayer microstructures. The proposed Induced Smetic-A LCs (ISALCs) are
intrinsically low in viscosity, and therefore their optical properties can be
electrically switched at low voltages without power pulse heating. ISALC
materials will significantly improve the performance of flat panel displays,
electro-optic devices, and storage media with infinitely long-term intrinsic
memory. In contrast, current monolayer smectic-A LCs are highly viscous, and
thus require either very high voltage for electrical driving or complicated
thermal addressing. Other LC materials such as ferroelectric smectic-C and
cholesteric require careful treatment of substrate surfaces and precise
thickness of LC layers, which has limited their widespread commercial use.

The commercial applications of these materials include scientific and industrial
instrumentation ranging from microelectronics manufacturing, telecommunications,
computers, and training and simulation systems, and extending to security
control systems.
