he models used in inductive inference have their&lt;br/&gt;roots in the models
used by the philosophers of&lt;br/&gt;science who were discussing the scientific
method.&lt;br/&gt;The goal there, and in prior work in learning
theory,&lt;br/&gt;was to come up with an explanation of the
phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;under consideration.&lt;br/&gt;However, scientists rarely
work directly for the grand goal&lt;br/&gt;of a complete
explanation.&lt;br/&gt;The more modest goal of finding features
and&lt;br/&gt;facts about the observed data is pursued.&lt;br/&gt;A variety of
types of algorithms that could be construed as&lt;br/&gt;discovering their final
result will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to consider computations that
discover rather than compute&lt;br/&gt;their intended result.&lt;br/&gt;A logic
of discovery will be developed and investigated.&lt;br/&gt;This study is
particularly relevant to contemporary&lt;br/&gt;science as automated data
generation techniques&lt;br/&gt;produce sufficient volumes of data
to&lt;br/&gt;overwhelm the analysis abilities of humans.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
our work is to illuminate&lt;br/&gt;precisely what can and cannot be
accomplished&lt;br/&gt;by automatic data analysis algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;Such
algorithms are used in data mining and&lt;br/&gt;text analysis for world wide
web search engines.
