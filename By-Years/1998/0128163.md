The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) in the area of
Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing will develop a science,
engineering and technology base for laser and plasma processing of materials,
devices and systems. Laser and Plasma processing of materials is used in various
manufacturing sectors such as semiconductor/electronic manufacturing, aerospace,
automotive, general manufacturing, life science products, medical device
manufacturing. The focus of the center includes: bulk processing, surface
processing, coatings, surface etching and patterning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
I/UCRC will also take full advantage of being cited next to Free Electron Laser
Facility of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The Facility is the
world's most powerful, tunable laser, currently delivering kilowatt average
power in the mid infrared. The strong interest in the center is evidenced from
various letters of commitment received from industry and federal laboratories.
