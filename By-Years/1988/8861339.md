This is an SBIR Phase I award for development of a new class of electron
multiplier arrays for particle detection. These devices are physically similar
to available micro-channel plates, but can be made with micron and submicron
channels of arbitrary sizes. Because of the smaller size, these devices will
have approximately ten times better response and bandwidth than conventional
micro-channel plates. The project will attempt the first steps toward a major
improvement in micro-channel electron multipliers, by developing a technique to
fabricate extremely small channels of arbitrary shapes. The devices are used in
both research and commercial applications and any improvement in their
performance would be a significant development.
