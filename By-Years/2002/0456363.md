The proposed research deals with topics in Higher Dimensional Complex
&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Geometry. It is mainly focused on natural questions
in&lt;br/&gt;the birational geometry of complex projective
varieties&lt;br/&gt;such as the study of the pluricanonical maps of varieties of
general type&lt;br/&gt;and understanding how rational curves and holomorphic
1-forms influence the &lt;br/&gt;geometry of these varieties.&lt;br/&gt;Some of
the main problems to be investigated are: For what values of m is the
&lt;br/&gt;m-th pluricanonical map of a variety of general type
birational?&lt;br/&gt;Are the fibers of a resolution of a variety with mild
singularities always &lt;br/&gt;rationally chain connected? &lt;br/&gt;Is it the
case that on a smooth projective variety of general type,&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic
1-forms always have non-empty zero set?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classification
of complex algebraic surfaces was initiated by the&lt;br/&gt;Italian school at
the beginning of the twentieth century. Its main features&lt;br/&gt;have been
long understood.&lt;br/&gt;In Higher Dimensional Complex Algebraic Geometry, one
hopes to extend &lt;br/&gt;the theory surfaces to dimensions grater or equal to
three.&lt;br/&gt;The minimal model program, for example aims to show, as in the
case of&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, that any variety is either covered by rational
curves or&lt;br/&gt;birationally equivalent to a minimal model.&lt;br/&gt;The
minimal model program is complete only in dimension 3, but it has
&lt;br/&gt;inspired many important advances in algebraic
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;This project hopes to answer some of the questions and
conjectures that &lt;br/&gt;naturally arise in this context.
