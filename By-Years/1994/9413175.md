9413175 Bray In this project, the PI will lead the data collection effort on a
hydrographic section between Indonesia and Australia, designated as line I-10 of
the Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE) of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE). Conductivity, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, Chlorofluorocarbons, and
Helium/Tritium will be sampled. In addition, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiles
will be obtained, and 10 ALACE (Autonomous LAgrangian Current Explorer) floats
will be deployed. Line I-10 is crucial to understanding the amount of flow
entering the Indian Ocean from the Pacific Ocean, and its measurement on this
section, as well as on other sections by other countries will provide a key to
interpreting all the other measurements made in the IOE.
