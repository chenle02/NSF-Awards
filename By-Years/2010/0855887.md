This award supports the Princeton Gravity Group's continued exploration of
gravitational physics and cosmology through the experimental and observational
study of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The speci&amp;#64257;c
experimental work includes: (1) Observations and data analysis for the Atacama
Cosmology Telscope (ACT). ACT is fully functional and taking data. (2) The
&amp;#64257;elding and analysis of the Atacama B-mode Survey (ABS) experiment to
measure the signature of gravitational waves from the early universe through
their imprint on the polarization of the CMB. (3) The completion of the QUIET
project, also targeting the CMB polarization, but at lower frequencies, which is
just entering its observation and analysis phase. These experiments are
complementary to both the existing WMAP satellite and the upcoming PLANCK
satellite as well as to other ongoing work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurements
of the CMB are at the foundation of the standard cosmological model and probe
gravitational physics at extreme length and temperature scales. The CMB is the
cleanest probe of the physics of the nascent universe. In addition to unveiling
fundamental physics during the first instants of the universe, the CMB provides
information about the dark energy causing the present-day acceleration of the
universe, is sensitive to the sum of the neutrino masses, can help locate the
baryons that we know must exist but wich have not yet been found, and tells us
how cosmic structure emerged in the early universe. This research program
includes substantial educational development for students, continued public
outreach, extensive international collaboration, and strong interagency
collaboration (especially with NIST). The Princeton group will continue its
vigorous program of hands-on research for undergraduates and graduate students.
