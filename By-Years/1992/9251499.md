This project introduces undergraduate students to the important measuring
technique of laser-doppler velocimetry (LDV) which is now widely used in
industry, especially for turbulence measurement. The project employs a single-
channel system for use in a small water-flow test rig. For safety and for ease
of setting up, the system uses a fiber-optic probe, which holds the main optics,
permanently adjusted, in a self-contained unit. The laser power is 7mW, but the
effective laser power for safety considerations is 3.5mW. Students ise the
system first in the Introductory Fluids Engineering course (a combined lecture
and laboratory class) and use it for more detailed measurements in the senior
year Thermosciences Laboratory course.
