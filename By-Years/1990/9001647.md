This research project is developing a new technique, based on the detection of
interface elastic waves by Brillouin scattering, to measure the bulk elastic
constants of solids under hundreds of kilobars of hydrostatic pressure. This
unique capability will permit the investigation of the almost universal
softening of acoustic phonons with pressure in cubic semiconductors and their
potential role in structural phase transitions. Measurements on semiconductor
alloys and heterostructures will allow isolation of compositional and
interfacial strain effects. Resonant Raman scattering will be employed to study
the exchange-mediated phonon renormalization discovered in cobalt-based dilute
magnetic semiconductors. Antoher program on II-V semiconductors is attempting to
elucidate the fundamental driving mechanism for their novel ordering during
epitaxial growth and to explore the possibility to stabilize through strain
otherwise unstable crystal lattices.
