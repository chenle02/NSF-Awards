AST-0406587&lt;br/&gt;Kashlinsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cosmic infrared
background (CIB) arises from accumulated emissions from early galaxy populations
spanning a large range of redshifts. This research will measure and study the
anisotropies in the CIB by using both ground-based and space-based archival
data. After careful processing of these data to create a reliable,
uncontaminated map of the CIB, the spatial correlation function and the spatial
power spectrum calculated therefrom will be modeled using synthetic data
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out at a minority woman-
owned small business, in collaboration with academic institutions, and using an
online education resource (http://www.theastronomycafe.net) that has been
recommended by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The team
has already employed high school students through their working relationship
with area schools, and this activity will continue, and may expand.&lt;br/&gt;
