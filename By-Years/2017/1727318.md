Women's Intellectual Network Research Symposium: A Meeting of Mathematical Minds
is a one-day symposium that will be held at Brown University on Saturday, March
4th, 2017. The goal of this symposium is to bring together undergraduate and
graduate students, as well as post-doctoral fellows and faculty from New
England, in order to engage in research discussions and exchange ideas. This
symposium particularly seeks to connect women and other underrepresented
minorities in similar fields of mathematics or statistics from universities in
the New England area, as well as to promote collaboration and share strategies
for addressing issues facing these groups. However, the symposium is more
broadly inclusive, and hopes to benefit a larger community. The symposium is
open to everyone, regardless of gender identity. The symposium will feature two
plenary talks, in applied dynamical systems and geometric group theory, three
tutorials, including one on public key cryptography, and one in data science,
short talks by students (graduate and undergraduate), post-doctoral fellows and
faculty, a poster session, and a panel on effective mentoring. A meeting of
members of AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics) Student Chapters will also
be convened during the symposium. The symposium seeks to have a broad
representation from pure, applied and industrial math, and encourages
participation from researchers in all areas of mathematics, applied mathematics
and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pan-New England symposium will serve
to build bridges between universities and connect researchers, particularly
upcoming and younger researchers, women and underrepresented minorities, in
similar mathematical fields. The geographic proximity of these universities
makes it more likely that networks formed at the conference can be sustained and
strengthened, which in turn should increase the probability that these
researchers stay in the field and become highly productive members of the
community. The symposium lays a strong emphasis on vertical integration, namely
having representation at all levels, from undergraduate students to faculty, as
we believe this is particularly beneficial to achieve the objectives of the
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium website is:
