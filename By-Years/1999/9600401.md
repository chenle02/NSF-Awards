9600401 Huebner Stutts This award supports a 6 month National Science Foundation
Dissertation Enhancement Award for Mr. James R. Friend at the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (TIT), Tokyo, Japan. Mr. Friend, will work with Dr. Sadayuki Ueha,
senior scientist at TIT, on a research project entitled, "Analytical Modeling of
Ultrasonic Traveling Wave Motors". The main objective of the research is to both
perform analytical modeling of ultrasonic traveling wave motors and construct
working prototypes of the models. Piezoelectric traveling wave motors provide
promise for replacing fractional horsepower motors in a wide variety of
applications. The primary investigator has created a theoretical model of a
piezoelectric motor that, while slower than those currently being developed in
Japan, is far more accurate in its prediction of the physical behavior of the
motor's operation. Cooperation between scientists in the United States and Japan
on a project involving mutually compatible theories would allow the development
of more effective models as well as the design, assembly, and operation of
actual working motors. ***
