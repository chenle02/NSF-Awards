This award provides support to the Ralph Bunch Summer Institute (RSBI), which is
a program of the American Political Science Association hosted at the University
of Virginia. The RSBI is designed to expand opportunities for African Americans
by preparing black undergraduates to enroll in doctoral programs and become
university professors of political science. The RSBI immerses undergraduates in
the summer after their junior year in a five-week intensive program that
includes graduate level course work, and the design, analysis, write-up, and
presentation of original research papers. The program simulates the graduate
school experience and focuses on scientific analysis by introducing the students
to research methods and statistics, and the research enterprise that is the
lifeline of professional political scientists. Fifteen students each year, over
a three year period, will be selected for participation in the program. This
award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented
students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
