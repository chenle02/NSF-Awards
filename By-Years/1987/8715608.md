A number of plant pathogens produce low molecular weight chemicals which are
toxic to plants. Some toxins, called "host-specific", have the same host-range
in vitro as the producing organism does in the field; that is, plants resistant
to the pathogen are insensitive to that pathogen's toxin, and plant susceptible
to the pathogen are sensitive to the toxin. Host-specific toxins produced by
fungi in the genus Cochliobolus (also known as Helminthosporium or Bipolaris)
have been implicated in two catastrophic epidemics of cereal crops in the U.S.
in the last forty years. While in the last few years the chemical structures of
most host- specific toxins have been determined, and their modes of action in
some cases partly clarified, nothing is currently known about the biosynthesis
of phytotoxins, nor about the molecular processes by which pathogens acquire the
ability to make them. The objectives of this project are to identify and isolate
enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a host-specific toxin, to raise
antibodies to these enzymes, and to isolate the genes which code for those
enzymes. The antibodies and cloned genes will be tools to study the molecular
basis of race specificity and toxin production in plant pathogenic fungi.
Initial efforts will focus on the purification and characterization of two
enzymes recently identified as being involved in the biosynthesis of a cyclic
peptide toxin, HC- toxin, made by the fungal pathogen of maize, Cochliobolus
carbonum. The purified enzymes will be used to raise antibodies, and, following
amino acid sequencing, to make synthetic oligonucleotides. The antibodies and
oligonucleotides will be used to clone the genes for these enzymes. The cloned
genes will be used to compare isolates of the fungus which can an cannot make
HC-toxin, and ultimately, to study at the molecular level the evolutionary
processes by which pathogenic fungi acquire the ability to make toxins.***//
