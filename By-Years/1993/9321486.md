9321486 Rockwell The goal of this research is to develop phylogenies
(genealogies) for the hawks, Falconiformes. There are three major questions to
be asked: 1) Is the group a natural one, that is, are the families within the
group each others' closest relatives; 2) What are the relationships among the
families within Falconiformes; 3) What are the relationships among the falcons
(Falconidae)? Sequence data will be collected from the mitochondrial genome. The
molecular phylogenies inferred from these data will be compared with
morphological ones inferred from morphological data generated by Griffths, to
see how well the results match. The two data sets will then be combined for the
final analyses. %%% This study will be one of the first to provide both
morphological and molecular phylogenetic data by the same researcher. The
results of the analyses will provide a phylogenetic framework for a wide variety
of research studies on hawks, including ecological and conservation studies.
