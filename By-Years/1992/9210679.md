In many real world systems, they are of such complexity that the functional
relationship between the parameters of the system and its performance is not
well understood. Simulation is often the only tool that can be used to evaluate
the performance of the system. Standard mathematical programming techniques
cannot be used to optimize the performance of the system. This project will
conduct research aimed at developing efficient methods for optimizing the
performance of stochastic system with respect to continuous decision variables.
The project is concerned with three issues: 1) under what conditions do several
new stochastic approximation algorithms converge, 2) when are these conditions
satisfied in simulation, and 3) how do stochastic approximation algorithms
compare empirically?
