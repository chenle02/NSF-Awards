This project deals with the processing of primary metals such as aluminum
alloys. Liquid metals are employed as cathodes in molten salt electrolysis. The
cathodic part is reduced into the molten metal, e.g. aluminum into the aluminum
pad of Hall-Heroult cells or into the floating aluminum laser of a three layer
aluminum refining cell. In this work metals that are normally solid will be
reduced into and onto liquid metal substrates, both at ambient temperatures and
in molten salt systems at elevated temperature. Electrolytic reduction of metals
from aqueous solution at mercury and amalgam electrodes will also be studied and
extended to cover low-melting metal mixtures and gallium in non aqueous media.
The metal deposition at liquid silver and aluminum, using the established see-
in technique, will also be studied. The research conducted includes a study of
the nature of solid products electrocystallized on an atomically smooth
substrate and the establishment of the conditions under which alloying or film
deposition occurs.
