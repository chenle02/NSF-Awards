Professor Scott plans to work on conjectures in two specific areas: four
conjectures related to the characterization of Seifert fiber spaces; and three
conjectures which arise in the study of 3-manifolds of negative curvature. His
third area of interest is the subgroup separability of 3-manifold groups.
Manifolds of dimension three are among the most natural geometric objects for
study by inhabitants of a three-dimensional universe.
