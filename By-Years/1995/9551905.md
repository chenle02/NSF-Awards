Laboratory improved through cooperative learning Declining resources, outdated
equipment, and under prepared students are problems facing many institutions
across the country, including Cabrillo College. These problems have contributed
to students in Human Physiology laboratories becoming observers, rather than
active participants in laboratory experiments. The goal of this project is to
provide more investigative and cooperative learning experiences for students by:
1) restructuring the curriculum to foster inquiry and teamwork; and 2) equipping
them with computer controlled data acquisition technology. Students are learning
science and critical thinking by actively participating in hands-on laboratory
exercises, working in small groups to gather data, using computers to analyze
the data, and discussing and presenting their findings. Computer workstations
with accompanying data acquisition hardware and software, and a computer network
are being employed to accomplish these goals. In restructuring the curriculum to
include the new equipment, care is being taken to design a user-friendly
environment that encourages teamwork and active learning, especially for under
prepared students lacking a technological background. A thorough critique of
this project and the results of its evaluation will be presented and published
nationally.
