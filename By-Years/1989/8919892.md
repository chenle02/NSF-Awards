The development of cerebral cortical astrocytes will be studied in cultures
from mice with three copies (aneuploidy) of chromosome 16 (MMU 16; Ts16).
Astrocytes have been increasingly implicated in hormonal control of brain
development and may possess some of the membrane excitability mechanisms
normally characteristic of neurons. The long term objectives are to determine
the developmental consequences of autosomal trisomy in mammals. Astrocyte
morphology, expression of glial specific antigens such as glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP), and expression of voltage-gated ion channels as
determined by tracer influx and radiolabeled ligand binding measurements will be
used to establish the state of astrocyte differentiation. Conversion to a
stellate morphology of GFAP+ cells and appearance of voltage-gated sodium
channels with high affinity for saxitoxin are associated with astrocyte
maturation in vitro. Preliminary results reveal that this developmental program
is accelerated in Ts16 Astrocytes. The proposed studies will investigate the
nature of this acceleration maturation in Ts16 astrocytes and also examine
whether growth factors trigger this premature aging. These studies should
provide new information about the roles of astrocytes and neuronal-glial
interactions in normal brain development and how astrocyte development is
altered by aneuploidy.
