Several years ago the council of the Geochemical Society conceived the plan to
initiate joint meetings of major geochemical societies to foster cooperation
between scientists, in particular to develop stronger ties with the European
scientific community. The longer range goal is to hold meetings organized in
alternate years by European and the United States- based societies. The very
positive feedback from the participants of the first Goldschmidt Conference,
which was organized by the Geochemical Society in 1988 to mark the Centennial
Year of V.M. Goldschmidt's birth, encouraged the council of the Geochemical
Society to proceed with organizing bianial Goldschmidt Conferences. The second
conference will be held from May 2 to 4, 1990 in Baltimore, Maryland.
