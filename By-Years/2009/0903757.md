This grant provides funding for the symposium "Insect Evolution" at the annual
meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology held in Boston,
January 3-7, 2009. The symposium addresses the interface of two active fields in
comparative biology: the study of evolution and advances in physiological
ecology. Historically, the understanding of the pattern of evolution in insects
was based on data from fossils and comparative anatomy. Recently, molecular data
have provided new insights and new hypotheses about pattern and process in
insect evolution. For example, new information has arisen regarding the
relationships between different groups of insects. In this symposium,
researchers will present talks addressing how new evolutionary insights inform
the understanding of respiration, flight, social structure, cuticle, diurnal
clocks, osmoregulation and vision in the insects. Substantial insights will be
gained by the coming together of researchers in these two vibrant fields. The
topics will also be of great interest to a listening audience composed of
researchers and teachers in this broad and integrative scientific society. The
symposium will broaden its impact by including a diverse program of presenters,
including speakers at early stages of their careers, international speakers,
female speakers, and speakers who are members of under-represented groups in the
sciences.
