With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Viktor Nemykin and colleagues from the University of Minnesota - Duluth will
acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer with a CCD detector for use in
chemical research, including: 1) characterization of binuclear lanthanide
complexes, 2) studies with a new beta-hydroxy ester synthon equivalent, 3)
structure-activity studies of toxoplasma gondii inhibitors, 4) studies of high-
valent transition metal arene complexes, 5) structural analysis of organic
natural products, and other projects. Besides being available to users at the
University of Minnesota -- Duluth, researchers at the College of St. Scholastica
(Duluth, MN) and University of Wisconsin - Superior will also use the instrument
for their own research projects.

The technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography allows accurate and
precise determination of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of molecules relative to the neighboring molecules.
These studies will have an impact in a number of areas ranging from synthetic
organic and inorganic chemistry to systems of biological interest and materials
research. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as
research, and will serve universities and colleges in a region of the country
(northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin) that do not currently have modern
crystallography facilities.
