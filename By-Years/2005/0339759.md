This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project addresses low
cost fabrication of probe cards for use in testing advanced circuit
technologies. Currently, high-density probe card assemblies employ more than
1500 test points to provide the increased test coverage necessary for System-on-
a-Chip and high pin count devices. At $50/test point, such assemblies often sell
for over $75,000 and they wear out in only 1 million wafer touchdowns. These
assemblies often require integration of multiple components-sometimes thousands-
and require many hours of labor to assemble. This project would promote
nanoparticle-based meso-film; laser patterned optical-quality glass ceramics;
and inkjet printing processes that will reduce the probe card manufacturing
cost, increase test point density, increase contact life, and reduce assembly
labor. The Phase I project will be a collaboration of several companies bringing
together expertise in 3D laser patterning; material and process development; and
nanoparticle manufacturing in a unique and powerful way to tackle an important
industry challenge.

The commercial application of this project is in testing of advanced electronic
circuits in such uses as processes for the manufacture, deposition and
functionalization of nanoparticle-based coatings with low sintering
temperatures; feature resolution of laser patterned substrates for 3D
micromachining applications including MEMS, MOEMS, microreplication, and grating
manufacture; test integration-optical, mechanical, and electrical wafer testing
being combined in a monolithic substrate; faster product development cycle times
and production ramps for advanced processor and microsystem designs; and design
of test fixtures for the new wave of electronic products built using direct-
write deposition of passive and active electronic structures onto non-silicon
substrates.
