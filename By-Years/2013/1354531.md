The NSF Collaborative grant "Graduate Student Training through Research on
Plasma-Based Accelerators", has supported the work of 14 graduate students since
September 1, 2009 at seven different institutions. Eight of these students have
already graduated and another six are expected to graduate by September 2014.
This project supports one of these six students, whose scientific goal is to
visualize --- in a single shot --- evolving plasma structures that propagate at
the speed of light in the wake of intense ultrashort laser pulses or electron
bunches. The single-shot Frequency Domain Holography (FDH) visualization and
control techniques developed and refined through this research can impact a wide
cross section of plasma and accelerator science through the impact on Laser
Plasma Accelerators (LPA). In LPA science, FDT will contribute fundamentally to
scaling LPAs to multi-GeV energy. Compact FDT systems could ultimately become
standard in-line metrology for future laser- and proton-driven plasma
accelerators that produce electrons up to the energy frontier. These methods
will also promote more reliable plasma-based accelerators, which are useful as
compact, coherent x-ray sources for biological, chemical, and medical research,
injectors for conventional accelerators, and medical accelerators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student will apply and adapt the Frequency Domain
Holography (FDH) cutting-edge visualization method developed in the PI's
laboratory to new frontier plasma science problems: (1) He will implement FDT
visualization of evolving laser-driven plasma bubbles in two regimes: (a)
atmospheric density plasma driven by an ultrashort terawatt laser pulse; (b)
0.01 atmosphere plasma driven by the Texas Petawatt Laser, with the aim of
understanding, optimizing and scaling a laser-plasma accelerator (LPA) that
recently accelerated electrons to a world-record-breaking energy of 2 GeV.
Particle-in-cell and photon-in-cell simulations will guide the experiments. (2)
He will develop methods suitable for visualizing wakes in meter-long tenuous
plasma. These methods will be designed with the intention of implementing them
ultimately at advanced accelerator facilities such as SLAC's Facility for
Accelerator Science and Experimental Tests (FACET).
