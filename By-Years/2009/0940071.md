Many decisions are made in the face of risk and uncertainty and under
circumstances where each person's individual decision affects other people's
outcomes. The 2009 outbreak of swine flu (influenza A H1N1) provides a chance to
study how lay people's perceptions of risks change over time and how those
perceptions drive willingness to engage in precautionary behaviors (such as
anti-viral medication use or self quarantine) that not only have consequences
for the person who engages in the behaviors but that also affect the risks for
others in the population. The investigators use an internet survey regarding
people?s risk perception and willingness to take precautionary measures to query
cohorts of US adults starting a few days after the first news of the outbreak
and continuing at regular intervals throughout the epidemic. The research
examines the relationships over time among information from the media about the
influenza outbreak, perceptions of risk, and interest in taking precautionary
measures. This outbreak of a new infectious disease represents a rare
opportunity to study how risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors change
over time in response to information about how the hazard unfolds. The results
could have implications not only for public health responses to natural
disasters but also for an understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying risk
perception and decision making under uncertainty.
