This experimental and theoretical research deals with acoustic control of
coherent structures in a jet. The focus is on helical disturbances and the
interaction between various disturbance modes, emphasizing those without
cylindrical symmetry. The disturbances which are to be exited through acoustic
means will cause distortion in the originally circular cross-section of the jet.
Such distortions are know to strongly enhance mixing. Thus, this investigation
may ultimately produce efficient and low-power control schemes based on sound
irradiation to enhance mixing and/or combustion.
