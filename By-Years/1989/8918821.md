This proposal is to investigate the rates of vertical diffusion in the open
ocean by releasing an inert tracer and measuring its distribution as a function
of time. The experiment will be conducted in the eastern North Atlantic in
conjunction with another ocean process experiment. The work is a contribution to
the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
