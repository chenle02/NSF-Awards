UNIAX has developed a series of ester-substituted soluble poly(para-phenylenes)
PPP for use as active layers in blue and violet light emitting diodes (LEDs).
The synthetic route is simple, conducive to large scale, and allows for a wide
variety of derivatives - making other routes into blue luminescent conducting
polymers seem awkward or obsolete. Derivatives have been tailored to have
solubility in non-polar solvents such as hexane or in polar solvents such as
ethanol. Films spun-cast directly from solution are pinhole-free and
transparent, but take on a violet or blue hue in reflected sunlight.
Photoluminescent spectra for all derivatives prepared are reported (luminescence
energies for some derivates exceed 3.0 eV), and the fabrication of a prototypes
LED device using one of these stable room-temperature processible PPP
derivatives has been achieved. The goal in developing this preliminary research
into a commercially attractive portable display involves purification of the
conducting polymer active layers to optimize the efficiency, and to
systematically investigate diode characteristics (efficiency, or "brightness,"
and light emission turn-on voltage) as a function of active layer thickness,
nature of the transparent electrode contact, and nature of the metal electron-
injecting contact. The research will also include research into synthesizing a
green luminescent PPP, making use of the finding that electron- releasing groups
red-shift the luminescence.
