This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Roger Laine and
Prof. Marta Ysern-Caldenty of the Universidad Simon Bolivar in Caracas,
Venezuela. The objective of the research is to study the cell surface proteins
of Anaplasma marginale, a micro-organism that binds to bovine red cells with an
end result similar to the invasion of red cells by malarial protozoans. The
investigators plan to study the molecular entities that interact at the cell
surfaces of these micro-organisms with bovine erythrocytes, to form a
recognition and binding pair. Preliminary evidence indicates that this binding
pair consists of a complex carbohydrate in the blood cell and a binding protein
on the Anaplasma. This work will serve to further elucidate the mechanisms
behind these binding interactions. The Venezuelan side will contribute expertise
in the biological system under study while the U.S. side brings to bear their
experience with chemical structural analysis. Because Anaplasma marginale has a
similar relation to bovine red blood cells as malaria does to human red cells,
the techniques used and knowledge gained in surface chemistry studies using
bovine red blood cells should prove beneficial to research in both areas.
