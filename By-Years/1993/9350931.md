The institution is firmly committed to significantly enhance instruction in the
plant sciences. A major goal is to develop a program in plant physiology, with a
special emphasis on environmental plant physiology or ecophysiology. Key items
of equipment are being used to teach concepts and experimental methods in
microclimatology, radiation interception and leaf energy balance, water
relations, photosynthesis, growth performance, and efficient data acquisition
and analysis. The equipment is also being used for several exercises in the
Ecology and General Biology courses. It is expected that our enhanced program
will prepare majors for successful graduate work and productive careers in plant
physiology, and that our approach can serve as a model for such programs in
other institutions.
