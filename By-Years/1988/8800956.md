Factors that control decomposition and associated nutrient dynamics in
phosphorus-limited wetland ecosystems will be studied. The effects of litter
quality and environmental factors on decomposition will be determined with
laboratory and field experiments. Litter quality variables will include nutrient
and lignin content. Environmental variables will include inorganic P availablity
and redox potential. Standard methods will be used to measure decay rates and
nutrient dynamics. The proposed research is an appropriate dissertation topic.
Mr. Bridgham, under the guidance of Dr. Richardson, will certainly make
contributions to our understanding of decomposition in wetland ecosystems. The
excellent research facilities at Duke University will provide all of the support
needed to conduct the proposed research.
