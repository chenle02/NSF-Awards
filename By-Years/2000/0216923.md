This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program to the
University of Washington supports the acquisition of a solid phase peptide
synthesizer, and a triple channel CPMAS probe. The instrument will provide new
NMR capability to the university. It will have impact in the area of molecular
engineering, in characterization of biomolecules immobilized at material
surfaces, in atomic level information on the structure of biopolymers adsorbed
onto material surfaces and the details of protein side chain-surface
interactions. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for
