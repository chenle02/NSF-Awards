In this proposed study the PI and collaborators (Mark Reagan, Iowa; Mike Carr,
Rutgers) propose to measure the oxygen isotope values (d18O) in Central America
Volcanic Arc (CAVA) lavas in order to distinguish mantle wedge processes
involving subducted upper crustal materials, from assimilation/contamination of
rising magmas with in situ upper crustal materials. In the former case, one
would expect a correlation between d18O and proxies of the extent of melting
(e.g. U/Th, Na6) and/or mantle source tracers (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr. In the latter,
one would expect correlation of d18O with proxies of contamination,
assimilation, and differentiation (like MgO or Mg#). A pilot study of ~30
samples from CAVA show very surprising results- there are correlations between
d18O and indices of melting, however large extents of melting and radiogenic
87Sr/86Sr are associated with low d18O, not high d18O as expected for common
sources of slab-derived metasomatizing agents. The PIs propose to collect more
d18O data for more well-characterized samples in order to try to understand the
puzzling results of the pilot study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
