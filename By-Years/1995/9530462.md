The automatic and efficient recognition of genes in DNA sequences is now widely
recognized as a central problem in computational molecular biology. This
research project uses the gene recognition problem in databases of gene sequence
data as a driver for research in machine learning. It builds on several
promising recent results, investigating decision tree methods, memory-based
reasoning, and hidden Markov models. Each of these approaches has particular
strengths. Recent research by the PI has found that decision trees can achieve
consistently higher accuracy that any previous methods for finding protein
coding regions in very short DNA subsequences. Embedding of the decision tree
approach in a dynamic programming algorithm can be used to produce a more
general system. The techniques discovered to be most effective will be
incorporated into a complete gene finding system that can identify genes with
high accuracy, augmented with a user-friendly interface, and made freely
available to the biology and computer science research communities.
