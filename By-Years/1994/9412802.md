9412802 Hryciw This project concerns the collection of perishable geotechnical
data resulting from the January 17, 1994, Northridge, CA, earthquake.
Specifically, it involves the collection of soil liquefaction (ground failure)
data at four locations: Simi Valley, Santa Monica, Redondo Beach and the Lower
Van Norman Dam; as well as conducting preliminary Cone Penetration Tests (CPT),
Flat Plate Dilatometer Tests (DMT) and seismic shear wave profiling at each of
these sites. It is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
investigation into the causes and effects of the Northridge earthquake. ***
