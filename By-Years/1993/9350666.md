9350666 Vaughn This project provides computing equipment and software for a
remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) laboratory to implement
a program in applied geospatial analysis. Some exercises focus on digital image
processing and GIS modeling. Other laboratory exercises address such topics as
terrain analysis and classification, georectification, and GIS spatial modeling.
The operating premise is to provide a sufficient measure of training to enable
students to compete for jobs in spatial analysis including GIS and digital image
processing, or to continue on into graduate school with a high probability of
success. It is expected that the exercises employed throughout the five courses
in GIS and remote sensing will provide the foundation for subsequent research
projects and formal presentations. Also, upon completion of the courses,
students will be placed in internships and summer jobs related to applications
in GIS and image processing. ***
