This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants to attend a
conference on Nevanlinna Theory and Complex Geometry during March 14-18, 2012 at
the University of Notre Dame. The conference will center around Nevanlinna
theory and complex hyperbolic geometry. Notre Dame has been a power house in
these areas. In recent years, there has been much important progress, including
several major breakthroughs, in the study of complex hyperbolic geometry and
Nevanlinna theory. The purpose of this conference is to gather experts in the
field of algebraic or complex geometry, especially complex hyperbolic geometry
and Nevanlinna theory, to report and understand the recent exciting discoveries
and techniques.

Special efforts will be made to invite young researchers, graduate students and
women mathematicians to participate and to give talks during the conference. We
expect that this conference will have a positive impact on young researchers and
graduate students in the field. The members of the organizing committee are
planning to act as editors of a special proceedings volume for the proposed
conference. Each submitted paper will be carefully refereed to ensure the
submission is appropriate and is of high quality. It is expected that many
publishers will be interested in printing such a volume. The conference will
provide a platform of communication, to explore further collaboration on the
diverse areas related to this subject, to further expound on new ideas and to
introduce the rapid developments in this area to a new generation of
mathematicians. The geographic diversity of the participants should contribute
to the fast dissemination of new scientific developments reported in this
conference. Details about the conference, list of speakers, participants, and
scientific program can be found at
