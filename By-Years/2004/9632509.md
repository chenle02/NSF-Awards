This project has four related objectives: (1) identifying/developing, testing,
and collecting population data on multiple marker loci appropriate for use in
the Human Genome Diversity Project; (2) developing a global population database
of such loci designed specifically to provide a framework that can be built on
by others, (3) testing the hypothesis of a European bias in the ascertainment of
markers and exploring the consequences for human population studies. Twenty-
three populations (of global distribution) will be typed for a large number of
polymorphisms (about 28) composing 8 compound loci, some of which will be
specifically ascertained to be free of the European Bias. Nuclear DNA loci have
been chosen for study because of the unrestricted nature of the information they
carry. The populations have been selected to provide a global distribution, but
are also weighted toward over-representation of Europe to allow thorough testing
of objective 3. The markers to be studied will be selected to be PCR-based or
converted as part of this project to a PCR-based typing format. This will assure
that other investigators can readily test the same markers in other populations.
The resulting database will be analyzed for heterozygosity, linkage
disequilibrium, and genetic distance. By the end of the study a global framework
of the microevolution and diversity of Homo sapiens will be in place, complete
with a set of appropriate and thoroughly tested haplotype loci.
