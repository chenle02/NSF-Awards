This study will investigate how people are injured and die in earthquakes and
other disasters, how they are rescued, and how medical care is provided to
victims. Field research will be conducted at the site of earthquakes and other
natural disasters as well as some technological disasters. Particular attention
will be given to situations involving building and structural collapse. At each
site data will be gathered on: (1) damage to the built environment for
engineering analysis, (2) casualties, (3) search and rescue activity, and (4)
the provision of emergency medical services. The results should prove useful to
designers working in areas subject to such environmental risks as earthquakes,
to emergency medical officials confronted with planning for mass casualties, and
to emergency managers involved in search and rescue planning.
