This project continues experimental research on institutions that may offer an
appropriate framework for negotiating solutions to externality problems such as
global warming, pollution control, and common resources. The institutions, known
as compensation mechanisms, yield efficient outcomes for most externalities
problems of interest to economists. They also have attractive distributional
characteristics in that they yield allocations that are competitive equilibria
with the externalities priced at marginal cost. This project investigates
experimentally the performance of different compensation mechanisms for two-
party unilateral externalities, public goods, general externalities structures,
commons problems, and congestion problems. The experiments are run both with and
without full information. The project also develops and disseminates a computer
environment for NeXT workstations that captures the logical structure for all
externalities problems. As a consequence the same computer program can be used
for all experimental work on externalities - just the user interface and the
payoff structure will change.
