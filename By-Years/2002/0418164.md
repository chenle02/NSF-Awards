This pilot study examines the role of motivated cognition in the
comprehensibility of instructions at the penalty phase of a trial. In
particular, it will assess the interactive effects of cognitive and motivational
factors on jurors' abilities to understand penalty-phase instructions and follow
the law in capital cases. We anticipate that people in a promotion motivational
state seek accomplishment and advancement by obtaining matches to a desired end
state, while people in a prevention motivational state seek safety and security
by avoiding mismatches to the desired end state. It follows that jurors in a
prevention motivational state will vigilantly discharge their responsibilities
and avoid making errors of commission (i.e., sentencing a defendant to death
when the law supports a prison sentence) while jurors in a promotion
motivational state will work hard to accomplish the justice-based goal of
punishing the defendant and avoid making errors of omission (i.e., failing to
invoke the death penalty when the facts support it). The study will lay the
groundwork for future work on the role of such factors on multimember jury
deliberations.
