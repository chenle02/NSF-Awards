An Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education Conference (ITiCSE)
working group is examining the educational missions and curricula of two and
four-year institutions with respect to information assurance education.
Participants in this workshop will define and describe the distinct and
complementary missions of two and four-year institutions with respect to
information assurance education, describe the differences and similarities of
the educational programs at two and four-year institutions, and document the
challenges and opportunities for information assurance course articulation
between two and four-year institutions. Travel support is provided for nine
information assurance educators and researchers to attend and participate. This
workshop continues the work of similar 2009 and 2010 working groups which
reviewed the state of information assurance education throughout the world and
created a detailed list of critical information assurance topics to be used as
the foundation for curriculum development.
