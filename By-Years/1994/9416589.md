9416589 Hermans This Americas Program award will support a collaborative
research project between Dr. Jan Hermans, University of North Carolina, Chapel
Hill, and Dr. Francisco Lara Ochoa, Universidad Autonoma Nacional de Mexico,
focusing on complementary studies of loop structures in antibodies. Methods for
study of conformational stability of biological macromolecules with molecular
dynamics simulation will be applied to problems of the conformational
preferences of hypervariable loops of gamma globulins and related molecules.
Calculations will be performed to assess the relative free energies in solution
for different conformers of specificity determining loops. This research
addresses two important scientific questions: the relation between sequence and
structure of immunoglobulin loops and the problem of distinguishing alternate
conformations of proteins on the basis of simulations. Answers to these
questions will have important consequences for understanding the properties of
new immunoglobulin sequences, in the context of protein engineering and disease,
and would be a valuable final step in theoretical studies of the so-called
protein folding problem, which has been a central question in structural biology
for many years. ***
