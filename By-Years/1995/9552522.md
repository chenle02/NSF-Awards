9552522 Pennypacker Lawrence Berkeley Labs developed a CD containing educational
materials, staff training and the software necessary for informal science
education centers to offer to middle school students one- hour sessions,
multiple-day workshops, and ongoing participation in a drop-in computer lab.
Hands-On Universe (HOU) is an active science education program that provides
participants access to observing time on professional telescopes through the use
of a personal computer and the Internet. The CD contains: exploration
experiences and challenge games; resource material including images from other
national labs, descriptions and animations of related topics, and astronomical
catalogs; image processing software; a telecommunications package to interface
with HOU telescopes and support network, the Internet, and World Wide Web; staff
training material. The target audiences are youth in grades three through high
school, and adults.
