This award to Professors Lipsman, Herb, Kudla, and Rosenberg is made under the
Mathematical Sciences Research Groups initiative. It will support postdoctoral
associates, visitors, and graduate students in a series of collaborative
projects in representation theory. Specific foci are representations of p- adic
groups, symmetric spaces, and group C*-algebras. The research will deal with
various aspects of the representation theory of Lie groups, which bear the name
of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie. One basic example of a Lie group is
the group of rotations of a sphere, where the group operation consists of
following one motion by another. Detailed information concerning this group is
very helpful in solving mathematical or physical problems in which spherical
symmetry is present. Other groups of motions capture other kinds of symmetry. A
more algebraic (as opposed to geometric) source of examples of Lie groups comes
from the multiplication of matrices. The group of all invertible real (or
complex) matrices of a given size is a Lie group, as is just about any subgroup
thereof that can be described in a natural manner. It is desirable to be able to
go back and forth between the geometric and algebraic points of view, for
instance to consider the numerous ways in which the rotation group of the sphere
can be realized as a group of invertible matrices. This, roughly, is
representation theory. Facts about the representations of a given group tend to
store a lot of information very economically. Depending on where the group in
question comes from, this information can impinge on almost any subject from
number theory to mathematical physics.
