This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University in acquiring a CCD
Detector System. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) homogeneous arene hydrogenation catalysts, (2)
trinuclear nickel cluster electrocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide,
(3) total synthesis of natural and unnatural products, (4) pharmaceutical
applications of a CCD detector on a rotating anode, and (5) structural studies
of zeolite inclusion compounds The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate
and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule.
The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and
bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
