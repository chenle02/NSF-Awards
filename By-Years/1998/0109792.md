This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test new
methods to detect and distinguish similar strains of the bacteria Haemophilus
influenzae. Ninety-five percent of systemic infections in childhood are caused
by H. influenzae strains of the serotype b. They include meningitis, sepsis,
epiglottitis, pneumonia and otitis media. Bacterial meningitis and epiglottitis
are life-threatening diseases with a lethality of five percent to twenty-five
percent. Thus, a real-time sensor capable of detecting specific strains of H.
influenzae in the parts-per-trillion range is needed. Any new detection device
must be highly sensitive and selective, miniature, self-diagnostic, low cost,
have rapid response time, and require no sample preparation. This Phase I
project proposes such a novel point-of-care detection device for highly
sensitive determination of H. influenzae and other bacteria strains. This
approach builds on recent research conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
using microcantilevers as sensor platforms. The BioTELL sensor will consist of
an array of microcantilevers with one surface derivatized by an antibody coating
receptive to H. influenzae antigens.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the biosensor market for
detection of H. influenzae and other disease causing microorganisms. The primary
customers for products developed through this project are expected to include
pediatricians, general practitioners and consumer households.
