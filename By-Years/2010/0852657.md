0852657&lt;br/&gt;N. R. Aluru &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transport and
interfacial phenomena of water and electrolytes in nanopores have gained
attention over the last decade due to their promise in substantially improving
the performance and efficiency of many applications such as biological/chemical
systems, water purification systems, and fuel cell devices. Carbon nanotubes
(CNT) physical and chemical properties have been investigated for a number of
these applications. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) possess many of the superior
properties of CNTs such as a high Young's modulus and thermal conductivity, but
unlike CNTs, BNNTs exhibit high resistance to oxidation, and a wide band-gap
regardless of its chirality. These exciting properties allow BNNTs to act as
complementary materials to CNTs or even replace the CNTs for many applications.
The goal of this research is to perform extensive computational studies on
transport and interfacial properties of water and ions through BNNTs to not only
establish the fundamentals of nanofluidics in BNNTs but also to enable
development of various applications using BNNTs. The primary objectives of this
proposed research are to (i) perform quantum-mechanical calculations to compute
partial charges of various atoms in bare and functionalized BNNTs, (ii) perform
molecular dynamics simulations to compute structure, dynamics and transport
properties of water and ions in bare and functionalized BNNTs, (iii) perform
continuum and hierarchical multiscale calculations to compute macroscopic
properties (such as current versus voltage, flow rate versus pressure) in BNNTs,
and (iv) explore various applications in energy, sensing and separation. The
research fundamentals and techniques developed as part of this project will be
incorporated into a graduate level course on computational modeling of MEMS and
NEMS offered by the PI. Recruitment of women and minority graduate students,
recruitment of undergraduate students for REU projects, incorporation of project
results into summer schools offered at UIUC are other planned activities.
