9614726 Isachsen A large area of southern Arizona is underlain by a family of
rocks called the Pinal Schist terrane. These rocks are poor understood, and this
inhibits the regional syntheses of Precambrian tectonics. Isachsen's proposal
requests funds to characterize there rocks by isotope geochemical and dating
methods. The results will help establish whether the rocks of this terrane
correlate to adjacent terranes, or whether they constitute a new unique crustal
block. This in-turn will constrain models for the tectonic development of the SW
United States.
