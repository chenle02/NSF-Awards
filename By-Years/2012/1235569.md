The research objective of this award is to understand how contractile cells use
information from their physical microenvironment to dynamically control their
contraction. The observation that cells in different tissues generate different
amounts of tension has led to the concept of ?tensional homeostasis?, in which a
cell organizes itself to maintain a constant tension within a given tissue.
Studies conducted as part of this project will directly tests this hypothesis in
single cells using force microscopy combined with micropatterning to control
cell adhesions and fluorescence microscopy to track key molecules involved in
tension generation. This work will develop new experimental techniques for
quantifying the response of cells to mechanical signals and identify molecular
mechanisms involved in mechanosensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
address basic questions in mechanobiology that have the potential to clarify the
mechanical control parameters cells use to maintain proper physiological tissue
function. This work will also advance the development of computational models of
cell mechanics by establishing constitutive relationships. The educational plan
associated with this project will provide new opportunities for middle school
science students and the general public to learn about the role of mechanics in
biology. Activities for middle school students will be developed that introduce
them to the material properties of objects in their environment, and an exhibit
on properties of materials within the human body will be developed for
presentation at community science events. Both activities will include
undergraduate and graduate students and help to improve their ability to
communicate science to non-scientists.
