PI: Fainman, Yeshaiahu&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1445158&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of California-San Diego&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Cartridge lab-on-chip (CLOC)
for Mobile Health&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile health (mHealth) uses mobile
technologies for health research and healthcare delivery in concert with the
more general electronic health concept which encompasses a wide range of
services that are at the cutting edge of healthcare and information technology,
including access to electronic health records, electronic prescribing,
telemedicine, and health informatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The realization of a
portable, affordable medical diagnostic platform will have a profound impact on
the global level. The proposed research will not only advance the basic science
and technology of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems, but will also lead to the
development of additional LOCs that do not require external optical components.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and develop a smartphone
interface system that would enable rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable
measurements with simultaneous detection using a medical sensing and diagnostic
platform (MSDP) with a disposable cartridge lab-on-a-chip (CLOC) biochip. For
integration with advanced mobile platforms They will utilize Google's open
hardware platform, Project Ara, exploiting Java programming language which is
commonly used by all mobile smartphone companies, including Google's Android.
This device will include the use of an inexpensive, single use, disposable and
universal CLOC that would be available in both developed and developing
countries. The MSDP will perform detection on-chip, obviating the need for bulky
detection equipment, paving the way for a truly portable medical diagnostic add-
on for future smartphones.
