Small RNAs, the recent addition to the repertoire of genetic regulators, play
central roles in key biological processes in bacteria, plants and animals.
Quantitative understanding of the regulatory properties of small RNAs, how
molecular and cellular processes influence them, and how they can adapt and
evolve, is key to understanding the design principles and evolution of
regulatory networks. In this project the PI will study how properties of small
regulatory RNA and their target mRNAs affect the efficiency, noise features, and
evolvability of RNA regulation. Such properties include molecular features of
sequence and structure, and functional properties such as translation rate and
stability. Quantitative experiments and theoretical studies will be employed
synergistically to bridge multiple scales, from the molecular level to cellular
functionality and evolutionary dynamics. The results of this study are expected
to shed new light on the role played by small RNAs in various pathways and to
provide tools that map sequence data into properties of small RNA - target
interaction and its evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This
project bridges between molecular biophysics and quantitative biology, and
exemplifies a true inter-disciplinary approach. It is expected to be of interest
to young researchers from a wide range of disciplines, and the PI will provide
an opportunity for students to experience this type of research by establishing
a discussion group that would follow the project. The PI is developing a new
course intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, which will
discuss a spectrum of biological systems from a quantitative perspective, and
develop the theoretical and practical aspects of modeling complex biological
systems. Small RNA regulation will serve as a central theme in this course.
