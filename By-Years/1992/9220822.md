This research evaluates how attached aquatic microflora (periphyton) regulate
(1) the rates of deposition of organic carbon that is imported from upland areas
or synthesized by aquatic plants and algae in these regions , and (2) the
retention or loss rates of organic carbon. The microbiota accomplish this
regulation by a combination of intensive decomposition of dissolved organic
carbon to CO2 and methane and by burying a significant portion of microbial
biomass that does not decompose. High metabolism and growth results from
intensive recycling of nutrients within the communities. The research program
will examine natural communities under replicated experimental conditions for:
(1) Metabolic and community carbon retention and decomposition to CO2 and
methane in response to substratum. (2) Resistance to nutrient limitations of
phosphorus and nitrogen and the effects on carbon losses. (3) Effects of
different types of dissolved organic compounds on metabolic recycling and carbon
losses. (4) Determination of lateral microscale fluxes of nutrients within these
attached communities. %%% Wetland/ littoral and floodplain land-water interface
regions of lake and river ecosystems are being recognized as major depositional
areas for organic carbon. Organic carbon storage versus evolution of metabolized
carbon in the form of CO2 and methane is important because these 'greenhouse'
gases are critical to global climate change evaluations. ***//
