This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to replace Cu
on-chip interconnects with a graphene technology. Nanoscale Cu interconnects
that make electrical connections to active devices, mainly transistors, are an
essential component of nearly all semiconductor chips. In Complementary Metal
Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Integrated Circuits (ICs), this Cu interconnect
fabric is applied as a separate component to the transistors that are embedded
in the Si wafer. As the dimensions of these transistors are continually scaled
down to improve performance (a trend that major chip manufacturers agree will
continue for the next few decades), the Cu interconnect fabric must also be
scaled in parallel. Whereas transistors improve performance with scaling, the
electrical resistance of Cu interconnects rapidly increases when scaled due to
intrinsic properties of the metal. This brings an abundance of interconnect pain
points to chip manufacturers, limiting their competitive edge for high-
performance and low-power processors. This project develops graphene on-chip
interconnects that can replace Cu and facilitate future IC scaling.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the enabling of a
tremendously diverse portfolio of technologies including, but not limited to,
mobile computing / smartphones, implantable biomedical devices, and hybrid
engine controllers and semiconductor chips cross-pollinate well into broad
commercial applications. Scaling the dimensions of transistors and interconnects
has defined the success that microelectronics (and now nanoelectronics) have
enjoyed for nearly half a century. Technologies that facilitate continued
scaling and keeping pace with Moore's Law are a must for chip manufacturers to
maintain a competitive edge. With scaling comes faster performance, expanded
capabilities, and greater reliability to all of the diverse applications that
are driven by such chip technology.
