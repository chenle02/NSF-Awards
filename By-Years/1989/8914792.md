An important area of magnetospheric research is to understand the dynamics of
the magnetopause current layer which is responsive to solar wind-magnetosphere
coupling processes. The focus of this study will be on the formation and the
stability of the magnetopause current layer using a 2 1/2 dimensional
electromagnetic particle simulation model. Previous results obtained from the
model revealed that the self-consistent boundary layer between the solar wind
and the dipolar magnetic field is unstable with respect to transverse
perturbations whose wavelengths were of the order of a solar wind ion
gyroradius. The study will extend previous work on the current layer in many
directions by using the simulation model and by analytic theory. For example,
the anomalous diffusion at the boundary will be studied as well as the formation
and stability of the boundary layer.
