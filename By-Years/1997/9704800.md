THOMPSON, ABSTRACT 9704800 The proposer plans to continue the study of finite
projective planes, especially the Galois-theoretic aspects of incidence
matrices. Additionally, the proposer will continue the study of realizing simple
groups as Galois groups , especially of covers of the complex projective plane
with 4 branch points. Finally, the proposer will continue his interest in the
Lyons-Solomon work on providing a detailed, coherent proof of the classification
of finite simple groups. The theory of groups is a central area of research in
mathematics because its methods apply generally to the study of many
mathematical objects through the properties of symmetry and geometric
transformation.
