This project is evaluating a new architectural paradigm that can extract and
exploit the parallelism in sequential code. This new approach uses both software
scheduling in the compiler, as in VLIW, and hardware scheduling at run-time, as
in superscalar architectures. The compiler segments code into large blocks of
instructions that form subgraphs of the control-flow graph, though not
necessarily basic blocks. The compiler appends synchronization information to
each block that describes which registers must be shared with blocks. The
compiler appends synchronization information to each block that describes which
registers must be shared with other blocks. The blocks or tasks are passed to
separate identical parallel execution units, each of which executes its task
sequentially. Tasks are scheduled optimistically, so that some tasks may be
executed by a unit when they would not be executed in a sequential system; in
such cases, the tasks are "squashed," which means that their results are not
written to memory or registers. At the end of each task, it blocks until the
system determines that the task will not be squashed; at that time results are
committed. The collection of execution units appears logically to be one unit,
with a single register file. Shared register values are passed on an inter-
execution-unit network, and tasks that need shared values block until the values
are produced. During the first two years of this award is devoted to compiler
design for the new architecture, to comparison with other architectures using
simulation, and to conceptual refinement of the architecture. During later
years, work is expected to focus on implementation.
