The majority of responsible conduct of research interventions focus on broad
compliance and are presented as an annual one-off training rather than being
grounded in the actual experiences of researchers. This project aims to improve
lab data collection, record-keeping, and data stewardship practices in STEM
disciplines to integrate attention to responsible conduct of research. The
project addresses these needs by creating and disseminating effective toolkits
to support labs in creating and maintaining customized strong practices to
document and share their discoveries and progress. This work includes two
phases. A research phase focuses on the causal effects of a communication
intervention focused on data management at a single university site. The
development phase will draw on the research findings and the team's experience
in creating responsible conduct of research materials to develop the toolkit to
be disseminated widely to researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An earlier project
demonstrated that the evidence-based communication approach (deliberative lab
conversations) improved the way labs approach the issues of authorship and
ethics. This project extends the work to data management practices. Through the
research phase, the team will adapt the evidence-based communication approach to
incorporate data management practices, assess its efficacy in context, and
support its adoption by developing and disseminating an easy-to-use, practical
toolkit. The efficacy of the approach will be tested by assessing the quality of
labsâ€™ data management plans, and their internal communication, before and after
the intervention via pre/midpoint/post surveys. Participating labs will be
federally funded STEM and biomedical research labs on a single campus. Using
information from this investigation, the project will develop engaging, relevant
video and written case study materials to help labs create tailored data
management plans fitting their research personnel, equipment, and methods. This
will include range of openly available introductory and just-in-time practical
resources to support adoption and ongoing lab use to make the communication
approach and data management practices more widely
available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Improving
Undergraduate STEM Education, Innovations in Graduate Education, and Ethical and
Responsible Research Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
