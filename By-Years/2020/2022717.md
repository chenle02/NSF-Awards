This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project
competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research
through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding
organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global
environmental change challenges and opportunities. It aims to accelerate
delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical
barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources.
Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium
to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach
facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent
research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational
approach, recognizing that global challenges need global
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on coral reefs â€“ one of the
most valuable ecosystems on the planet that are being lost at an alarming rate.
This loss threatens human lives because coral reefs provide food, income, and
shoreline protection. Efforts are underway worldwide to rehabilitate reefs, with
mixed success. This project uses a novel approach to rebuild coral reef
ecosystems by building artificial reefs and seeding them with biota from healthy
coral reefs. The project will be carried out in Ranobe Bay in southwest
Madagascar which contains 32 kilometers of coastline with 13 villages,
increasing populations, and growing rates of malnutrition largely caused by
overfishing. The primary goal is to rebuild healthy coral reef ecosystems and
increase fisheries catch in Madagascar to reduce the incidence of malnutrition
in the most impoverished country in the world. All aspects of the project will
involve local scientists and fishers. The project will utilize cutting edge
tools, including environmental DNA barcoding, fisher supported GPS tracking of
fisheries activities, and extensive human health and well-being data collection
to comprehensively connect ecosystem health to human health. This project will
provide a comprehensive blueprint for other coral reef restoration projects by
thoroughly testing a new technology, creating tools to measure success,
providing a guide describing the ecosystem to human health data collection
protocols. Overall, this project will greatly enhance the equitable and
sustainable use of marine resources and will respond to a threat caused by
global change, all with a tool that can be applied anywhere coral reef
ecosystems are found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
