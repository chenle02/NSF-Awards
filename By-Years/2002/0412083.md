This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a feasibility
study to produce two-submicron inorganic powders via solvent-free processing
routes. One of the materials is the anionic clay known as hydrotalcite, which is
used as an antacid and a PVC additive. The other material is a glass-zirconia
composite, which is a promising candidate for making glass-ceramic dental
materials. Structure-function relationships suggest that production of these two
types of inorganic powders in particle sizes at or below one micron should
translate into materials with improved performance over commercially available
forms.

For both target materials, the key advantages over current manufacturing methods
are simplicity in terms of the processing steps; solvent-free manufacturing; and
cost. Mechanochemical production of submicron powders should also compete
favorably with more exotic syntheses leading to nanosized powders.
