The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will develop and maintain
&lt;br/&gt;an on-line database of information on doctoral engineers and computer
scientists &lt;br/&gt;and students pursuing graduate degrees in all fields of
engineering and &lt;br/&gt;computer and information sciences. Individuals
featured in the database will be &lt;br/&gt;U.S. citizens or permanent
residents. QEM will strongly encourage the &lt;br/&gt;registration of
individuals from minority groups underrepresented in these fields
&lt;br/&gt;(African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific
Islanders). The &lt;br/&gt;proposed database (INFLOW) will be designed to serve
as a one-stop source of &lt;br/&gt;basic information on engineers and computer
scientists in academia, industry, &lt;br/&gt;and government that can be
regularly updated by participants via QEM.s web &lt;br/&gt;site using
individually assigned passwords.
