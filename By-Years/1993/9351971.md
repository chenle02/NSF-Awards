To generate interest in science and to create future scientists in psychology,
undergraduate students must be educated in an environment that facilitates their
involvement in research and in the curriculum that is research based. As the
environment in experimental psychology changes, so too must undergraduate
institutions that are educating our future psychologists. This proposal seeks to
obtain funding to establish a micro-computer laboratory in human experimental
psychology for undergraduate psychology majors to enhance the curriculum of four
existing courses; namely, Cognitive Processes, Psychology of Learning,
Psychology of Perception, and Experimental Psychology and Laboratory. The micro-
computer laboratory in human experimental psychology will consist of 486
computers and a software package.
