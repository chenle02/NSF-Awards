This award will support collaborative research in mathematics between Dr.
Richard Bass, University of Washington, and Dr. Martin Barlow, Statistical
Laboratory, University of Cambridge, U.K. Professors Bass and Barlow propose to
work on several problems in the area of diffusions on fractals. Problems include
the construction of Brownian motion on fractals imbedded in Euclidean space with
dimension greater than 2, the uniqueness of Brownian motion on nested fractals,
and the identification of the Dirichlet form for Brownian motion on the
Sierpinski carpet. Drs. Bass and Barlow are both considered to be leaders in
this area of research. The project will greatly benefit from their joint
expertise and past history of fruitful collaboration.
