ABSTRACT L. James Lee CTS-9411462 Researchers from five academic units at the
Ohio State University: Chemical Engineering, Engineering Mechanics, Mechanical
Engineering, Welding Engineering, and Physics, will purchase a versatile
rehological measurement system which will be dedicated to support research in
engineering and advanced materials. This equipment will be used for research
projects with major emphasis on reactive processing of polymers and composites;
processing of thermoplastic polymers; rheology of colloids, emulsions, and
polymer solutions; joining of polymer and composite structures; rheology of
biomaterials; and processing and properties of conducting polymers. These
projects are currently supported by NSF, NIH, NIST, DOE, ONR, ARPA, TRP Program,
the State of Ohio, The Ohio State University and various industries. Rheological
measurements of materials in both fluid and solid states are essential for these
projects. ***
