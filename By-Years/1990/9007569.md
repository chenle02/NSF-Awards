This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Harry A. Morrison at Purdue University. This research will yield
results of fundamental significance about chemical processes that result from
the interaction of organic molecules with light. Dr. Morrison's research is
designed to provide important information about the reactivity of photochemical
intermediates, particularly those generated from difunctional molecules. The
investigation will focus on understanding three related phenomena: (1) the
photochemical consequences of orbital mixing for molecules having two non-
conjugated functional groups, (2) intramolecular photosensitization in
multifunctional molecules, and (3) photochemical processes involving molecules
in upper electronic and vibrational excited states. Molecular orbital
calculations will be employed to interpret and correlate the experimental
results.
