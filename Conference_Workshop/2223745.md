This award supports the 2023, 2024, and 2025 meetings of the Texas Oklahoma
Regional Undergraduate Symposium (TORUS) series. The first of these will be held
on February 18, 2023, at Dallas College. Subsequent symposia will be held in
February 2024 at Southern Nazarene University and February 2025 at Tarleton
State University. TORUS is an annual one-day conference that has been held since
2005 at different universities in the Texas and Oklahoma regions. It provides
opportunities for undergraduates interested in the study of mathematics to
participate in scholarly and social activities in mathematics with other
colleges and universities with the goal of encouraging students to pursue
graduate study and careers in mathematics. TORUS also helps strengthen
connections between undergraduate-focused colleges/universities in the Texas
Oklahoma region and encourages faculty at these institutions to pursue research
projects with undergraduate students.

Each symposium includes two invited talks, student presentations, a panel
discussion, and Math Jeopardy. Furthermore, students will have the opportunity
to share the results of their research (for example, a paper or poster) with a
larger audience via the conference website. The conference website is

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
