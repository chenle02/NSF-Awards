This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the Marine Biological Laboratory
for the renovation and repair of Lillie Research Laboratory which contains year-
round and summer, nonclinical, independent research laboratories that house
research and research training activities in cellular, developmental, molecular
and neurobiological sciences as well as in marine ecology. This building was
constructed in several phases beginning in 1913 and last renovated in 1958. The
ARFMP grant of $575,000 and $726,600 provided by the grantee as cost sharing
will be used to modernize these research and research training facilities. This
project will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure
both in terms of health and safety and of reduced risk of loss of research data
and frozen samples. The renovation will provide adequate environmental control
in a deleterious marine climate and an emergency electrical power system, along
with an upgraded heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system; and
all asbestos will be removed from the building. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the conduct
of research and for the training of pre-college students and teachers as well as
graduate students. Because of the international and national position of the
Marine Biological Laboratory, the wider research community will also benefit
from this modernization.
