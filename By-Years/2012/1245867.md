Assured systems, those systems that exhibit confidentiality, integrity, and
availability and whose security properties have been verified or proven, are
essential for the United States' national security. This project is developing
the necessary learning materials and strategies to equip undergraduate computing
students with the following capabilities, which are essential for building
assured systems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The ability to account for system
security from the start in the form of requirements, specifications, policies,
and concepts of operation.&lt;br/&gt;2. The ability to use security and
integrity mechanisms (such as authentication and reference monitors) to satisfy
confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.&lt;br/&gt;3. The
ability to apply computer-assisted reasoning tools (such as theorem provers and
model checkers) to formally verify security properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
learning materials being created include a series of hands-on lab exercises that
incorporate security concepts and mechanisms, as well as functional programming
and theorem proving. Materials also include hands-on projects that integrate
both security and assurance, requiring students to walk the virtuous cycle of
specification, design, implementation, and verification. Through these
activities, students experience first-hand how theory, concepts, and tools can
be combined to solve real-world problems. This project is identifying the
educational foundations necessary for producing graduates who can build assured
systems to support the nation's critical infrastructure. The activity-based and
modular nature of the project's learning materials will help foster adoption by
a wide range of educators, including those whose primary expertise is not in
assurance.
