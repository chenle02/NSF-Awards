The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technology to increase the mobility of existing power wheelchairs
that are currently limited to usage over short travel distances and over short
time periods. With an emphasis on the affordability of the autonomous
wheelchair, end-users will enjoy the affordability benefits of the product.
Autonomous wheelchairs will enhance safety and reduce injury due to
inappropriate operation or unawareness of dangerous scenarios. Enhanced mobility
can create a more equitable and inclusive environment for people in
disadvantaged communities, enabling end-users to navigate independently in a
crowd.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of an autonomous driving
wheelchair that may provide more efficient, affordable, reliable, and accessible
transportation options for underserved and disadvantaged communities. The
feasibility of developing affordable and reliable autonomous wheelchairs is
demonstrated through an innovation for autonomous navigation. Based on initial
research, the new navigation method can significantly reduce computation cost
for computing collision-free navigation without sacrificing other performance
attributes such as ride comfort.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
