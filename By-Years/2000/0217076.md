operating funds for the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF) during 2002.
Resources provided for under this proposal include the Human Occupied Deep
Submergence Vehicle Alvin, the Remotely Operated Vehicles Jason, Medea, Argo and
DSL?120. These assets will be used to support NSF?sponsored ,oceanographic
science programs utilizing the engineering and operational personnel of Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution's Deep Submergence
Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed operating schedule contains a total of
321 operating days for DSV ALVIN and the ROVs. The DSV days will be supported on
the R/V ATLANTIS with 13 cruises for the National Science Foundation, The
facility will also support 3 cruises for National Ocean and Atmospheric
Administration and one joint cruise for NOAA, NSF and Navy. The ROV days will be
supported on the R/Vs ATLANTIS and THOMPSON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cruises
will mainly take place in the Pacific Ocean and will range from the Galapagos
Islands off Ecuador to the Aleutian Islands off Alaska and include waters off
