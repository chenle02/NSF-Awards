Parallel processing systems will be studied from a queueing theoretic point of
view, under general assumptions of stationarity and ergodicity of the random
input flow of jobs. The jobs have some complex internal structure, consisting of
multiple elementary tasks, that have to be executed by a system of processors,
according to some specifications. The classical queueing theoretic problems of
stability, asymptotic stationarity etc. will be addressed, as well as control
theoretic problems of optimal dynamic scheduling of jobs to processors in order
to optimize the performance of the system, for example, maximize the throughput.
Analysis will focus on basic prototypical models of parallel processing,
capturing the essential operational characteristics of large classes of parallel
processing systems. The research is important for understanding the operation of
parallel processing systems at a fundamental mathematical level and establishing
techniques to optimize their performance, based on a solid mathematical
methodology, contrary to the largely heuristic current practice.
