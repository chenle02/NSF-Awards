The conference Transformation Groups 2017 will be a meeting of mathematicians
specializing in various aspects of transformation group theory. The conference
will be held on December 14-19, 2017, at the Independent University of Moscow.
The speakers will be leading experts in various aspects of transformation groups
who are making major contributions to this and related fields. The conference
will be a major event, attracting a large segment of the mathematical community
working in various aspects of transformation group theory. The broad spectrum
and great current interest in the topics to be discussed at the conference will
make it especially useful for early-career mathematicians.

Transformation group theory plays an important role in various areas of
mathematics, from algebraic geometry to representation theory to analysis. The
aim of the conference is to present current progress on the following related
topics: algebraic groups and geometric invariant theory including the theory of
spherical varieties; transformation groups in differential geometry, analysis
and topology; structure and representation theory of Lie algebras and their
generalizations, such as affine and vertex algebras or W-algebras; and discrete
subgroups of Lie groups and discrete transformation groups. More details about
the conference are available at https://www.mccme.ru/tg2017/.
