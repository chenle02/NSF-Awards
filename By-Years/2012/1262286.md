The recently demonstrated ability to stretch out long segments of DNA for
genomic mapping points to a need to better understand the behavior of DNA in
extreme confinement. This goal of this proposal is to develop an "engineering
quality" description for the equilibrium properties and dynamics of long DNA
molecules under extreme confinement in a nanochannel and to compare the
predictions with experimental observations generated by BNG and its
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project can help the
development of this new DNA mapping technology by providing a fundamental
understanding of DNA confined in nanochannels. This is also an excellent
academic-industrial partnership that can help the development of next-generation
DNA sequencing and mapping technologies.
