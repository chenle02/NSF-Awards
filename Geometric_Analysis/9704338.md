9704338 Kapouleas The proposal consists of two somewhat distinct groups of
projects. The first group of project deals with various geometric constructions
by singular pertubation methods. These include constructions using
desingularization of intersecting minimal surfaces, minimal hypersurfaces and
constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in higher dimensional Euclidean space, and
Einstein four-manifolds. The second group of projects lie in the area of general
relativity. In particular, the PI, in collaboration with Christodoulou, will try
to settle uniqueness and stability questions for the Kerr and Schwarzschild
black holes. Minimal surfaces arise as various physical surfaces; they have the
remarkable property of minimizing the surface area amongst all surfaces bounded
by the same spatial contour. Minimal surfaces can also used to model condensed
matter. Stability questions for black holes, which involve examining the
interaction of a black hole with weak gravitational waves, have important
applications in cosmology.
