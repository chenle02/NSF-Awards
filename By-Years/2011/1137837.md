In order to strengthen graduate education in representation theory and help our
graduate students gain international working experiences, the proposed project
is to support the travel of U.S. graduate students to attend the second US-China
summer program during during June 28-July 10 2011 at South China University of
Technology. The summer program will feature 3 or more short courses given by
leading experts on algebraic, analytic, combinatorial, and geometric aspects of
representation theory. About 50 Chinese students from more than half dozen major
mathematical departments and research centers in China will attend the joint US-
China summer school.

Representation theory has been a central theme in mathematics and physics for
the last several decades. It is so broad that almost all major mathematical
areas have connections to it. Many research groups world wide do work related to
representation theory from various perspectives using different tools. Thus it
is especially important that a graduate student training in this area has
exposure to some of the breadth of the area.
