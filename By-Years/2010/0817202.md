Linguists are working toward understanding what all human languages have in
common and, simultaneously, toward understanding the ways in which human
languages differ from one another, and what the limits on those differences are.
In recent years, the number of languages taken into account has been increasing
substantially. So much so that it has become increasingly difficult to keep
track of them, and to integrate the data, the descriptions, and the theoretical
implications that this ever larger number of languages is feeding into the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of this database, designed with
support from this Special Grant for Exploratory Research, will be to provide a
tool to linguists which will allow them to explore the connections between the
various properties of the world's languages. The planned database will take
inspiration from open-ended systems such as Wikipedia. It will be constructed in
such a way as to allow linguists from anywhere in the world to add new language
data to it, and with an eye toward interoperability with other language data
being collected, curated and archived for similar purposes.
