Providing learning and support opportunities for early-career faculty is an
important strategy to improve undergraduate geoscience education, strengthen
faculty research and scholarship, and address issues of diversity and inclusion
in the Geosciences. To this end, in partnership with the National Association of
Geoscience Teachers, a team of experienced faculty leaders in geoscience
education will host three annual workshops to help early-career geoscientists
advance their understanding of best practices in pedagogy. The project supports
NSF goals of fostering the development of a globally competitive scientific and
engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Early Career Faculty Workshops
will be held at the University of Maryland and will include approximately
seventy-five participants each summer. The workshops will be nationally
advertised, and participation by faculty who are from minority serving
institutions and community colleges will be encouraged. In addition to
evaluation of the workshop activities, the project will complete a comprehensive
evaluation of the impact of the Early Career Workshop program, including a
longitudinal study of past participants. This evaluation will provide important
insights into the long-term impact of early career professional development and
training. This project is funded by Division of Undergraduate Education, the
Division of Earth Sciences, Division of Ocean Sciences, and the Office of Polar
Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
