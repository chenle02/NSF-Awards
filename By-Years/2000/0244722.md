The proposed research will focus on finding a theory beyond the standard model
of elementary particle physics that will be capable of explaining quantities
such as the pattern of quark and lepton masses. String theory is a potential
candidate theory to solve this problem, however the theory has many degenerate
ground states labeled by the value of the moduli fields. Thus the predictability
of the masses problem is replaced by being able to determine the value of the
moduli fields. The goal of this research effort is to compute the value of all
the moduli fields in a realistic model. The approach is to introduce warped
space times that naturally generate large hierarchies of physical scales. The PI
proposes to determine the properties of the background geometry of string
compactifications in the presence of fluxes. This might make it possible to
determine the nature of broken supersymmetry and allow a determination of the
cosmological constant.
