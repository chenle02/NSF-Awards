This project will explore a new and general model that ties together three
parameters - an organism's growth rate, its elemental composition, and a new
parameter referred to as catalysis power - to predict that there will be a
tradeoff between growth rate and competitive ability when the concentration of
one element controls changes in another. The model, called the Elemental Linkage
Model, is highly general and makes a single assumption - that organisms maintain
balanced growth or equal specific rates of change of all elements within
organism biomass. Considerable previous work on phosphorus concentrations in
freshwater zooplankton supports the application of the Element Linkage model to
these organisms. This project will focus on the growth-competition tradeoff the
model predicts. Food threshold experiments (to measure growth rates) and
competition trials will be initiated using seventeen species of cladoceran
zooplankton and six clones of one species to compare predictions of the
Elemental Linkage Model at several taxonomic levels. These comparisons will be
used to detect interspecific growth-competition tradeoffs, which the linkage
model predicts will occur on low-P but not high-P foods. These experiments
explore thoroughly this tradeoff using an otherwise well-known experimental
system and extend the application of stoichiometric (nutrient abundances and
ratios) models to competitive interactions. Broader impacts of the research will
be to advance a potentially important new model in ecology. Career and
educational opportunities will be generated for the PI, a graduate student, a
technician and extended to undergraduates and high school teachers, who will
participate in the project via ongoing University of Minnesota initiatives.
