The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
identification of industrial users interested in harnessing olfactory receptor-
based biosensors for the rapid detection of chemical and biological targets in
the environment or complex aqueous systems. Unambiguous detection of target
chemicals in complex samples has the potential to improve water treatment
processes, detect chemical threats in the field, and identify environmental
pollutants. Precise detection of biologicals in complex samples has the
potential to identify biomarkers for disease diagnosis, reveal contaminated food
and water supplies, and alert to airborne pathogens in the environment. The
large number of solutions that olfactory-receptor-based sensors have the
potential to offer speaks to the large potential commercial impact of this
technology.

This I-Corps project leverages the proteins used in odor detection to generate
chemical sensors that fluoresce upon chemical detection. To date, this
technology has been used to generate biosensors with flouroescent readout to
detect chemicals ranging from biofuels and environmental pollutants to
pharmaceutical intermediates and perfumes. Among other applications, the sensors
are being used to improve the performance of whole cell and enzyme biocatalysts
for the improved production of chemicals. This I-Corps project explores the
commercial potential of the innovation to better define the technical
requirements of olfactory-based biosensors in commercial applications.
