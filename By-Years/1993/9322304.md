9322304 Ellis This grant will support the undergraduate summer experience of six
to eight students each year. Half of the students will be women specifically
recruited from the Twelve College Exchange Program already in place, and the
other half will be Wesleyan physics students. The Physics Department will use
this added opportunity for physics summer research to bring more women into
physics by using the Twelve College Exchange Program to significantly increase
the pool of prospective women. This combination has the added benefit of
eliminating the time obstacle to real research involvement during only one
summer. The research will follow a semester or two of academic study at the host
institution (Wesleyan) and the participating students will have already
acclimated themselves to the environment within the Physics Department by the
beginning of the summer. This will integrate the summer research as part of a
larger physics experience for the student and at the same time make it more
productive for the host researcher. ***
