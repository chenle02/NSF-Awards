9361961 Leyva BBO and LBO class materials will be studied for possible
application as UV sensitive photorefractive materials. Undoped samples of BBO
and LBO will be doped by high temperature diffusion with various transition
metal species to determine their suitability for storing high efficiency
holographic gratings. Oxidation and reduction heat treatments will be carried
out on the resulting materials to optimize their photorefractive properties. The
results will be used to determine the optimum material and dopant configuration
for a future crystal growth effort. ***
