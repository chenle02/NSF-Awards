This research will explore the potential for measuring Sr/Ca ratios in coral
skeletons deposited during the night as a reliable proxy for sea-surface
temperature (SST). The work will test the hypothesis that Sr/Ca in aragonite
deposited during the daytime contains a vital effect due to algal symbionts but
that aragonite deposited during the night is in thermodynamic equilibrium with
ambient SST. PIs will first identify portions of coral skeleton in modern corals
deposited during nighttime and then use SIMS ion microprobe to calibrate Sr/Ca
as a proxy for SST. After the calibration studies are done Sr/Ca will be
measured in nighttime aragonite from fossil corals recovered from Barbados and
Vanuatu to determine tropical SST during the last glacial. &lt;br/&gt;
