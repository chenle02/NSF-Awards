Fundamental research will be conducted on the structure of materials, especially
structure at crystal surfaces. The primary theoretical tool will be realistic
atomic-scale calculations carried out using a plane-wave pseudopotential
approach to the local density approximation density-functional theory. The
recent successful development of a new pseudopotential approach allows for the
efficient application of these methods to systems containing first-row and
transition-metal atoms. Both "static" total energy and structural refinement
calculations, and finite temperature ab- initio molecular dynamics calculations,
will be done. As in the past, a primary emphasis will be on structure at crystal
surfaces, especially semiconductor surfaces. Previous calculations of surface
stress and studies of elastic properties at surfaces and surface defects will be
extended, with special emphasis on complex stress-induced surface structure and
on elastic interactions between surface defects such as steps. New work will be
done on oxides of silicon, tungsten, silver and gold. This involves study of
bulk liquid and solid structure using ab-initio molecular dynamics, as well as
study of oxygen at semiconductor, metal and metal-oxide surfaces.
