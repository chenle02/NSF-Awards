This project addresses several problems form the area of information theory and
coding. In the area of channel coding, the work will address error correction
and modulation codes for storage channels, techniques for burst error correction
coding, codes which detect unidirectional error patterns and correct random
error patterns , and multi-user channel coding from a unified information theory
and network theory point of view. In the source coding area, the research will
consider the problems of estimation through compressed information, Huffman
codes with reservations, and some adaptive lossy data compression algorithms.
