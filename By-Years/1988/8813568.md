This effort is a component of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study Northeast
Atlantic Spring Bloom Experiment. The specific effort of this study will be to
measure vertical beam attenuation and pigment fluorescence profiles along the 20
W transect and to provide, near-surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll
fluorescence and incident irradiance profiles. In addition to the above, time-
series data will be provided to investigate the formation of the near-surface
pigment maximum during summer stratification. This will be done by deploying
temperature, oxygen, and radiance sensors with appropriate data loggers and
current meters and on free-floating particle trap arrays.
