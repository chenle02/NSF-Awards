This project is motivated by several classical areas of mathematics. The main
tools come from combinatorics, including combinatorial topology, algebraic
combinatorics, and the machinery of quiver mutations. Combinatorics deals with
discrete objects such as finite sets, graphs, permutations, partial orders, etc.
Many continuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation, lending
themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study. It is often the case that
identical or similar combinatorial structures underlie seemingly unrelated
mathematical entities, revealing hidden connections between these and allowing
the transfer of insights and techniques from one discipline to another. A case
in point is the theory of cluster algebras, which are the main focus of this
project.

This award supports the PI's research on combinatorial structures arising in
algebra and geometry, with an emphasis on the theory and applications of cluster
algebras. Cluster algebras, discovered by the PI in collaboration with A.
Zelevinsky, have found applications in several mathematical disciplines
including representation theory, Teichmueller theory, mathematical physics, and
enumerative and geometric combinatorics. The investigator intends to further
explore the connections between cluster algebras, on one hand, and classical
invariant theory and projective geometry, on the other. Another research
direction concerns algebraic complexity for computational models employing a
restricted set of arithmetic operations.
