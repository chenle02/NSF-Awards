0331163&lt;br/&gt;Thorson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an extension of
the highly successful book for children "Stone Wall Secrets," authored by the
PI. It reflects a collaboration between the researchers at the College of
Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, the educators at the Neag School of Education at
the University of Connecticut, and the teachers at the Dorothy Goodwin
Elementary School in Storrs, CT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is producing a
standards-based, integrated curriculum that directly addresses needs expressed
by the Connecticut State Board of Education. The project will deliver research-
based, field-tested educational materials that will be catalogued through the
reviewed section of the Digital Library for Earth System Education, &lt;a
href="http://www.dlese.org/"&gt;DLESE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project has three key goals: 1) to integrate geoscience research and education
by enhancing the existing partnership between science and education at the
University of Connecticut, 2) targeting K-8 schooling by developing, evaluating,
revising, and disseminating a standards-based, integrated curriculum based on
"Stone Wall Secrets" and a trans-disciplinary approach curriculum, and 3)
leveraging the innovative, field-tested products after two years into
alternative funding.
