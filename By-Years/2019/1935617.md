This award supports student attendance at the 60th IEEE Annual Symposium on the
Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Baltimore, Maryland from November 9
through November 12, 2019, as well as to support attendance by some qualified
postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and
its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based
conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly
encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a
valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and
for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent years, the
annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who
have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will provide
partial support to about 20 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
