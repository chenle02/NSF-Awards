This project, acquiring a photogrammetry-based 3D acquisition system (multi-
camera computer vision 3D capture system) as a research instrument, aims to
enable easy and repeatable collection of data across a wide range of research
areas (Computer Science, Information Science, Geography, Environmental Science,
Engineering, American Studies, Visual Arts, History, Library Science, etc.). The
system consists of 96 synchronized cameras and associated flash and projection
lights to capture a single object ranging from about 5 centimeters to several
meters instantly. The flexibility of a photo-based system allows the same system
to capture high resolution models over a wide range of scales, and to be equally
useful for a single rigid object, an object in motion, or a person using a
subject, object, or software, all with no object or subject preparation and
minimal setup or reconfiguration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scanning device is
likely to have significant impacts: the projects on assistive technologies
promise a lasting impact on disabled individuals; the brain imaging and genomics
projects promise improvements on diagnostics health; the project will also have
impact in the humanities, in understanding, and in documenting artifacts; and
the digital library project will directly address how data generated by an
instrument like this one can be preserved and
referenced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the project will have impacts on
education and training of students. The center that will house the instrument
has significant undergraduate staff who will be exposed to a state-of-the-art
instrument and the research it enables. Undergraduate assistants, under the
guidance of the center staff, will support the staffing for the instrument.
Moreover, the instrument will impact several classes directly which will be able
to use object and motion scanning equipment that is seldom available to
undergraduates.
