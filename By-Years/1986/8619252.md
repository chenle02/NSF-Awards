The Isua supracrustal rocks and their surrounding gneisses are among the world's
oldest rocks and are truly unique for the study of continental crust. The West
Greenland section also represents some of the best-exposed and best-studied
Archean rocks known and thus constitute a prime target for geophysical studies.
Primary objectives of this study include the Nordlandet granulite terrain,
granitic and anorthositic intrusives, the gray basement gneisses, the Isua
supracrustal rocks, and the crustal transition along the coast. Since
geophysical interpretations for this oldest Archean crust are lacking,
determination of 3-D relationships should contribute greatly to an understanding
of early Earth's crustal processes. This investigation will include a gravity
survey and gravity and magnetic interpretation for this area.
