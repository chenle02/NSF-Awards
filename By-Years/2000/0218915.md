The ITR: Flathead Reservation Wireless Community Network at Salish Kootenai
College would examine, explore, and adjust how people utilize wireless
communications technology on this rural reservation to interface more
effectively from remote locations. This project will facilitate changes in
educational and business organizational processes in fixed wireless
telecommuting through various wireless networking technologies. In addition,
this project will also greatly enhance numerous programs and research projects
both on campus and with other organizations throughout the reservation. Other
activities that will be implemented are technologies and services that assist in
teaching, training and the expansion of innovative educational environments.

The goal of this project is threefold. First, to see how far you can push
wireless technology in a rural and remote environment to provide high-speed
network connections. Second, to radically change the way certain educational and
business organizational processes are carried out. Third, enhance peoples'
experiences with information technology through a variety of wireless
activities.

During the first 6 months of the project, a single high-speed wireless link will
be deployed to provide service to a selected part of the reservation. The second
6 months will focus on conducting the initial research activities, review of any
results. The third 6 months will be devoted to making adjustments and
modifications to ongoing research activities, and the addition of another high-
speed link. The final 6 months will be focused on making the transition to a
fully self-sufficient, community-owned network.

The Flathead Reservation Wireless Community Network will be collaborating with
other tribal entities on conducting research test connections to examine the
usefulness and how people respond to high-speed wireless network connections.
Over the course of the project, various wireless networking technologies will be
employed as they become available to test the reliability, functionality and
practicality of each. Also, this project will collaborate with other NSF-
sponsored projects with a wireless component and/or focus.
