Continued studies of spin-polarized hydrogen and diversification into related
areas, e.g., a search for spin waves and a study of spin diffusion in dilute
3He/4He mixtures polarized in an external magnetic field. And a search for
superconducting and magnetic transitions in heavy-electron materials in the
millikelvin and sub-millikelvin temperature range.
