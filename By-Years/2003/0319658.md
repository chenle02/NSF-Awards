This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
develop a novel process for manufacturing flexible active matrix backplanes on
plastic substrates. The backplane consists of individual amorphous silicon thin-
film transistors (TFTs) in a matrix grid pattern fabricated on a thin sheet of
plastic. The proposed process will use electrographic printing methods (laser
printing) to replace conventional photolithography. The backplanes will be
fabricated using techniques such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
and electrophotograhic patterning. The significance of this innovation is that
it will reduce the number of processing steps compared to photolithography,
lower manufacturing costs, and be compatible with future roll-to-roll
manufacturing. The final goal will be to fabricate a working display based on
these technologies using a polymer dispersed liquid-crystal medium.

Commercially the backplanes are used to control both electrophoretic and liquid-
crystal displays as part of a radio frequency identification (RFID) label. The
commercial applications for the backplane/RFID label include retail electronic
shelf labels, airline security luggage tags, and dynamic camouflaging. The total
market size is estimated at $33 billion annually, with $13 billion in the United
States and $20 billion internationally.
