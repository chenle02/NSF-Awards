Quantitative methods for the display and analysis of a complex mixture of
proteins are needed to analyze changes in the proteome. Two-dimensional gels are
capable of separating a large number of proteins and permit visualization of
patterns of protein expression and post-translational modification (PTM) under
different physiological conditions--but suffer from gel-to-gel reproducibility
problems. The best post-separation protein staining methods are able to detect
proteins down to the range of about 300-1,000 copies per cell, a level
insufficient to monitor many important cellular control proteins that are
present in low copy numbers. New fluorescent dyes that are designed to overcome
major limitations in proteomic methods, as commonly practiced using two-
dimensional gel electrophoresis, will be synthesized and tested in this project.
The new dyes are designed to (1) enhance sensitivity about 300 fold to allow
detection of proteins in the range of 1-3 copies per cell, (2) increase the
solubility of dye-labeled proteins for increasing loading capacity and reduction
of gel artifacts to foster improved protein identification by mass spectrometry,
(3) allow multicolor detection of proteins produced by cells under different
physiological conditions, and (4) permit removal of dyes from labeled proteins
to enhance protease cleavage and improve identification of proteins by mass
spectrometry. The novel, ultrasensitive, multiplex proteomics methods under
development promise to be very widely useful in biological research and
education.
