This Phase 2 project addresses improvements in student pedagogy and educational
materials for the engineering thermodynamics curriculum by completing the
development of an "Engineering Scenario" based learning model. Engineering
Scenarios are textbook supplements based on actual engineering facilities and
equipment. They expand on the case study concept by including skills-based
problems written in the context of the real-world environment, as well as
additional design problems based on design methods and actual solutions at real
facilities that can be used in place of traditional homework problems.
Accompanying supplementary and background information promotes increased
inquiry-based or student-centered learning, better addresses student real world
expectations, and leads to an increase in overall student engagement. A CCLI
Phase 1 grant allowed for the development and repeated formative assessment of a
single scenario. Based on considerable assessment and student feedback the
original concept has been refined to the point of full development. This project
creates a final product ready for widespread dissemination as a textbook
supplement.
