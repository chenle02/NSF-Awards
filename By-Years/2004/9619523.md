9619523 Constraint logic programming (CLP) is a family of programming languages
built upon predicate calculus, with the added expressiveness of constraint-based
problem representations. Each language in the family is distinguished by the
domain of values for the program variables. Prolog is the best-known language in
the family and can be viewed as CLP in the domain of infinite trees. This
research focuses on CLP over a real-number domain (CLP(R)). Implementations of
CLP(R) generally restrict constraints to linear equations and inequalities, and
the resulting languages have proven expressive enough for a variety of
scheduling, warehouse location, cutting stock, options trading, and crew
rostering problems, as well as AI puzzles. However, CLP(R)'s usefulness is
limited by the large search space required for most problems and by the
complexity of the constraint satisfaction algorithm. Stated more simply, it is
not always possible to benefit from CLP's expressiveness, since many useful
problems take too long to solve. The goal of this research is to identify CLP(R)
applications that would be feasible if execution could be sped up, and to find
ways to cut down on execution time through a more efficient constraint
satisfaction algorithm. ***
