\9352396 Van Willis The project will provide funds for the acquisition of an
atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The instrument will be used in the
laboratory courses at all curricular levels from introductory non-science labs,
through quantitative and instrumental analysis, to the senior research program.
The AAS will play an important role in the environmental chemistry program,
where it will be one of the principal tools used to teach the determination and
interpretation of metal concentrations in environmental samples. ***
