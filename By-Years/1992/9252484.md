Calculus and Mathematica is a laboratory course in calculus based on electronic
interactive notebooks written within the Mathematica system. In two years the
teaching of Calculus and Mathematica has spread to more than twenty colleges and
six high schools. The proposed work is continuing this project by extending the
development, dissemination, and evaluation of the existing Calculus &
Mathematica project. Development includes a thorough revision of materials for
Calculus I, Calculus II, and Calculus III, together with a pilot development of
a Differential Equations course. Dissemination includes implementation in a
network of rural high schools.
