This proposal addresses the major questions of how offspring survivorship and
competitive ability influence adult reproductive behavior in certain species of
neotropical insects whose larvae develop in water-filled treeholes. Because
these species use the same limiting resource (i.e. treeholes), and females are
predictably found in light gaps, differences in mating systems cannot be fully
explained in terms of the distribution of reproductive resources (the
traditional paradigm). The discrete nature of the larval habitat allows
assessment of success in terms of the relative number of offspring surviving to
emergence. Although previous research in Panama suggests that predation among
larvae render territorial defense ineffective for some species, experimental
confirmation of this result is needed. If the working hypotheses are supported,
this study will be one of the first to demonstrate a role of interspecific
competition in the evolution of mating systems.
