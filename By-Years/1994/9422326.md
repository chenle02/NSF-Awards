This research is designed to develop a broad information base on transformations
to quality from a large sample of companies within one industry (concrete
piping). It will identify practices or combinations of practices related to
successful transformations, as well as identifying catalysts for, and barriers
to successful transformation. The research also will provide benchmark
information against which future transformations to quality can be assessed, and
it will identify and isolate the steps necessary to achieve effective
transformation. Data will be obtained through a multi-faceted survey of 238
member facilities of theAmerican Concrete Pipe Association, through surveys of
over 2,000 customers of these concrete pipe makers, and through intensive
investigations of approximately five of the facilities. Information will be
obtained about the specific quality initiatives in use, the contextual factors
surrounding the use of these initiatives, the factors that promote or impede the
success of the quality initiatives, and about perceived and objective
performance and quality outcomes. The interdisciplinary research team includes
both behavioral scientists and engineers. The primary industry organization
participating in this study is the American Concrete Pipe Association.
