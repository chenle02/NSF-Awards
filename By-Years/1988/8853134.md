The goal of this project is to improve the teaching of Instrumental Analysis by
use of an integrated approach and state-of-the-art instruments which typify
contemporary research in the chemical sciences. The introduction of the use of
modern Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) techniques will be made possible by teaching students the
fundamentals of instrumentation with computer aided instruction followed by
hands-on experience in a series of four subdiscipline laboratory courses. This
ILI award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington to acquire GC/MS and
FTIR instrumentation that will be used to enhance undergraduate laboratory
instruction.
