9457828 Bruno This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young
Investigator Award, will focus on mathematical problems related to
microstructure and material properties. In particular, research will be
conducted on homogenization of composite materials and nonlinear homogenization
for shape memory polycrystals. Existence problems for three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium, resonant electromagnetic scattering, and
related issues in numerical analysis and approximation theory will also be
considered. The National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award recognizes
outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's strong
potential for significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
