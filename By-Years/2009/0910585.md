The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
efforts of Professor David A. Shultz of North Carolina State University for the
examination of electron transfer and electron transport. The research group
determines long-range intramolecular electron correlations modulated by
ancillary ligand effects, synthesizes donor-bridge-acceptor biradical ligands
with new bridges and investigates lifetimes and thermal stabilities of
photoinduced valence tautomerism in various compounds. The PI has developed
laboratory experiments on magnetochemistry and group theory and these will be
incorporated into an "in-house" and a public textbook. He mentors a large
percentage of African American and women students.
