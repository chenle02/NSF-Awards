This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing award IRI-9214141.
Both rule-based and neural-network approaches have been useful for the
development of intelligent systems. The main objective of this research is to
develop a robust machine learning and inference system by combining these two
approaches. A novel prototype system toward this objective has been implemented
and tested successfully in a number of practical domains. The research project
comprises of three parts centering around rule- based connectionist networks.
The first is to investigate an inductive learning method which combines neural
learning and symbolic artificial intelligence techniques. The second is to
investigate the knowledge-based neural network approach for revising existing
knowledge and learning new knowledge. The third is to investigate an incremental
rule-based connectionist model for machine learning.//
