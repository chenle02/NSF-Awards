This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program, Jeffrey B. Johnson and colleague Moses Lee from
Hope College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to support research that
includes mechanistic elucidation of transition metal-catalyzed carbon-carbon
bond activation methodology, design of prodrugs for possible applications in
prostate cancer, synthesis and analysis of organic photochromes, polymer
synthesis and characterization for use in light emitting electrochemical cells
(LEC), and assessment of phosphates in lake sediments. The spectrometer will
also provide research opportunities at collaborating community colleges through
cyber infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, environmental and energy
research. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as
research.
