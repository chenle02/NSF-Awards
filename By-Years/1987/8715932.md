An ultracentrifuge will be acquired to support neuroscience and physiological
research. Among the projects to be enhanced are studies on the role of the
olfactory adenylate cyclase in chemosensory cilia of the bullfrog; the
compartmentalization of glycolytic metabolism in Leishmania; the intracellular
water in cultured heart cells and evaluating the role of the sodium- potassium
pump in regulating the water volume.
