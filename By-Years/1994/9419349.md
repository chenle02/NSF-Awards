9419349 Robert Sokal There are currently two contending hypotheses for the
origin of the Indo-European speakers. Sir Colin Renfrew has challenged the
established view, propounded by Marija Cimbutas, that the Indo-Europeanization
of Europe proceeded in three waves between 4400 and 2800 B.C. from the Pontic
Steppes, north of the Black Sea. Renfrew has the Indo- Europeans arising in
Anatolia much earlier (ca. 7000 B.C.) and entering Europe as early
agriculturalists, distributing themselves through Europe with the spread of the
Neolithic. Both of these hypotheses should have very different consequences for
the subsequent population relationships among European groups. Robert Sokal has
constructed a unique database on European ethnohistory, recording the location
and movements of most known ethnic units from 2200 B.C. to the present. In an
earlier pilot project, his has established the utility of the database in making
further predictions of patterns of genetic variation over the European
continent. He can now proceed to testing the two overarching (and conflicting)
hypotheses of Indo-European origins and dispersal in Europe. ***
