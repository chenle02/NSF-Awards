CAREER: A Novel CMB Polarization Experiment based on Large Arrays of Coherent
Polarimeters ABSTRACT

AST 0449809 Amber Miller

Dr. Amber Miller, at Columbia University, will undertake a research program
related to the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The PI will
develop a 40 GHz "pathfinder array", to be used for observations of the CMB, and
ultimately pave the way for production of a larger-format camera. With this
instrument, it should be possible to increase observational sensitivity to
polarization anisotropy, and better constrain foreground polarization
contaminants. The PI will involve undergraduates in her research. A pilot
program, involving a local high school teacher and two students in the PI's
research, will also be undertaken - the longer-term goal is to include a student
teacher from Columbia's Teacher's College, during each academic year, in the
effort.
