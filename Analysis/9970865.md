The proposed research deals with discriminants of orthogonal polynomials and
energy minimization problems where the equilibrium energy involves a
discriminant. We will study q-deformed and quantized analogues of discriminants
which are defined as resultants. This involves developing a theory of second
order q-difference equations for polynomials orthogonal with respect to a
positive measures whose masses are concentrated on the union of at most two
geometric progressions. We will also consider certain indeterminate moment
problems whose solution involves elliptic functions and their generating
functions satisfy a Lame type differential equation. The Lame differential
equations are also generating functions for a family of biorthogoal rational
functions which are related to R-type continued fractions, a class of continued
fractions Masson and I introduced and recently arose in solving generalized
eigenvalue problems. We also intend to study spectral theory of second order
operator equations involving the Askey-Wilson divided difference operator.



We plan to study the equilibrium position of a system of particles in an
external field and find explicit formulas for the energy at equilibrium. We also
intend to determine how large the energy gets when the number of particles gets
large. This will be done in different one dimensional models. Mathematically
this leads to a theory of the so called deformed infinite dimensional Lie
algebras (named after Sophus Lie). Another focus will be moment problems where
the observations (moments) do not necessarily determine the distribution (the
physical law) but nevertheless one can find ``best" distributions. We are also
concerned with spectral theory of the operators called the Askey-Wilson
operators. What we are trying to achieve is to describe their spectrum, which
means describe the possible states of the physical system obeying these
equations.
