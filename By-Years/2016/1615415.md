Enzymes are critical for life. Understanding how the atoms in enzymes move
during the chemical reactions they catalyze is integral for the design of
enzymes that would catalyze novel reactions and would lead to advances in the
fields of biotechnology and drug design. This research aims to impact these
fields through the characterization of enzyme motions and their importance to
catalytic function. In addition to the direct impact on differing scientific
areas, this project will result in the training of postdoctoral scientists in
state-of-the-art biophysical techniques to enable their transition to
independent researchers. Moreover, this project will recruit and train
undergraduates, from underrepresented groups, in modern biophysical
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanism by which the catalytic activity of
enzymes is regulated often involves the relay of structural or dynamical
perturbations in the enzyme between a distant (allosteric) site and the
catalytic (active) site. This project will examine the allosteric regulation of
the human enzyme, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) using solution nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) and computational methods coupled with biochemical
experiments. These methods will enable examination of the kinetics,
thermodynamics, and mechanism of motions in PTP1B. The goals of this project
will be to understand how allosteric changes can be relayed over long molecular-
scale distances and influence chemical reactivity. These goals will be achieved
by characterizing how the binding of small, organic molecules at an allosteric
site changes the structure and atomic flexibility of amino acids at the active
site. In addition, studies will be performed to examine the natural allosteric
site in PTP1B that is utilized in vivo to regulate its catalytic activity. This
combination of experiments will provide new insight into PTP1B function and into
general allosteric models applicable to numerous other important enzymes.
