The research funded under this grant is to determine how to create a rapid
prototyping system which can automatically combine millimeter-size links and
joints with actuators, sensors, and wiring, using kits of component parts and a
novel low-cost assembly system. Identification and design of a minimal
sufficient set of uncured composite-fiber millirobot components will be
explored. The problem of flexible wiring around joints will be addressed using
thin laminations of copper foil and polymers. The use of compliant motion
strategies with fixtures will be studied for precise and reliable micro-part
placement. Experiments to verify reliability of micro-manipulation will be
performed, and results used to improve compliant motion strategies. The design
of novel compliant mechanisms for two-fingered micromanipulation using low-cost
off-the-shelf actuators will be explored. Using these compliant
micromanipulation primitives, an assembly system will be designed which can
automatically and reliably build mechatronic systems with dozens of degrees of
freedom using these component parts. Standardizing the assembly tooling, system
components, and joining processes for this rapid prototyping system will be
studied to allow the easy copying and fabrication of millirobot designs across
institutions.

If this research is successful, it will lead to creation of a common, low-cost
tool which removes barriers to millirobot fabrication, and allows easy sharing
of designs and fabrication sequences among many diverse, widely distributed
users. Understanding will be advanced in rapid prototyping of centimeter scale
mechatronic systems, including design of miniature joint, structure, actuator,
sensor, and wiring components, as well as automatic assembly methods using a
minimal complexity, very low cost robotic manipulation system. This rapid
prototyping tool will enable faster research into millirobot applications such
as miniature surgical robots, by enabling many more designers to construct and
test real millirobots.
