Synchronous machines are an important class of high performance computers.
Machines of this type include linear and systolic arrays such as the WARP
machine, two dimensional arrays such as the Massively Parallel Computer, and
machines with more complex interconnections such as the Connection Machine. The
importance of this class of machines is due in large measure to the scalability
of the architecture. Synchronous machines can be built containing hundreds of
thousands of processors. This scalability, however, implies a corresponding
increase in the complexity of the overall program running on the machine and,
hence, in the difficulty of reasoning, either formally or informally, about the
correctness of that program. The objective of this research is to develop
methods for the formal verification of programs running on synchronous parallel
machines-- specifically machines consisting of a large number of processors that
execute copies of the same program and communicate using message passing. The
basic approach is to prove assertions about a single copy of the program and,
from this proof, infer properties of the entire assembly of programs. The goal
is to develop a complete formal theory based on this approach. As with all
formal methods for reasoning about programs, the concepts, theorems, and general
approach can be expected to have a significant benefit on software development
for such machines--even when that software is developed informally. The software
designer must certainly reason about the correctness of the software even if
that reasoning is done informally. Formal methods can provide a guide to how to
perform that reasoning.
