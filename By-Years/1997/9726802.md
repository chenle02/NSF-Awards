This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
studies of the role of structural defects in lamellar thermotropic and lyotropic
soft matter systems. The collaboration involves Oleg Lavrentovich of Kent State
University's Science and Technology Center on Advanced Liquid Crystal Optical
Materials and Maurice Kleman of the Marie and Pierre Curie University in Paris.
Bernard D. Coleman of Rutgers University will also participate in this project.
The investigators will study the role of defects in surface anchoring and light-
induced structural transformations in materials. In addition they will
investigate transformations and dynamics of defects under shear flow. A second
goal of this collaboration is the writing of a textbook on soft matter physics
for use in a chemical physics interdisciplinary program at Kent State. The US
investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in structural defects in
materials, theoretical mechanics, and rheology. This is complemented by French
expertise in defects and lyotropic liquid crystals. The project will advance
understanding of the structural properties of soft matter systems.
