This project concerns the theory of discrete deterministic nonlinear control
systems and their relationship to continuous time models. The interest is both
discrete time results as such and on sampling and other discretization
techniques, with an emphasis on certain subclasses such as invertible,
polynomial and piecewise linear systems. The theory builds on past research by
the PI and others in these areas. For invertible systems, it is now possible to
obtain Lie-algebraic accessibility conditions very analogous to those known for
continuous time systems. In polynomial case, elementary techniques from
algebraic geometry become useful. Regarding sampling, the main objective is the
understanding of how properties of continuous time physical systems are
preserved under digital control.
