In this project, the PI aims to study very large networks using algebraic and
analytic tools. Large networks like the Internet, molecular lattices and social
networks (such as Facebook) naturally arise in many different areas of real
life. The PI aims to look at these from a new perspective: we consider them as
approximations of an infinite object. For molecular lattices this is a very
natural approach, but via a recently developed theory of sparse graph
convergence we can tackle a much broader class of problems, creating new links
between mathematics, statistical physics and computer science.

The PI will investigate two essentially different, but still related topics. The
first one is the study of extremal values of algebraic invariants of graphs with
a special emphasis on those problems where the conjectured extremal graphs are
not finite. Despite the lack of finite extremal solutions, using the recently
emerging language of Benjamini--Schramm convergence, one can find and analyze
the extremal solutions. This then leads to new asymptotic results on finite
graphs. The second topic is the study of certain special infinite graphs and
lattices via graph limit theory and analytic and algebraic combinatorics. The
general theme is to consider a graph invariant of algebraic nature and analyze
its limiting behaviour using analytic tools. Often the invariants come from
graph polynomials like the matching, chromatic and independence polynomials and
have various ties to statistical mechanics.
