ABSTRACT Collicott Purdue University CTS-9501881 Experiments investigating
internal cavitation and turbulence in steady and pulsed atomizing orifice flows
will be conducted. Applications of non-intrusive shortpulsed optical diagnostics
are proposed to measure and observe cavitation and turbulence within small
orifices. The primary diagnostic tool will be a photochromicdye-based flow
tagging method using a short-pulsed laser. Cavitation in the orifice flows will
be studied with short-pulsed image holography and a special orifice with gap
dimension comparable with the dimensions of modern diesel fuel injector
soifices. Applications of this work includes modern multi-orifice diesel fuel
injectors, spray pain and other coating application, and agricultural spray
application. The teaching plan consists of a new program with editorial and
writing tasks. A common stumbling block for engineering students is the need to
transfer their mathematical knowledge from the equation-solving format of early
courses to delicious, rich flavor to engineering. A series of brief articles to
coach students through this transition is envisioned.
