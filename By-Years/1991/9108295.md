Although data are most often recorded as observations at a single point, on
many occasions the data are actually curves, for example a motion or a growth
pattern or a development process occurring over time. The goal of this research
is to develop statistical procedures which draw inferences from curves or
estimated curves directly. In particular, this research is concerned with
multivariate methods addressing problems in principal components analysis,
canonical correlation, discriminant analysis and prediction.
