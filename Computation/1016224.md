Matrix polynomials frequently arise in the engineering and applied
sciences,especially in structural dynamics, vibrational analysis, control
systems, and differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), to give a few examples.
Principal among the associated problems are the computation of the
eigenstructure of regular matrix polynomials, and in the case of singular
polynomials, the computation of minimal indices and minimal bases. In recent
work, the investigators and their colleagues identified rich spaces of
linearizations which led to the construction of new structured
linearizations,condensed forms, and accurate structure-preserving algorithms. By
using new techniques, they have also made progress on singular polynomials,
showing that linearizations provide a pathway to the reliable computation of
minimal indices and bases. This proposal singles out several important tasks for
investigation concerning linearizations, quadratifications and minimal indices
and bases. The goal is to develop new algorithms for these computations, and
increase theoretical understanding so as to aid in the formulation of effective
algorithms.

The problems studied in this proposal are ubiquitous in a wide range of
important problems in engineering and applied sciences. Numerical methods for
their solution are critical in structural mechanics, molecular dynamics,
vibrational analysis, the simulation of electrical circuits, elastic deformation
of anisotropic materials, and optical waveguide design, to give a few examples.
The trend towards extreme designs, such as high speed trains, optoelectronic
devices, micro-electromechanical systems, and ``superjumbo'' jets such as the
Airbus 380, presents a challenge for the computation of the resonant frequencies
of these structures. These extreme designs often lead to computationally
sensitive problems, while the physics of the underlying problem leads to
structure that numerical methods should exploit in order to obtain physically
meaningful results. The aim of this project is to increase our theoretical
understanding of mathematical transformations that preserve these structures and
thereby advance the development of computationally effective algorithms.
Consequently, this work will have direct benefit to scientists and engineers
across a wide range of disciplines.
