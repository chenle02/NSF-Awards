Research is initiated into the development of an entirely real representation of
the Green's function for all values of the energy. If successful, it will be
possible to perform scattering calculations using a purely discrete
representation and this would have a real advantage in practical many-body
scattering calculations, especially when 3-body breakup channels are present.
