ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9612308 Principal Investigator: Renardy This research
is concerned with the shape of the interface between two immiscible liquids.
Theoretically there are often many possibilities for the shape of the boundary
between the two fluids. However, experiments show that certain shapes are often
preferred among the several possibilities. The motivation of this research is to
lessen the gap between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. A
combination of physical modeling, analysis , and computational techniques will
be used to achieve the desired results. The focus of this study will be on
several important issues including the role of oscillatory forcing as a dynamic
stabilization or destabilization mechanism, two layered polymeric flows and two
layer convection. This study has applications in the manufacture of bi-component
polymeric materials and layered films, and in bi-component liquid flow in pipes
and channels such as in the use of water to assist in the more economical
transport of petroleum products in pipelines. A major problem in this technology
is the unexpected behavior of two fluid systems.
