This work will focus on an investigation and characterization of image
processing algorithms and their relationship to image representation schemes.
Classic image processing functions manifest significant differences in memory
access patterns, i.e. spatial and temporal locality, from the standard "general
purpose" routines which have historically been used as the metrics of optimal
system design. Image processing alogrithms have not been characterized as a
seperate class of functions executing in a uniprocessor system. It is postulated
that important increases in performance can be obtained by customization of the
computing architecture. This enhanced performance will be obtained without
resorting to highly parallel systems and the resulting problems of decreased
mean time between failures and highly complex programming issues. Items to be
studied are memory hierarchy and caching strategies as well as stored image
representation schemes. Using stochastic models of behavior an optimal image
processing architecture and stored image representation scheme will be designed.
