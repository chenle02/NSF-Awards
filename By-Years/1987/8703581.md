The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus
Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, Lie
theory has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics, elementary particle physics, and
relativity. In particular, the structures and the symmetries are interwoven, as
illustrated by the fundamental work of Einstein, and later Yang-Mills, in which
profoundly successful nonlinear theories for the fundamental forces in nature
have been guided mathematically by the need for a large family of symmetries. In
a different direction, mathematicians and physicists, often independently, have
developed a vast array of powerful techniques that classify the linear
realizations of the symmetries. This is the subject of "representation theory".
Professor Zuckerman has done pioneering creative work in many facets of
representation theory of Lie groups, and he is now applying his work to
fundamental physics. Ten years ago he invented new ways to construct linear
representations of Lie groups, his methods drawing from diverse, seemingly
unrelated areas of mathematics. Recently, Professor Zuckerman's efforts have
been directed toward their adaptation to the exciting new study of "string
theory" in physics. The goal of this theory is to provide a unified description
of all the forces of nature. In the current proposal he will conduct research on
both linear and nonlinear manifestations of symmetry in string theory, as well
as other more conventional physical theories. This includes the development of a
new basis for the passage from classical to quantum physical theories, and
resulting compatibility of both theories with Einstein's special and general
relativity. Symmetries are realized nonlinearly at the classical level and
linearly at the quantum level. This dual role of symmetry is a fundamental
aspect of his work.
