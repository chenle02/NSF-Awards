The objective of this project is to develop and test fault tolerant algorithms
for numerical computation in various domains, including sparse matrices,
recursive filtering and signal processing. The methods used are a combination of
checks made during the computation based on preconditioned checksums and
thresholds, and a-posteriori checks made on the final computed results based on
backward error assertions (BEAs). In spite of the presence of rounding errors,
BEAs allow very tight, cheap, validation of the final results independent of the
specifics of the implementation or sources of error, and checksums and
thresholds supplement the BEAs by providing checks during the computation. These
methods will be extended beyond prototype examples to more realistic large
computations, demonstrating their scalability and applicability to large
domains.***
