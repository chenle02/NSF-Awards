Understanding the dynamics of massively parallel computer systems is critical to
advancing the state of the scientific art. Increasing numbers of scientist use
high-performance computer systems as their only tool. However, it is impossible
to accurately predict performance of application programs of massively parallel
procesor systems and it is difficult to identify the reasons for poor
performance. This work is to use a head-mounted display and virtual reality
technology to develop virtual environment representations of the time varying
state of a parallel computer system. Immersion view models will be developed for
data representation and process control. Much of the work will focus on the
development of appropriate visual and aural idioms for computer and application
scientists, making immersive performance analysis readily understandable.
