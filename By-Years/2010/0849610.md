Why do leading advocacy organizations in transnational networks construe certain
global problems, but not others, as international issues? How do certain issues
rise to global prominence while other social problems fall by the wayside? The
study will answer this question by collecting data on the rise and fall of
issues in the transnational human rights network. First, it will capture
variation in the human rights issue agenda through surveys and interviews with
human rights activists, and analysis of advocacy websites. Second, it will
explore reasons for this variation through a series of focus groups with
activists from leading organizations in the human rights network. Participants
will be asked about what is and is not on the human rights agenda; how this
changes over time, and why. These data will yield insights as to how ideas move
through and (sometimes) gain footholds in transnational communities of practice.

Significant numbers of Masters and Ph.D. students from the University of
Pittsburgh and Carleton University will be trained to conduct interviews and
focus groups, as well as in the systematic use of qualitative data analysis
software and scientific methods for reaching vailid inferences about large,
unstructured text datasets. This project will integrate rigorous, computer-
assisted qualitatitive methods into the study of transnational networkds.
