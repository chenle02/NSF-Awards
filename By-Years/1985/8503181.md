A three-pronged effort will be conducted on coherent optical sources and devices
with potential applications to optical communication systems. Specific projects
include broadly tunable optical parametric oscillators, electrically tunable
semiconductor lasers, and noise and stability properties of semiconductor
lasers. For many applications in optical communications, it is necessary to have
a coherent light source that is continuously tunable over a large spectral
range. Recently, the first optical parametric oscillator has been operated using
a single crystal of an organic material (urea). The spectral range of interest
is very broad and includes a number of important wavelengths for communications.
In addition, in this program truly smooth continuous tuning of semiconductor
lasers by electrical means is being sought. A new project will be initiated to
study the noise and stability properties of semiconductor lasers which is
fundamental to successful optical communication systems.
