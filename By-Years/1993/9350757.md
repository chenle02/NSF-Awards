This project is purchasing high performance (486DX) desk-top computing systems
and printers, including one for color reproduction, in order to enhance a
microcomputer-based laboratory program. The students are being involved in (a)
using new digital multimeter interface units and software currently under
development by IBM in collaboration with one of the faculty members, and (b) 3-D
molecular modeling for visualization and computation. The equipment is being
used in courses for majors at the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior level
as well as by non-majors in a liberal arts course in physical science. Students
are performing precision electrochemical experiments using the interface
devices. These allow direct measurement of current and/or voltage as a function
of time or of keyboard input permitting the study of numerous chemical reactions
and physical quantities. Data analysis and transformation using a full set of
mathematical tools as well as graphical output to screen or printer also is
being done. The molecular modeling software is introducing students to an
important new tool for the chemist. They are learning to display and manipulate
3-D molecular structures, to extract geometric or electronic properties and to
perform calculations once reserved for high-end computer facilities.
