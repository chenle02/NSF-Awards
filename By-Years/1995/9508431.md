9508431 Weingarten This is a request for holding a workshop on the timely
subject on Social Aspects of the National Information Infrastructure. This
workshop will bring together computer scientists and social scientists to
develop a research agenda for studying and predicting changes in work, social
interactions, societal roles, and other changes that ubiquitous computing and
communication will bring. The results of the workshop will be threefold: 1. A
report that will prioritize research themes and issues; 2. Enhanced
communications between social scientists, technologists, and technology
assessment practitioners concerned with the social aspects of the NN; 3. The
(new) involvement of the social science research community in the ongoing
activity of planning and implementing the NII. ***
