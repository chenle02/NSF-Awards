9311659 Roytburd The PI will continue research in applied analysis and
scientific computing related to nonlinear wave propagation. The work will
include: i) The nonlinear evolution of low-frequency instabilities of detonation
waves and an asymptotic theory for the phenomenon of detonation waves
propagating along a cylindrical tube; ii) The study of a class of free boundary
(free interface) problems which arise naturally as simplified conceptual models
of gasless combustion and fast solidification. These free boundary problems
demonstrate a variety of dynamical patterns that are essentially low-
dimensional. The qualitative behavior of these model problems and their
connections with the front motion description will be investigated both
analytically and numerically. %%% The proposed theoretical investigation will
contribute to a better understanding of a number of engineering problems that
include: the design and safe use of highly energetic propellants; safe handling
of explosives; the process of synthesizing of certain ceramic and metallic
alloys via solid combustion; explosive solidification of thin films and others.
On the other hand, the mathematical models that the PI proposes to investigate
appear to be generic and are encountered as simple building blocks also in other
contexts. Their investigation will lead to progress in dynamical systems theory.
