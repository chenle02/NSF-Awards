This grant is to provide the airfare for about nine young scientists at the
early stage of their career to attend and participate in the 10th International
Symposium on Flavins and Flavoproteins to be held, July 15-20, 1990 at Villa
Olmo on Lake Como, Italy. The field of flavin (vitamin B2) research is extremely
broad, covering a diversity of topics ranging from basic chemistry to physiolgy
and medicine. The first symposium of the series was held in Amsterdam in 1965
and since then it has been held at three year intervals in different countries.
The symposium will bring together an interdisciplinary group of scientists
working on various aspects of flavins and flavoproteins. It will promote
discussion and exchange of ideas in an important area of biochemical research.
