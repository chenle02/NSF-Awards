9417001 Sadee This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between Dr. Wolfgang Sadee, School of Pharmacy, University of California, San
Francisco and Professor Tatsuya Haga of Tokyo University. The first objective of
this joint proposal is to identify those receptor domains responsible for
activating the receptor kinases to initiate phosphorylation. The second
objective focuses on the role of phosphorylation in protein coupling and
cellular trafficking. The results are expected to reveal diverse effects of
phosphorylation including desensitization of signal transduction. This proposal
brings together research scientists from two countries working in the area of
neuron function. Dr. Sadee and his graduate students will have the opportunity
to become familiar with research techniques and practices at Tokyo University.
Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange
and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
