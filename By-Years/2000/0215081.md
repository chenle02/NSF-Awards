This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel method of interrogating the structural condition and cure state of
composite materials. It works by propagating a sub-nanosecond voltage pulse
along an intrinsic microwave transmission-line fabricated directly in the
laminate. The transmission-line is formed using graphite-reinforcing fibers as
the conducting path. Changes in pulse propagation are used to monitor changes in
cure state, and detect various structural failures such as microcracking,
delamination, disbonding, marcelling, and moisture absorption. The fibers are
native to the material and constitute zero structural defect, and negligible
cost.

Applications include graphite composites, glass composites, composite joints,
and metal-adhesive joints.The commercial potential will be an inexpensive and
spatially continuous structural-health and cure monitoring system with minimal
invasiveness.
