&lt;br/&gt;The eastern flank of the Andes supports the richest flora and fauna
in the world. Climate change and forest destruction threaten these habitats.
Research will be undertaken to provide the first detailed information on the
composition of modern forest communities on the Andean flank of southern Peru,
and how those communities change along an elevational gradient (600 m to 3000 m
elevation). Simultaneously, an investigation will be made at eight sites on that
gradient to determine the changes of local forest communities since the peak of
the last ice age. Fossil pollen and diatoms recovered from ancient lake sediment
will provide a detailed record of how lake systems and local forests responded
to past sudden climatic change, such as rapid cooling events within the last ice
age, and the rapid warming associated with the start of the present
interglacial. Information will be provided on how forest community diversity has
changed through time, and whether changes in communities were restricted to just
the rare species or affected all species equally. These data will help
biologists understand how high diversity floras and faunas, with a high
proportion of endemic species, can survive climate change, and what will be
required to conserve them.&lt;br/&gt;
