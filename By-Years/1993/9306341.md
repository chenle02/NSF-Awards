This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Robert D. Bach at Wayne State University to study the structures and
reactivities of alkyl peroxides, metal hydroperoxides, peroxy acids, dioxiranes,
and carbonyl oxides by high level ab initio methods. Specifically, the oxygen
atom transfer from peroxyformic acid, dioxirane, carbonyl oxide, peroxide, and
vanadium peracid to ethylene and other molecules like ammonia, phosphine, and
sulfides will be analyzed. Emphasis is given to the solvent and substituent
effects on these transitions and their influence on the biradical states and
isomerizations. The study will address the Sharpless epoxidation. %%% In this
project Dr. Robert Bach will conduct computational studies to address
fundamental aspects on oxidation reactions. His high level ab initio approach
aims to provide insight into the structures, electronic properties, and solvent
effects on the oxygen atom transfer reactivities of alkyl peroxides, metal
hydroxyperoxides, peroxyacids, dioxiranes, and carbonyl oxides. These studies
aim to advance the understanding of metal catalyzed oxidations that are
ubiquitous in industry, organic synthesis, and biochemistry and may lead to more
environmental benign processes.
