The location of non-emergency service facilities is dependent upon many factors.
For example, the facilities must have a permanent setting, must serve multiple
users who travel to the facility, and should be efficiently located for fixed
and variable costs. This project will develop models to enable planners and
engineers to make realistic decisions on the locations of non-emergency
facilities. The results will benefit local and regional decision makers
concerning the location of fixed non-emergency facilities.
