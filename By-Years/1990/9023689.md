This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Mei-Chu
Chang of the Department of Mathematics, University of California, Riverside. Dr.
Chang will continue her work in the area of Algebraic Geometry. In particular,
she will work on Hartshorne's conjecture, classification of codimension 2
subvarieties in Pn for n = 4 and 5, the geometry of Mg, and deformation of
projective varieties. The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high
quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as potential
for continued significant contributions to scientific research, the academic
profession, and the education of future scientists. Dr. Chang will continue her
work in the area of mathematics called Algebraic Geometry. Particularly
noteworthy is her leadership is the growth of research in this area in her
department.
