Modern software increasingly employs concurrent programming in order to exploit
the performance benefits offered by multicore architectures. Unfortunately,
concurrent programming is notoriously difficult and concurrency bugs exist even
in code written by the most seasoned programmers. Consequently, researchers have
developed mathematical reasoning techniques in attempt to prove these programs
correct but existing techniques rely on the user to provide complex invariants
that are often not very intuitive. By contrast, algorithm designers from the
distributed computing community frequently provide more understandable arguments
for the correctness of their implementations, by focusing on describing a few
key example scenarios of how threads may be interleaved. This project will
bridge this gap by elevating scenario-based reasoning from intuitive arguments
to formally rigorous proofs. The project’s novelties are new foundations,
algorithms and automated tools for verifying concurrent software that
demonstrate how scenario-based reasoning can be formal, yet also approachable to
everyday programmers. The project’s impacts are (1) theories, algorithms and
automated verification tools for concurrent software that can be used by
programmers, without the need for a background in formal methods, (2)
demonstrated applicability to real-world concurrent programs such as web or
databases servers, (3) publications and public open-source release of these
verification tools, and (4) broader impacts on education through novel course
materials and participation of under-represented groups. Overall, the project
will make verification more accessible and, through our advocation in academia
and in industry, lead to adoption and ultimately safer concurrent software.

Technically the project formalizes scenarios as a program's execution quotient,
which captures a small set of representative interleaved executions that
nonetheless generalize---via commutativity---to the set of all executions, even
with unboundedly many threads and infinite state spaces. The project aims to
demonstrate that these quotients can be described succinctly in a convenient
language; that the proof of quotient soundness (i.e., that the abstraction
covers all executions) can be systematized through new forms of induction that
interact with commutativity; that it is possible to automatically derive
quotients directly from source code; and that programmers can use these
derivations and query them to better understand the concurrent behavior of their
implementations.
