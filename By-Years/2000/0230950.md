Empirical skills are playing an increasingly important role in the computing
profession and our society. Despite this, computer science curricula have paid
little attention to developing empirical investigative skills such as forming
testable hypotheses, designing experiments, critiquing their validity,
collecting data, explaining results, and drawing conclusions. The goals of this
project are (1) to formalize a set of core empirical concepts and skills needed
by today's computer science graduate, (2) to develop and evaluate resources for
integrating the presentation and development of those concepts and skills
throughout the computer science curriculum, and (3) to disseminate our approach
for adoption at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following an
incremental approach similar to the way programming skills are developed, this
project advocates the early introduction of fundamental empirical concepts and
skills. Once an empirical foundation has been laid, applications and
laboratories with empirical components may then be integrated into courses
across the curriculum, reinforcing the student's understanding of empirical
methods and also demonstrating the utility of experimentation in computer
science and related disciplines. Via publications and a Web repository,
instructors at other institutions will be encouraged to integrate these
applications into their courses and provide feedback as to their
effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cross-institutional nature of this
proposal is explicitly designed to ensure the broad applicability of developed
materials (with perspectives taken from a regional university, a national
university, and a national liberal arts college). The applications and
laboratories developed will be reviewed and classroom tested by faculty at each
school, followed by outside review and assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
