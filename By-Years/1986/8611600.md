The purpose of the research is to develop a model for simulation and forecasting
of labor-intensive activities in building construction. The research will
examine the theory that a smooth ideal performance curve underlies the actual
performance curve of crews performing labor-intensive construction activities
and that disturbances, disruptions, and factors affecting the ideal performance
curve can be quantified statistically. In order to verify this hypothesis, the
researchers will document the performance of construction crews involved in
masonry, structural steel erections, and framework activities. The project will
be conducted in close collaboration with the researchers at Dundee University in
Scotland. This collaboration enhances the project by incorporating relevant data
from international activities.
