&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0128851&lt;br/&gt;McKoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas
Program award will support Dr. Vincent McKoy of the California Institute of
Technology in collaboration with Dr. Marco A. Lima of the Universidade Estadual
de Campinas, Brazil and Dr. Marcio H. Bettega of the Universidade Federal do
Parana, Brazil. The aim of the project is to determine why the differential
elastic cross sections obtained from high-level calculations using a number of
methods exhibit, within certain ranges of collision energy and scattering angle,
surprisingly large deviations from recent experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
calculations will produce very valuable data, adding significantly to the
knowledge of electron scattering from a handful of technologically and
fundamentally important molecules. The project also promotes education and
training by providing an opportunity for Brazilian graduate students in the
physical sciences to gain experience with the application of large-scale
parallel computation to scientific problems.&lt;br/&gt;
