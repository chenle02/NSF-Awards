Silk, Joseph 96-17168 Dr. Silk will research several fundamental problems in
theoretical astrophysics and cosmology that focus on the cosmic microwave
background. One representative problem is the study of the angular anisotropy of
the cosmic microwave background radiation in different cosmological models,
where the small observed deviations from anisotropy probe the origin of the
large-scale structure in the universe. A second example is the study of galaxy
formation and evolution. Improving models for the global star formation rate and
application to the early evolution of disks and protogalaxies will aid
predictions of their luminosity, spectral and chemical evolution.
