9726013 King This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading the
geophysics computing facility at Purdue University. Specifically, the upgrade
will involve purchase of SUN Ultra dual processor workstations, SUN Ultra single
processor workstations, memory expansions, SCSI mass store devices, tape drives,
a printer, and a scanner. Rapid obsolescence is a trademark of the computer
industry and the computational needs of this active group of geoscientists
warrants the latest in UNIX-based CPU's, extensive RAM and massive data storage
capabilities. A mix of seven senior and junior departmental faculty members and
their graduate students will benefit from these upgrades for a wide range of
research requiring advanced computation including, modeling mantle dynamics,
modeling lithospheric deformation near convergent boundaries, modeling ice-flow
dynamics, geomechanical studies of fault-related folding, seismic tomography,
and modeling hydrologically mediated landscape evolution. ***
