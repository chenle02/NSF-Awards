This project, investigating formal languages as a general methodology for task
transfer between distinct cyber-physical systems such as humans and robots, aims
to expand the science of cyber physical systems by developing Motion Grammars
that will enable task transfer between distinct systems.

Formal languages are tools for encoding, describing and transferring structured
knowledge. In natural language, the latter process is called communication.
Similarly, we will develop a formal language through which arbitrary cyber-
physical systems communicate tasks via structured actions. This investigation of
Motion Grammars will contribute to the science of human cognition and the
engineering of cyber-physical algorithms. By observing human activities during
manipulation we will develop a novel class of hybrid control algorithms based on
linguistic representations of task execution. These algorithms will broaden the
capabilities of man-made systems and provide the infrastructure for motion
transfer between humans, robots and broader systems in a generic context.
Furthermore, the representation in a rigorous grammatical context will enable
formal verification and validation in future work.

Broader Impacts: The proposed research has direct applications to new solutions
for manufacturing, medical treatments such as surgery, logistics and food
processing. In turn, each of these areas has a significant impact on the
efficiency and convenience of our daily lives. The PIs serve as coordinators of
graduate/undergraduate programs and mentors to community schools. In order to
guarantee that women and minorities have a significant role in the research, the
PIs will annually invite K-12 students from Atlanta schools with primarily
African American populations to the laboratories. One-day robot classes will be
conducted that engage students in the excitement of hands-on science by
interactively using lab equipment to transfer their manipulation skills to a
robot arm.
