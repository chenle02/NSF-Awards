This project studies English language acquisition among Hispanic immigrants and
native citizens, relating skill to various social factors. It advances such
studies partly through use of an actual measure (rather than subjective
estimate) of English skill, and partly through focusing on social factors such
as family and friends as facilitators of acquisition. Other factors whose impact
are measured include amount of schooling, opportunities to use Spanish outside
the home, and several aspects of culture. The study advances demographic
understanding of how language patterns develop in the U.S. Results should have
application in designing immigration policies and educational programs.
