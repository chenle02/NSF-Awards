9357513 Dravid This project is for the NSF Young Investigator (NYI) awardee. The
awardee intends to conduct basic and applied research related to nanoscale
phenomena in materials science, with an emphasis on internal interfaces in
solids. New novel electron/ion beam techniques will be developed to probe the
structure, chemistry, and electronic structure of defects and interfaces in
solids. Structure-property relationships for internal interfaces will be
established through a systematic and balanced experimental and theoretical
approach. The awardee also has very extensive teaching plans for undergraduates
and graduates. %%% This project is a NSF Young Investigator (NYI) award. The
awardee plans to study the internal interfaces in solids relating to nanoscale
phenomena. The approach will be both theoretical and experimental. New
techniques will be developed to probe the defects and interfaces in solids. This
type of research aims to develop the structure-property relationship. The NYI
awardee also intends to carry on an extensive teaching activity in both the
graduate and undergraduate education programs. ***
