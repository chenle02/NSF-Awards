9306891 Croat Field collecting of plants in native habitats followed by
intensive laboratory and herbarium study remain the most efficient means of
identifying and classifying the rich plant life of the tropics. Dr. Thomas Croat
of the Missouri Botanical Garden, a specialist on the aroid or philodendron
family, is studying the neotropical genus Dieffenbachia in Mexico and Central
America, with an estimated 30-35 species, in preparation for a taxonomic
monograph of the group. The genus includes the second most important species of
ornamental plant in terms of commercial sales in the U.S.; however,
relationships among species, sources of germplasm for breeding, geographical
ranges, and aspects of pollination and dispersal biology and possible
hybridization are poorly known. Descriptive information about the plants, taken
from living material and herbarium specimens, is entered in a computer database,
which eventually will be accessible over the Internet to interested researchers
and students. The research will lead to improved diagnosis of each species, a
preliminary account of phylogenetic relationships, mapping of geographic ranges,
notes on flowering and fruiting phenology and other aspects of ecology, and
identification keys for reliable assignment of scientific names. The inventory
of plant diversity in the tropics remains an ongoing endeavor by a small group
of devoted taxonomic specialists. The collections they create, both herbarium
specimens and living material in botanical gardens, and the published
information and, now, computerized records, become resources for wise use and
stewardship.
