For this Presidential Young Investigator Award theoretical research will be
conducted on quasicrystal growth and on the evolution of foams in two and three
dimensions. A quasicrystal growth model will be developed within the context of
a simple tiling model based on the six-vertex (ice) model of statistical
mechanics and its three dimensional generalization. The effects of dynamics on
the evolution of foams will be studied by using a simple one dimensional model.
These dynamical effects will then be incorporated into more realistic models for
foam evolution in two and three dimensions.
