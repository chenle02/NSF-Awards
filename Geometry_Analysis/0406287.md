Abstract

Award: DMS-0406287 Principal Investigator: Mark Adler

The project aims at investigating various connections between random matrix
theory, various statistical processes,integrable mechanics and the Virasoro
algebra Specifically,one project is to study non-colliding Brownian motion a la
Dyson,on the line and on the circle,including the Dyson elliptic Brownian
motion;the connection with matrix models in a chain is particularly relevant to
finding PDE's for the joint probabilities of the motion.Using scaling limits
arising in the context of random matrices and permutations,the Dyson motions
above tend to novel limiting random processes.The motion of the outmost particle
tends to the so-called Airy process.Finding stochastic differential equations
for these processes hinges on intricate statistical questions about the
universality laws appearing in random matrix theory.Another project is to find
large time asymptotics,like asymptotic covariances,for the Dyson processes and
the limiting processes as well.The investigators believe that each of the
universality laws in random matrix theory connects with an integrable system and
the algebra of Virasoro constraints.The problem is to find these sysems and to
extract interesting information about the distribution functions and their
differential equations.Finally,the Dyson circular motion has an interesting
realization in terms of the "Stochastic Loewner equation",providing a conformal
map realization of this motion.Its Ito stochastic differential equation is
related-in a mysterious way-to the Virasoro algebra,which also naturally comes
up in questions of non-colliding random walks and the Fokker-Planck
equations.These connections will be investigated.

The mathematical physics above has applications in the statistiical analysis
that comes up in many practical problems involving a small number of sources
,each generating lots of data,like antennas receiving information,analyzing
ecological data from a small number of sources ,each generating lots of
data,etc.The point being that in many practical problems large rectangular
arrays of data come up,which are big in one direction,but not the other.The
statistical processes that come up also seem to come up in lots of growth models
that should be relevant in industrial processes.In addition the universality
laws that arise in the random matrix theory arise quite naturally in quantum
mechanics,in studying large atoms and so may prove useful in understanding
chemical reactions in physical chemistry and hence in manufacturing drugs
through simulation experiments one day.
