Scientific argumentation and decision-making abilities are critical for our
college graduates to become active participants in the 21st century workforce.
Research has shown that by learning the skills of scientific argumentation,
students can become more effective problem solvers. There have been few efforts
to help students in large enrollment gateway undergraduate science classes
develop these skills. The project will transform an introductory physics course
for future engineers into a format that integrates scientific argumentation. The
main objective of this project is to develop strategies to help students to
engage in scientific argumentation when they work in groups to solve problems
and complete labs. Additionally, the project will prepare faculty and teaching
assistants to learn strategies that help students develop argumentation skills.
The project will assess the impact of these changes on student learning,
attitudes, and retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior research has shown that
argumentative tasks can enhance conceptual understanding, epistemic beliefs and
problem solving skills. This project will develop strategies to foster
scientific argumentation in novel contexts including context-rich problems and
contrasting cases. Prompts supporting both written and oral argumentation will
be adapted and refined to create design principles for argumentative tasks.
These strategies will be first implemented in the SCALE-UP format and then be
adapted to courses in other formats. A two-phase concurrent mixed methods
approach will be utilized to assess the impact of these interventions on
students' conceptual understanding, epistemological beliefs, problem solving and
argumentative skills, attitudes, and retention. The investigators anticipate
higher gains in students' conceptual understanding, problem solving skills, and
attitudes, as well as a drop in DFW rates.
