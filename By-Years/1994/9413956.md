9413956 Sonek The investigators propose to study and quantify the effects of
optical phase conjugation on optical trapping, and to design, develop, and
evaluate an optimum configuration for the integration of various image
processing functions, such as aberration correction, contrast reversal, and
novelty filtering, with an optical tweezer and microscopic imaging, for the
imaging and diagnosis of micromanipulated biological samples such as cells and
tissues. This approach can offer substantially improved imaging capabilities via
contrast enhancement of phase objects; high- resolution (submicron) detection
and feature extraction of images obscured by aberrating media; preferential
display of slow and fast moving objects; rapid nearly all-optical processing of
image data; and the simultaneous optical manipulation and force transduction of
biological samples. ***
