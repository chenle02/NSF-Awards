Regularization Techniques have been used to solve problems in stereo vision,
shape analysis and motion estimation. These techniques usually incorporate
smoothing operations in the restoration of degraded images. They offer a general
tool for dealing with a variety of problems in image processing and computer
vision. While regularization appears to be a very promising overall technique,
its early applications have suffered because continuity conditions must be
imposed over the whole domain of the data. Clearly, this is not justified in
vision problems where there is a multitude of objects in a scene, or even in a
case where there is only one object, but whose surface is not smooth. A major
goal of this research is to modify regularization methods by including
discontinuities. In addition, the project will also investigate the
applicability of these methods in textured areas by looking at the statistical
properties of the data.
