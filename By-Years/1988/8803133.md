This grant supports a study of magnetospheric storms. Specifically, it covers:
(1) the asymmetric development of the main phase of magnetic storms, (2) the
growth and decay of the substorm current system on the basis of DE satellite
data and ground-based magnetic data and (3) modelling of interplanetary
disturbance events. During the initial phase of the project, the following
subjects have been chosen; (a) the asymmetric development of the main phase, (b)
the growth and decay of the substorm current system, (c) subtraction of the
geomagnetic disturbance fields produced by the polar current system, (d)
energetic neutral atoms and the asymmetry of the main phase, (e) the input-
output relationship, (f) modelling of interplanetary disturbance events and the
associated storms and (g) the polar cap phenomena. The project is designed to
fulfill two additional purposes: (1) training magnetospheric physicists who can
well understand ground-based data and (2) promote solar-terrestrial physics
(rather than solar and terrestrial physics) by considering magnetospheric
disturbances as an integral part of solar- terrestrial physics.
