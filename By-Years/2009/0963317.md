This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The award supports the renovation of the research
infrastructure of VanderWerf Hall on the campus of Hope College. VanderWerf Hall
was constructed in 1964, housing the departments of Physics and Mathematics.
VanderWerf Hall now houses four departments: Computer Science, Engineering,
Mathematics, and Physics. Each of these four departments is active in original
research (about 30 faculty members); each research program involves researchers
working with undergraduate students (about 50 per year). The research areas to
be enhanced by the award range from development of electrodeposition of magnetic
thin films and layered structures to fundamental nuclear physics to mathematical
biology, among many others. The building's research space has evolved over the
last 45 years, cannibalizing classrooms and installing enough equipment to
perform research, but lacking a cohesive focus to design and even space for some
departmental research efforts. Updating and renovating the scientific research
spaces in VanderWerf Hall will transform cramped, inadequate facilities into
safer environments and will broaden participation in research by improving
access by everyone to research facilities, allowing increased use of equipment,
and allowing increased access to research by undergraduate students.
