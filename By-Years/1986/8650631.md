This project will improve the instrumental component of the chemistry program at
Mount Union College in two areas: high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
and data acquisition through computer-interfaced instrumentation. A computer-
interfaced HPLC system will enable students in organic chemistry, instrumental
techniques, and undergraduate research to: (1) gain laboratory experience with
the capabilities and applications of HPLC, (2) investigate a wide range of
chemical problems which are best studied using HPLC techniques, and (3) work
with a computer-interfaced instrument in chemical analysis.
