Function and assembly of basement membranes in the nervous
system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basement membranes (BMs) are thin sheets of
extracellular matrix that separate epithelial tissues from adjacent connective
tissues. In the nervous system, they exist as the pial and the vascular BMs.
&lt;br/&gt;Although it is well established that cells die when the BM they are
attached to is defective, the role of the BM in neuronal survival is unclear.
The experiments proposed in this project will address this important but
understudied area of research. In addition, Dr. Halfter's laboratory will study
how the BM is formed in the nervous system. His laboratory has worked out unique
experimental procedures that dissolve and reconstitute the retinal BM in chick
embryos by the sequential injections of collagenase and mouse laminin-1. The
reconstitution of the BM, facilitated by laminin-1, can be blocked by antibodies
to laminin-1, but not by antibodies to laminin-2. Both laminins differ only in
the sequence of their alpha chains. Dr. Halfter's laboratory will localize the
domain(s) of the laminin alpha 1 chain that is (are) critical in the assembly of
a new BM. The successful outcome of the experiments would be the fist step in
understanding the biochemical detail in building the multi-component BMs in
vivo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
