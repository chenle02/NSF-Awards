We plan to study arithmetic groups for their own sake and for
their&lt;br/&gt;applications to other branches of mathematics and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;Two central themes are the subgroup growth of arithmetic
lattices and the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics of the simplicial complexes obtained by
taking quotients of&lt;br/&gt;Bruhat-Tits buildings modulo arithmetic
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arithmetic groups are at the crossroads of several
central areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: Lie groups, number theory, geometry and
combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;Their study can be carried out using a wealth of
different methods and&lt;br/&gt;shed light on different directions. A previous
work has led to the&lt;br/&gt;construction of Ramanujan graphs which turn out to
have remarkable&lt;br/&gt;applications to computer science and combinatorics.
One of the goals of&lt;br/&gt;this research will be to study higher dimensional
analogues with the&lt;br/&gt;hope of getting deeper
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
