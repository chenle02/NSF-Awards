Just before World War II, Robert Merton wrote in his doctoral thesis that the
scientific revolution in England was accepted because of the rise of the Puritan
ethic. Merton noted that Puritanism itself was neither a sufficient nor a
strictly necessary condition for the rise of the new science since "other
functionally equivalent ideological movements could have served to provide the
emerging science with widely acknowledged claims to legitimacy." This "Merton
thesis" has been widely debated since he first presented it. By implication, the
thesis argues that the acceptance of the new science was dependant upon the rise
of protestantism. This thesis gains weight in light of the condemnation of
Galileo after he published his Dialogue between the Two Chief World Systems. A
number of scholars have examined the acceptance of the new science among
Protestants. Few have examined its acceptance among Catholics. Dr. Harris, under
this grant, is completing a study of another group which was, he argues, a
"functionally equivalent ideological movement" to Puritanism. This group was the
Society of Jesus, i.e. the Jesuits of the Catholic Church. He has found
remarkable parallels between teachings and research by Jesuit and Protestant
scientists during the period of the triumph of the new science. These results
lead to several questions: why and how were these developments in the Catholic
Church ignored? Was the religious situation during the Scientific Revolution
much more complex than the Merton thesis allows? Rather than focusing on the
theological or ecclesiastical differences that distinguish and separate
Protestant from Catholic, should we not look to the deep institutional parallels
and common methods that religious leaders of various movements used in their
struggle to instill a "Christian way of life" in their followers? By answering
these questions, this study promises to make significant new contributions to
our understanding of the historical relationshi p of science and religion.
