A workshop will be convened under the aegis of the Earth System Science
Partnership (ESSP) to gauge the needs and preferences of the African scientific
community as to the nature of a regional networking organization that could best
meet this regional community's needs in support of global change science. This
workshop will: contribute to identification of common needs and common goals for
regional research in Africa; encourage the African earth system science
community to more effectively communicate among themselves and to better connect
their research with that of the global community; and will bring global change
research more to the attention of universities and national agencies in African
countries.

The workshop will involve a wide range of experts, including scientists from
within the region and scientists from other countries who are actively involved
in research in the region; representatives of national agencies that manage
and/or fund global change research; the African Academy of Sciences and the
Third World Academy of Sciences; the four ESSP worldwide global change research
programs; and representatives of national agencies that support development. It
is expected that: the workshop will be held at an African location that would
encourage participation by a wide range of African scientists; products of the
workshop will include identification of long-term data sets that need to be
developed in the region; and arrangements will be made to assure that results of
the workshop are transmitted to all interested parties, including African
regional organizations and other international programs and organizations.
