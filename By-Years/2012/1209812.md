This action funds Brian Steidinger of Indiana University Bloomington to conduct
a research project, entitled "Investigating novel defenses of New Zealand
conifers towards exploitative fungi," during the summer of 2012 at Landcare
Research in Lincoln, Christchurch. The host scientist is Ian Dickie.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to uncover unique adaptations
of Southern hemisphere conifers (Podocarpaceae) that may allow them to segregate
and sanction exploitative fungal partners upon whom they rely for soil
nutrients. Field studies are being conducted in collaboration with scientists in
New Zealand who collaborate with Maori Iwis (self-governing communities) who
collect samples on protected land. This research explores the efficacy of plant
defenses against exploitative fungi in natural conditions - investigations that
complement ongoing laboratory work on the same subject. In addition to studying
the ecology and physiology of plant defenses, this project provides a learning
experience for the Fellow on the economic and cultural value of NZ conifers,
which are used for timber and steeped in native mythology.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
