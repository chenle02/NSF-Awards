9506360 Zimmerman Essentially nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms
nor the genes involved in regulating differentiation and morphogenesis during
early embryogenesis in higher plants. This proposal describes the molecular and
genetic analysis on one of the earliest stages of embryogenesis, the globular
stage, Dr. Zimmerman has chosen this stage because it is during the globular
stage that all of the basic tissue systems of the mature plant are initiated and
the primary meristems are established. She has identified two globular defective
Arabidopsis mutants that show interesting defects in development during the
globular stage. One of these mutants may exhibit a homeotic transformation of
one embryo cell type to another, and the other mutant shows defects in tissue
organization and the transition to polarized growth. Each of these mutations
appears to be caused by T-DNA insertion, and hence the genes of interest should
be tagged; indeed, Dr. Zimmerman has already cloned one of the genes using T-DNA
as a probe. She will use these mutants to address fundamental questions
regarding the molecular basis for cellular identity, tissue differentiation and
organization in plant embryogenesis. In order to begin to address these
questions, she will 1) characterize the phenotype and timing of developmental
interference in each mutant, 2) genetically map the mutations relative to known
chromosomal markers and relative to other embryo defective genes, and in the
longer term, 3) isolate and characterize the tagged genes responsible for the
mutations in order to evaluate the molecular and developmental consequences of
these mutations. ***
