Principal Investigators (PIs) Newman and Bird are mapping galaxiesâ€™ locations in
the cosmic web to understand how the environment affects the evolution of
galaxies. PI Newman is using the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph
(IMACS) on the Magellan Baade Telescope to conduct the Lyman-alpha Tomography
IMACS Survey (LATIS). PI Bird will make computational simulations and synthetic
observations to optimize this 3-D survey of the early universe. The PIs will co-
mentor a UC Riverside undergraduate through the Carnegie Astrophysics Summer
Student Internship program (CASSI). PI Bird will also design and deliver a CASSI
workshop that introduces students to cosmological simulations and data
visualization. PI Newman will develop and offer a spectroscopy module to 75 high
school teachers during the annual UC Riverside Summer Teacher Physics
Academy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will map the z = 2.2-2.8 universe over
1.8 square degrees. They will determine the masses of a large sample of
protogroups and protoclusters, investigate how different galaxy subpopulations
trace LATIS-detected structures, and quantify the Mpc-scale environments of
thousands of galaxies. The LATIS tomographic maps, 7000 galaxy spectra
(including 4000 at z &gt; 2.2), and accompanying software and documentation will
be made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
