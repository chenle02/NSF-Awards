Taste specificity in the vertebrates is shown by activity in specific single
nerve fibers. Peripheral receptor cells in taste bud organs can be classified
into types based on morphology and ultrastructural features. Individual nerve
fibers may innervate subpopulations of these receptor cells that are
specifically activated by certain stimuli, but the evidence to date is scarce
and controversial. This project is a pilot study to find out if classes of taste
cells that are distinguishable by structural criteria respond preferentially to
given chemical stimuli. The preparation will be from taste barbels of catfish
because they are a very well studied model physiological system, able to
discriminate among several chemical compounds. There are three novel aspects to
the approach: 1) use of a metabolic label (2-deoxyglucose) for ultrastructural
studies, 2) autoradiography with high-voltage electron microscopy, and 3) high-
pressure rapid freezing for tissue preparation. The pilot work will determine if
this approach yields useful information on the structure and function of the
taste cells, and if the cells form functional clusters. This innovative project
has a great potential impact on an important issue in chemosensory research, and
on developing new technology for cellular biological studies.
