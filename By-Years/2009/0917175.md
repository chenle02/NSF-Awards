This project investigates two deeply commingled and significant scientific
questions on the statistical distributions of range, disparity, chrominance and
luminance in natural 3D images of the world: (1) developing a comprehensive
database of co-registered luminance, chrominance, range, and disparity images of
natural scenes; and (2) conducting eye movement studies on stereoscopic images..
On the acquired database, the research team studies and models the bivariate
statistics of luminance, chrominance, range, and disparity . In the eye movement
studies, the locations of visual fixations are measured as they land in range
space against where they land in luminance, chromatic, and disparity space,
making it possible to develop gaze-contingent models of the statistics of
luminance, chrominance, range, and disparity. The results of these studies have
broad significance in vision science and image processing. To exemplify this,
new approaches to computational stereo and to stereo image quality assessment
are developed. New computational stereo algorithms are developed using
appropriate prior and posterior distribution models on disparity. Further, new
algorithms are developed for stereopair image quality assessment using the
statistical models that we will develop. These new algorithms dramatically
impact the emerging 3-D digital cinema, gaming, and television industries,
allowing for automatic assessment of 3D presentations to human viewers. The
developed 3D range-luminance databases are made available via public web
portals, and the results of the work are published in the highest-profile vision
science and image science journals.
