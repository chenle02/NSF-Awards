The PI's work to date strongly suggest that one can see conductivity structure
in the upper 1000km of the Earth with unprecedented resolution. The data already
analyzed requires two sharp jumps near the 400 and 650km seismic
discontinuities. If this result is true, it should provide a powerful constraint
on the compositon and physical state of the mantle. The PI has used robust
processing which removes a variety of noises, including the effects of
distortion of the electric field by near surface lateral heterogeneities. This
processing produces magnetotelluric (MT) impedances which are much more accurate
than previously obtained. This data has been inverted using an algorithm that
produces the globally flattest model fitting the data within its errors. The
fact that this least structure model requires localized jumps argues strongly
for their reality. The PI will very carefully examine each step of this
processing to improve both the efficiency and robustness of the compu- tations.
This effort will include examining other readily available data.
