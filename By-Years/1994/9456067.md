9456067 Millett A partnership of engineering, mathematics, and science faculty
from the eight general campuses of the University of California are planning the
development of an alliance to create, implement, evaluate, refine, and
disseminate a series of variable length investigations. Each investigation
involves students in mathematical work in the context of a concrete engineering
or scientific investigation. Students will work in teams facilitated by
specially prepared assistants and scientific experts and will have access to
data, information, and experts through internet. The student experience with
exciting problems in science and engineering using mathematics is intended to
promote changes within all the affiliated scientific and engineering disciplines
as well as mathematics. Teams of affiliated faculty on each campus are assisting
in the planning of a full project proposal.
