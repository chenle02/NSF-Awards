Devarajan Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational to continue his research in statistical mechanical treatment of
protein folding and protein dynamics. Work is proposed in four major areas: 1)
the development of simple off lattice models representing the alpha carbons of
proteins whose target native conformations are four helix bundles; 2) molecular
dynamics studies of the effect of denaturants on the unfolding and refolding of
proteins using minimal models; 3) extension of the minimal models to more
realistic models that include the effects of side chains that can be used to
model real proteins; and 4) use of instantaneous normal modes to characterize
the rugged landscape of protein potential energy surfaces, and to further
characterize the protein dynamics and optimal reaction pathways using these
techniques. This theoretical approach will provide the basic understanding of
the folding properties of protein. This problem is currently at the frontier of
protein research, and a basic understanding of the factors that influence
protein folding will have an enormous impact on the biotechnology industry.
