9627331 Tadesse The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty- four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will fund a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit which
will allow Dr. Nigatu Tadesse to work with Dr. S. Rajaram at the International
Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico. The goal of this research
is to explain the inheritance of osmoregulation, relative water content, and
excised leaf water retention (plant-water relations) as droughtresistance
mechanisms in wheat. The objectives are: 1) to identify and map the quantitative
trait loci (QTLs) of plantwater relations; and 2) to determine if there is a
genetic relationship between plant-water relations traits and yield under water
stress environments. The long-term goals of the project are to develop marker-
based selection tools to facilitate selection for drought-resistant wheat
genotypes and provide a linkage map that will enable map based cloning for
plant-water relations genes. ***
