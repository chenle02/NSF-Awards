9401571 Sarnak This award supports Prof. Peter Sarnak's study of the fine
structure of the spectrum of the Laplacian for arithmetic quotients of symmetric
spaces. These problems turn out to be related to a number of central problems in
the analytic theory of numbers. They have also received attention from
Physicists working in Quantum Chaos. This is research in the field of number
theory. Number theory is basically the study of whole numbers. The research done
under this award studies properties of the whole numbers by encoding them into
the functions of calculus. Number theory is among the oldest fields of
mathematics, yet it has always played an important role in choosing directions
for the rest of the subject. Within the last half century, the study of whole
numbers has become doubly important as the theory has been used to develop new
algorithms for computer science and to construct new error correcting codes for
electronics.
