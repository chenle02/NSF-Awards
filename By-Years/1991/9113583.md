This Science in Developing Countries award will support a regional research
workshop on Science and the State, to be held in Mexico City in January 1992 in
conjunction with the Third Congress of the Latin American Society for the
History of Science and Technology. Organizers are Joan Bromberg and James
Griesemer of the University of California at Davis and Juan Salda>a, an
organizer of the Third Congress in Mexico. The workshop aims to examine the
relationship between the scientific community in the Americas and the State,
their differences, and strategies that could be adopted for a more effective
perfor- mance. Nine U.S. panelists will present the results of recent research
on the relationship between U.S. Federal and state governments and science and
technology, from the country's beginning until the present. Nine Latin American
historians will compare the U.S. experience with that of their nations. The
workshop will formulate problems for further historical research and lessons for
today's science policy. The benefits to both U.S. and Latin American
participants are the development of new areas for regional research cooperation
and the potential for improving the nations' scientific infrastructures.
