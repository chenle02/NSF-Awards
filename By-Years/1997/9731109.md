AST-9731109 Abstract Funds will be used to add two new capabilities to
theSpectrum Cross-Dispersed (SpeX) instrument at the Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF). SpeX is a 0.8 micrometer to 5.5 micrometer medium-resolution, cross-
dispersed spectrograph. A low- resolution (R=150) spectroscopy mode, and a high-
speed time- resolved spectroscopy mode will be added. These capabilities will
cover the 0.8 micrometer to 2.5 micrometer wavelength range.
