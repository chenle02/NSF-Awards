This study seeks to apply novel data science techniques (such as tree-based
classification models and deep learning) to four-dimensional (4D) weather radar
observations of thunderstorm dynamics to enable identification of storms capable
of producing tornadoes up to an hour prior to tornadogenesis. Real-time severe
storm prediction is a challenging task that currently requires a human
forecaster with a thorough understanding of the dynamics and current state of
the atmosphere. This study will develop and apply data science techniques to
four-dimensional radar data from severe storms throughout the continental U.S.
with the goal of identifying critical spatiotemporal relationships that can
improve the understanding and prediction of tornadoes. The long-term goal will
be to develop techniques to fundamentally improve our understanding of severe
storms in general (including hail, wind, and tornadoes) by analyzing the new
knowledge identified by the data science models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study
seeks to advance the scientific knowledge of tornadogenesis by identifying novel
precursors to tornadoes in two unique 4D weather radar datasets. Data science
has the potential to advance knowledge by processing and objectively evaluating
a large amount of data in a relatively short period of time. This provides a
mechanism by which large, complicated meteorological datasets can be assessed
for their predictive capability or alternative applications without the need for
time consuming subjective evaluation. The methods developed will enable others
to evaluate existing Earth system data to a spatiotemporal extent that is not
possible with established approaches. The application of data science techniques
to a novel domain will require the development of new techniques focusing on
spatiotemporal 4D weather radar data.
