A key problem in programming languages is the design and implementation of a
balance between static (compile-time) and dynamic (run-time) phases of
computation. A good balance allows the generation of good code without an undue
burden on programmers or compilers. Finding this balance relies critically on
intuition and experimentation, but these methods are not enough by themselves.
As type systems and optimizing transformations have become more sophisticated,
it has become essential to provide rigorous means to express static/dynamic
relationships at suitable levels of abstraction. Programmers and compiler
writers rely on these relationships, so a precise but approachable description
of them is important. Using intuition and experimentation alone may allow errors
or valuable opportunities for generalization to go unnoticed. The goal of this
project is to develop and apply techniques for rigorously expressing and proving
the relationships between static and dynamic semantics of programming languages.
Primary objectives include (i) finding ways to specify meanings at levels of
abstraction suitable for reasoning about sharing, copying, and liveness; (ii)
developing ways to represent and manipulate semantic specifications in a formal
manner; (iii) aiding the development of new interface definition languages by
formulating techniques for describing the properties that compatibility of
modules guarantees for systems that integrate them.
