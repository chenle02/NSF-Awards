9302746 Van Hentenryck Constraint logic programming is an extension of logic
programming where unification is replaced by constraint solving. Constraint
logic programming languages, and their generalizations in the cc framework,
combine constraint handling and (don't know) nondeterminism; they are
particularly appealing for a variety of combinatorial search problems for which
they offer a short development time and a good efficiency. However there is
still a difference in efficiency between special-purpose algorithms written in
procedural languages and constraint programs. The research aims at reducing
further the gap between constraint and procedural programming by using global
compilation techniques. Global compilation will be based on abstract
interpretation, a systematic framework for dataflow analysis, which has been
studied intensively in the logic programming community. Recent results have
indicated that abstract interpretation of logic programming can be performed
with a reasonable efficiency and that significant benefits in efficiency can be
achieved. The main result of the research will be the design and implementation
of optimizing compilers for two languages: cc(FD) (a constraint language over
finite sets of integers) and cc(Q) a constraint language over rational linear
arithmetic). Beside the traditional Prolog optimizations, the global
optimizations considered include constraint specialization, detection of
determinacy, elimination of redundant constraints, exploitation of independent
subsystems, and constraint clustering. New results in abstract interpretation
may also be expected. In particular, new frameworks and algorithms, including
reexecution- based analysis and forwards/backwards analysis, the impact of
granularity on efficiency and accuracy, and new domains will be studied. ***
