Professor Daniel Chiu of the University of Washington has received a CAREER
award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to investigate the
effects of constrained space on enzyme kinetics. Single molecule spectroscopy
will be utilized to examine enzymes such as beta-galactosidase acting on
fluorophores contained in 100 nm synthetic vesicles and designed planar
supported bilayers in nanochannels. Electroporation and microfluidics will be
used for manipulation of vesicles and single enzymes. The studies will ascertain
whether the surface charge and hydrophobicity associated with cellular
nanoenvironments can exert significant influence on the activity of proteins.
These studies will lead to a better understanding of cellular functioning and
compartmentalization. The PI will offer a new graduate course covering topics in
microfabrication, fluid mechanics, Fourier optics and bioanalytical methods, and
also will use web-based technologies extensively to assist in the General
Chemistry courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most protein reaction studies are
carried out in solutions in beakers, and any effects of the cell surfaces are
lost. The advent of single molecule spectroscopy makes possible the study of
single enzyme molecules inside tiny channels or vesicles, mimicking the enclosed
ultrasmall spaces found in cells. Differences from molecule to molecule have
shown up in previous studies, and these can be significant. The effects of the
walls and limited spaces on the biochemical reactions can then be studied.
Students engaged in the technologies used in this research and in the graduate
course can transfer the knowledge to many efforts such as lab-on-a-chip and
sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
