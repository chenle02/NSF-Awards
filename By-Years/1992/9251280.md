The Chemistry Department is purchasing computers and accessories to make
computer technology an integral part of undergraduate education. Both locally
generated and commercial software is being used for simulations, data
acquisition and analysis in general, analytical and physical chemistry courses.
Molecular modeling is undertaken by organic and biochemistry students. New
experiments such as a comparison of the two- dimensional NMR based conformation
of valinomycin to that obtained from modeling studies, molecular mechanics and
docking in the oxidation of bicyclic alcohols are being introduced.
