This workshop is part of an ongoing and worldwide effort to better understand
the effects of surface geology on the waves propagating from an earthquake
rupture. Specifically, this is being done through experiments which consist of
two phases: weak motion and strong motion data collection and model testing
through "blind" prediction and analysis (that is, the predictions are made in
advance of the experiment being performed). The United States and Japan have
separately implemented experiments; at Turkey Flat, CA and in the Ashigara
Valley, Kanagawa, Japan. The objective of the ESG1992 Symposium is to bring
together researchers from around the world who have made blind predictions using
the Turkey Flat and Ashigara Valley data, in order to present individual and
summary results and analyses to: 1) develop insights with respect to the effects
of near-surface geology on properties of earthquake motions, 2) to evaluate
models and modeling approaches and 3) to identify future directions for
research. This is the first of two symposia on site response that are planned.
The second will be held in the United States following the anticipated strong
motion earthquake at Parkfield, CA (an official prediction made by the U.S.
Geological Survey). This action is to provide travel support for four U.S.
researchers to attend this symposium.
