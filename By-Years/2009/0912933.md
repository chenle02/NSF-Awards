This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project concerns a novel, rapid
and cost-effective detection system for fecal contamination in water supplies.
The need for better water safety screening is exemplified by the outbreak of E.
coli serotype O157:H7, a pathogen found in fecal matter, in September, 2006 that
was traced to contamination of spinach in California. Food poisonings were noted
in several states, necessitating responses from agencies such as the Food and
Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control to protect the public.
Although existing methods can detect fecal contamination in water samples,
improvements are needed in sensitivity, accuracy, and speed. This proposal
describes the refinement of a novel sensor technology that uses insect
chemosensory proteins (CSPs) as recognition elements for fast, sensitive
biosensors to detect very low levels of fecal contamination in water samples and
can be used at home or in industry.

The broader impacts of this research are as a platform technology with direct
applications in the detection of environmental, chemical, or biological
compounds or contaminants, including the detection of harmful volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), quality control of foods and pharmaceuticals and the detection
of volatile compounds present in weapons or explosives.. Thus, the utilized
platform technology has immediate application to a variety of important sensor
and detector implementations that affect numerous industries, public safety, and
public health. The application described herein "A fecal contamination detector
for monitoring water safety", is only one example of the applications possible.
