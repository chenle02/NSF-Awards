This proposal is for the continuation of the PI's research toward the
development, implementation, and application of efficient numerical methods for
interface problems especially with moving interfaces and/or free boundaries.
Specific projects include development of the immersed interface method for the
Navier Stokes equations modeling incompressible viscous two phase flow with
fixed or moving interfaces. Related to this topic, some important projects
include development of new projection and/or gauge methods so that the second
order accuracy can be preserved even with the presence of interfaces; second
order elliptic solvers that can satisfy the maximum principle for interface
problems in two and three dimensions; the finite element methods using Cartesian
and/or adaptive Cartesian grids for interface problems. Another application
which will be studied in depth is the simulation of electro-migration of voids
in integrated circuits with the presence of grain boundaries.

This proposal is about developing efficient (fast, accurate, and in real time)
methods to simulate some important moving interface/free boundary problems.
Applications include the simulation of the interface between water and oil in
petroleum industry; simulation of contaminated bubbles in water for
environmental science; simulation of crystal growth of pattern formulation in
material science; simulation of cell deformation and motion of biofilm in
medical and biology sciences; and simulation of electro-migration of voids in an
integrated circuit in semi-conductor industry. Over the years, we have developed
advanced methods for solving these interface problems and we believe we are the
leaders in this area. Therefore we are very confident in the success of the
proposal and can maintain the edge in this area over other countries.
Economically, the success of this proposal can save millions of dollars that are
needed to carry out real experiments.
