This research: (1) treats variations in the "design concepts" posed by other
members of the design team as "conceptual noise"; (2) shows how to incorporate
such noise into "conceptually robust" decisions; (3) describes a method for
using the same analysis to provide preference information back to the other team
members; and (4) provides a procedure for determining whether to release the
conceptually robust design or to wait for further design certainty. Taguchi's
approach is used as a starting point because it is widely known. This project
generalizes concurrent distributed decision making procedure by employing
genetic algorithms. Concurrent engineering processes involve multi-functional
teams, which make decisions about many parts of the product\production system
and aspects of the product life-cycle simultaneously. This research argues that
such concurrent distributed decisions must be based on communications about sets
of possibilities rather than single solutions. By extending Taguchi's parameter
design concepts, it develops a robust and distributed decision-making procedure
based on such communications. That is, it shows how a member of a design team
can make appropriate decisions based on incomplete information from the other
members of the team.
