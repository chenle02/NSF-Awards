EAGER: Workshop on Shared Infrastructure for the Social and Behavioral
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert M. Groves&lt;br/&gt;University of
Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SBE
0930160&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project involves a workshop to be mounted in the spring of 2009 to address the
shared infrastructure needs of the social and behavioral Sciences. The workshop
addresses the fundamental question: What social and behavioral scientific
questions of great import to human understanding cannot now be answered because
researchers do not have the needed infrastructure to answer them? The
infrastructure needs involve data needs and satisfactory methodological tools.
The focus of the workshop centers on how human scientists can build the needed
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in this project are chosen to
represent researchers at the cutting-edge of individual lines of inquiry.
Viewpoints involve both new, bold initiatives, and key needed additions to well
established thinking about current human science domains.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product of this workshop is a listing of key questions
that can be answered with new infrastructure, explicated in a language that can
be understood across the SBE disciplines represented in the Directorate. The
results are potentially transformative because the discussion has broad impact
for researchers doing social and behavioral research across all subfields of the
human sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
