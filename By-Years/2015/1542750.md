A delegation of Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) came to the
United States (U.S.) for a bilateral science and technology (S&T) meeting in
July 2014. Attending were National Science Foundation (NSF) program directors of
geosciences. As a result of this visit, MOST and NSF are organizing three
workshops in Taiwan between May 29 and May 31, 2015. These are: workshop on
Earth Science and Mountain Building, one on Engineering Science and Photonics,
and the third one on Atmospheric Science and Meteorology. This project is to
support U.S. scientists to participate in the Meteorology workshop. The topics
include: 1. Severe weather (e.g., hurricane/typhoon, flash flood, etc.)
observation and forecasting; 2. Orographic induced precipitation and mesoscale
storm systems; 3. WRF and data assimilation system applications.

JOSS requests funds to send selected U.S. scientists to Taiwan for the workshop.

Intellectual merit The U.S. and Taiwan have been cooperating in research aimed
at understanding the dynamics and societal effects of extreme precipitation
events, earth system modeling and the COSMIC radio occultation satellite science
missions. The workshop will be the latest in a decades-long collaboration that
has resulted in enhanced scientific understanding of these areas of science.

Broader impacts The U.S. and Taiwan have both experienced severe precipitation
events for many decades. These events cause local flash flooding, property
damage and, occasionally, loss of lives. The enhanced ability to understand the
dynamics of these extreme events and the subsequent ability to provide better
and more timely forecasting to the general public will materially reduce the
negative societal effects of local flooding and property damage, and may result
in fewer lives lost.
