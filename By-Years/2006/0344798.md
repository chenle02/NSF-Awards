&lt;br/&gt;Eukaryotic cells establish and maintain polarized cellular domains
which are essential for intracellular transport, cell differentiation, cell
shape and cell locomotion. Previous studies identified nineteen independent
genes that control cell morphogenesis in fission yeast. One of these genes,
orb6, has a key role in the regulation of both cell shape and cell
proliferation. Orb6p is ser/thr protein kinase that is conserved in higher
eukaryotes, and is related to mammalian LATS kinase. The objective of this
project is to define the Orb6p kinase effectors that regulate cell morphology
and to determine the mechanisms of control of Orb6p kinase. Studies will be
performed that address the following aspects of Orb6p function: (1) Spatial and
temporal control of cell morphology by Orb6p kinase. Using a combined
biochemical, cell imaging and genetic approach this project will establish: (a)
the role of Orb6p kinase activity in the control of polarized cell growth and
the cytoskeleton; (b) The presence of cytoskeleton control proteins in the
multiprotein complex associated with Orb6p kinase; (c) The role of
Orb6p-associated proteins as substrate targets of the Orb6p kinase in the
control of cell morphology. (2) Mechanisms of control of Orb6p kinase activity.
Previous studies have found that Orb6p is phosphorylated in vivo and that Orb6p
kinase activity is strongly stimulated by hyper-osmotic stress. These studies
intend to: (a) examine changes in Orb6p protein phosphorylation in response to
hyper-osmotic stress; (b) test specific kinase pathways for their involvement in
the control of Orb6p protein phosphorylation and Orb6p kinase activity. These
studies will offer training opportunities in biochemical, yeast genetics and
microscopical techniques to researchers of different backgrounds and levels of
education, including high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and
medical fellows.
