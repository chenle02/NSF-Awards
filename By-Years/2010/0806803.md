This project is called META: Math, Engineering and Technology Awards Program.
META provides scholarships and student support to 105-140 economically
disadvantaged students with GPAs of 2.5 or higher. Degrees/certificates targeted
include Biotechnology, Microbiology, Forensics, Geology, Mathematics, Computer
Science, Engineering, Physics, four Computer Information Systems degrees,
Engineering Technology, Engineering Technology for Civil Engineering, Surveying
Engineering Technology, Electronics Technology, Computer Electronics Technology,
Communications Electronics Technology, Nuclear Electronics, Computer-Aided
Engineering Drafting, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design, and Geographic
Information Systems. META services include comprehensive academic/career
counseling, supplemental instruction/cohort learning communities, tutoring,
study groups and STEM club activities in a MESA Center for STEM students, and
field trips; scholars meet weekly with faculty, counselors, and/or faculty/peer
mentors.

META integrates research on best practices in persistence and retention
strategies for disadvantaged students into STEM programs, and advances discovery
and understanding about these issues among educators, while promoting teaching,
training, and learning through faculty and student training and mentorships. The
goal of META is to broaden participation in STEM fields, increasing the number
of STEM certificates and associate degrees awarded. With potential to attract
and prepare 30-40 predominantly minority students annually to enter four-year
STEM programs, META increases the STEM applicant pool, raises the number of
individuals employed in technical areas of national need, and attracts new
industries to this area.
