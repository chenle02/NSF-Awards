This dissertation project examines a little studied but prominent aspect of the
scientific encounter between Europeans and Chinese in the British naturalists
interest in and investigation of the natural history of China. Its objectives
are to understand (1) the interactions between the naturalists and the local
Chinese community involved in their scientific activities and (2) the process of
interpreting new data and the translation between the different traditions of
natural history. The project involves extensive research into primary and
secondary sources in both English and Chinese. Much of the material has not been
examined in depth by historians. The results of this project promise to deepen
our understanding of the issues of science and mperialism and comparative
studies of scientific traditions.
