Southeast Asia has long been an area of US strategic interest, as well as an
area of immense linguistic diversity. This project investigates Tai languages
spoken in Khamti District, Myanmar (Burma), a place that has seen almost no
linguistic fieldwork. It unites traditional language documentation with modern
quantitative analysis, using new field data to improve our understanding of
these languages. This hybrid approach enables innovative answers to research
questions that traditional methods have not sufficiently answered, and that
modern methods cannot answer with only the data currently available.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fieldwork will focus on modern evidence for historical
tones and phonology in the Tai languages, while also providing important
linguistic and cultural context for the data. The project also undertakes an
ambitious survey of all existing lexical data, from resources published in more
than a dozen countries. These results will be organized alongside the new field
data into a database designed for quantitative study of Tai language history,
which will be used to produce a dissertation, a corpus of texts, and a
comparative dictionary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As some of the first linguistic
fieldwork in Myanmar, this project improves our understanding of the language
situation in a long inaccessible part of the world, which serves to strengthen
US relations with Myanmar. Improvement in these areas contributes to greater
regional stability within Southeast Asia, further advancing American political
and economic interests in this part of the world.
