[HRD 0811750] Prairie View A&M University is infusing modern computational
engineering tools (CAx) across and throughout their design curricula in the
Mechanical Engineering Dept. The goal is being achieved through the development
of self-learning tutorials and modules, and through introducing closed-form and
open-ended projects to reinforce the teaching of engineering fundamentals. The
CAx tools are systematically integrated in the engineering design courses
through freshman to senior. CAx tools, including Unigraphics NX5, MSC. ADAMS,
ANSYS, and Altair.Hyperworks, are being adopted in order to train students in
engineering design and to analyze engineering problems.
