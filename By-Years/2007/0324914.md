Graph partitioning is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that has
many practical applications such as in supporting efficient load balancing for
parallel processing, in VLSI layout, and in data clustering. This proposed
research program focuses on the study of spectral methods for graph
partitioning. Spectral methods make use of the eigenvectors of graph matrices
(e.g., the Laplacian or the adjacency matrix of a graph) to construct a quality
partitioning. They have been popularly used in practice for partitioning meshes
in scientific simulation, for dividing graphs derived from circuits, and for
clustering data in web-graph analysis and information organization. However, the
quality of the partition that these methods should produce has so far eluded
precise analysis. Spielman and the PI made some breakthrough progresses. In
particular, by proving that the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian
matrices of bounded-degree planar graphs is at most O(1/n), Spielman and the PI
showed that proper use of spectral techniques can produce a bisection of graphs
with cut size at most $O(\sqrt{n})$, which is best possible for the family of
planar graphs.
