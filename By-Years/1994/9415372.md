This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student at
City University of New York. The project analyzes the development of the alpaca
knitwear industry in highland Bolivia, where hand-knitting for export has become
an important source of employment for local women. The project will examine how
home-based production has provided a based around which women have organized,
and how knitting has affected the status of women in the community. The project
will examine the impact of development projects working with knitters. The
research will advance our understanding of the effects of intensification of
artisan production on women's status and workloads. Methods include participant
observation, structured interviews with a sample of workers and their
households, and analysis of development agencies and wholesalers in the artesian
knitting industry. This research is important because many development projects
are similar to this, providing income-generating skills and outlets for women in
agrarian or developing economies. Understanding the impact of the development on
the household lives of women will provide valuable information to development
planners.
