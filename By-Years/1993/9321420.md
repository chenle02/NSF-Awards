9321420 Albert The proposed project is a field study of the physical processes
that affect the manner in which atmospheric constituents are incorporated into
polar snow and firn at the surface of the Greenland ice sheet. These processes
are an important component in reconstructing the characteristics of
paleoatmospheres from the observation of inclusions in deep ice cores, and
consist of the direct transport by the flow of air within the snow (advection),
the molecular scale dispersion (diffusion), and the effects of solar radiation
penetrating into the snow. The air-to-snow transfer of atmospheric constituents
is filtered and potentially altered by such processes. The objectives are to
define the magnitude and extent in space and time of these transfer processes,
and to develop a process-level understanding and a capability to model these
processes. Field studies will be conducted in central Greenland in the summer of
1994 to determine the spatial and temporal variability of key parameters, and to
observe boundary conditions needed to constrain the model. An existing
multidimensional numerical model will be extended and verified to simulate the
advection, diffusion, and radiation transmission/absorption processes. ***
