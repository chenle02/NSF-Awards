The American Enterprise Institute proposes to convene experts in the science
underlying biotechnology, applications in biotechnology, analysis of risks and
benefits of biotechnology, international trade and the regulatory environment to
discuss the issues and outlook for the future of biotechnology. The papers and
highlights of the ensuing discussion will be published for wider distribution.
Those slated to speak or participate on panels are highly qualified, and this
type of discussion is important to the continuing development of commercial
biotechnology. An award for partial support of the conference is recommended.
