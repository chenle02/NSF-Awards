The eyes are responsible for transducing light, but the brain must interpret the
retinal images before a person can see the properties of the objects around
them. To do this the brain extracts signals (such as motion, color, and
binocular disparities) from the retinal images and then uses these signals as
''cues'' to construct visual percepts that accurately represent the local
environment. For example, binocular disparities are signals that are used by the
brain as a cue for depth, which can be demonstrated by looking at a stereogram.
A question of long standing interest is how the brain knows which cues to use
during the construction of a given percept. In other words, how does the brain
learn to use cues appropriately during perception?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Backus and his colleagues are
conducting experiments to clarify an important aspect of this problem, namely,
how the brain decides to start utilizing a new cue during perception. Recent
work in the Backus lab confirmed that under certain conditions the brain''s
visual system can be trained to use new cues. This training was achieved by
means of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning procedures in which a new signal
(such as a motion direction) was paired with depth cues that were already
trusted by the brain (such as binocular disparity). The experiments will use
simulated 3D stimuli to measure the rate at which new cues are learned under a
variety of conditions. In addition to advancing our basic understanding of
perceptual learning, this work may lead to the development of new techniques for
training human perception and to better computer vision systems that can improve
themselves through learning.
