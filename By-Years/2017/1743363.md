This project seeks to extend the capabilities and capacity of the Cloudlab
compute cloud in the second phase of the NSFCloud program. Since CloudLab began
service in mid-2015, this experimental research infrastructure has become a
critical experimental resource for the computer science research community.
CloudLab has served over 2,000 users in over 39,000 experiments spanning more
than 400 projects, with experimenters coming from nearly every state. The
Cloudlab project continues to increase its support of computing for the domain
science research communities, and support of technology transfers to commercial
cloud technology providers and users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Phase II
activity seeks to expand the testbed capacity and capabilities through 11
enumerated hardware and software extensions to satisfy the growing needs of
leading computer science systems researchers. The three major areas of new
technology investments are in 1) new cloud networking technology, 2) support for
new cloud architectures, and 3) increased programmability in cloud network data
planes.
