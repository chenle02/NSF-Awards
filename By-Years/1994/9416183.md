9416183 Arnold This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The study aims to make a contribution to
filling a gap in knowledge relating to the direct and indirect effects of
earthquakes by undertaking a systematic investigation of building damage,
business interruption and recovery involving a significant inventory of
buildings and businesses in the epicentral region during the first twelve months
following the Northridge earthquake. The study inventory consists of
approximately 170 business members of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce,
together with approximately 200 stores at Northridge Fashion Center. It is
intended that the results of this study will provide greatly improved
understanding of the effects of such earthquakes on a prototypical business
community, significant input into economic models used for estimating direct and
indirect economic losses in future earthquakes, and valuable insights into the
significance of types of structural and nonstructural damage and their effects
on business viability. ***
