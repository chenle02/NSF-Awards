The objective of this project is to determine the technical feasibility of
removing organic substances from water by an electrochemical, reduction-
oxidation process. This line of research will be continued with specific
emphasis on conditions needed to selectively destroy phenols, chlorinated
ethanes, phthalic esters, and chloroform.
