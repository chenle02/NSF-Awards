9455636 Mandelbrot This project is building on the inherent interest in fractal
geometry by creating materials for a series of 3 fractal-based undergraduate
mathematics courses: an introductory pre-calculs course emphasizing concepts,
visualization, and interdisciplinary connections, particularly to art, music,
philosophy and economics; a post-calculus course presenting the same material at
a deeper mathematical level; and an upper level course on the applications of
fractals and chaos including a detailed examination of data analysis and
modeling. All courses will make extensive use of computers in lecture
demonstrations, student homework, and communication and dissemination of course
materials. Platform independent graphics software will be developed to
facilitate this program. Detailed instructor lesson plans will be developed and
tested.
