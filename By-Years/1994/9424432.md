The objective of this project is to develop and validate 3D vortex element
methods on both fine and coarse grained parallel architectures. The numerical
schemes are based on discretization of the vorticity field into a large number
of Lagrangian elements, and transport of these elements along particle
trajectories. This award will, in particular, be used to support Prof. S.
Huberson's participation in constructing and optimizing the algorithms.
