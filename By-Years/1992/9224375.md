The goal of this project is to facilitate the use of partial evaluation in
broader applications and by a larger class of users. To do so, a comprehensive
plan to refine and extend the design and implementation of partial evaluation
systems is proposed. The anticipated contributions of this work include:
Improving the quality of residual programs by exploring and designing new tools
for a programming environment of a partial evaluation system, and by developing
new techniques to improve the accuracy of the binding-time analysis. Extending
partial evaluation to handle side-effects by developing an automatic binding-
time analysis and a program specializer. The first part of this work will focus
on the notion of references a la ML. The improvements described above will allow
further applications of partial evaluation in some areas as well as the attack
upon new ones. Examples from the area of compiler generation are sub-typing,
generic functions, exceptions, and task operations. A novel use of partial
evaluation in operating systems involves using partial evaluation to derive
automatically implementations of operating system components from generic
specifications.
