9357677 Kallinderis The proposed research addresses large-scale simulation of
fluid flow and general transport phenomena. The objectives are the development
of parallel adaptive numerical algorithms and dynamic data structures which are
portable and architecture-independent. These developments should lead to
dramatic increases in computational performance and efficiency.
