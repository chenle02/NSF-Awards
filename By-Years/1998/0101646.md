&lt;br/&gt;The institution is developing a watershed learning environment for
their Integrated Natural Resources Technology program's innovative and
successful curriculum. The Watershed Research and Assessment Project (WRAP) adds
a contextual framework to the existing curriculum by integrating it physically
into a small watershed so that students experience the interconnectedness and
complexity of an ecosystem. This approach produces multi-disciplinary natural
resource technicians with the knowledge, comprehension, and skills to support
efforts for solving key environmental issues in the region. An important aspect
of the program is the involvement of area high schools and local communities in
the learning process. The project enables these groups to participate in
collaborative watershed studies. The interdisciplinary faculty include those
with extensive technician and technology education, as well as research and
natural resources management experience. They are uniquely suited to develop and
disseminate the Watershed Research and Assessment Project material and methods
to high schools, community colleges and community
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
