The purpose of this project is to develop a set of research-based, classroom-
tested recommendations for teaching genetics and problem solving. During Phase
I, national experts in genetics problem solving and genetics education, problem
solving in other sciences and mathematics, and genetics will participate with
exemplary high school teachers in a convergence entitled "Teaching Genetics:
Recommendations and Research." The conference will develop (a) a consensus of
recommendations/alternatives for teaching genetics in high school so as to
enhance student understanding of genetics and enhance the development of student
skills for solving genetics problems, (b) a listing of the current research
support for each recommendation, (c) a research agenda for testing the effect of
implementing these recommendations in the classroom, and (d) a commitment from
interested participants to cooperate in conducting experimental studies that
judge the value and practical effectiveness of the teaching recommendations.
