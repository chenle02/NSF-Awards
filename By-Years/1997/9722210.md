This action will extend the work in progress work by a group at the University
of Colorado to develop advanced instrumentation for the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). As part of a collaborative effort they
will pursue numerical modeling to continue development of an active seismic
isolation system for LIGO. The modeling techniques they develop will be used by
other groups working on isolation systems related to LIGO. This project is
jointly supported by the Division of Physics and the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities.
