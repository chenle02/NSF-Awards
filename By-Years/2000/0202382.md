The principal investigator proposes here to study groups defined by a single
relation. Such groups arise as fundamental groups in algebraic topology, as
discrete groups of transformations in analysis and geometry and in abstract
group theory. The importance of such a study is in its many connections to other
branches of mathematics, as well as to computer science and logic. Progress will
shed light on a number of other subjects. These include the theories of
hyperbolic and automatic groups, computability, genetic and other algorithms and
may lead to a deeper understanding of finitely presented groups as a whole. This
proposal represents a first step in an overall study of one-relator groups,
using the number of steps in a so-called Magnus breakdown, as the basis for
induction. The principal investigator, together with his many colleagues, will
initiate this study by focussing attention on one-relator groups of planarity
one. These are the very special HNN extensions of a free group that arise in the
first step of the Magnus breakdown referred to above.

Groups are mathematical structures which are designed, in part, to capture the
intrinsic nature of symmetry. Consequently groups play an extremely important
role in geometry, in chrystallography, in particle physics, in chemistry and in
cryptography as well as in much of mathematics. Their uses in cryptography are
yet to be exploited; RSA encryption may be viewed as a first step in this
direction. Many of the problems of the physical world can be translated into
problems in group theory. On the other hand, many processes, such as evolution,
can be used to unravel the nature of particular groups. Thus group theory
provides a testing ground for a better understanding of these processes. The
principal investigator, in the work to be undertaken, will, in particular, use
group theory to attempt to improve on one of the most exciting new aspects of
computer science, so-called genetic algorithms. Such algorithms appear to be a
means for designing ever more intelligent computers.
