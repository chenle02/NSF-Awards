9528086 Houston This project will contribute to the understanding of ozone
photodissociation and formation processes in the upper atmosphere. Several new
mechanisms for additional ozone production in this region have been suggested
recently. One of them involves the production of vibrationally excited oxygen
molecules from the photodissociation of ozone, which could react with ground
state oxygen molecules to form ozone. The first step of this process, production
of vibrationally excited oxygen, has been demonstrated by the PI in earlier
work. The second step, ozone formation, has not been unambiguously identified,
however, there is indirect evidence from recent work. In this project, the
technique of product imaging will be used in concert with laser
photodissociation. In the imaging technique, a "snap-shot" of the three-
dimensional velocity distribution of a state-selected reaction product is
produced. From this, the internal energy distribution of the molecular oxygen
fragment can be deduced. The objectives of this project are: (1) determine the
wavelength dependence of the production of triplet oxygen in the vibrational
states above the energetic threshold (v=26) for ozone formation via reaction
with another oxygen molecule, (2) investigate the product distributions in the
singlet dissociation channel.
