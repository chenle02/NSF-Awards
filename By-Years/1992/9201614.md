This proposal describes research on confined electron systems using optical
measurements in the highest magnetic fields and lowest temperatures available at
the National Magnet Lab. The research involves a collaboration with crystal
growth experts at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. High-quality GaAs structure with quantum
wells and other confined geometries will be investigated in magnetic fields to
69 T and temperatures as low as 0.03 K. Phenomena being investigated include
Wigner crystalline solids, the fractional quantum Hall effect, metal-insulator
transition and excitations of coupled Landau-intersubband levels. The materials
will be investigated with inelastic light scattering and emission spectroscopy.
