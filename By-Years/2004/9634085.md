9634085 Robinson This research leads to an analysis of the mathematical content
of sixteen comprehensive, materials development projects in mathematics funded
by NSF. The deliverable is a publication that shows for each project the
mathematics that students who have used the materials should know. Discussions
of pedagogical and staff development issues are also provided. The need for such
a study is illuminated by the observation that the materials developed by these
projects place the mathematical topics in various contexts that are intended to
make the mathematics more meaningful and attract the attention of students.
These contexts are very rich and require a careful analysis to see all the
mathematical topics that are embedded. For example, on the surface the "Cookies"
unit from the Interactive Mathematics Program appears to be an attempt to
introduce mathematical programming, but in fact the purpose of the unit is for
students to learn how to manipulate equations and how to reason using graphs.
