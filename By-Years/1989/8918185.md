The purpose of this research is to examine patterns of growth and survivorship
of tropical wet forest tree species, and to determine the factors which most
influence these patterns. This project is a continuation of a long-term,
multidisciplinary study of a diverse spectrum of canopy and emergent tree
species in a Costa Rican Tropical wet forest (the La Selva Biological Station of
the Organization for Tropical Studies). This phase of the research will focus on
plant population processes, photosynthetic and growth responses of saplings and
adults to environmental conditions, and forest-level evaluation of the light
environment. Electronic light sensors and new techniques for computerized
analysis of the forest canopy will be used to measure the distribution and
variation in light availability to the trees during regeneration. Data will also
be gathered on the physiological characteristics (photosynthetic capacity) of
saplings and adults with known histories of growth and light environment. Such
integrated information is critical for understanding and managing tropical
forests, and can be obtained only by combining expertise from different fields.
