This international workshop will be held in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, in
July of 1995, following the World Conference on Resource Modeling, sponsored by
the Resource Modeling Association (RMA). Researchers from the US, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Germany, and the UK will formulate
scientific proposals for collaborative research in one of two areas,
`Sustainability in Herbivore-Vegetation Interactions in Semi-Arid Environments`
or `Freshwater Requirements for Southern African Ecosystems.` The co-organizers
of this workshop include: Dr. Wayne Getz, principal investigator, University of
California at Berkeley; Dr. Roland Lamberson, collaborator, Humboldt State
University; Dr. Anthony Starfield, collaborator, University of Minnesota at St.
Paul; Dr. Norman Owen-Smith, collaborator, University of Witswatersrand in South
Africa; and Dr. John Hearne, collaborator, University of Natal in South Africa.
This workshop will introduce US scientists to South African natural resource
problems, and will catalyze US-South African collaboration in resource modeling.
As South Africa is facing increasing pressure on its natural resources, the
workshop provides a timely means to facilitate international knowledge of and
access to South African resources, and to share international expertise. The NSF
funding of the international travel costs will stimulate scientific
collaboration among the Resource Modeling Association members and a diverse
group of African and US scientists, including US women and minority scientists,
South Africans from disadvantaged backgrounds, and Mozambican and Zimbabwean
researchers.
