This proposal seeks funding to support US-based graduate students to attend the
conference. Attending important conferences like Middleware is a critical
experience for graduate students since it exposes them to new ideas, and helps
them build a network with other researchers. Middleware includes significant
participation from industry, making it a particularly good opportunity for
students to learn about practical problems. Middleware brings together
participants from both academia and industry, which will help students learn
about both career opportunities and realistic challenges faced by industry
today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance the education, training,
and career development of U.S. graduate students by introducing them to new
research topics, points of view, technologies, and potential collaborations.
Students will have the chance to see presentations on cutting edge research in
the field of distributed software systems and middleware.
