This award supports an international workshop on the mathematics of dynamical
systems to be held at the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from July 20-31, 1989. The U.S. organizer is Sheldon
Newhouse of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Brazilian
organizer is J. Palis of IMPA. The participants consist of seven leading
mathematicians from the U.S., the same number from Brazil and five Europeans.
The workshop will bring together experts in the field of dynamical systems to
discuss results and progress on significant problems in this area. There has
been important progress in this field in the last twenty years with impact in
many areas of science, particularly in physics, biology, economics and
chemistry. Therefore, this workshop is an opportunity for the exchange of
recently developed knowledge and ideas, important for the goals of the
U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Research Program. In addition, it will further develop
the strong background of cooperation between these two countries in dynamical
systems.
