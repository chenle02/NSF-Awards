In 1983 an algorithmic description of the method of equivalence of E. Cartan
was given by the proposer. These ideas were pursued and resulted in a set of
Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences lecture series in August of 1987. This
project consists of continuing the general program with applications to three
problems interfacing control theory. The first is to complete to the extent that
it is practical the study of control systems under feedback. The second is to
begin and complete the study of control systems under feedback. The second is to
begin and complete as far as it is practical the equivalence problem for the
dual observability problem. The third is the development of a symbolic
manipulation program to convert abstract solutions of equivalence problems into
parametric solutions.
