This project upgrades and improves the equipment used in the biomedical
engineering laboratory at Wright State University by interfacing state-of-the-
art physiological signal conditioners into existing PC-controlled workstations.
Currently the special transducers and matched signal conditioners are borrowed
from another academic department. More than ten laboratory experiments which are
offered in conjunction with three required senior courses, will be directly
benefited with this equipment. These laboratory experiments involve the
measurements of either biological signals directly from living subjects (e.g.
ECG signal) or transduced signals from simulated biological systems (e.g. an
artificial kidney). The acquisition of this equipment greatly improves the
quality of the undergraduate biomedical laboratory. This award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
