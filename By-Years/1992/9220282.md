The 1992 Joint Meeting of the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S) and
European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST) is to be
held August 12-15, 1992 in Gothenburg, Sweden. A group of U.S. academic
participants will organize two sessions dedicated to international human
resource issues, and prepare a special analysis of session materials and
discussions for NSF. This report is intended to contribute to an agenda for
international human resources issues relevant to planning NSF international
activities. As one issue, the special analysis will consider the availability of
international measures of science and technology human resource trends. Other
international issues will be addressed concerning scientist and engineering
education and practice worldwide in terms of equity issues, training and
retraining. The special analysis will serve as highly useful input to NSF and
INT in planning international initiatives. ***
