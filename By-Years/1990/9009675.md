The patch clamp has revolutionized the study of electrophysiology, but little
is currently known about the structure of patches. Knowledge of structure is
important for proper interpretation of single channel data, especially data from
mechanosensitive ion channels, where the cytoskeleton plays a major role in
activating the channel. By combining electrophysiology, light and electron
microscopy of patches, general techniques for understanding patch structure will
be developed. These techniques will aid in determining the structural
alterations that occur in the preparation of a patch for electron microscopy and
the structure of the interface between the membrane and pipette. Images of
"living" patches will be made using optical microscopy with high magnification
video. To observe the ultrastructure, a device will be built to rapidly freeze
the patch after light microscopic examination. After freeze drying, patches will
be examined as whole mounts in the high voltage electron microscope. Comparison
of patch images will be made with light and electron microscopy, using two
dimensional projection images, stereo pairs, and complete three dimensional
image sets. Techniques for freeze fracturing, etching and replicating fragments
of pipette tips will be developed to study the interaction that occurs between
the membrane and the wall of the pipette. Examination of several types of cells
will aid in determining which structures are general and which structures
represent tissue-specific differences between patches. Since the patch clamp and
the electron microscope have the potential for describing single molecules,
cross correlating results from both techniques will lead to a new level of
structure-function relationships.
