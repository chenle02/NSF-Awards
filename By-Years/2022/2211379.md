This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is
threefold. First, to study permutations from a combinatorial and geometric point
of view. Permutations are ways to describe symmetries and arrangements of
objects. They have applications in many fields such as computer science (e.g.,
sorting algorithms), physics (e.g., describing states of quantum particles), and
biology (e.g., describing RNA sequences). This project seeks to describe the
composition of permutations that share a given collection of properties and
their spatial distribution when plotting these permutations in a Cartesian
space. The second focus is the study of arithmetical structures of graphs.
Graphs are ways to geometrically describe a given relationships between a
collection of objects. Arithmetical structures of graphs provide (among other
things) a combinatorial description of the number of times certain curves
intersect. The PI seeks to describe the total number of arithmetical structures
in certain collection of graphs. Finally, the project will create the Villanova-
Puerto Rico Research Retreat (VPR^3), a collaboration research summer program
between students at Villanova University and the University of Puerto Rico.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on previous work to better understand
peak and descents of permutations. This project aims to describe the structure
coefficients of the peak algebra and provide a combinatorial reciprocity theory
for the coefficients of peak and descent polynomials. These polynomials are
crucial in the enumeration of permutations with a given peak or descent set. A
second goal is to describe a collection of polytopes created by permutations
that share peak sets and those that share descent sets. Finally, the PI will
study the collection of arithmetical structures on a family of “Y-graphs” to
enumerate them and to describe the effect of a smoothing operation on these
arithmetical structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
