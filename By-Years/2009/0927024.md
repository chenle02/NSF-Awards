&lt;br/&gt;The Andaman-Sumatra margin of Southeast Asia is the site of
convergence between the floor of the Indian Ocean and the Asian continent that
spawns major earthquakes and tsunamis, with consequent loss of both lives and
property. An interesting feature of this boundary is that the plate motion
changes from normal convergence (perpendicular to the plate boundary) at Sumatra
to oblique (parallel to the boundary) in the Andaman Sea. This project seeks to
unravel how the displacement is partitioned between these directions, which is
crucial to understanding the tectonics of this region. An additional and very
significant benefit of the work is that build on and improve a rare
collaboration between U.S. investigators and the Indian National Institute of
Oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;
