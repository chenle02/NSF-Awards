Support is provided for a Workshop on Intelligent Control. Intelligent Control
is defined as a control which would replace the human mind in making decisions,
planning control strategies, and learning new functions whenever the environment
does not allow and does not justify the presence of a human operator. This is a
relatively new discipline which has emerged as an intersection of control
theory, artificial intelligence, and operations research; it has been stimulated
by the extensive application of computer science and technology. This award will
provide partial support for travel expenses of a number of key scientists and
engineers who are participating in the workshop, but who for lack of funds might
not be able to attend. The workshop will focus on the critical issues faced by
the discipline of intelligent control, and will define priorities for the
research required in this area during the upcoming years.
