On several billions of hectares, modern land uses are transforming soil
biocomplexity, the interactions between the extremely diverse soil biota and
biogeochemical pattern and process. Regrettably, our understanding of this
transformation lags far behind our impact. This award constitutes an ambitious
planning grant, composed of a variety of the nation's leading soil biologists
and biogeochemists as well as highly talented young scientists, to evaluate how
and why soil biocomplexity is altered by long-practiced land uses. The project
features the soils of the old cotton belt of the southern United States, soils
highly disturbed by long-continued agriculture and forestry. The team will meet
on two occasions as a full group to conceptualize a model of land use impacts on
soil biota and biogeochemistry, and perform preliminary work on novel
collections and samples from the long-term Calhoun Experimental Forest, located
near Spartanburg, South Carolina. The team will apply new expertise in a variety
of complex analytical and sampling techniques.
