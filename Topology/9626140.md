9626140 Kalfagianni This project lies in the general area of low-dimensional
topology. The investigator will attempt to develop a theory of finite type
invariants for knots and links in an arbitrary 3-manifold as a generalization of
the Jones invariants. She will also study these invariants via geometric
methods, and try to understand what types of knots they detect. Low-dimensional
topology is mainly concerned with classifying spaces of dimensions three and
four, where two spaces are treated as equivalent if one space can be deformed
onto the other without tearing - this is known as a homeomorphic transformation.
Such a classification, known as the topological classification, has been
essentially carried out in dimensions other than three and four. It turns out
that these two dimensions provide further technical difficulties, some of which
are topics of much current interest as they interface with various ideas of
modern physics.
