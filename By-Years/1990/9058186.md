The major area of research of this grant is wave scattering from rough surfaces
with emphasis on numerical studies of rough surface scattering models with the
objective of developing a surface scattering model that accurately predicts
acoustic wave scattering, first from the ocean surface and later from the ocean
bottom. Ultimately, what is needed is a model that will work for the most
general type of boundary condition and that can be used for electromagnetic
waves as well as acoustic and optical waves. This is a very difficult problem
which researchers have been working on for decades. It is only with the recent
introduction of high-speed computers and workstations that a solution has become
practicable. In particular investigation into such problems as the detection of
ship wakes and the estimation of wave height and direction will be carried out.
Co- investigators will include a physical oceanographer, a signal processor, a
fluid dynamicist, a fluid experimentalist, and acoustician, a surface scattering
modeler and are currently searching for a remote sensing experimentalist and an
image processor to fill positions in the electrical engineering department.
