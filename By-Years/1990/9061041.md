This is a SBIR Phase I project in the topic area of biological instrumentation.
Aprend Technology will develop an optical force trap micromanipulator using a
semiconductor laser. Such a device is potentially useful as an attachment to
high powered microscopes used in cell biology research. If the product becomes
readily available at a reasonable cost, it is likely to be widely used by the
research community.
