This project develops an undergraduate chemical engineering laboratory program
in which a significant part of the program involves a unifying theme based upon
a functioning process/device rather than upon the thematic classroom curriculum.
Instead of constructing experiments so that the data obtained is in agreement
with theoretical models developed in lecture classes, a real process/device is
studied throught the laboratory course and forms the basis for unifying and
integrating the classroom material. Chromatography forms a suitable basis for
such an approach in chemical engineering, and therefore is used.
