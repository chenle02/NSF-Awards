****Technical Abstract****

The two-dimensional electron gas confined to GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures
provides a model platform for the study of emergent phenomena brought about by
strong electron-electron interactions in systems with reduced dimensionality.
Recent theoretical work suggests that the two-dimensional electron system hosts
novel phases of matter with previously unanticipated topological order and
unusual quasiparticle statistics. The concept of topological order has been
extended to many novel materials and it now permeates modern condensed matter
physics. Our work focuses on questions of fundamental science of the two-
dimensional electron gas such as inducing transitions between the various ground
states of interest and the search for novel topological invariants. This project
will constitute excellent preparation for a graduate student for his/her future
academic or industrial career through the study of modern condensed matter
physics and training in modern semiconductor processing, in conducting low level
measurements, and in the use of cryogenic equipment. Undergraduate students will
be introduced to concepts and techniques used in condensed matter physics.

*****Non-Technical Abstract****

Studies of the fractional quantum Hall effect reveal fascinating rules according
to which the interacting quantum mechanical electrons arrange themselves. It has
recently come to the fore that it is possible that certain fractional states may
have a new type of internal degree of freedom called topological order. The
concept of topological order may allow storing and manipulating quantum
information in new ways and it has now conceptually been applied to many novel
condensed matter materials. For this project we will study this hidden order in
clean two-dimensional electron gases. The experiments will be at the confluence
of modern semiconductor processing, nanophysics, and state-of-the art cryogenic
technology. This project will support the education of a doctoral student in
modern condensed matter physics which has historically provided excellent
training for carriers both in academia as well as in high tech industries.
