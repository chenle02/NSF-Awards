This developmental proposal aims to create an integrated South&lt;br/&gt;Texas
CLT. The three institutional partners are The University of Texas
--&lt;br/&gt;Pan American, The University of Texas -- San Antonio, and The
University of&lt;br/&gt;Texas -- Austin. The CLT will work primarily with school
districts in San&lt;br/&gt;Antonio and the lower Rio Grande Valley of south
Texas. More than 70% of the K-12&lt;br/&gt;students are economically
disadvantaged and almost 80% are Hispanic. During&lt;br/&gt;the developmental
phase they will explicitly assess the regional science,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics
and technology (SMT) educational needs and the
specific&lt;br/&gt;responsibilities of the participating institutions for
meeting those needs&lt;br/&gt;within a CLT. They will also evaluate relevant
existing models and project&lt;br/&gt;strategies dealing with defined goals and
objectives (e.g., recruitment,&lt;br/&gt;professional development, and/or
pipeline infrastructures/career pathways&lt;br/&gt;for SMT educator preparation)
especially those appropriate for the&lt;br/&gt;preparation of teachers of
Hispanic students from bilingual, bicultural and&lt;br/&gt;low socio-economic
environments. Part of the developmental process will&lt;br/&gt;focus on
developing models appropriate for meeting these goals and
for&lt;br/&gt;identifying other institutional partners including community
colleges and&lt;br/&gt;professional organizations.&lt;br/&gt;
