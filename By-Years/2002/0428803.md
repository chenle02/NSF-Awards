Lynch-Stieglitz/99-84989 This CAREER Award provides funding to reconstruct the
patterns and magnitudes of major upper ocean currents over the past 60,000 years
using the oxygen isotope composition of foraminifera archived in ocean
sediments. In the educational portion of this proposal, the PI requests funding
to develop and implement a educational summer internship program for high school
girls. The PI plans to pair them with scientists at Lamont Doherty engaged in
various solid earth, ocean, atmospheric, and life science research activities.
