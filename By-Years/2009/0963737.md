Computing today is at a critical juncture as processors move away from
uniprocessors to multicore processors. Without innovations in how to
writeprograms to make use of multiple processing cores, software vendors will no
longer have access to increasing processing performance, a phenomenon that has
driven the growth of the computer industry for over four decades. Realizing the
enormity of the situation many leaders have put parallel computing high on their
list of critical research issues and many researchers are trying to build on
four decades of knowledge to make progress in this critical area.

This research is investigating a novel approach to attacking this critical
problem, one that is counter to much of the prevailing wisdom on parallel
execution. The approach couples widely used sequential programrepresentations
with a novel dynamic parallel execution model to achieve parallel execution.
Initial experience with this new approach has been very promising: it can
achieve parallelism comparable to, and sometimes better than, applications
parallelized with traditional techniques, but can do so without the drawbacks of
the traditional techniques. This work investigates the applicability and
effectiveness of this new approach for a variety of problem areas, including
database, networking, and embedded applications. The work will also investigate
the impact of the novel parallel execution model on the design of processors and
chip multiprocessors. Broader impacts include a potential transformation in how
a variety of important application programs are written for parallel execution
on multicore processors and the consequent design of such processors.
