Over the last decade, deep learning has demonstrated great success in a variety
of application areas mainly due to the simultaneous increase of massive
computing power and the availability of extremely large datasets for training
networks with a large number of parameters. It is also well-known that
conventional deep learning suffers from data scarcity, namely, too few (even no)
data samples exist for learning because it is too expensive to collect data or
the data set is small as compared to the necessary amount. Such cases are common
in real life such as rare disease diagnosis which significantly restricts the
applicability of deep learning. Thus, there is a crucial need for data-efficient
deep learning with very limited data. This project seeks to provide innovative
solutions to many important real-world problems such as autonomous driving,
manufacturing automation, robotics, surveillance, healthcare, and big data
analysis. It will support the national initiative of “Artificial Intelligence
for the American People” that accelerates AI discoveries and maintains American
leadership in AI technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on
knowledge-integrated data-efficient deep learning, along three different
thrusts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Data-efficient deep learning with large-scale
knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs, widely-used as a priori knowledge for
reliable reasoning, can be used to significantly reduce the need of training
data. A novel bilevel optimization approach is proposed to address this problem
from the perspectives of structured learning and optimal transport. The
mathematical foundation in optimization can also lead to better understanding of
some theoretical questions such as the model complexity in data-efficient
learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Self-supervised data augmentation. Data
itself is subjective and open to interpretation as empirical knowledge. To
address this problem, nonlinear topological dimension reduction using self-
supervision is proposed to generate new data for training deep learning models.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Hardware architecture for data-efficient deep learning
algorithms. Data efficient deep learning has the potential to revolutionize the
applications of AI regarding modeling, predicting, and decision making. Along
with software, an FPGA-based power-efficient, reconfigurable hardware
architecture is proposed for the developed algorithms and will be tested in a
perception system for autonomous driving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
