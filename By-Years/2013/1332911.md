This project will develop and test a non-traditional method to measure the time-
varying heat content and vertical temperature profile in high-latitude seas,
shelves, and fjords using pressure-sensor-equipped inverted echo sounders
(PIES). PIES, which are installed on the seafloor below the reach of destructive
iceberg keels, present a promising and inexpensive way to improve understanding
of fjord dynamics and shelf-fjord interactions and will increase long-term
monitoring capabilities in high latitudes where remoteness and harsh conditions
hamper traditional in situ observation techniques. The use of PIES to
characterize variability at high latitudes is a novel repurposing of an existing
technology, but rests on the same principle as the traditional blue-water uses
for PIES: due to the dependence of sound speed on temperature, the surface-to-
bottom round-trip acoustic-travel-time associated with reflections between the
PIES and the air-sea interface is an excellent proxy for heat content in the
intervening water column. Furthermore, since reflections from seawater-ice
interfaces are also detected when ice is present, PIES also provide a means to
characterize the ice component in high-latitude systems. The PIs propose to
develop these methods with existing PIES data collected in a 1-year test
deployment in Sermilik Fjord in eastern Greenland and with observations to be
collected in a 2-year deployment of three PIES in the fjord and on the nearby
shelf.
