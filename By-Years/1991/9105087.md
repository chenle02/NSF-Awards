Cell movements such as phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and cytokinesis require
precise control of the assembly of actin filaments into either randomly gelled
networks or highly polarized bundles. Formation of these cross-linked actin
structures is mediated by actin cross-linking proteins. This project focuses on
the structure and function of the Dictyostelium 30,000 dalton actin bundling
protein, one of seven actin cross-linking proteins present in Dictyostelium. The
binding sites for actin and parameters controlling the formation of either actin
gels or bundles will be investigated. The biological function of the protein
will be examined through studies of its interaction with plasma membranes,
intracellular localization during phagocytosis and cytokinesis, and by using a
genetic approach to engineer cells lacking this protein. The structure of
similar molecules in Drosophila and mouse will be examined to determine the
degree of conservation of this protein during evolution of arthropods and
vertebrates. This work will promote our understanding of molecular mechanisms of
cell movements essential to the growth and division of eukaryotic cells.
