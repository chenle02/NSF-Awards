This Career Development Plan is focused on Metric Embeddings, a powerful area of
algorithms research. Interest in embeddings stems from their broad algorithmic
applicability; they are being used extensively to&lt;br/&gt;obtain solutions and
design algorithms that are simple, elegant and versatile. The use of metric
embeddings has often allowed ad-hoc methods to be replaced by powerful general
principles, and has suggested new&lt;br/&gt;approaches to tackle long-standing
open problems. The impact of these techniques can be seen on problems in finding
graph separators, data clustering, network design, streaming computation, and
geometric and&lt;br/&gt;on-line algorithms, to name but a few.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research intends to focus on the algorithmic theory
of embeddings in the context of these applications. Informally, an embedding is
a map of an arbitrary metric space into a ``simpler'' one which does not alter
&lt;br/&gt;distances by much, and the focus of this research is on two natural
and fundamental themes: (a) to investigate the complexity of metric spaces from
an algorithmic perspective, and to use this to develop efficient
&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and (b) to develop embeddings that simplify metrics; i.e.
embed general metric spaces to well-understood simpler
ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal offers a broad spectrum of research
opportunities at both graduate and undergraduate levels: these include the
investigation of theoretical principles, the development of algorithms and
embeddings, &lt;br/&gt;and the implementation and experimental evaluation of
these results. Progress in this research will influence the curriculum via
special courses presenting theoretical advances along with their applications.
&lt;br/&gt;Workshops and seminars will be used to promote interdisciplinary
research.&lt;br/&gt;
