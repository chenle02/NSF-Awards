Core Support for the Board on Biology The Board on Biology (BB) a unit under
the Commission on Life Sciences of the National Research Council, addresses
issues in the biological sciences and their impact on society. Its work
encompasses all of the life sciences, from molecular genetics to biodiversity.
Since 1984 BB has received contracts and grants for the conduct of discrete
studies and has received only a small amount of core support to assist in the
management of BB, in the oversight of its committees, in the organization of
special workshops, and in the development of new ideas for studies. This award
provides modest support for core funding for BB. These funds will help
invigorate the activities of the Board at a time when rapid advances in biology
are occupying an increasingly important role, both in science and in public
policy. BB will facilitate such core activities as a yearly workshop for
sponsors, board members, and other experts to identify and discuss emerging
issues in selected areas and other activities of benefit to biological science.
