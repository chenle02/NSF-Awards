There are many sequential decision problems which can be appropriately modeled
as a repeated game, in which the decision-maker is competing with an adversary.
For instance, in the problem of virus detection in a computer network, the aim
is to label incoming packets as either clean or infected, while a hacker aims to
design infected packets that escape detection. Similar problems arise in other
areas of computer security (including spam filtering and detection of denial-of
service attacks), in internet search (such as deciding if a highly-linked web
page is genuinely authoritative and should have high page rank), and in
financial applications (such as portfolio optimization). In these problems, the
decision-maker aims to perform almost as well as the best element of some
comparison class. Even for decision problems that are not inherently
adversarial, it is often appealing to model them in this way, since the
assumptions are sufficiently weak that effective learning algorithms for these
adversarial settings are very widely applicable. Many of the key algorithmic
approaches to online learning problems can be viewed as methods involving
regularization, an idea that has its origins in the solution of ill-posed
problems, such as statistical estimation problems. This project aims to exploit
this regularization viewpoint in the analysis and design of methods for complex
online learning problems. In particular, its aims are (1) To develop techniques
for decision problems with limited feedback. (2) To develop techniques for
decision problems with complex losses that cannot be simply decomposed into a
sum across trials. (3) To develop efficient learning algorithms that can
simultaneously compete effectively with a variety of rich comparison classes and
a variety of constraints on the adversary. (4) To improve our understanding of
the relationships between online decision problems (in adversarial settings) and
statistical decision problems (in probabilistic settings). Successful research
outcomes of this project are likely to increase our understanding of complex
sequential decision problems and to provide design methodologies for effective
learning algorithms for these problems, and hence have a significant potential
for practical impact in many application areas, including computer security and
computational finance.
