Dr. Cassidy is examining the impact of US policy on the nature and organization
of scientific research in the post-World War II American occupation zone of
Germany. This project focuses on the military phase of occupation through the
division of Germany, the descent into Cold War, and the founding of the Federal
Republic in 1949. The project combines available American perspectives on US
policy, recent German surveys of the early history of German science
organization, and recently available German and American archival resources to
achieve a fuller account of the hitherto little researched subject of the US and
West German science. At the same time, this study lends new perspectives on the
orientation of post-war US policy makers toward basic science and the US role in
post-war Germany and Europe, both during the early years of a period that is now
rapidly drawing to a close.
