This project investigates facets of the Langlands program -- a fundamental area
of Mathematics bridging number theory, geometry, and analysis, and examining in
a systematic way the symmetries inherent in solutions of algebraic equations. By
relating these symmetries to geometry, the program creates a powerful way of
obtaining arithmetic information. The project is particularly concerned with
obtaining such information in an algorithmically computable way. Deep and
explicit knowledge of the arithmetic of numbers is essential for many
technological advances over the last decades that we take for granted today,
including encryption and digital security. Part of this work involves mentoring
of young scientists.

More precisely, the project aims at deepening our understanding of the refined
Arthur-Langlands conjectures for general connected and disconnected reductive
groups, in particular the internal structure of local and global packets and the
character identities satisfied by them. The study of disconnected groups, while
of interest in its own right, is also essential for the study of connected
groups. The special case of disconnected groups over the real numbers will serve
as a first step. An important role in obtaining the refined conjectures beyond
the case of discrete parameters is played by self-intertwining operators acting
on parabolically induced representations, and the project seeks to obtain
natural normalizations of these and a precise statement of the intertwining
relation. The project will also construct non-generic Arthur packets for local
and global unitary groups, and obtain a description of the full discrete
automorphic spectrum of global unitary groups.
