This U.S.-Venezuela award will support Dr. Lee Hartmann and Dr. Scott Kenyon of
the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge
Massachusetts, in a research collaboration with Dr. Nuria Calvet of the Centro
de Investigaciones de Astronomia in Merida, Venezuela. The purpose of the
research is to carry out theoretical and observational investigations of the
acceleration of jets from young stars. These jets or focussed winds emanate from
the accretion disks that surround the youngest stars and are an important
component of the energy budget of star formation. The proposed joint effort
takes advantage of the observational capabilities of the U.S. investigators and
the theoretical experience of the Venezuelan researcher in radiative transfer
models for protostellar accretion disks and winds. The result will be the
development of models for the acceleration of protostellar disk winds and jets
which are consistent with, and supported by observations. This research may have
implications for theories of accretion disk winds for many other astrophysical
systems, such as cataclysmic variables and active galactic nuclei.
