This research will use ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterizations Experiment) aerosol
and radiometric observations to determine the radiative effects of the polluted
aerosol coming from the Asian continent through three objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1.
Develop and validate an aerosol scattering model using the observed aerosol
chemical, microphysical, and light scattering measurements.&lt;br/&gt;2.
Determine the radiative forcing of the aerosol, using this model and observed
radiative fluxes at the surface and top of atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;3. Determine
the context of these results by conducting a comparison of these forcing
properties to those found for other regions, particularly during INDOEX (Indian
Ocean Experiment).&lt;br/&gt;These studies will concentrate on the surface
radiometric and aerosol properties measured from the R/V R. H. Brown, and will
include satellite data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because
of its potential to add new understanding and knowledge about aerosol chemistry
and microphysics and the influence of aerosols on radiative forcing, and hence
climate, over East Asia and the western Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;
