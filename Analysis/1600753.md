The problems addressed in this project ask about properties of shapes in an
ambient space (like a human heart in the body) that can be inferred from
information about their shadows or slices (as in medical imaging). The advantage
of the problems is that the solutions to many of them are "intuitively clear"
not only to graduate students, but also to undergraduate students, and in some
cases, even to high-school pupils! On the other hand, the answers are (very
often) counterintuitive, requiring the use of the most advanced and
sophisticated tools belonging to the different branches of modern mathematics.
Moreover, many of the problems originated not in "pure math," but in medical
imaging and tomography. For this reason the solutions might find very
interesting biomedical applications.

The current project is a continuation of the long-time collaboration between the
two principal investigators. They will continue to use and develop the methods
of harmonic analysis to solve problems arising in convex and discrete geometry.
These problems include ones about Brunn-Minkowski-type inequalities for general
measures, as well as questions related to different versions of slicing
inequalities, including a slicing inequality for general measures and a discrete
version of the slicing inequality. The principal investigators also plan to
continue their work on the unique determination of convex bodies given
information on the size (or some other properties) of projections and sections.
This will involve a mixture of topological, probabilistic, and Fourier-analytic
methods, and part of the work will be concentrated around a classical problem of
Bonnensen that the principal investigators and their collaborators have
previously solved in even dimensions. Many of the techniques developed in that
work are new, and there are high hopes that the methods could help to solve a
number of classical (but still open) questions in geometric tomography.
