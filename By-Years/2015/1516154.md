The cytoplasm of gram-negative bacteria is surrounded by a membrane composed of
two layers: the inner membrane (or periplast) and the outer membrane (OM). The
OM separates the periplasm from the external environment and functions as a
selective barrier that prevents the entry of toxic molecules such as antibiotics
and bile salts into the bacteria. This selective barrier is crucial for survival
of bacteria in diverse and hostile environments. This project seeks to acquire
an in-depth and molecular-level understanding of how the bacterial OMs behave
and work for various types of bacteria, how membrane proteins behave in the OM
and interact with the OM, and how solute molecules, especially antibiotics, can
enter through the OMs. This will be accomplished using start-of-the-art
molecular modeling and simulations. This project will also form the basis for a
general approach for molecular modeling and simulation of the OM that will be
freely available through the CHARMM-GUI website (www.charmm-gui.org) so that
researchers in various disciplines can investigate other important OMs and
associated proteins. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in
the interdisciplinary discipline of computational biophysics. In particular,
this project will raise the scientific literacy of the public through the
publication of research results and workshop participation.

The cell envelope surrounding a gram-negative bacteria's cytoplasm is composed
of an inner membrane, the periplasm, and an outer membrane (OM). The OM is
unique in terms of having beta-barrel membrane proteins and a highly asymmetric
lipid bilayer containing phospholipids in its inner leaflet and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in its outer leaflet. This project aims to provide an
in-depth and unprecedented understanding of the structural and dynamics of the
OMs from various bacteria, interactions between proteins and OMs, and their
influences on antibiotic permeation by establishing reliable computational
methods for all-atom modeling and simulation of various complex OMs of gram-
negative bacteria and membrane proteins in various OMs. The research will found
the basis for a general approach of LPS/OM molecular modeling and simulation.
This project also seeks to foster synergistic scientific research and education
on LPS molecules and bacterial OMs by providing reliable and general
computational methods (through LPS Modeler and Outer Membrane Builder in CHARMM-
GUI) to students and researchers in the simulation community and other
disciplines.
