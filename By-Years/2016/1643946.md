The Community Environmental Scholars Program (CESP) will provide scholarships
and cohort-based training and support for at least 36 low-income junior and
senior students who are STEM majors and also enrolled in an Environmental
Studies major or certificate. Via a weekly seminar taught by STEM faculty
members, CESP connects students with their peers, links them to a network of
CESP graduates, and provides avenues in the community for them to connect their
passion for the environment with a commitment to service. To identify potential
applicants, we work with our Office of Student Financial Aid, current CESP
students, and the wider campus community. Via a campus scholarship portal, we
receive applications fall and spring. Those accepted form a team (cohort) in the
weekly seminar that takes on increasingly complex leadership roles over time.
Ultimately, our goal is to improve the retention of our students in their STEM
disciplines by offering relevant scientific content, opportunities to build
confidence, and enhanced career skills that will allow them to work in diverse
teams to address the real-world challenges faced the communities in which they
live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While existing research already suggests that cohort-
based programs improve student retention within STEM disciplines, there is
little or no research that evaluates whether interdisciplinary STEM cohorts
(such as those in CESP) can improve student performance, retention, and
graduation rates. We will use statistical comparisons to investigate our diverse
cohort design and determine if these important educational outcomes differ
between our CESP students and a comparison group of STEM students who also
enrolled in Environmental Studies but who did not participate in CESP. The
results of our analysis will be shared with institutional peers at conferences
and with the broader community through journal articles and public outreach.
