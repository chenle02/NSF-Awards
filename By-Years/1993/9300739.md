9300739 Hunt The goal of the research is to develop techniques to have outputs
of multi input, multi output (MIMO) nonlinear systems follow nonanalytic
trajectories, which are formed by concatenating analytic segments in time. We
consider a class of nonlinear systems that are feedback equivalent to linear
systems with linear outputs. This is full state linearization which is different
from input output linearization based on relative degree unless the system has
no zeros. This research will include design of regulators to handle modeling
error{ and disturbances. ***
