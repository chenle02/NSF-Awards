This award will provide support for US students to participate in the primary
annual international conference on accelerator science and its applications, the
9th International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPAC`18) to be held in
Vancouver, Canada on April 29 - May 4, 2018. The IPACs are an annual series of
conferences that rotate between the Americas, Europe, and Asia to highlight the
science and engineering of major accelerator facilities, provide scientists with
a forum for presenting results from research conducted using accelerators, and
serve as a venue for describing new applications of accelerators. Accelerators
and accelerator-driven light sources are burgeoning worldwide, offering new
prospects not only for fundamental discovery science, but for medicine, biology,
energy, environment, national security, and industry. This award will give many
students the first opportunity of their scientific careers to be exposed to the
breadth of this growing field of basic and applied
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used to provide partial travel
support for US students to attend the conference. The recipients of the travel
support will be making presentations at the conference and will assist in
conducting the conference. Attendance of 10 US students will be facilitated by
the funds provided by this award. The conference will be an excellent
opportunity for early career scientists to interact with more experienced
researchers and their colleagues in the broader international scientific
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
