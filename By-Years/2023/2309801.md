The conference "Systems of PDEs in Fluid Mechanics and Atmospheric Sciences"
will take place at West Virginia University, in Morgantown, WV, from September
15 to 17, 2023. This award provides funding for a conference to bring together
experts, early researchers, and students, to share and exchange the latest
advances in the study of systems of conservation laws and related applications.
The event will include support for two mini-courses, nine invited talks from
guest speakers and fourteen contributed talks from graduate students and
postdocs.

The main theme of this conference is the study of non-smooth solutions of a wide
variety of partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics, atmosphere
and ocean science and other fields. These solutions may have singularities
corresponding to different physical phenomena. The event will offer two mini-
courses reviewing the theory of systems of conservation laws and optimal
transport, and invited talks on topics including conservation laws with general
fluxes, water waves and non-local conservation laws, adhesion dynamics and
presureless gas systems, and semi-geostrophic equations and optimal transport.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
