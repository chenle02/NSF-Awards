The goal of this proposed research is investigate the roles of primary sequence
and conformational characteristics in determining protein aggregation behavior.
The specific objectives are directed toward experimental and theoretical
investigations of the underlying mechanisms. The ultimate goal is to control
aggregation. To assist in uncovering forces and mechanisms essential to
manipulate protein aggregation properties, the proposed research focuses on the
effects of sequence patterns and solution parameters that impact the competition
between aggregation and refolding. The experimental work will be performed on
multiple systems of interest, including short oligopeptides as well as specific
regions of three different proteins, all of which are suitable candidates for
studies of aggregation.
