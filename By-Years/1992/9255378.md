Howard University Materials Science Research Center of Excellence (MSRCE)
proposes to continue its research in the fields of materials science and
engineering. This center will conduct research on artificially structured
materials and wide-band gap semi conductors to produce optical and electronic
devices, with emphasis on those materials that can operate at high-power levels
and/or in harsh environments. A second objective of the MSRCE is to contribute
to the understanding and development of advance materials as well as provide
graduate education opportunities for minorities in important fields of science.
A third objective is to maintain a competitiveness in the age of materials for
the 1990's. This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers
of Excellence (MRCE) program: to increase the minority presence in science and
engineering by making substantial resources available to upgrade the research
capabilities of strong and productive minority institutions. Howard University
as an institution and the MSRCE program, in particular, have proven their
effectiveness in addressing some of the problems which beset the national
research community in materials science and engineering and in educating
minority students in a high quality research environment.
