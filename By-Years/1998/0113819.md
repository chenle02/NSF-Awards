This project relieves the shortage of qualified information assurance personnel
by providing generous financial support for at least 23 masters level students
in the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Information Assurance Educational
program. Several interdisciplinary degrees are offered in the program that allow
students to specialize in their particular interest area within the field. There
are a growing number of Information Assurance and Computer Security faculty and
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, and the students have outstanding
opportunities to work in world-class on-campus entities such as the Software
Engineering Institute and the CERT Coordination Center. Through classroom
instruction, project work, and supplemental curricular activities such as an
Information Technology lecture series, the student participants become leaders
in the information security area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The university is also
focused on the development and success of other programs in this area. To that
end, Carnegie Mellon University plans to host an annual intensive seminar for
current and/or prospective CAE/IAE institution faculty. The seminars will
consist of a three-day instructional dialog offering approximately 30 faculty
members access to existing CAE/IAE program curricula and
methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;
