This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). In this project funded by the Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI) Program, the PI?s will develop a new, international (8-nation), broadband
seismic capability for Greenland - the GreenLand Ice Sheet monitoring Network
(GLISN) - a real-time sensor array of 25 stations which enhances and upgrades
the performance of the scarce existing Greenland seismic infrastructure for
detecting, locating, and characterizing glacial earthquakes and other cryo-
seismic phenomena, and contributing to our understanding of Ice Sheet dynamics.
Complementing data from satellites, geodesy, and other sources, in concert with
these technologies GLISN provides a powerful tool for seeing change, and will
advance new frontiers of research in the glacial systems, the underlying
geological and geophysical processes affecting the Greenland Ice Sheet,
interactions between oceans, climate, and the cryosphere, and other
multidisciplinary areas of interest to geoscience and climate dynamics. The
development of the telemetry infrastructure linking the sites together into a
coherent framework creates the temporal resolving capability and potential for
rapid scientific response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLISN is an international
collaboration on a problem of global importance. Participating countries include
the USA, Denmark, Canada, Germany, Norway, Switzerland, Italy, and Japan. GLISN
creates a new large, freely and openly available, real-time data set to enhance
existing monitoring efforts and catalyze new interdisciplinary scientific
research and education while establishing a fiducial reference framework for
facilitating regionalized studies of Greenland glacial systems. GLISN data will
advance understanding of the solid Earth and cryo-seismic source mechanisms from
a region of important societal relevance.
