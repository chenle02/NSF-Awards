The literature on marine benthic ecology and evolution has generally ignored
fertilization rates as an important factor in the life histories of benthic
species, many which are important resource species. These rates have implicitly
been assumed to be uniformly high and thus not a terribly significant factor in
the establishment of the adult populations. There are now a number of data sets
which raise doubts about the validity of that assumption. The research will
determine rates of fertilization among natural populations and will explore some
of the factors controlling these rates in reef communities. Using the Caribbean
gorgonian, Plexaura A, as a model system Drs. Lasker and Coffroth will determine
rates of fertilization of eggs released in synchronous spawning events. Plexaura
A is clonal and often has skewed ratios of male and female colonies on different
reefs. This will enable comparison of rates from reefs which differ in current
regime and in the density of male colonies. Using random amplified polymorphic
DNA (RAPD) from individual planulae larvae, they will conduct paternity
analyses, determine the proportion of fertilizations attributable to specific
male clones, and determine the effects of clone size and distribution on
fertilization. If rates are low and are affected by factors such as population
density, then it will be necessary to incorporate fertilization rates in
analyses of benthic population animal dynamics and evolution.
