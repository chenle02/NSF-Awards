Professor Jeffrey, a philosopher of science concerned with the foundations of
probability and decision theory, in collaboration with Dr. Michael Hendrickson,
a surgical pathologist, is undertaking a pilot study of decision making in
pathology. The goal under this grant is to detail a theoretical basis in
probability theory for the proposed applications of probability theory to
surgical pathology. Ultimately, they hope (1) to model the formation and change
of histopathological disease concepts with their syndromic basis, coupled
managerial/scientific (pragmatic/theoretical) aspects, and ways in which these
change in response to new knowledge; (2) to characterize diagnoses that are
appropriately handled probabilistically which entails analyzing the various
sources of uncertainty in histopathological diagnosis, forming a concept of the
value of histopathological information and creating a framework for deciding to
what extent various uncertainties are worth resolving; (3) to explore strategies
for probabilistic reporting of diagnoses (as by appropriate ratios of
probabilities or logs of such ratios, etc.) so as to achieve appropriate
resolution when probabilities of diagnoses are close to each other or to the
extremes of the scale; and (4) to explore strategies for combining expert
opinions for use in decision making, e.g. hard ( i.e. credibly transferrable)
probabilistic data from clinician, radiologist and pathologist in the form of
ratios of new to old odds between diagnoses. They will draw on three major
resources to develop, refine and validate this model: the extant taxonomic
literature in surgical pathology, a large consultation practice in academic
pathology, and the results of several ongoing clinicopathological projects of
Dr. Hendrickson that include construction of a clinical managerial
classification of several groups of gynecological neoplasms. This study
potentially will fill a troublesome gap in the histopathology literature while
illuminating questions of general importance concerning concept formation,
decision and risk management.
