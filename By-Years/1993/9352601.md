9352601 Biggerstaff The PIs have proposed equipment for an undergraduate
laboratory to study the structure and evolution of atmospheric storm systems
using interactive color graphics software at Texas A&M. Many of the laboratory
exercises have already been developed and tested using existing research
equipment. The laboratory will be used by majors and non-majors in introductory
and senior-level courses to illustrate the fundamentals of fluid dynamics as
well as the complex structure of atmospheric storm systems. Output from
numerical structures as well as data collected during special field experiments
will be used to develop the classroom laboratory exercises. These data sets will
be made available to other interested institutions. ***
