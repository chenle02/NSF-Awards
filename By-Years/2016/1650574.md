The emergence of shale formations as a source of oil and natural gas has
prompted unprecedented commercial interest in utilizing the lighter compressible
hydrocarbon gases (so-called natural gas liquids) as feedstocks for the
production of chemicals. For remote shale formations, however, where the gaseous
light-ends (predominantly methane) cannot be readily transported, this has led
to gas flaring with associated loss of a high-hydrogen resource, and more
significantly, a greater atmospheric burden of carbon dioxide with its
greenhouse gas impact. Thus, technologies suitable for converting "stranded"
methane directly to larger, liquid or compressible hydrocarbons are highly
desired. Commercial chemical processes have traditionally been deployed using a
scale-up process that takes advantage of "economies of unit scale". This
requires large, high risk, capital investments. An alternative paradigm involves
the deployment of modular chemical plants that can evolve from small to large
scale through parallel module use that takes advantage of "economies of mass
production". The proposed research focuses on the development of a systematic
methodology for the automatic synthesis of globally optimal, modular,
intensified, process flowsheets, that employ a variety of process units,
including reactors, separators, pumps, compressors, turbines, valves, heat
exchangers, and many others.

The proposed methodology will be based on the use of infinite dimensional
programs with feasible regions defined by linear constraints, and objective
functions which capture "economies of mass production". Their solution will be
pursued through solution of finite dimensional programs of ever-increasing size,
which always remain feasible and possess significant invention capabilities. The
presented case study involves reactions producing acetic acid and formic acid
from natural gas. For this reason, alternative methods suggesting the creation
of subsystems including the steam methane reforming are presented along with
novel ways of separating azeotropes. Successful conclusion of this high-risk
research project will have a broad positive impact on process optimization
methods, process intensification, modular manufacturing, chemical process
manufacturing, power generation, and renewable energy resource development, and
will result in the creation of transformative and revolutionary modular,
intensified, process flowsheets, and in advances in the optimization of linearly
constrained programs.
