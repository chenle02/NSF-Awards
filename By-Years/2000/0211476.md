This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
fundamental issues limiting the applications of Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride/Cadmium
Telluride radiation detectors. Currently, x-ray and gamma ray equipment industry
producing medical imaging, manufacturing, and security inspection instrument is
a multi-billion dollar business. Room temperature Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride/Cadmium
Telluride detectors and arrays appear to be the obvious choice as the sensing
elements. However, after forty years of research, many problems remain. It was
not clear why the yield in producing Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride/Cadmium Telluride
detectors is still so low. Based on semiconductor physics, two parameters are
most crucial in determining the detector performance: the need of the deep level
of donor or acceptors to pin the Fermi level near the middle of the bandgap and
the necessity to avoid defects which trap the carriers. Potential commercial
applications of the research can be used by researchers at accelerator
laboratories for particle analysis, by scientists for crystallography, by
security personnel for inspection, by engineers for the control of packaging
such as bottling, and for numerous medical applications.
