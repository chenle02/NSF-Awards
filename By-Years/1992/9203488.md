This project concerns the design and study of computational methods for the
solution of nonlinear systems of equations involving multi- dimensional
parameter vectors. Such systems arise frequently in equilibrium problems in
science and engineering where, generally, interest centers on the computational
assessment of the change of the solutions under variation of the parameters. The
work utilizes that under conditions, which typically hold in practice, the set
of all solutions forms a differentiable manifold in the combined state and
parameter space. It has been shown previously that a consistent use of
differential geometric concepts and techniques provides a new and powerful tool
for the development of the desired computational methods for analyzing the shape
and properties of the solution manifold. This project will investigate the
further development of a manifold- approximation algorithms, of the resulting
computational errors and of sensitivity measures for the computed solutions, of
the reduced basis method and its errors in the multi-parameter case, and of
methods for solving ordinary and certain partial differential equations on
implicitly defined manifolds.
