9550545 Jones A series of computer driven projects that engage students in
creating atoms, molecules, and crystals and then predicting and testing their
properties along with environmental consequences is the format of this high
school chemistry course. Based on the Russian materials "To Create the
Universe," the course is CD-ROM-based, with an accompanying "mini-textbook," a
manual on small-scale laboratories, a teacher's guide, and a teacher-training
workshop kit. The topics include the design of atoms and molecules of the first
36 elements and a study of their properties. The materials embody design
challenges to be completed with powerful software and computer applications.
This software, including both commercial and newly developed programs, offers
flexible and motivating situations so students can design new structures and
experiments related to abstract concepts in chemistry. Students learn these
concepts by interactively controlling computer visualizations and animations of
dynamic atomic and molecular behavior. National leaders in curriculum
development for chemistry in the US and in Russia are involved in design and
preparation of materials and guidance is provided by a prestigious international
advisory board
