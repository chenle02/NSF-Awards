This project outlines a research plan for the development of a sensor to measure
supersaturation activity in solution. The sensor consists of a tube chamber
which is immersed in the solution and which is filled with a buffer solution
containing a probe molecule pyranine. One side of the chamber consists of a ion
exchange membrane which allows for the selective transport of protons from the
exterior solution into the chamber, but does not allow the transport of the
probe molecule out into the solution. The proton concentration determines the
equilibrium between the protonated and unprotonated forms of pyranine. The
chamber is irradiated by UV light through a fiber optic inserted into the
chamber. The radiation excites both protonated and unprotonated forms of the
molecule, causing emission of the protonated form at 440 nm and of the
unprotonated form at 511 nm. The ration of the intensities at these two
wavelengths is a function of the ratio of the ratio of the two molecular forms,
and this in turn characterizes the proton concentration in the chamber (and
presumably in the solution). The intensities are measured using a second fiber
optic immersed in the chamber and connected to a photodiode detector. This
sensor will be used to measure supersaturation. Recent evidence for source
indicates that the concentration level affects the proton availability. In
particular, previous research reviewed in the proposal demonstrates that the
emission intensities of the protonated form of the molecular increases with
sucrose concentration, while that of the unprotonated form decreases with
increasing sucrose concentration.
