Equipment is being acquired for research activities of which the major thrust
deals with fundamental investigations for the design of reliable and efficient
superconductive systems, particularly refrigerators. As in any emerging
technology, there is a paucity of information available to permit the scale-up
or scale-down of these thermal systems. The associated research fields can be
significantly advanced through the use of modern instrumentation for data
acquisition and processing.
