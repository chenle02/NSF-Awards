0936384 Gruner This award from the Division of Materials Research to Cornell
University supports a renewal of the operation of the Cornell High Energy
Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The award also includes funds to operate the Cornell
High Energy Storage Source (CESR) as an accelerator fully dedicated for
supporting photon science. CHESS will operate as a national user facility
providing open access to users on the basis of a competitive proposal process.
With the availability of CESR as a dedicated X-ray light source CHESS will
provide better quality of X-ray light for users and increased beamtime allocated
to user service. CHESS will serve a variety of users in science and engineering
disciplines from academe, industry and government for studies encompassing the
atomic structure, properties, and time-resolved behavior of electronic,
structural, polymeric and biological materials. In addition, CHESS will continue
studies of protein and virus crystallography, environmental science,
radiography, art and archaeology, and micro-elemental analysis. In addition, the
staff at the CHESS facility will pursue advances in synchrotron radiation
instrumentation and techniques development in: (1) high-pressure science, (2)
X-ray fluorescence imaging, (3) low X-ray energy (2-7 KeV) studies, (4) time-
resolved science and detector development, (5) soft matter and nanostructures,
(6) X-ray optics developments, (7) biological macromolecules and biological
chemistry. In the education and training plan, CHESS will provide unique
education and training programs for undergraduate and graduate students.
Training of undergraduate students provides apprenticeship programs via summer
internships and REU. CHESS performs K-12 outreach to students and public school
teachers by collaborating with other campus centers and local schools to offer
classroom science activities, by creating and sponsoring neighborhood after-
school science programs, and by hosting tours and demonstrations for the public.
CHESS has specific initiatives aimed at increasing participation of under-
represented groups in science with goals to improve science literacy in the
local and national workforce.
