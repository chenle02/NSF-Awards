*** 9550532 Khalsa IntelliTools, Inc. is designing and developing Multi-Math
Adaptations that work with multiple mathematics curricula, serve people with a
multiplicity of disabilities, employ a multisensory approach, and use the power
of multimedia computing combined with hands-on manipulatives and classroom
activities. Multi-Math Adaptations targets some 70,000 students nationwide in
grades K-6 with orthopedic and visual impairments and encompasses three
different types of instructional materials: multimedia computer activities built
on IntelliTools product platforms; accessible mathematics manipulatives that
closely parallel standard mathematics manipulatives but can be handled by people
with visual and orthopedic impairments; and upgrades to IntelliTools platform
products. Some activities are generic and correspond to common mathematics
teaching strategies and others are direct adaptations of those published by any
of the three comprehensive elementary mathematics instructional materials
development projects currently funded by NSF. ***
