The Entomology Collection of the California Academy of Sciences contains
approximately 12.4 million specimens representing 300,000 species, and it ranks
among the largest and most actively used insect collections in the world. It is
the principal collection of its type in the western U.S. Dr. David Kavanaugh,
Curator in charge of the collection, has devised an ambitious plan to improve
the curation and availability of the collection. New storage trays and
identification labels will enhance the utility of the collection to visiting
researchers and to the collection management staff. Many important collections
that are currently inaccessible will be processed and made readily available to
visiting investigators and through the Academy's specimen loan program. The
proposed collection improvement project will increase the collection's research
impact significantly, and will help to assure the long-term safety of
irreplaceable research specimens. Collections of natural history specimens such
as this one are unique resources for the study of biological diversity. Future
generations of research will rely on the continued growth and improvement of
museum collections.
