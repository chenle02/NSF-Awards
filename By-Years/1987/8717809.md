This investigation will use nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) to characterize
the new copper oxide superconductors. A major goal is to develop a method for
monitoring in situ the environment of copper atoms during high-temperature
processing and to relate this data to physical properties of the superconductor.
The oxygen near neighbors largely determine the electric field gradient (EFG) at
the copper - and other cation - nuclei, so the EFG spectrum can be used as a
measure of the perfection of the oxygen shell around that atom and, therefore,
as a guide to appropriate processing technique. NQR spectral accumulation times
may be as short as a few seconds to a few minutes(even at high temperatures).
Consequently, NQR could be used as a real- time in situ guide for optimizing
processing variables. The copper EFG distribution expects to correlate with the
transition temperature and width of the superconducting transition.
