The relative importance of human and biophysical factors in vegetation change is
often not apparent in the case of slow vegetation degradation processes. One
form of vegetation degradation common to rangelands is bush encroachment, which
can result from chronic grazing and fire suppression. The investigators in this
project have chosen to study an encroached landscape on the Botswana-South
Africa border. The PIs will map historic bush encroachment and fires using
historical aerial photographs and satellite images, and statistically relate
these observations to several human and biophysical factors that vary spatially
across the study area. They will then develop a computer model that can simulate
the complex interactions between the important human and biophysical factors
over time, in a manner the reproduces observed patterns in bush encroachment.
This adaptive management model could prove helpful for guiding land management
decisions not only in this study area but also similarly degraded rangelands
elsewhere.
