This three-year program is a continuation of the Millstone Hill Observatory in
Westford, Massachusetts. This incoherent scatter radar facility supports both
optical and radar operations, encompassing a broad range of topics involving
processes and dynamics of the thermosphere, ionosphere and magnetosphere, as
well as investigations of plasma waves and magnetic storm effects. Data will be
deposited in the CEDAR data base at NCAR for community use.
