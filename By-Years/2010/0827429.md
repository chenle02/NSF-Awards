This grant will fund the travel expenses of ten new scholars from the United
States to attend one of two pre-conference workshops at the biennial meeting of
the International Society for the Study of Behavioural Development (ISSBD), held
in Wurzburg, Germany, July 12-17, 2008. The workshops are intended for both
learning and forming international research collaborations. Funds for the
workshops will also provide the scholars with the opportunity to attend the
ISSBD meeting itself, a major international conference. The scholars, chosen by
a committee through an intense competition process, include graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and new faculty. The workshops are held for early career
researchers from around the world and cover two important and growing fields of
study: Child/youth victimization and developmental socio-cognitive neuroscience.

Attendance at the workshops and conference will have a substantial impact on the
training of these early career researchers, as they will have the opportunity to
learn theories, recent findings, and methodology from top scholars around the
world. Perhaps more importantly, international collaborations in the field of
child development research will be facilitated by giving these scholars the
opportunity to meet and have intellectual exchanges with others working in
overlapping areas of developmental science.
