*** 9617613 Rollins The lateral load capacity of foundation piles and pile
groups is a key consideration in earthquake hazard mitigation. Because of the
cost and logistical difficulties of full-scale testing, only three pile group
tests are currently available to guide engineers regarding pile group behavior,
especially under dynamic loading. Due to the dearth of experimental data,
computer programs for analyzing pile groups have not been thoroughly validated,
and empirical methods are extremely restricted in their application. This is
particularly true when it comes to dynamic loading such as earthquakes. As a
result, designers are forced to be conservative and this leads to increased
costs for retrofits as well as new construction. Brigham Young University is
performing a series of lateral load tests on a full-scale pile group in soft
clay at the Salt Lake International Airport. This testing involves both static
and dynamic testing at large strain levels. The objective of this action is to
support additional low-strain vibration testing of the pile group, thereby
providing data for calibrating and validating computer models. Since the pile
group is already in place, and soil exploration is completed, the incremental
cost of performing these additional tests is small in comparison to the
information to be gained. Due to time constraints on the original test schedule,
it is necessary to expedite the schedule for the low strain testing: once the
large-strain testing is completed, it is impossible to obtain meaningful small
strain results. The low-strain vibration testing is conducted with an eccentric
mass shaker which is mounted on top of a pile cap. The testing makes it possible
to obtain the natural frequency of the pile-soil system, as well as the
stiffness and damping at low strain levels. These parameters, in combination
with the large-strain parameters, provide an excellent case history which
researchers can use to validate their computer codes for both static and dyna
mic conditions.***
