Funding is provided to further test the early anthropogenic hypothesis (EAH)
that agriculture produced greenhouse-gas emissions large enough to reverse
natural downward trends in carbon dioxide and methane concentrations several
thousand years ago by driving atmospheric levels of both gases upward and
keeping the climate anomalously warm.

Specifically, the researchers plan to: (1) re-examine a model parameterization
that artificially limit snow thickness, in order to determine how this
constraint affects the extent of permanent snow cover; (2) run model simulations
with modern insolation but varying carbon dioxide and methane levels to
determine the threshold for present-day glacial inception; (3) assemble data on
modern and little ice age mountain glaciers and ice caps for comparison to the
model simulations; (4) assemble archeological data on the spread of rice
irrigation and livestock tending across southern Asia; and (5) conduct
experiments with the NCAR CCSM4 model that include: (a) a 'no anthro' experiment
using interactive vegetation with carbon dioxide physiology and a dynamical
ocean to assess the full climatic impact of early agricultural greenhouse gases;
(b) an experiment simulating late pre-industrial times in order to parcel out
the climatic effects of early-agricultural versus industrial-era anthropogenic
gases; and (c) an experiment using only direct carbon dioxide and methane inputs
from humans to determine whether carbon dioxide feedbacks from the ocean can
account for the full carbon budget needed to support a 35-40 parts per million
atmospheric carbon dioxide anomaly.

This research is potentially transformative because it provides a new
perspective on climate forcing and challenges the broader science community's
understanding of the extent of human impacts on climate.
