This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage data due to the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. The lifeline systems gaslines, sewer lines electric transmission and
power systems etc. in the San Francisco area sustained considerable damage and
service disruption during the October 17, 1989 earthquake. As a result it
provides excellent opportunity to assess the safety and service operation of
such vital systems, which service the city and community. this project is to
collect and evaluate data resulting from this particular earthquake or endurance
and damage of water and sewage facilities. The tasks to be conducted include:
(1) damage inventory for general damage level, (2) inventory of all system
facilities and identify earthquake design criteria for those facilities, (3)
identify local geotechnical data, (4) inventory systems endurance and damage,
and (5) develop loss algorithms for facility components and identify successful
design solutions. The project will establish a comprehensive data base and
provide in-depth insight into complex issues on the seismic safety, loss,
service restoration and repair of the water and sewage lifeline systems.
