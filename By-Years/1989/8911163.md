In this project, the P.I.'s will use sea level data from tide gauges and
satellite altimeters to study low frequency, large scale variability of the
ocean. Specific topics include variability of the western Pacific warm pool,
intraseasonal fluctuations, slow temporal variations in tidal harmonic
constants, and reconciliation of tide gauge measurements and altimeter
measurements. Specific applications will include the planned TOGA/COARE
experiment in the western Pacific.
