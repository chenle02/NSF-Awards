Messenger RNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression and
requires the action of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs).
These particles consist of a small nuclear RNA molecule (snRNA) which is
complexed with up to ten proteins. Although the U1-U6 snRNPs are known to be
essential for splicing, the specific functions of these snRNAs and their
associated proteins are poorly understood. Our long term objective is to define
the roles of the RNA and protein components of the snRNPs, and to discover how
these molecules contribute to the consummate specificity of the splicing
reaction. The goal of this proposal is to identify the precise function of a
highly conserved snRNP protein called 70K, a component of the U1 snRNP. The gene
encoding the yeast 70K homolog will be cloned using a polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). The clones gene will be used to generate a set of conditional mutations
in 70K. These mutants will be tested for their effects on U1-specific processes
including 5' splice site identification, 5' cleavage site determination, branch
site recognition, interaction with the pre-messenger RNA as well as with other
proteins involved in splicing.
