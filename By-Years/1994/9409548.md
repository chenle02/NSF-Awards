The research will develop and test an attitude-behavior model based on reasoned
action to explain individual risk judgments regarding global climate change. The
model incorporates key aspects of the dominant theoretical and empirical
approaches to risk judgments. The elements of the model are: levels of
knowledge, cultural values, perceived vulnerability, attitude toward hazard,
perceived social norms, and perception of control. Survey data will be used to
test the model using various regression techniques as well as non-parametric
statistics. The results are expected to improve our understanding of public
opinion on global climate change, illuminate the process of risk decisions as
they occur in polling situations better, and help develop a more effective tool
to pursue scientific inference regarding risk judgments.
