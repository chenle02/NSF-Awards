Robotics promises to transform how people work, learn, communicate, and engage
in other activities of daily living. To do so, robots must interact with users
following conventions and norms that people expect, so that people readily adopt
them into their environments. These conventions and norms, however, are highly
complex and nuanced, requiring that designers consider an impractical number of
scenarios, constraints, and requirements in the design process. This project
will build new computational methods to facilitate this process, enabling
designers of future robot systems to more easily explore the design space for
human-robot interactions and to verify that their solutions satisfy design
goals. These methods will help achieve the promise of robotics by improving
their safety, effectiveness, and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of
robotic technologies for human interaction poses a complex, multifaceted design
problem that requires that resulting designs satisfy several constraints.
Systematically exploring the solution space for actions and behaviors that meet
user expectations, follow norms of human interaction, and ensure safety of
nearby humans requires an appropriate computational framework for the evaluation
and proactive exploration of the space of possible human-robot interactions.
This project will devise a novel framework for computationally representing
human-robot interactions and exploring the solution space for robot behaviors
and actions that satisfy defined correctness properties. Specifically, the
project will develop a set of prototypical interaction scenarios and correctness
properties; specify formal representations for interaction states and
properties, using a variety of temporal logics; apply and extend existing
verification methods to verify correctness; devise methods to translate
verification output to design feedback; and validate and demonstrate the
applicability of the developed framework.&lt;br/&gt;
