This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project plans to demonstrate
how to limit the costs of the bipolar plate by the choice of materials that can
be molded or extruded. The usual choice of material is a mixture of graphite and
polymeric binders. Since the bipolar plate must exhibit sufficient electrical
and thermal conductivity, the content of polymeric binder must be minimized, but
maintained at a level to assure moldability. As a consequence, the toughness of
the bipolar plate is not very high and may retain some porosity. In this effort
we will synthesize a new ceramic material that is more conductive and stronger
than graphite. This material can be fabricated into the desired shapes using
powder processing methods and sintered to full density. If the proposed research
is successful, we will have identified a new ceramic material that has
conductive properties superior to graphite, can be fabricated into shapes using
powder processing techniques, and pressureless sintered to give a material that
will have potential applications as a bipolar plat for use in PEM fuel cells.
This material could also replace molded graphite electrodes in other
applications that require a higher strength material.
