This proposal considers innovative numerical methods using hybridization and
multigrid techniques. While hybridization was thought of as an implementation
technique in its inception, the investigator argues that it is much more. It is
shown to be a computational technique that has the potential of achieving goals
difficult to achieve by conventional techniques in applications ranging from
computational fluid mechanics to electromagnetics. E.g., a new technique using
hybridization to solve a long standing research problem, namely computing
exactly incompressible approximations to fluid flow, is proposed. Other proposed
uses of hybridization include construction and analysis of variable degree mixed
methods and design of local post-processing techniques to enhance accuracy. A
different category of proposed activities involve accelerated solution
techniques by multigrid methods. Powerful multigrid techniques are proposed for
various systems arising from computational electromagnetics and hybridization.
The aim is to make solution techniques efficient. This goal, while often
achieved by multigrid methods, can also be achieved by utilizing symmetries such
as axisymmetry occurring in practical problems. E.g., investigation of methods
for the axisymmetric Maxwell equations form a part of the proposed activities.

While the proposed research has significant theoretical impact, equally
important is the fact that parts of the research are motivated by the needs of
industrial applications such as clinical ablation. Use of the proposed new
methods in these applications is an integral part of the proposal. Broader
impacts of the proposed activities result not only from the applications to the
industrial problems, but also from educational activities and broad
dissemination of results.
