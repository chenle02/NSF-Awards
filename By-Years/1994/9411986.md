Levitan 9411986 Post-zygotic mortality is considered to be the primary
selective agent in the evolution of propagule size in many taxa, including
marine invertebrates. Unfortunately, theoretical predictions of marine
invertebrate egg size based on post-zygotic mortality have been difficult to
test and are often at odds with the empirical data. This study will conduct a
series of laboratory experiments that will measure egg size, sperm swimming
ability, and fertilization rates, and a series of field experiments that will
determine how these gamete attributes influence rates of fertilization under
different environmental conditions. In one experiment , DNA fingerprints of
single larva will provide answers to how specific gamete attributes influence
rates of fertilization and mediate the outcome of sperm competition.
Incorporating fertilization into a comprehensive life- history theory will
resolve many of the apparent paradoxes between the empirical evidence and
previous theories. ***
