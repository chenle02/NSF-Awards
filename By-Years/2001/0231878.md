&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year longitudinal project studies how diverse girls'
attitudes, perceptions, and experiences in grades 7-12 influence both subtle and
explicit choices leading towards or away from a college major in science.
Participants come from 4 urban and suburban districts whose students represent a
range of economic background and ethnicities. The design would follow two
cohorts of students, one from 7th to 10th grade and one from 10th grade into the
first year of college. The middle school cohort allows a broad look at student
experiences before they formally enter the pipeline, while the high school
cohort focuses on those students who are most likely to pursue science and
engineering careers. The study includes an annual large-scale survey of the full
cohort and an annual in-depth interview with a continuing subset of students.
Contextual interviews with selected parents, science teachers, guidance
counselors, and others are also included. Both quantitative and qualitative
analysis techniques are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to explore
the linkage between school and extracurricular experiences of female students to
their decision to pursue a science college major. These variables have been
found to be related to the gender gap in achievement and attitudes about
science, but a formal linkage between them and girls' decision to pursue a
science major has not been established. This research has the potential to
identify factors that might facilitate the recruitment of females in science
majors.
