Professor Gellene is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to use absorption and emission spectroscopy to study the
neutral radicals which are in the neighborhood of the transition state on the
potential energy surface of a polyatomic molecule. The neutral radicals are
produced by reneutralization of an ion beam and either remain in the transition
state long enough to be observed in absorption spectroscopy or are in excited
Rydberg states which vertically radiate to transition state regions by emission.
Probing the transition state directly is important because the characteristics
of the transition state region largely determine reactive events. This approach
is potentially applicable to systems for which the geometry of the positive ion
closely resembles that of the transition state region. Specifically the
technique will be applied to a study of 3- and 4-atom radicals containing H(or
D), N, O and F. %%% By preparing a species that has a structure that is in
between the reactants and the products and doing spectroscopy on it in the
relatively short time that it exists in this geometry, Professor Gellene hopes
to characterize that state, called the transition state, which largely
determines how a chemical reaction proceeds.
