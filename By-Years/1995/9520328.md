CTS-9520328 Ralph T. Yang University of Michigan ABSTRACT The research project
seeks to develop two new sorbents for olefin-paraffin separation and to obtain a
basic understanding of the pie-complexation mechanism for adsorption. Novel
sorbents have been synthesized by dispersion of Ag(I) and Cu(I) cations on
substrates that do not adsorb paraffins strongly. Preliminary experiments show
enhanced olefin selectivity, capacity and rate of separation. Other adsorbents
will be prepared using monolayer dispersion of Ag(I) and Cu(I) salts on various
substrates. The later sorbents will be examined for acetylene separation. The
study will include the effects of different anions, cations and substrates on
the adsorption and separation behavior. Theoretical studies based on molecular
orbital calculations will focus on the hydrocarbon-sorbent interactions. The
effectiveness of the new sorbents for olefin-paraffin separations will be
assessed by model simulation for pressure (or vacuum) swing adsorption. The
results will have an impact on the development of energy efficient separation
techniques for the chemical and petrochemical industries.
