This Dagstuhl workshop is to bring together scientists from the research areas
of Design Verification, Formal Methods, High-level Design, Manufacturing
Testing, Robust System Design, and related disciplines in the context of
integrated circuit manufacturing. The objective is to discuss major upcoming
obstacles in the design, verification, and testing of robust systems and their
potential solutions. Existing pre-silicon verification is insufficiently
scalable, and today's manufacturing test methodologies may not be adequate in
screening marginal and reliability failures. Bugs and defects that impact system
correctness and/or security must be detected, localized, and corrected in the
system environment, during post-silicon validation, or during system operation
in the field. New methodologies, that are radical departures from today's
practice and require multi-disciplinary effort spanning traditionally distinct
research areas are to be discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this
workshop is expected to influence US semiconductor industry by making
connections between the academic and industrial researchers. The industry
experts present at the workshop will also be instrumental in the benchmarking
efforts critical to the research in the field. The workshop will also use the
technical topic as a means to assess the value of joint collaborations between
the relevant US and German scientific communities and explore various
collaboration mechanisms that can be supported by the respective funding
agencies. To this end, the workshop is co-sponsored by the German Science
Foundation (DFG) as well.
