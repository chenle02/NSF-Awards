Experimental and Numerical Modeling of Czochralski Silicon Crystal Growth This
award will enable Vicki Booker, a Ph.D. graduate student at the University of
Pennsylvania, to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Koichi Kakimoto for six
months at the Fundamental Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation, in Tsukuba,
Japan. By experimentally growing silicon crystals under different conditions,
the team will test the accuracy of numerical models developed by Ms. Booker for
silicon crystal growth. As the basis of most electronic devices, silicon based
semiconductors are essential to the consumer electronics, telecommunications,
and computer industries. A high quality silicon substrate is crucial for further
advancement and refinement of small scale electronic devices. In order to
produce the necessary high quality single silicon crystals, the primary
technique for growing these crystals, the Czochralski (CZ) method, must be
better understood. Ms. Booker has developed numerical models to describe the
bulk fluid motion in the CZ system and the effect of this motion on the growing
crystal, however, the accuracy of this model is verifiable only through the use
of experimental data. By working with Dr. Kakimoto, Ms. Booker will utilize Dr.
Kakimoto's technique for directly observing bulk fluid motion in melting silicon
and provide numerical simulation to aid in the analysis of the e xperimental
results. An experimentally verified model for the Czochralski crystal growth
system will benefit not only the semiconductor industry, but also a wide range
of materials development efforts which are based on single crystal growth.
