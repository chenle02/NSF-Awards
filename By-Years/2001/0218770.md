This proposal focuses on improvements in spectral boundary element method for
simulation of multiphase flows. These include drops and cells suspended in
Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids that may be subjected to steady and
oscillatory flows. A convincing case was made that the computational time will
be significantly reduced using the proposed algorithm. The proposed educational
activities are well integrated into the planned research.
