College of Computer Science at Northeastern University in Boston proposes to
host six one-day regional workshops for faculty members from New England on
Active-learning Curricula for Introductory Computer Science. These curricula are
based on extensive use of simple graphics, visual feedback, model programs, and
experimentation. Each workshop will focus on one topic typically covered in the
first-year courses. Hands-on activities, discussions, and preparation of course
materials will be integral parts of each workshop.***//
