This award will support a six-month research visit by Professor Mostafa A. Foda
of the Department of Civil Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, to
the laboratories of Professor Tetsuo Sakai, Department of Civil Engineering,
Kyoto University, and Professor Yoshi-Hiko Maeno, Department of Civil
Engineering, Maizaru College of Technology, Japan. The research will focus on
coastal engineering and porous media dynamics, in particular the generation
mechanisms of multiphase wave in fluid-filled porous media. Experiments will be
conducted on two of the most promising mechanisms of generation, one being
relevant to earthquake shaking of soil masses; and the other to the phenomena of
seabed lique- faction by ocean waves. The results are expected to increase our
understanding of the interaction of seabed, ocean waves and earthquakes.
