This proposal is for an extension of the research currently being carried out
by the American Mathematics Society on the recognition and rewards systems that
currently exist in academic departments in the mathematical sciences. These
studies are seen as key to revitalizing science and mathematics education at the
school and undergraduate levels. This proposal calls for ethnographic and other
innovative methodologies that will offer data on barriers to changing the
rewards structures. The project will be carried out as a series of case studies
and a survey of some 3,000 mathematical sciences departments. The results will
be reported to NSF and to the scientific community through the usual channels of
the member societies of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics. The project,
building upon the work supported by the current SGER grant, is expected to
provide a critical basis for subsequent investigations that will lead to
recommendations and a plan of action to produce recognition and rewards systems
that are consistent with missions and responsibilities of institutions of higher
education.
