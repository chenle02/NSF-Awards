Dynamic maneuvers such as rapid starts, stops, and changes of directions are
important behaviors for many mammals in high-speed pursuit or flight situations.
In this project we will study these maneuvers by means of a combination of
theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiment using robotic
galloping machines. The focus of the work will be on non-repetitive maneuvers,
as opposed to the cyclic motions that occur when galloping or trotting. An
impulse-momentum model, combined with ballistic trajectories, will be used as
the basis for our theoretical analysis. Evolutionary robotics strategies,
including genetic algorithms, will be used in combination with high-speed
dynamic simulation to evolve the dynamic maneuvers. We will design and build a
relatively small experimental galloping machine to further investigate the
dynamics of such systems.
