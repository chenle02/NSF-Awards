9312023 Svestka The investigators will analyze X-ray imaging data of the sun
obtained by instruments on the Yohkoh satellite. The purpose of the study is to
investigate the properties of giant post-flare arches which represent an
important coronal phase of the most eruptive flares on the sun. The Yohkoh soft
X-ray whole-Sun and large field-of-view images, with excellent angular
resolution offer a real breakthrough in the information about these structures
which have energy comparable to those in coronal mass ejections. The study will
address several problems related to these giant arches: their internal
structure, their magnetic fields, the location of the footpoints of giant arches
in the underlying magnetic field, the time of onset of a coronal arch and its
mode of formation, the vertical and lateral time dependence of the process, the
physical conditions in the elementary components of the arch, the association
between giant arches and eruptive flares, the difference between stationary and
growing arches, and the conditions for coexistence of quasi-stationary giant
arches with eruptive coronal mass ejections in the same active region. The
theoretical investigations will be conducted in collaboration with Japanese
scientists. ***
