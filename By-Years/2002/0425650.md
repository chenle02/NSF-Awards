Perception seems effortless and yet it remains one of the most challenging
scientific topics. For instance, how do we separate beach chairs from the beach
in visual perception, or from the people in a crowded beach scene? Indeed it
remains a general puzzle how we may see objects in a scene separate from one
another and from their backgrounds. Recent computer models succeed in
segregating objects in pictures only when past experience is allowed to play a
role. With NSF support Dr. Mary Peterson will follow this lead to investigate
scene separation in human perception, specifically the effects of previous
experience with objects on later perception of the same
objects.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include supervision and training of students
from underrepresented groups and outreach activities to local high schools. The
funded research will also supply equipment to the University of Arizona for data
analysis and storage. Findings will also be disseminated through a laboratory
website.&lt;br/&gt;
