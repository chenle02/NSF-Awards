This award provides funds to The Infant Study Center and Visual Research Lab in
the Psychology Department at Brooklyn College to continue a successful REU-SITE
which offers students a research experience which focuses on many aspects of the
visual system. Together with a colleague from Medgar-Evers College of CUNY,
mentors will constitute a REU-Site aimed at students who might be persuaded by
their research experience to continue to the doctorate in Experimental and
Developmental Psychology, and related areas in the Neurosciences. Both
institutions have many women and minority students as well as special programs
to attract and guide such students; heavy emphasis will be placed on recruiting
among them. The training program includes laboratory seminars, an active role in
a specific research "team", and public presentations of results. The research
areas are all heavily computerized and instrumented: (i) Development of infants'
abilities to focus their eyes on objects around them (i.e., mechanisms of
accommodation and convergence); methods will include quantitative
photorefraction. (ii) Brain mechanisms associated with vision. Visual evoked
potentials will be recorded to examine the maturation of physiological systems,
especially those involving the lateral interactions that are so important for
object recognition. (iii) Color vision, particularly the use of scaling
techniques to specify color appearance under a variety of viewing conditions,
such as changes in retinal position; results will be related to known variations
in anatomy and physiology across the retina.
