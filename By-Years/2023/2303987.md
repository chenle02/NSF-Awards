The project will use ideas from classical real and complex analysis to solve
problems arising in computer science, physics, dynamics and probability. One
focus of the project is optimal meshing and triangulation, which has many
applications, from computer graphics to modeling fluid flows. In many problems
it is necessary to approximate a region of space as a finite union of triangles.
The shapes of the triangles greatly influences the accuracy and speed of various
numerical methods, and it is important to avoid angles that are too small or too
large. Finding good triangulations is often the most time consuming (and least
automated) step in numerical modeling. Funding for this project will lead to the
development of algorithms that compute the best possible angle bounds for a
given domain and find practical triangulations achieving these bounds. Other
parts of the funded work will develop methods to recognize and classify
2-dimension shapes via special embeddings into 3-dimensional space, and will
give improved estimates for certain random growth models that have been used to
model tumors and the propagation of fluids through porous materials. The project
provides research training opportunities for graduate students.

This work will extend the conformal and quasiconformal methods introduced by
the PI for triangulation of polygonal planar domains to more difficult
situations involving PSLGs (planar straight line graphs), non-planar surfaces,
and 3-dimensional regions. The PI's previous work involves dynamical flows
associated to triangulations and discrete analogs of closing lemmas for these
flows. These results will be extended and generalized. The work will also expand
on the PI's results on the smoothness and geometry of Weil-Petersson curves,
aiding computation with these curves, which are closely related to string
theory, pattern recognition, geometric measure theory and random curve families.
In this project, planar curves are associated to minimal surfaces in hyperbolic
3-space in such a way that geometric properties of the curve are reflected in
the properties of the surface. The PI will also investigate growth estimates for
diffusion limited aggregation, a random growth process from statistical physics
that is motivated by a number of natural processes, but about which few rigorous
results are known.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
