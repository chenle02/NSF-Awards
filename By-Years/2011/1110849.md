A substantial fraction of the world's biodiversity is made up of species that
are morphologically indistinguishable from other species (i.e. "cryptic
species"). Efforts to preserve and protect global diversity rely on an
understanding of how and why these cryptic species evolve and coexist. In this
project, the moss genus Scleropodium will be used to examine how cryptic species
coexist along a terrestrial/aquatic environmental gradient in California.
Specimens will be collected and two of their genes will be sequenced to
determine their identity. Ecological data collected for each specimen will be
analyzed to determine how the species in question are distributed relative to
each other and to the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mosses perform
important roles in carbon cycling in the northern latitudes, in water cycling in
the tropics, and as constituents of biotic soil crusts in deserts. Despite their
diversity and importance, mosses remain a poorly understood group of organisms.
In California where this study will take place, new taxa continue to be
discovered even as land development continues to reduce the amount of habitat
necessary for current and future diversity. The fine scale ecological data
captured in this study will prove useful in understanding the evolutionary
processes and requirements necessary for maintenance of current and future
species diversity.
