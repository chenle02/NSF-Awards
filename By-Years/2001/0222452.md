ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Douglas Lind and Selim Tuncel
&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: DMS-0222452&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
requests funding for a Concentration Year in &lt;br/&gt;Dynamical Systems at the
University of Washington. A major&lt;br/&gt;focus of activity will be a
collaborative effort to solve&lt;br/&gt;the Furstenberg Conjecture, a central
problem in dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the program will include a mix of
long-term&lt;br/&gt;participants, including regular faculty, visiting
faculty,&lt;br/&gt;post-docs, and graduate students at the University of
&lt;br/&gt;Washington, and short-term visitors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funds
will be used to support graduate student travel&lt;br/&gt;to conference and
workshops and six junior short terms&lt;br/&gt;visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
