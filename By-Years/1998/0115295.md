This project supports research for an alternative to student loans as a way to
finance higher education. The project utilizes the theory behind financial
instruments such as call or put options to develop the alternative, an education
call option. The education call option is intended to protect students from
investing in higher education and then not earning an income substantial enough
to afford basic living expenses, loan repayments, or future investment in
education. Hence, the option functions as insurance against the risk of
investing in higher education. Like any insurance policy, it is important to
have a premium and deductible that are economically beneficially to both the
policyholder and underwriter. A major objective of this project is to develop
analytically tractable methods for pricing the education call option that can be
used in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
