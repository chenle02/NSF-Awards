Engineering scientists have long been interested in calculating the dynamic
loads acting in a solid of finite or infinite extent, with heterogeneous
properties. This research program is a continuation of this effort with specific
application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. In considering
the propagation of seismic waves through the earth's crust, and of the resultant
ground shaking at a particular constructed facility such as a dam or nuclear
power plant, an attempt is made to take account of the earth's inhomogeneity;
this however usually leads to severe analytical or computational difficulties.
This research program will capitalize on a significant advance that the
principal investigator has made in this regard, and will extend it to account
for the layered stratification of the earth. The method is expected to be
computationally efficient and will be of use in a wide range of earthquake
engineering problems, such as the dynamic analysis of structural foundations and
underground facilities. The principal investigator is recognized for his
expertise in, and contribution to, this area of research. It is expected that
the research will provide a significantly improved capability to include the
effect of the earth's inhomogeneity on earthquake induced ground motion and the
associated response of constructed facilities.
