9634496 Needham The American Society for Microbiology will undertake a planning
effort to further develop the key themes and scientific elements of a
television-based project to inform the general public about current research and
theories in microbiology. The specific planning activities will include: o
Clarifying the vision of how the science will be made accessible and interesting
for the general public o Expanding the composition and role of the scientific
advisory panel o Reviewing and modifying the scientific content of the project o
Improving the coherence and clarity of the scientific themes in the television
series A principal means of achieving these goals will be to convene review
meeting in conjunction with a colloquium held by the American Academy of
Microbiology which many of the leading scientists in the field will attend.
