AST-0138235&lt;br/&gt;Ge, Jian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon immersion gratings
for astronomical applications in the infrared for wavelengths between 1 and
10-microns will be developed for telescope projects requiring spectral
resolutions between 1,000 and 100,000. Immersing the grating in Silicon, which
as an index of refraction of 3.4 in the infrared will enable much higher solid-
angle throughput or etendu than is now possible for an instrument of smaller
volume and mass. Spectrographs used on telescopes must be moved during the
observations; either swinging through the sky at a Cassegrain or equivalent
focus or rotating at a Nysmyth platform (to compensate for rotating field during
exposure). Large heavy instruments present serious engineering challenges for
cryogenic operation. Use of silicon immersion gratings will enable lighter-
weight higher-performance instruments for cutting edge scientific research. The
first astronomical observations will be on the Lick 3-meter
telescope.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
