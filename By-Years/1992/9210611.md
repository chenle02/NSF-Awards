This research planning grant will enable Dr Leslie Lyons to initiate a research
program on the correlation of structure and ionic conductivity in amorphous
polymers. Systematic composition studies will be undertaken on the ionic
conductivity of polymer salt complexes prepared from amorphous polymers.
Molecular weight determinations will be performed using high pressure liquid
chromatography and size exclusion techniques. The long term goal is to address
the issue of ion pairing in polymer salt complexes. %%% Research Planning Grants
are awarded to women who have not yet been awarded federal funding for their
research. Dr Lyons is a professor at Grinnell College and is initiating a
program in the electrical conduction properties of polymers. Results of her work
could lead to commercially important plastics which have unique electrical
properties.
