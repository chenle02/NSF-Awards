A theoretical study of magnetic reconnection involving magnetic field
approaching and exceeding the quantum critical field of 40 terraGauss is the
subject of this award. This is a fundamental plasma physics problem with
important applications in high-energy astrophysics. Specifically, this research
may be key to understanding magnetar flares and the workings of the central
engines of gamma-ray bursts. When such a strong field is dissipated, the
corresponding plasma energy density inside the reconnection layer is high enough
that one expects prodigious pair creation, radiation- and pair-pressure
domination and a strong radiative cooling. Furthermore, the large pair density
can make the layer optically thick and so the problem becomes in part a
radiative transport problem. All these factors mean that the physical regime of
interest in this research differs greatly from the traditional environments in
which magnetic reconnection has so far been investigated.

The behavior of matter and energy in such regions are inaccessible in the
laboratory. The research spans astrophysics, particle physics, high energy
density physics, and plasma physics. It may increase our understanding of gamma
ray bursts, the most powerful explosions in the universe.
