Undergraduates site supporting 10 undergraduate researchers. The program focuses
on the use of statistical methodology for research in several disciplines. Using
a combination of research sessions and small discussion groups, the
participating students will work on individual case studies. Students will be
provided a research experience in the guided and collaborative project selected
by them on the basis of summary descriptions of the projects and discussions
with the supervisor. The will receive a review of technical writing,
presentation styles, career opportunities in statistics, graduate admissions,
financial aid for graduate studies and so on. Students will be recruited
primarily from the Southeastern United States. Follow-up activities include
extensions of student research programs, presentations at professional meetings
and personal visits to the students' home institutions and discussions with
their faculty. ***
