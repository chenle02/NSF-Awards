This research focuses upon an important but largely unsolved problem: the
dynamics of polymers at solid surfaces. The experimental strategy will be to
make in situ experiments of the kinetics with which polymers first adsorb to a
well-characterized single solid surface and then exchange with isotopically
labelled polymers originally in free solution. Time constants will be determined
for the exchange process and also for evolution of the bound fraction. They will
investigate the dynamics underlying an overall equilibrium, chain relaxation
between adsorption states, and the times required for reversibility of
desorption and adsorption. Experimental variables of interest will include
molecular weight of the chains, solution concentration, thermodynamic quality of
the solvent, chain topology (linear and star), hydrodynamic flow conditions, and
the functionality as well as density of functionality of the surface. The method
of investigation will be infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection.
The findings of this research will be correlated with modern physical theories
of polymer behavior and may find application in steric stabilization of
colloidal systems, film formation, chromatography, and lubrication.
