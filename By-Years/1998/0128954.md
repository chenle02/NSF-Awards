0128954&lt;br/&gt;Ramayya&lt;br/&gt;This award is a renewal of an earlier award
that supports A.V. Ramayya, Joseph Hamilton, and a graduate student from
Vanderbilt University in a collaboration with Walter Greiner of the Department
of Theoretical Physics at the University of Frankfurt, Germany. The project will
focus on understanding the mechanisms of cold (neutronless) fragmentation of
nuclei. The collaboration brings together the experimental expertise and
facilities on the U.S. side with the theoretical capabilities of the German
side. Recently, new facilities (namely, large germanium arrays such as
Gammasphere and Eurogram II) have made detailed spectroscopic studies of
neutron-rich nuclei possible, resulting of observation of new structural
features. This in turn has led to some entirely new approaches to the study of
fission. The collaboration supported here will bring together experimentalists
and theorists in a way that will significantly advance the field of nuclear
fission.&lt;br/&gt;
