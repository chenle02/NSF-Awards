This award will fund the group to study ultrahigh energy cosmic rays with the
High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) and Telescope Array collaborations. The study
of cosmic rays has intellectual impact in several areas of physics and
astrophysics. Ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are the highest energy particles in
the universe, and are accelerated in the most violent astronomical objects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HiRes collaboration has made several important
measurements, with this group playing an important part. The Telescope Array is
the largest cosmic ray experiment in the northern hemisphere. It is a hybrid
experiment and has been collecting data since early 2008. The group is involved
in the analysis of both surface detector (SD) and fluorescence detector (FD)
data. They lead the collaboration in the SD work, developing a new method of SD
analysis, and have calculated the spectrum of cosmic rays from the SD. Their FD
analysis centers on the two fluorescence detectors located in the southern
portion of the experiment. They are making the first steps in FD analysis:
monocular reconstruction, followed by hybrid reconstruction.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research include the education
of students and postdocs and the group will join the Aspire Outreach activity.
