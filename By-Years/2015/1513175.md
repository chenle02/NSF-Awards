This project aims to increase female interest in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers through the emerging field of soft
robotics. Soft robotics diverge from other robotics in that they leverage
materials science (understanding how materials stretch and deform), chemistry
(polymer synthesis), and biology (bio-inspired design) to provide aids for human
needs. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology
Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and
promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue
STEM careers by exploring the inspiration that soft robotics might afford. The
focus is a unit within a high school freshman engineering course. Results of
this project will include the development and testing of curriculum that has the
potential to broaden participation. The International Technology and Engineering
Educators Association STEM Center for Teaching and Learning will disseminate it
to 50,000 students annually.

This project will test the hypothesis that the implementation of soft robot
design experiences improves learning, motivation, engineering self-efficacy and
interest in engineering careers as compared to traditional robot design
experiences. This development and study is contextualized in a course required
of many 9th grade students called Foundations of Technology, which is the
freshman-level technology and engineering education course provided by the
Engineering by Design core program. It is taught in over 270 school districts
across 23 states to about 100,000 students annually. The study will employ a
design research framework to develop the 8-hour unit and study its
implementation in 11 classrooms with a total of 660 students in the Carroll
County Public Schools. Measures include the Situational Motivation Scale and the
Longitudinal Assessment of Engineering Self Efficacy. In Year 3, the project
will implement an efficacy study to compare results of the soft robotics unit
with the unit implemented traditionally in the Engineering by Design program.
