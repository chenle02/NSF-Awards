9720157 LUCAS This award provides funding for establishment of an Alabama
Biomedical Implant Center that will integrate research activities for 32
researchers from six Alabama universities. Primary goals for the proposed center
include 1) basic research in biochemical, biomechanical and cellular responses
elicited by the surgical implantation of a prosthesis or other material in the
human body; 2) technology transfer from the universities involved to state and
national industrial partners; and 3) research/training and industry internship
opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. A developmental
grant program will support pilot projects to obtain preliminary data and enhance
the research competitiveness of collaborating faculty. Workshops and a
newsletter are planned for dissemination of information about center activities
and research results. The center is also anticipated to serve as a resource,
providing laboratory facilities and technical advice for developing medical
device companies. This center will be unique in its emphasis on integration of
biomedical and tissue engineering research efforts. The partnerships with
industry and emphasis on technology transfer, as well as basic and applied
research, will contribute to both economic growth and development and the
quality of health care in Alabama.
