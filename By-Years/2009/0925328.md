This project examines newspaper stories about prison privatization in the
context of mass incarceration. Delegating a coercive function of the state to
private contractors was viewed by some as a fundamental shift in the nature of
government, and by others as merely an efficiency measure. Determining whether
and how this issue was portrayed in news sources is important for understanding
the relation between public discourse and government policy. Relevant news
stories are located in electronic archives of four "national" newspapers based
in four states for 1985-2005 and regional newspapers located in an additional
six states for 1995-2005. These 10 states vary in the extent to which they used
private prisons. News stories are coded for the prominence (volume and
visibility) of prison privatization discourse, the frames actors used to talk
about private corrections (e.g., nature of government, costs, safety), the
valence of actors' claims (i.e., support or opposition), and the standing of
various types of actors (e.g., corrections administrators, private corrections
firms, union leaders, elected officials) in making claims about private
corrections. Analysis examines variation in the discourse across time and place
in relation to the extent of prison privatization. Some similarities across news
sources within time due to media diffusion effects are predicted. Despite these
diffusion effects, differences between news sources are also predicted due to
state differences in the political salience of the issue and the configuration
of political actors. Three types of states are predicted to exist: non-starter,
with no private prisons or proposals for them and little news coverage of the
issue; unopposed, where prison privatization occurs without controversy and news
coverage is scant and concerns cost and efficiency only; and conflict where
there are proposals for private prisons, active opposition to them and news
coverage that includes critical frames. Results shed light on the evolution of
public discourse as both a response to and a constraint on shifting governmental
responsibilities.
