9605206 Rothman-Denes This project is for partial funding for the 1997 FASEB
Summer Conference on "Transcription Initiation in Prokaryotes" to be held July
19-24, 1997, at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, Vermont, under the
auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
(FASEB). There will be ten oral sessions with, on average, three 30 minute talks
and two 15 minute talks per session, and two poster sessions, each lasting two
days. Thirty-two speakers have been invited and twelve additional speakers will
be selected from participants who submitted abstracts. The purpose of the
meeting is to bring together biochemists, biophysicists and geneticists to share
information on a crucial step that regulates the flow of information in all
cells: transcription initiation. The rapidly progressing field is providing
information on structure and mechanisms at the molecular level. The specific
topics to be discussed in the oral sessions are structure of DNA-dependent RNA
polymerases, physical and chemical approaches to study protein-protein and
protein-DNA interactions in transcription, promoter recognition, transcription
initiation in archae and thermophilic bacteria, biochemistry of transcription
initiation and promoter escape, mechanisms of negative and positive control, and
control of transcription in complex systems. ***
