Funds are requested for a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840, Power Macintosh 7500, HP
LaserJet 4M plus, and 6 imaging screens, to be placed in the core facility
serving the three departments of Biology, Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, and
Chemistry. The instrument will be used by the laboratories of six major users,
two minor users, and other occasional users in these departments. The Storm 840
images radioactive and fluorescent blots and gels with five orders of linear
dynamic range, and a resolution of 250 M for radioactive samples, and 500 M for
fluorescent samples. This instrument will provide the ability to accurately
quantify radioactive and fluorescent blots and gels, which is not currently
possible at Wesleyan University. The fluorescent capability will enable the use
of fluorescent labels instead of radioactive labels in many applications.
Substitution of chemifluorescent techniques for chemiluminescent techniques will
provide both accurate quantitation of samples and longer sample lifetime. The
Storm imager will be used to quantify protein-DNA and protein-RNA gel shifts,
sequencing gels, CAT assays, Western, Northern, and Southwestern blots, RNA
footprints and toeprints, pulse-chase labeling experiments, processive DNA
replication, nucleotide binding, RNase protection, and RT-PCR assays. These
methods will be applied to several different projects. These include studies of:
Contribution of individual structural elements to the folding of RNA;
Thermodynamic and structural basis of RNA- protein interactions; Dissection of
Drosophila Paired proteil function; Identification of imm unoglobulin-like
molecules in he developing CNS; Mechanisms of protein localization in scherichia
coli; Identification of novel antigens for Lyme disease diagnosis; Biochemical
analysis of yeast DNA replication and repair proteins; and The role of
extracellular matrix and signaling molecules in teratocarcinoma stem cell
differentiation. Matching funds from Wesleyan University will pay for 50% of the
cost of the instrument.
