In chemical process design, flowsheeting is a time-intensive phase which is done
repeatedly. It deals primarily with mass and energy balances. This effort will
research into more efficient and reliable methods of solving the equations that
model a process flowsheet, taking advantage of new computer architectures. This
research should provide an understanding of methods for exploiting vectorization
and parallel processing in the solution of equations that model complex chemical
processes. The results should be more broadly applicable to other engineering
disciplines.
