9510164 Johann Well-founded orderings are ubiquitous in automated deduction,
being fundamental to the development of termination proofs for computations in
rewrite-based deduction systems, as well as of deduction strategies aiming to
restrict search spaces in saturation processes. The determination of well-
founded orderings suitable for a particular purpose, however, typically requires
a good deal of technical expertise, and because termination of rewriting is
undecidable in general the best that can be hoped for is to have a sufficient
understanding of a sufficient variety of orderings to be able to cope with the
many kinds of termination and efficiency problems which occur in practice. This
research planning grant undertakes to develop a comprehensive theory of well-
founded orderings based on their logical and numerical invariants. Two specific
directions for further research are extending known results to larger classes of
terms, and obtaining similar results for more general well- founded orderings,
such as exponential orderings. As a further, related line of inquiry, a theory
of nontotal well-founded orderings will be explored. Since the notion of order
type makes no sense for nontotal orderings, appropriate logical invariants will
need to be determined. ***
