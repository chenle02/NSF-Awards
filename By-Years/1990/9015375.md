Many-body QED calculations on atomic systems will be carried out using a
Green's function technique. Radiative corrections will be treated perturbatively
for low Z atoms. The zeroth order approximation to be used is the Dirac-Fock
approximation. Analytical approximations will be obtained using perturbation
theory, but the final results must be obtained by numerical computations.
