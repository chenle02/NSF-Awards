This U.S.-Panama award provides funding for U.S. participation in a planning
workshop that will take place in Panama City in January, 2012 to chart the
future of Environmental Studies at the Liquid Jungle Laboratory (LJL). This
award will enable approximately 10 U.S. researchers to attend the workshop,
together with an equivalent number of Latin American and European participants.
The goal of the workshop is to discuss options and plan future strategy and
programs to support sustained research and education at LJL. The Laboratory is
in an especially attractive region for integrated tropical research due to an
extraordinary combination of natural geographic settings (terrestrial, coastal,
and oceanographic) and strong bimodal (wet-dry) seasonality. The U.S.
participants are associated with institutions such as the Woods Hole Consortium,
Roger Williams University, Conservation International, and the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute (STRI). Foreign participants are expected from the
University of Panama, University of Costa Rica, the Natural Environmental
Authority in Panama, the Catholic University of Chile, and research universities
and agencies in Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the results of this workshop
is expected to be a series of planned major activities that should enhance the
long-term research and education goals of the Liquid Jungle Laboratory. Having a
site to study and evaluate changes in diversity that result from climate change
in a tropical system is highly desirable. The education and training
opportunities for junior researchers at such a site would be significant and
would satisfy a major goal of the Office of International Science and
Engineering, to provide young scientists with opportunities to conduct research
in an international setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by
Americas Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering.
