The objective of the research is twofold. A comprehensive data-flow model of
procedural programs will be de eloped that will permit one to formulate
structural testing strategies, debugging procedures and static analysis in a
unified framework. The model should reflect the mutual dependencies of those
activities and exhibit a hierarchical structure. The development of the model
will be related to the study of the origin and propagation of errors in the
program. The second objective of the research is partial automation of some
verification activities. This involves the identification of the paths that meet
the requirements of a structural testing strategy, using the technique of
regular expressions; interactive procedures for the synthesis of test data that
cause the traversal of those paths; and the derivation of efficient error-
locating algorithms. Ultimately, the results of the research will be used in
Computer Aided Software Engineering.
