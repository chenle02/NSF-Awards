The proposer intends to continue his study of geometric questions in the theory
of meromorphic functions, using the new techniques developed in his previous
work. The main directions of the proposed research are the following. a)
Questions related to Bloch's theorem and the Type Problem of a simply connected
Riemann surface, especially the relations between the conformal type of a
surface and its integral curvature. b) Problems of geometric function theory
arising in real algebraic geometry. More specifically, it includes counting real
solutions of certain systems of algebraic equations of geometric origin, which
have important applications in linear control theory. c) Generalization of
results of geometric function theory to quasiregular maps in spaces of arbitrary
dimension. d) Normality criteria for families of holomorphic curves in
projective spaces.

One of the basic questions in mathematics and its applications is whether a
given equation or a system of equations has solutions, how many, and where are
they located. In the theory of meromorphic functions one studies these questions
for equations of the type f(z)=a, where a is a given complex number and f a
given meromorphic function. The class of meromorphic functions includes
elementary functions, such as rational, exponential and trigonometric ones, as
well as the special functions, a. k. a. higher transcendental functions, such as
the Gamma function, Airy functions, elliptic functions and so on. Most functions
arising in applications of mathematics belong to this class. In modern
mathematics, questions about solvability of equations are usually formulated in
geometric language, which makes the results appealing to our geometric
intuition. The logic of development of mathematics and its applications require
an extension of results to vector-valued functions known as ``holomorphic
curves''. The proposer plans to continue his study of geometric theory of
meromorphic functions and holomorphic curves. A part of the proposal is related
to existence of real solutions, which is by far more subtle than the existence
of complex solutions, which are usually studied. This part is inspired by the
so-called "pole placement problem", which is a major unsolved mathematical
problem in control theory of linear systems. The results in this area will have
implications for the design of complicated automatic control systems. These
results would establish limitations on the possibility to control a system of
given size by a control device of certain class.
