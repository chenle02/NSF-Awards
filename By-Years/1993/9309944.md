This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is made by the
Chemistry Division to Dr. Martha Reynolds of the Chemistry Department, Colgate
University. Multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopies will be used to probe metal-
catalyzed oxidative brominations. During the planning period, Dr. Reynolds will
spend an extended period in the laboratories of Dr. Alison Butler of the
University of California at Santa Barbara learning the needed instrumental
techniques and assessing the feasibility of these mthods for studying the
oxidation of bromide by peroxometal complexes. This research will form the basis
for subsequent work on synthetic analogues of the enzyme vanadium
bromoperoxidase. The project is relevant to halogenation reactions widely used
for organic synthesis by the pharaceutical industry and to studies of
atmospheric bromoform.
