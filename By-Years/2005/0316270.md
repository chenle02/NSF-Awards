The numerous conserved protein domains of unknown function have been revealed
through microbial genomics, which suggests that significant areas of microbial
physiology, metabolism and behavior remain unexplored. This research is aimed at
investigating functions of proteins containing GGDEF and EAL domains that are
broadly distributed in diverse bacteria. The GGDEF and EAL domains are involved
in synthesis and hydrolysis of the unusual nucleotide, cyclic diguanylate, c-di-
GMP. The main hypothesis of this project is that c-di-GMP is an important
underappreciated second messenger in bacteria. The long-term goals of the
project are to elucidate the role of c-di-GMP and to reveal the mechanisms by
which it operates using the metabolically versatile proteobacterium, Rhodobacter
sphaeroides, as a model. Preliminary data indicate that R. sphaeroides contains
enzymes involved in both synthesis (diguanylate cyclases) and hydrolysis
(phosphodiesterases) of c-di-GMP. Initial emphasis of this project will be
placed on two R. sphaeroides c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, designated
BphG and BphH, which contain phytochrome-type domains and are likely to
represent photoreceptors of unique structure. The depletion of the intracellular
pool of c-di-GMP in R. sphaeroides results in specific changes in the R.
sphaeroides transcriptome. Uncovering mechanisms by which c-di-GMP affects gene
expression is another aim of this project. A combination of molecular genetic,
transcriptomics and biochemical approaches will be employed to address these
questions.

This research will fill an apparent void in our understanding of the bacterial
cell resulting from an oversight of a potentially important second messenger,
c-di-GMP. Elucidation of the role of c-di-GMP is anticipated to have a
significant effect on the field of signal transduction in various bacteria,
including agriculturally, environmentally and medically important species. This
project will provide ample opportunities for interdisciplinary training of high
school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.
