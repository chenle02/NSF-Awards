This grant provides NSF support to broaden participation in the Sixteenth
International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and
Operating Systems (ASPLOS 2012), to be held in London, UK in March 2012. ASPLOS
is the premiere forum for research involving the interaction of computer
architecture, compilers, and operating systems. It brings together leading
researchers from these diverse communities to one conference offering
opportunities to interact across traditional disciplinary boundaries. This
proposal aims to increase the impact of this conference by enabling
participation by additional students and faculty for whom travel support would
otherwise preclude their attendance. Priority for these funds will be given to
defray the travel expenses of under-represented groups.
