The principal investigator proposes two main lines of research, focused around
new directions, and around foundational problems, in the relatively new field of
operator spaces. These lines are: 1) 'noncommutative functional analysis and
noncommutative Banach function theory', which in part continues the
investigators introduction, and application, of powerful tools from classical
functional analysis and C*-algebra and von Neumann algebra theory to
'noncommutative functional analysis', 2) the general theory and structure of
operator algebras, for example extending to general operator algebras important
new notions of equivalence that are attracting widespread attention in the
field. The investigator and collaborators are also proposing to investigate
applications of the above.

The study of operator algebras originally grew out of quantum mechanics. It is
often of crucial importance to see how formulas involving numerical variables
behave when these variables are allowed to be operator variables. Because
operator variables do not commute, this is often called 'noncommutative
mathematics' It is out of such a process that the theory of operator spaces and
completely bounded maps emerged. This theory, which the investigator helped to
found, is a novel and compelling approach to problems involving linear analysis
which arise in 'noncommutative mathematics'. The investigator's research focuses
partly on transferring important ideas and tools from classical subfields of
linear analysis, via such 'quantization', to solve significant problems in
'noncommutative' mathematics. Most of the projects involve a deep unification of
ideas from several different research areas; and often require extremely deep
and technically demanding analysis. Successful findings would bring several
subjects closer together, attract scientists with disparate backgrounds, and
lead to cross-fertilization between these disciplines.
