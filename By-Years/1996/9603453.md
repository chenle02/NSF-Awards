This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in condensed matter
physics involves the research group of Jeffrey Childress at the University of
Florida and Frederic Petroff of the CNRS/Thomson Physics Unit in Orsay, France.
The award provides travel support and living expenses to Dr. Childress and his
graduate student. The objective of their research is to investigate the
fabrication, magnetic properties, magnetotransport properties and spin polarized
properties of magnetic multilayer structures containing ferromagnetic ternary
alloys. The project takes advantage of French expertise in magnetotransport
properties of multilayer and nanostructured systems. This French group is renown
for their discovery of giant magnetoresistance effects which have applications
in magnetic recording, detection and memory devices. This collaboration will
advance understanding of techniques for growing high quality ultrathin films
with good properties.
