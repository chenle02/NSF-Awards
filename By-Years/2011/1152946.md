This is a proposal for a Principle Investigators meeting for the DataNet and
INTEROP programs. Often, PI communities that evolve within two related yet
distinct programs can become partitioned in both their thinking and their
interactions along strictly programmatic boundaries. The meeting proposes to use
the unifying theme of the participants common passion for data to transcend
these boundaries and create new collaborative networks to better explore the
challenges in data management, data preservation, and interoperability. Meetings
with this unconventional venue provide open and creative conversations to expose
and accentuate the group's collective knowledge, allow for a sharing of ideas
and insights, and let participants gain a deeper understanding of the
challenging issues involved.
