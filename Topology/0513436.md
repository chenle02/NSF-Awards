During the late 70's the PI initiated a study of geometric structures as a tool
for deciphering three-dimensional topology. The central principle has been the
geometrization conjecture, asserting that any 3-manifold has a canonical
topological decomposition into pieces that have one of eight possible kinds of
locally homogeneous geometric structures. The last two or three years have seen
dramatic progress in this program. The most notable progress is Perlman's proof
(which has been gaining in acceptance) using Ricci flow to establish
geometrization. In addition, there has also been great progress on understanding
the geometry of noncompact hyperbolic manifolds through the proof of the tame
end and ending lamination conjectures, and there have been some notable negative
results establishing that certain hyperbolic 3-manifolds don't have taut
foliations, essential laminations, or quasigeodesic flows. Geometric
decompositions of 3-manifolds have given us a firm grip on individual
3-manifolds. With the acceptance of the geometrization conjecture, the subject
is entering a new phase of exploration of the rich interconnections among three-
manifolds and various structures on manifolds. One important topic for
investigation is to further clarify the relationships among taut foliations,
tight contact structures, flows with varying properties, and hyperbolic
structures. Another interesting area is to investigate is the master three-
manifold, a laminated set whose leaves are all possible hyperbolic 3-manifolds,
compact and noncompact. A third important topic is to understand the lattices of
finite-sheeted covers of 3-manifolds and in particular, the questions of whether
hyperbolic 3-manifolds are virtually Haken, virtually positive betti, and
virtually fibered. The final and perhaps most significant topic is to develop a
bigger picture to explain geometrization, using structures such as a foliated
bundles over three-manifolds to build their geometry.

A 3-manifold is a space which has 3 degrees of freedom, so it can be locally
described by three variables. Through the geometrization conjecture, which is
now generally accepted, the topology of three-manifolds have a beautiful
description in terms of crystallographic groups in 8 flavors of 3-dimensional
geometry. In fact most 3-manifolds are the identification spaces of a
crystallographic group in non-Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry. Unlike for
standard (Euclidean) crystallography, there are infinitely many crystallographic
groups in hyperbolic geometry, and many mysteries remain about their structure,
their classification, and their interrelationships. This project will seek to
uncover and explain some of these interrelationships.
