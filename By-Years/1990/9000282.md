This award provides partial travel support for approximately 25 US academic
researchers to the Second World Congress on Particulate Technology scheduled for
September 19-22, 1990 in Kyoto, Japan. This Congress is expected to draw 250
papers and 500 to 700 attendees from around the world. Topics to be covered
include particle formation, dispersion, conveying, agglomeration, attrition,
separation, and characterization. Particle processing is of very great
importance to the chemical, minerals, energy, and high-tech material industries.
The Congress provides a favorable forum for assessing the state-of-the-art world
wide, but especially in Japan, of a wide range of topics relevant to particle
processing.
