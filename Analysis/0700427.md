We have developed a new approach to proving universality limits involving
orthogonal polynomials. We allow, for example, the weight to be positive a.e.
globally, and continuous at a given point. That is enough for universality for a
fixed weight. We intend to explore the limits of this method for weights on
compact and non-compact sets, as well as for varying weights.

Universality limits of this type arise in the theory of random matrices and its
applications, which include various topics in mathematical physics. The
significance is that previously strong global hypotheses were required, such as
analyticity. Now only weak local and global assumptions are required.
