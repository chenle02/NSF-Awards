This is a study of the electrocatalytic properties of mononuclear and binuclear
complexes of ruthenium, osmium, and manganese towards oxidation of organic
substrates. The ligands used should stabilize high oxidation states; these will
be prepared chemically or electrochemically and characterized by such techniques
as cyclic voltammentry and spectroelectrochemistry. The electrocatalytic
behavior of these species will then be studied under two different
circumstances: with the electrocatalyst bound to the electrode, and with the
electrocatalyst in the electrolyte solution. Current distribution and
electrochemical kinetics will be measured. Potential (but clearly future)
applications of this work include fuel cells, electrosynthesis, and
detoxification of hazardous waste.
