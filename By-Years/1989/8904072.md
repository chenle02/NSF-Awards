The accurate measurement of the isotopes of oxygen in rock and mineral samples
is a well established and powerful tool for interpreting the extent of chemical
interaction between rock masses and aqueous solutions during the formation of
ore mineral deposits and for deciphering the temperature of formation of mineral
assemblages during rock metamorphism. The capability to measure smaller and
smaller volumes of samples for oxygen isotope analysis allows for more accurate
and sophisticated interpretation. Oxygen is quantitatively extracted from
natural oxide and silicate minerals by either fluorination of the minerals
(liberating oxygen directly) or by carbon reduction of the mineral (which
creates CO and CO2). This project will adapt a laser heating method to these two
oxygen extraction techniques so that a laser beam focused on a mineral grain can
be used to extract oxygen from a very small volume, thereby allowing isotope
microanalysis with excellent spatial resolution.
