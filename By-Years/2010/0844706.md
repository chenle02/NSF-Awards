This project studies a new integrated data-driven planning and control scheme
for life science automation. Particular attention is paid for the objective of
designing a highly robust and intelligent system to achieve the safety and
reliability.

The research here intends to (i) create a framework for facilitating analytical
integration of planning and control, (ii) adopt a two degree-of-freedom
controller for robust and intelligent life science automation, (iii) test and
evaluate of the obtained results via simulation, (iv) evaluate the proposed
glucose controller by a quantitative grading system measure, and (v) establish
contact with Professor Alan Permutt at Washington University Medical School to
prepare for experimental studies.

The expected benefits are (i) an advanced nontrivial planning algorithm to
improve safety and reliability of the design of life science system, (ii) an
advanced control software for life science automation, and (iii) a science base
for the development of automated life science systems. Additionally this
research will significantly enhance our general understanding about nonlinear
dynamics and control of a complex system and will have a specific impact on the
bio-engineering fields in terms of their research and development.
