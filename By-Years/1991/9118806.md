This award supports a program of detailed field and laboratory studies of
Cenozoic volcanic rocks in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica. This area, one of the
earth's largest volcanic provinces, contains important records of Cenozoic
glacial-volcanic history, petrogenesis, and tectonic evolution of West
Antarctica. This project will extend detailed field coverage to Marie Byrd Land
volcanoes which are still known only on a reconnaissance level. Subsequent
laboratory studies will include geochemical and isotopic analyses, radiometric
dating, and surface exposure dating. This is an international cooperative
program involving U.S., U.K., and N.Z. geoscientists.
