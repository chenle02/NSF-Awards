This planning grant proposal presents information supporting a multi-university,
multi-disciplinary Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi).
The proposed center will be a National Science Foundation sponsored
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC). The vision for the
center is to provide integrated solutions to logistics problems, through
modeling, analysis and intelligent-systems technologies, building upon the
knowledge and expertise available at the three member campuses, the University
of Arkansas, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Louisville.
