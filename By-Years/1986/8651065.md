This project will enhance the chemistry education of undergraduate students at
the University of Minnesota--Morris by providing laboratory experience with NMR
spectrometry. The project is aimed primarily at chemistry majors, but also will
serve a large number of students in other science and preprofessional programs.
A 60-MHz NMR spectrometer with spin decoupler and variable temperature
capability will be used by students in organic, analytical, and physical
chemistry laboratories and undergraduate research. In laboratory courses,
students will study characteristic NMR phenomena such as chemical shifts, spin-
spin coupling, spin decoupling, linewidths and relaxation times, and will
discover how these are applied to the elucidation of molecular structure, to
problems of quantitative analysis, and to the study of chemical kinetics.
Student researchers will use the instrument in their projects dealing with
chemistry of natural products, including those with potential medicinal value.
