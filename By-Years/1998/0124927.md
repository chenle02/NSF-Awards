This project will analyze ice nucleating particles in real-time for chemical
composition using single-particle mass spectrometry. A continuous flow ice
thermal gradient diffusion chamber (CFDC) will be coupled to the NOAA PALMS
(Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry) instrument and deployed in the
field. This research will provide an assessment of the role of various aerosol
types as ice nuclei for cirrus cloud formation, and the role of certain
constituents as promoters or inhibitors of ice formation. The results of this
project are likely to have broad societal impacts by providing new insights into
the mechanisms for cloud formation, a topic critical for better understanding
climate change.
