This research examines why traditional Islamic schools (pensantren) are
flourishing rather than declining in the face of national development efforts in
West Java, Indonesia. The project will test the hypothesis that traditional
religions in Southeast Asia can both maintain their strength and promote
development in the modern context. It will also seek to determine what
historical, economic, political, and socio-cultural factors account for the
pensantren's ability to grow and address development issues without losing their
religious distinctiveness. The researcher hypothesizes that it is the
flexibility of the Sufistic conceptual framework of traditional Islam, coupled
with the centrality of the pensantren historically to Javanese village life,
that has enabled the pensantren to adapt economic development goals to rural
Javanese realities. The project will provide important data on the role of
religion in economic development.
