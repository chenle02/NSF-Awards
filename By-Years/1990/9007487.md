Magneto-transport measurement has been proven as one of the most powerful
methods in charactering advanced semiconductor materials and devices. The
measurement can provide vast information about a material and a device, such as
carrier mobility, carrier density, effective mass of electrons and holes,
elastic and inelastic scattering lengths, phonon emissions, gate capacitance,
layer thicknesses, etc. To establish this important characterization capability
in Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Minnesota, we propose
to purchase a superconducting magnet system (SMS), which consists of a
superconducting magnet of the maximum fields of 9 Tesla and a cryostat of the
lowest cooling temperature of 1.5K. Such SMS is not only necessary, but also
very crucial to our current vigorous ongoing research program on artificially
structured new semiconductor materials and devices for future electronics.
Currently, our department has total 10 faculty members in the area of
semiconductor materials and devices; and at least five of them have great need
of using magneto-transport characterization for their research. With a magnet
system requested in the proposal, we will measure the effective mass of
electrons and holes in artificially structured crystals grown by MBE; we will
study the transport in various new quantum-effect-based semiconductor devices
fabricated by MBE and ultra-high resolution e-beam lithography; we will
investigate the effect of strain in the artificially structured materials on the
transport properties of electrons and holes, and on the performance of
semiconductor devices; and we will characterize the delta doped MBE grown films.
Undoubtedly, not only the listed research but also many other related research
in Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Minnesota can benefit
greatly from getting this magnet system.
