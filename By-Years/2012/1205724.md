This award supports a panel symposium scheduled over two days in March 2012 that
will examine trends in ecological analysis and synthesis since the establishment
of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, or NCEAS, in 1995.
The symposium has several objectives, including recognition of the intellectual
impacts of NCEAS and the contributions of individuals to these; consideration of
lessons learned from the NCEAS experience in cross-disciplinary synthesis
research methods, data and information management, communication and outreach;
consideration of emerging trends and opportunities for synthesis research in
ecology and related fields; and discussion of the impact of networking
technologies for accelerating synthesis research, training and outreach. The
symposium will engage a diverse group of leading thinkers in ecology, data
management and informatics, and scientific journalism.

This symposium is designed to raise awareness of the growing impact of synthesis
research in ecology and other fields of science. The agenda is designed to
stimulate intensive, wide ranging discussion among the participants on key
issues that must be addressed to increase the long term benefits of synthesis
research efforts. Participation by some leading scientific journalists will
assure that important insights and ideas are communicated to a broad audience.
