9504913 Calabi The proposed research involves various aspects of differential
geometry and differential topology: variational problems in surface theory, knot
theory in the presence of curvature, topological classification of
representations, homology manifolds, Einstein metrics on homogeneous spaces,
equivariant K-theory, and Poisson manifolds are among the topics proposed.
Differential geometry studies shapes in space keeping in mind their distance and
curvature properties; differential topology concentrates on relative positions
in space whilst ignoring distance or curvature. This group proposal then seeks
to establish a connection between these two areas of research by asking such
questions as how the topology of a space determines its geometry.
