The remarkable floristic similarities between temperate eastern Asia and
eastern North America have been recognized for over a century. Despite an
unusually healthy fossil record, we are far from a general biogeographic
hypothesis that will prove to be robust across many distinct taxa. The most
informative approach to this problem will combine estimates of genetic
divergence, preferably for several different data sets, with explicit methods of
cladistic and biogeographic analysis. Such an approach is described herein for
the woody genus Gleditsia (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae), which contains two
hypothesized eastern Asian-eastern North American vicariad species-pairs, in
addition to other intra- and intercontinental disjunctions. The study will first
use cladistic analysis of different molecular data sets to recognize putative
monophyletic groups. Area cladograms will be constructed to discern intra- and
intercontinental disjunctions within monophyletic groups. Tests of competing
biogeographic hypotheses (especially dispersal vs. vicariance) for the origin of
eastern Asian-eastern North American disjunctions (and others) will derive from
the topology of area cladograms coupled with estimates of genetic divergence
provided by the molecular data. Gleditsia will thus serve as a model for similar
approaches in other genera, with the ultimate objective being to understand the
origins and biogeographic history of other northern hemisphere Tertiary
disjunctions.
