AST 0134739 University of Florida Jonathan Williams

Dr. Williams is awarded funds to initiate a research program in star formation
at the University of Florida in Gainesville. He will investigate the formation
of stars in clusters by observing them at millimeter and submillimeter
wavelengths, taking advantage of newly available telescope instrumentation.
Although it is known that most stars form in clusters, the physics of star
formation in groups is poorly understood relative to that of the formation of
single stars. Dr. Williams will use observations at continuum wavelengths to
locate protostars inside their dusty nascent clouds, and then use observations
of molecular lines to investigate the dynamics and chemistry of the surrounding
gas. The concentration and motions of the protostars will be used to estimate
the relative age of a cluster, allowing Dr. Williams to trace the evolution of
the chemistry and motion of the stars and surrounding gas as a function of time.

Dr. Williams will involve graduate and undergraduate students in his research,
and serve as liaison for a new international student exchange between the
University of Florida and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in Spain. He
will also participate in his university's Student Science Training Program by
mentoring a high school student each summer in a seven week program.
