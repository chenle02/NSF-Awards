This proposal requests equipment to support research in the area of machine
vision for automated manufacturing. Four Sun workstations and ancillary
equipment will be used to support the projects of several faculty in CAD/CAM
model-based machine vision, probabilistic reasoning for high-level deduction in
machine vision, development of architecture and language for cost-effective
vision system for industrial applications, and exploration of portable image
processing software for these applications.
