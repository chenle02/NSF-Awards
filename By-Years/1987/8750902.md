Many of the most important recent revolutions in science belong to Biology. The
discovery of means to routinely isolate, sequence, and reintroduce genes into
living cells has permanently changed biological teaching and research agendas.
The tools of Cell Tissue Culture and Recombinant DNA Technology are providing
the basis for an appropriate undergraduate education in modern Biology, and a
hope for exploiting the future promise of Biotechnology. This Department has
identified Molecular/Cellular Biology as an area for increased emphasis and,
using local resources, has partially equipped an area to include a functional
Cell Tissue Culture Laboratory. The laboratory complex is housing a specially
designed course "Cell/Tissue Culture", as well as supplementing student
experimentation in the Botany, Microbiology, and Genetics courses. Also, a new
B.S. degree program with an emphasis in Molecular/Cellular Biology is being
inaugurated. Thus the equipment provided through this project is greatly
expanding the efficiency, depth, and variety of possible student experimentation
in the areas of Cell Tissue Culture and DNA Technology.
