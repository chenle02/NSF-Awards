9414614 Reddy The project is an experimental and analytical investigation of
crack kinking in concrete structures bonded with prestressed and nonprestressed
fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) laminates. Concrete beams bonded with prestressed
laminates exhibit superior strength (3 to 4 times higher compared to those with
nonprestressed ones). The investigation will address the propagation of cracks
into the concrete core for specimens with varying thicknesses of the bonded
layer.
