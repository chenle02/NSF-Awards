The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research Phase II project is to develop a mature, market-ready approach for
building targeted, readily synthesizable inhibitors of viral proteases. The
technology will extend the discovery platform to new targets and disease
indications and build a biochemical foundation for progressing preclinical
programs to promising leads, starting with a potent lead candidate for treating
COVID-19. The project seeks to generate new intellectual property that covers
the discovery platform and promising small molecules, and it will support new
opportunities to partner with pharmaceutical companies on antiviral
therapeutics, which continue to be an important unmet medical need.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
seeks to expand and industrialize the company’s recently demonstrated approach
for using microbial systems to guide the discovery and assembly of protease
inhibitors. The project focuses on COVID-19 and other viral diseases that lack
effective treatments, exhibit significant epidemic potential, and/or remain
relevant to U.S. biodefense. The research program may uncover inhibitors of a
broad set of viral proteases and as it screens large libraries of biosynthetic
pathways for targeted inhibitors. This solution complements the multi-part
effort by developing a potent lead candidate for treating COVID-19 and a general
workflow for the (bio)synthetic optimization of hits identified. Success in
these tasks may stretch contemporary approaches to synthetic biology by applying
them to the discovery and assembly of new biologically active compounds and may
develop a supporting (bio)synthetic workflow—one that that combines applied
enzymology and synthetic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
