9623543 Kriegsmann It is proposed to model and analyze a class of physical
problems arising in microwave processing of ceramics. These problems give rise
to challenging nonlinear initial boundary value problems, the mathematical
statements of which involve one or more nonlinear parabolic equations, governing
the diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical concentration, and the
time harmonic version of Maxwell's equations. These equations are coupled
together in a nonlinear fashion and, in addition, nonlinear heat balances are
required in certain applications where surface temperatures produce significant
thermal radiation. It is proposed to develop and use asymptotic methods,
dictated by certain physical limits, to simplify the mathematical systems and to
develop and use numerical methods to solve the reduced problems. The goals of
the project are twofold. The first is the mathematical understanding of the
basic physical mechanisms which make the processes work. Such an understanding
would give scientists and engineers involved in microwave processing of ceramics
the basic scientific underpinnings to judge and interpret their experimental
findings. The second is the development and application of asymptotic,
numerical, and other approximate methods required to obtain an accurate
description of more realistic and complicated processes. The successful
completion of the proposed research would allow engineers and scientists to
design more efficient sintering and joining processes for ceramics which would
produce higher quality materials. It would also help in the design and
implementation of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes which are highly
promising in the construction of composite ceramic materials.
