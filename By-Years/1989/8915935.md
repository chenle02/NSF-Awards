Fish have served as objects of experimental research for several centuries,
however their role as an experimental model, which can substitute for
conventional laboratory warmblooded animals has been enhanced particularly in
recent times. Representative agnathans (lamprey or hagfish) and teleost fish
(salmon, trout, catfish) are to be used in studies of the regulation of
metabolism and growth by pancreatic hormones, their interaction with each other
and with growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor. Specific objectives of
the project are: 1) to develop new homologous radioimmunoassays or enzyme-
linked immunoassays for measurement of the islet hormones in lampreys; 2) to
continue an assessment of the profiles of pancreatic hormones in plasma and
endocrine pancreas of salmon, trout and lamprey at different stages of their
life cycles and kept under different feeding regimes; 3) to determine the levels
of pancreatic hormones in the blood outflow from the pancreatic islets (major
producing sites) and from the liver, (important target and main place for
destruction of the pancreatic hormones); to evaluate the differences in the
hormonal contents in fasting and feeding animals with respect to these patterns;
4) to examine whether the cells from different parts of liver, encountering
different levels of hormones are metabolically differentiated and to employ
isolated hepatocytes as an experimental in vitro system for investigation of the
effects of glucagon-family peptides, which regulate energy stores; 5) to study
specific binding of the major anabolic hormone, insulin to its target, the
liver, at different developmental stages and under different feeding regimes; 6)
to investigate whether the unusual abundance of "big" somatostatins in the
endocrine pancreas of lamprey and salmon has any particular physiological
significance. The expected results will contribute to better understanding of
hormonal regulation of nutrition and growth as well as extend our knowledge of
functional evolution of pancreatic hormones in vertebrates.
