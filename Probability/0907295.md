The objective of this research project is the investigation and the mathematical
analysis of a wide class of asymptotic problems for stochastic partial
differential equations, with emphasis on the study of averaging principle, large
deviation principle, stochastic singular perturbation and the interplay between
them. Multi-scale and asymptotic methods in the analysis of deterministic and
random systems are getting more and more important and by now they are
acknowledged among the most powerful tools in many fields. They play an
important role in the study of systems which possess multiple scales, in the
fundamental effort to give a simplified description of them. With this project
the PI is trying to apply multi-scale methods to the analysis of a large class
of SPDE's: these are highly complex mathematical objects and any effort which
goes in the direction of their simplification is crucial for a deeper
understanding of the main features of the models and for a better effectiveness
in applications.

Large deviations, averaging, homogenization, singular perturbations and in
general multi-scaling limits have been widely studied for systems with a finite
number of degrees of freedom and a wide literature on this subject is available.
The treatment of the analogous problems in the infinite dimensional case (with
maybe the only exception of large deviations) is a relatively new field of
investigation, which has already stirred up a vivid interest in many fields. Due
to the ampleness of the subject, which is related to many branches of
mathematics, and the diversified range of their applications in physics, biology
and engineering, these researches are only at the beginning and a lot of work
has still to be done. The analysis requires the development of new methods and
the substantial introduction of new techniques which have to range over many
fields in mathematics, from stochastic analysis, to the theory of partial
differential equations, to analysis in infinite dimensional spaces.
