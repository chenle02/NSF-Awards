This proposal requests equipment to improve the facilities for an advanced
undergraduate laboratory in optics offered at Cal Poly. The equipment is
primarily to teach the physics associated with volume holography and introduce
physics and engineering students to the technologically important area of
layered dielectric media. Students will holographically record gratings in
photopolymer and characterize the gratings as a function of index modulation,
thickness of medium, angle of incidence and wavelength of replay. Fundamental
physical concepts such as the angular spectrum, phase matching and Bragg
scattering will be demonstrated and the students will become acquainted with the
notions of coupled wave theory.
