This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Center for the
Mathematical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: Spline Functions
and Surfaces, directed by Carl de Boor; Dynamics of Viscoelastic and Related
Materials, directed by Sangtae Kim, David Malkus, John Nohel, Bradley Plohr, and
Marshall Slemrod; Computational Fluid Mechanics, directed by Robert Turner,
Jean-Marc Vanden-Broeck, and John Strikwerda; Large-Scale Optimization, directed
by Renato De Leone and Olvi Mangasarian; and Distributed Parameter Control and
Computation for Mathematical Modeling, directed by David Russell.
