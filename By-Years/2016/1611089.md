Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Colloids are collections of small particles
suspended in a liquid. They occur in many different places in everyday life,
such as paints and milk. The properties of these colloids can be controlled by
varying the size and composition of the particles allowing them to serve as
models for atomic systems. This project will explore the properties of colloids
to obtain a better understanding of the various phases (liquids, crystals,
glasses) of atomic and molecular systems. Colloids offer an advantage in this
study since the location of individual particles can be tracked in 3D. In
addition, the PI's will develop new techniques that will allow more control of
the particles in the colloids. The project will provide training for graduate
and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art synthesis and measurement
techniques. In addition, the relative simplicity and the visual character of the
experiments make them highly accessible to the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will use colloidal particles as models for the study of interesting and
important phase behavior of a variety of solid phases. Colloids offer the unique
advantage in that the motion of individual particles can be tracked. This
enables direct three-dimensional, time-dependent imaging of complex dynamic
processes, such as crystallization, nucleation or deformation, on the molecular
level; these processes are common to both colloidal systems as well as molecular
systems. This capability will be exploited in the work proposed to investigate
new properties of the phase behavior of solids, including phase transitions
between amorphous and crystalline states, solid-solid phase transitions and the
nature and dynamics of the amorphous state and the interfaces of crystalline
materials. An important part of the project is the development of new
experimental tools. One of them is the "electric bottle", in which the particle
density is controlled by dielectrophoresis. New types of electrodes are being
developed to aid in the study of phase transformations, in particular
homogeneous crystal nucleation from the melt and solid-solid transformations. A
second tool being developed is a highly sensitive traction-force method for
measuring the stress in a colloidal crystal or glass during deformation. The
tool will also present the rheology community with a new, highly sensitive
instrument. The colloids also provide a unique opportunity to study the mobility
and fluctuation dynamics of a large variety of random and engineered three-
dimensional grain boundaries.
