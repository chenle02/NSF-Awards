This project addresses the needs of American industry (and the local economy)
to provide education in state-of-the-art processing and technology of advanced
ceramic materials. Electronic and other advanced ceramics provide an excellent
vehicle for teaching correct processing, inasmuch as property data furnishes an
identifiable label for processing-controlled structural parameters. Cost sharing
is request for the acquisition of state-of-the-art powder processing equipment
(attritor and vibratory mills) powder characterization (thermal gravimetric
analysis, particle sizer and surface area analyzer), sintering (programmable
furnaces with atmosphere control), measurements (impedance analyzer, optical
microscope and scanning electron microscope), and computer to interface with
listed items. These items will be used in teaching processing science and
structure-property relationships within the context of a redefined ceramics
curriculum and completely refurbished high quality laboratory space.
