This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
to Professor Charles S. Weinert of Oklahoma State University addresses the
synthesis a wide range of catenated germanium species in linear, branched,
cyclic and cage geometries. This is a significant goal as the chemistry of
species containing extended chains or networks of germanium-germanium single
bonds is not well developed. In contrast, catenated silicon and tin systems are
well known and have important properties. The physical properties of these
species are evaluated as precursors for the fabrication of germanium
nanomaterials with important electronic properties. Native American high school
students are provided summer internships in Professor Weinert's laboratories
with the goal of engaging them in the chemical sciences. As Native Americans are
not well represented in chemistry, the outcome of this effort is extremely
significant.
