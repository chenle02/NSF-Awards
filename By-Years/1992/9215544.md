This study is a combined theoretical and physical study of the style of
convection beneath mid-ocean ridges using laboratory and numerical fluid
dynamics experiments. Laboratory studies at the University of Rhode Island will
involve an apparatus that uses mylar sheets to model the motion of surface
plates. Buoyancy will be provided by cooling along the top of the tank and
either the injection of fluids with different compositional densities or
localized heating along the base of the tank. Numerical experiments will
simulate 3-D thermal and compositional convection, with constant and variable
viscosity, plate driven and buoyant flow, (2) the formation and evolution of
longitudinal convection rolls in thermal and compositional convection, (3) the
effect of segmentation on convection, and (4) the role of deep mantle sources of
buoyancy.
