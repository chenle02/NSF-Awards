Dr. Daniel J. O'Leary has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. O'Leary's doctoral degree was from UCLA under the supervision of
Professor Frank Anet. Dr. O'Leary intends to continue research at Harvard
University under the sponsorship of Professor Yoshito Kishi. Dr. O'Leary's area
of postdoctoral research will be synthesis and conformational behavior of
C-glycosides related to palytoxin. Longer term, he plans to synthesize new
macromolecular systems and analyze their conformational properties by magnetic
resonance techniques. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
