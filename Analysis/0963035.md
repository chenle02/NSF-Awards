Representation theory and invariant theory have important applications to, in
particular, number theory, physics, combinatorics and geometry. This proposal
emphasizes both the analytic and the algebraic theory. The main thrust is an
extension of the analytic theory of generalized Whittaker models. These include
the Bessel models that have played an important role in the study of automorphic
forms and L-functions stemming from attempts at extending the theory of the
local Langlands correspondence to groups beyond inner twists of GL(n). The
importance of these Whittaker models is that they give a representation
theoretic interpretation of the Fourier coefficients of multivariate automorphic
forms. The mathematical literature, to date, on Bessel models studies only
models for subrepresentations of degenerate principal series. The most general
work of this type is the PI?s on previous grants. In this grant he proposes to
do a complete analysis of these models for generic principal series. The work
will be in part carried out in collaboration with his student Raul Gomez. He
expects to have solved the problem for the case of compact stabilizer before the
end of the first summer. The general case will be much harder and will be
emphasized in the next two years of the grant (after Gomez graduates). The other
work will involve more algebraic geometric problems in invariant theory
including the structure of the singular set in a semisimple Lie algebra and the
Hilbert series of rings of invariants of actions of reductive groups on affine
varieties. This work, if successful, will impact applications to geometry and
physics. General Abstract. Representations and symmetry have played key roles in
the recent solutions of some of the most profound problems in mathematics. These
include the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem and proof of The Poincar√© Conjecture
in three dimensions. The first example uses representation theory to calculate
local factors needed in the proof of a special case of the Langlands Program
known as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. The second involves the study of the
various invariants of the Riemann Curvature tensor and how they evolve under the
Ricci Flow. This proposal aims to extend the representation theory involved in
these major breakthroughs leading to applications to further developments in
number theory (more cases of the Langlands Program) , extensions of
applicability of the Ricci flow and related geometry, applications to some
amazing recent developments in Conformal Field theory related to exceptional Lie
groups.
