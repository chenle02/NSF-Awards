9730138 Silevitch This project creates a widespread implementation capacity for
the use of standards-based curricula in the New England region. The project
builds from the work initiated by the Project for the Enhancement of Science and
Mathematics Education (CESAME) at Northeastern University. Specifically, the
project: 1. Identifies, selects, develops, and supports at least seven
Curriculum Implementation Centers (CICs) at regional locations throughout New
England (Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont.) 2. Prepares the CICs to
create awareness and assist districts in the selection and implementation of
standards-based curricula. 3. Connects the CICs with physical and electronic
networks. 4. Supports the professional development of an Implementation Advisor
(IA) for each Center. 5. Identifies and develops over 100 Curriculum Trainers
(CTs) to work with teachers in participating districts. 6. Continues to use the
CESAME task force to identify emerging new programs and tools for participating
districts.
