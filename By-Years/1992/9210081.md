Atoms with two highly excited electrons display strong radial and angular
correlations, behaving much like a single quasi-particle. Earlier work is
extended which will converge to the double ionization limit as the overall size
of the system increases to infinity. The results are directly relevant to
experiments studying the double and triple ionization of atoms at low energy.
