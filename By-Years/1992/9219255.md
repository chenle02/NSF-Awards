This proposal presents a plan to study the thermodynamics of transfer of common
lipid membrane components between gel and fluid phases of a reference bilayer,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, using differential scanning calorimetry as the
primary technique. The experimental protocols involve carrying out the
measurements in very dilute solutions of the solute components in the bilayer,
and then using the regular solution model to evaluate the free energy proposed
for evaluation of the enthalpy of transfer of the solute, so that the entropy
change can also be determined. In the end a complete thermodynamic description
of the transfer process will allow comparisons between a variety of lipid
classes that are important in membrane biophysics. By systematically varying the
structures of solute molecules, a set of parameters can be devised that will
relate structural features of the solutes to the overall thermodynamic transfer
characteristics. Molecules such as the phospholipids, fatty acids, sphingolipids
and steroids will be studied. %%% Interactions between the lipid components of
biological membranes determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the
components in the membrane. Evaluation of the thermodynamics of these
interactions is fundamental to understanding the behavior of molecules in the
bilayer membrane environment. It has been difficult to devise methods to
evaluate the thermodynamic properties of membrane components because of the
limitations of models and techniques that can be used to study the interactions.
