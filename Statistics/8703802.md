This research will be on experimental designs in settings where systematic
departures from exact linear models are allowed but controlled. The study of
design problems in dimensions higher than one is facilitated greatly by
controlling the departure through the use of a stochastic process prior.
Problems with and without measurement error are of interest. Important and
interesting problems fitting the latter case arise in numerical integration and
in the selection of inputs to computer model experiments and simulations.
Algorithms for computing designs are to be devised, studied, and compared.
Prediction of linear designs are to be devised, studied and compared. Prediction
of linear functionals of the underlying regression or process will be
emphasized; non-linear functionals bring added concerns also requiring study.
The complexity of the problems and the necessity for addressing complex design
spaces leads to the need and use of advanced computational resources. The
primary goal of statistical experimental design is to assess the feasibility of
a proposed experiment and to optimize the use of resources in the experiment.
Most of current statistical theory applies to very simply configured experiments
and analysis techniques. This is so because, until the computer revolution, the
feasibility of experiments were severely limited by data collection and
computational capabilities. This research is to broaden the theory of
experimental design, to realistically apply to more modern scientific settings
where technological advances are permitting more complex questions to be studied
in controlled and controlled experiments.
