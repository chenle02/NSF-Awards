This grant will support the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' management
of the U.S. Committee for the International Institute for Applied Systems
Analysis (IIASA). IIASA, which is located in Laxenburg, Austria, is a
multinational, non-governmental institution established in 1972 to conduct
research in systems analysis, "in relation to problems of modern society arising
from scientific and technological development." A major current area of activity
is global change research, which the U.S. Committee monitors and evaluates.
Funds from the grant will support: (1) the office of the Executive Director of
the Committee at the American Academy; (2) domestic travel for Committee members
to participate in bi-annual meetings; (3) travel to IIASA for qualified U.S.
scientists as a means for addressing the Committee's objective of intensifying
involvement of the U.S. scientific community in IIASA's work; and (4)
participation of outstanding advanced U.S. graduate students in IIASA's Young
Scientist Program.
