The object of this research is to advance technology and training through
education and research in highly interdisciplinary, state-of-the-art research
thrusts. The areas of research are (1) integrated electroactive sensors, (2)
self assembled-nanostructures and (3) biochips. The key equipment acquisition
that we are seeking remains essentially intact, the SOLUTION deposition system
manufactured by CHA Industries. It will deposit noble/biocompatible metals,
refractory metals and dielectrics for fabricating ultra-thin electrodes for
polymer sensors, quantum dot formation for our innovative self-assembled
nanostructures as well as biocompatible electrodes for biochips.&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this research thrusts are (1) nano and biotechnology
research are major national initiatives, (2) integrated sensor systems pervade
industrial, medical and military systems, (3) VCU has established research
prominence in; electroactive "smart" polymers; sensors integrated with CMOS;
unique self-assembled quantum dots for quantum computing; novel implantable
biochips; living-cell-biosensors; and the electronic nose and (4) VCU's state-
of-the-art facilities provide the necessary infrastructure for accomplishing
these research goals. The broader impact of the proposed activity is that it
will: (1) provide a key new capability to an already extensive infrastructure,
(2) expand technologies available for cutting-edge undergraduate education
teaching and research, industrial partnerships and graduate research, (3)
enhance infrastructure available to industrial and academic partners, (4)
advance technological teaching and research to under-represented groups in an
urban population distribution with high gender parity and (5) benefit society as
a whole by enhancing the quality of all our lives, through technological
advances in the fundamental areas of safety, security, and health.&lt;br/&gt;
