Workshop on Analysis and Characterization of Marine Particles In the past 20
years, there has been an increasing amount of interest in suspended particulates
in seawater. There is, however, concern that the analytical and sampling
variability associated with the methods be sufficiently within control that the
important temporal and spatial variability of particles and fluxes may be
discerned. At this time there is a considerable diversity of approaches and
techniques being used by the community of active researchers in this field and
there is no single source which provides a review and catalogue of existing
methods for the characterization of marine particles. In order to remedy this
workshop on sampling and chemical analysis of marine particles will bring
together leading researchers in the field of marine particle analysis. The
object of this meeting will be to produce a monograph which will be a
comprehensive overview of the present practices, provide an effective teaching
resource for graduate level oceanography courses and be a reference for
experienced researchers.
