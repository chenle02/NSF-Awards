A grant has been awarded to Western Washington University, under the direction
of Dr Stephen Sulkin to support renovation and expantion of seawater facilities
for experimental marine research and education at Shannon Point Marine Center
(SPMC). Improvements to be made include: renovation and redesign of the sea
water tables that occupy the 900 sq ft wet laboratory that is the principal
holding area for live marine biota; new outdoor tanks in an area that receives
natural sunlight; extension of the system to provide running seawater in a room
in an existing laboratory that will become an additional instructional
laboratory; and installation of instrumentation to improve monitoring of water
quality parameters on a site-specific basis.

Provision of high quality running seawater of adequate capacity and access is
essential to virtually all of the research and instructional programs at Shannon
Point marine Center (SPMC). A proper seawater system should permit marine
science classes offered at SPMC to make collections and bring the material back
to the classroom/lab for careful study; provide us the ability to make advance
collections for main campus classes that come to SPMC on time-limited field
trips, as well as for classes coming from other colleges on field trips; allow
for the maintenance of plants and animals and for the spawning of larvae for use
in experimental research; and permit application of proper experimental design
directly in a flowing seawater environment. These are fundamental functions that
support virtually all resident and visiting scientists and students who use SPMC
as the site of their research and training activities.
