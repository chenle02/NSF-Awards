This project aims to promote research and training at the highest level in
topology and geometry. The program spans a broad area of geometry and topology.
The theory of minimal surfaces, their structure and more generally evolution of
surfaces. Riemann geometry, in particular Einstein metrics and the space of
metrics. Symplectic topology and relations to mirror symmetry, and low
dimensional topology. Homotopy theory and its ever closer ties to number theory.
Gauge theory and its applicationsto low dimensional topology. The MIT faculty
involved in this program are leaders in these areas. The program, in addition to
enhancing the research environment, will provide training and mentoring at all
levels, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates. In addition the grant
will allow the math department to support a undergraduate program for
underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry and topology remains
a major theme in present-day mathematics, and actively interacts with other
areas ranging from number theory to physics. New ideas that have entered the
subject recently have contributed to the solution of long-standing open problems
in mathematics. Moreover the areas of mathematics supported by this program
impact many areas of practical importance. Minimal surfaces and evolution of
surfaces have historically been important for material sciences, chemistry and
chemical engineering. Symplectic topology has had applications to understanding
dynamical systems and lies at the heart of current work in high energy theoretic
physics in the areas of string theory and mirror symmetry. Low dimensional
topology has had applications to problems in biology in particular quantifying
and understanding the knotted behavior of DNA as well as topological phases in
matter.
