This engineering education research project will develop a means to measure
engineering students' ability to function in a global workforce. The project
uses a technique based on situational judgment tests to determine global
competence. By creating a means to measure global competence then widely
distributing the measurement instrument, the project can help engineering degree
programs to develop effective courses and curricula that prepare students for
current, global engineering practice.

The broader significance and importance of this project arises through the need
of engineering degree programs to develop cost effective ways of preparing
students to function in a globalized workforce. By helping program evaluate
students' competence, this research can eventually lead to improvements in the
US engineering workforce. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of
transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with
new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society
by informing educational policy and practices.
