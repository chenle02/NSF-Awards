This action funds Christina Forbes of the University of Delaware to conduct a
research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the
summer of 2013 at the University of Queensland in St. Lucia, Queensland,
Australia. The project title is "Synthetic Modifications to the Cyclic Protein
Kalata B1." The host scientist is Dr. David Craik.

Cyclic peptides (cyclotides) are small proteins with a continuous circular
backbone, forming a structure that is resistant to thermal and enzymatic
degradation. Kalata B1 is a plant-derived cyclotide woven with three disulfide
bonds, creating an exceptionally stable structure with anti-HIV activity. Due to
its short sequence, there are few sites for functionalization in Kalata B1 that
do not change its core structural stability. This project broadens the potential
applications of Kalata B1 by incorporating non-natural amino acids with
bioorthogonal chemical "handles," generating a uniquely versatile and stable
platform for molecular scaffolding. These integrated "handles" can be further
modified to decorate synthetic Kalata B1 with small molecules, materials, and
proteins for applications in materials science and small molecule library
screening.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, this fellowship will establish an
international, interdisciplinary collaboration based on the design, synthesis,
and applications of modifiable cyclotides for biomolecular scaffolding. On
completion of this work, the results will be published in a peer-reviewed
journal so that other researchers may use cyclotide scaffolds in new
applications.
