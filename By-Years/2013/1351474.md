#1351474&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Amy L. Oldenburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes
to construct a novel integrated system that incorporates optical coherence
tomography (OCT), a method for visualizing cross-sections of cells in thick
tissues, with in-line digital holography to rapidly image in-plane motions near
the tissue surface. The OCT component will monitor light scattering fluctuations
from diffusing gold nanorods which act as probes of the nanotopological
environment. The holography component will capture induced surface elastic
waves, which will be reconstructed into high resolution tissue elastograms.
Integration of these imaging systems enables coregistration of driven and
diffusive motions at multiple length scales in order to relate subcellular
architecture with bulk viscoelastic properties. The proposed integrated system
will be employed to study an early-stage breast cancer tissue culture model in
which normal and pre-malignant mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are co-cultured
with stromal fibroblasts. Measuring the microscale extracellular matrix
stiffness in conjunction with nanorheological measurements in and around MECs
and stromal cells will provide new insight into the biophysical processes that
lead to breast cancer.
