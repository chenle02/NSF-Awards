The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to simplify how Americans in need of
assistance during COVID-19 obtain government benefits in a secure, safe
transaction. The platform will use new blockchain technologies for security. The
platform will streamline eligibility screening, facilitate enrollment and
expedite review timelines. Furthermore, it will enable rapid access to
disadvantaged populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an end-to-end platform using
distributed ledger technology (DLT) to facilitate transactions with the federal
government in a secure fashion. Subsequently, the platform will consolidate
redundancies into a uniform system. The proposed work will identify technical
requirements and implement DLT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
