Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;Our project builds on previous work (CCLI
9952577) to gather high quality digital videos and still photographs to enhance
environmental and water resource engineering education resources for educators.
The publication and dissemination of these materials provides educators with the
instructions to utilize these high quality digital materials in a variety of
educational settings such as overhead transparencies, PowerPoint presentations,
and computer based instructions. Our materials have the potential for use in
long distance education courses. We are providing these materials to help
educators in K-12 to foster environmental education through our "What Do
Environmental and Water Resource Engineers Design?" web site.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To obtain the digital images, we have gone on location,
photographing existing&lt;br/&gt;operations, renovations, and construction
projects at a range small to large-scale projects.&lt;br/&gt;Topics include unit
processes in water and wastewater, hydraulic structures and
open&lt;br/&gt;channel flow. We are disseminating our text and video materials
through a publisher and our Internet site.&lt;br/&gt;
