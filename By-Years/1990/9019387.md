This grant provides partial support for the Tenth International Symposium on
Environmental Biogeochemistry. The International Symposia for Environmental
Biogeochemistry, (ISEB) is an organization devoted to the advancement of the
science of biogeochemistry and to its influence on the global environment. The
goal of the ISEB is to disseminate scientific findings in biogeochemistry to the
international scientific community, thereby fostering interdisciplinary
communication and research among scientists around the globe. The field of
environmental biogeochemistry is broad and encompasses a diversity of
disciplines. The Tenth International Symposia is to be held 21- 24, August, 1991
in San Francisco and will have a focused theme, namely that of "Global Change
and the Biogeochemistry of Radiative Trace Gases." This topic is of great
concern to the international scientific community, as well as to the respective
governments.
