This SLC Catalyst project has the long-range goal of determining how integrating
the perspectives of diverse populations can improve technology design, training,
and use to enhance learning. In preparation for a full proposal, the project
will (1) conduct a meta-analysis of the existing learning technology literature
from the perspective of learner diversity (gender, ethnicity/race, socioeconomic
status, and disability); (2) convene a series of forums with small, diverse,
interdisciplinary groups designed to challenge assumptions and identify key
research strands; (3) produce three discussion documents that link the meta-
analysis with an innovative research agenda for a science of learning center;
and (4) identify final partnerships and prepare a 5-10 year strategic plan that
will form the basis for the Science of Learning Center proposal.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By defining an area of research that brings together
learning theories with diversity and technology, this project will (1) lay the
groundwork for understanding learning technologies within a social context, and
(2) introduce diversity theories into learning theory. It will define what this
implies for the development of new technologies that support learning among a
wide range of learners. The project will influence research in such areas as
computer mediated communication, online learning, and learning technology
development. It will build strong partnerships with business, policymakers, and
both formal and community-based education that will develop a national agenda
for integrating diversity to improve technology-based learning, especially for
currently underrepresented populations.&lt;br/&gt;
