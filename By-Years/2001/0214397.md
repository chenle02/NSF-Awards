This grant provides support to University of Wyoming seismologists to reformat,
place on modern media and make accessible via the internet, common depth point
(CDP) and vertical seismic profiles (VSP) collected within the Kola borehole
drilled in Russia (the deepest borehole in the world). All of this data will be
made freely available to the broader scientific community through the IRIS Data
Management System (DMS). ***
