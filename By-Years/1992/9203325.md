This project is a continuation of the PI's numerical model work on the Leeuwin
Current off western Australia. The primary goal of the numerical experiments is
to study the roles of seasonal ocean thermal forcing and seasonal wind forcing
in the observed seasonal structure of the Leeuwin Current. Extensions of
previous work include the incorporation into the model of bottom topography and
continuously-forced and seasonally varying thermal and wind forcing.
