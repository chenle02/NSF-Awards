The University of South Florida's "YES - WE CARE|" program, started in 1983,
increases suitably prepared and motivated minority high school graduates for
studies of science and engineering. The University currently operates four
centers, the last started in January 1991. In this 30 week Saturday morning
academic enrichment program, 6th through 12th grade minority students receive
mathematics, science, computers, and engineering projects instruction from
certified teachers and "role model" volunteer minority engineers. The program is
a community effort involving the University, county school boards, industry, and
the minority community. In early 1990 the program was selected to be one of
Florida's "Programs of Excellence" ("a program ... that could be
promoted...statewide.") "YES - WE CARE|" was conceived to operate de-centralized
with minimal administrative hierarchy. In October 1990 the enrollment was 137
students. To realize the full growth potential of the program (higher retention
rate and expansion to new communities) is requiring one-time efforts to
strengthen instructional materials, develop proper diagnostic tests, provide
additional teacher training, document the program's operation, and improve
public relations and parental and community involvement. The NSF award is
allowing for the implementation of these improvements.
