With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Duquesne University will acquire a
Beowulf cluster. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including a) the theoretical prediction and ultimate synthesis of small
nonprotein agents that control gene expression through site-specific binding and
induced bending of DNA; b) development of new materials in nanotechnology; and
c) development of a solution to carbon dioxide sequestration.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast, modern computer workstations is vital
to serving the computing needs of active research departments. Such a "computer
network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and
supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. These
studies will have a significant impact in a wide number of areas, including
biochemistry, materials science and environmental chemistry.
