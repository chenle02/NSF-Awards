This project focuses on the study of collisions of polarized electrons with
chiral molecules, metastable states of noble gas targets, and ground-state
targets of the same atom. The experiments address basic physics questions about
the dynamics of electron-molecule and electron-atom scattering, particularly
with regard to electron-spin-dependent effects. A strong effort in the
development of improved sources of polarized electrons and electron polarimeters
accompanies the basic research component.
