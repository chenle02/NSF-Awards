This action funds Kyana Young of University of Wisconsin - Madison to conduct a
research project, entitled "Detection of Harmful Disinfectants Caused by Water
Treatment" during the summer of 2012 at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou,
Guangdong, China. The host scientist is Dr. Yang Xin.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in understanding and
mitigating risks as a result of inadequate treatment of water where and when an
established water infrastructure is unavailable, for example, post war and post
natural disaster situations.

A point-of-use treatment device that uses a photoelectrocatalytic oxidation
(PECO) method can generate chlorine to purify water. However, when treating
natural water which contains naturally-occurring organic matter (NOM) and
heavily contaminated water to provide drinking water, disinfection by-products
(DBP) must be monitored to ensure that potentially harmful chemicals are not
produced or do not remain in the drinking water. In this research, raw water
samples from five regions in China are being treated with the treatment device
and tested for the presence of DBPs formed during treatment. Analytical
techniques include gas chromatography and membrane introduction mass
spectrometry.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
