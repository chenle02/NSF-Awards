The goal of this project is to identify ethical practices for large open data
research projects. It will contribute to creating networks for Indigenous
scholars and community members, data managers and social scientists to develop
processes and guidelines for databases that ensure data collection, storage, and
dissemination are done in ethical ways for stakeholders. The project will engage
scientists and community members working with data stored in the National
Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) database as a pilot effort. The projectâ€™s
outcomes will be of interest to researchers, community members, policy makers
and educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to develop
processes and guidelines that are applicable across Earth science data
repositories and address Indigenous Data topics in each stage of the data and
specimen lifecycle (i.e. collection, storage, publication, citation, re-use). In
this incubation phase, the project will rely on working group interactions and
use a participatory research framework to develop guidelines that can be applied
broadly across Earth science research and open data repositories. Throughout
planning and implementation, the project will connect to the people and
institutions in the Rising Voices Network to build a robust collaboration of
participants that includes Indigenous scholars, educators, and community leaders
as well as atmospheric, social, ecological, and data
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
