The addition of a multichannel seismograph to the Department of Geological
Sciences allows undergraduate students to acquire high quality, high resolution
seismic reflection and refraction data. Subsequent data reduction and analysis
gives students the ability to determine subsurface earth structure. The
resulting high resolution subsurface images are used in water resource,
