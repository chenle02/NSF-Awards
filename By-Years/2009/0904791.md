This award was funded through the Social and Behavioral Dimensions of National
Security, Conflict, and Cooperation competition, a joint venture between NSF and
the Department of Defense.

This project seeks to understand four critical recent changes in the process and
outcomes of war termination in both civil and interstate armed conflicts:
military victory has become less common, formal peace treaties have become less
common in interstate war but more common in civil war, military and political
outcomes of war have diverged, and clauses of war guilt are much more common
today. These changes have been largely ignored by scholars, but may do more to
hinder than to help the long-term prospects for peace. This project examines the
implications of changing strategies of violence for war termination. The
investigators will derive and test hypotheses linking strategies and conditions
such as guerrilla warfare, international intervention, peacekeeping, and laws
regulating the conduct of war to the process and outcomes of war termination.
This research will be based on an unusually comprehensive dataset that spans two
centuries with extensive and comparable measures for both interstate and civil
wars.
