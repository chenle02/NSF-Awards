X-ray diffraction techniques, both powder and single crystal, are important
components of modern geology, chemistry and physics curricula. X-ray
fluorescence and powder diffraction as analytical tools are absolutely essential
to the field of geology. The advent of solid state materials such as
semiconductors and thinly coated substrates makes X- ray analysis an even more
integral part of chemistry and physics than it was in the past. The existing
teaching and research X-ray facility at Hope College has recently been remodeled
and refitted to update the powder facility and to expand the capabilities to
include single crystal photographic techniques. The modernized unit, which is a
state-of-the-art teaching and research facility, is being utilized by students
in five geology courses, two chemistry courses and one course in physics. The
facility is also being used for undergraduate research activities.
