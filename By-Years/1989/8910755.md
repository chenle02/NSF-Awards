This proposal examines how to combine the results of database models with the
intuitive predictions of experts. The project requests funding for the
development of a theoretical model and for two field site studies, using buyers
in retail chains, that will compare different methods of combining models and
experts' forecasts. These methods are based both on mechanical (rule-based)
combinations and on various types of interactive procedures that allow for the
on-line adjustment of model forecasts by experts. The topic is inherently
complex, due to difficulties associated with developing an operational
definition of intuition and the significance of situational factors in
understanding how to do a better job of extracting knowledge from experts.
However, the proposed studies are well defined and relate clearly to earlier
work in the field. Moreover, the utility of the project is considered to be very
high: the use of large databases by managers, and decision models calibrated on
them, continues to grow but there is very little theoretical basis for providing
guidance on how to combine the results of these models with experts' intuitions.
Thus, the contribution of this project to forecasting practice and to the theory
of knowledge-base construction could be considerable.
