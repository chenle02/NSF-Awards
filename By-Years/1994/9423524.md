With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Finlayson-Pitts of
the University of California, Irvine will investigate the reaction between ozone
and organic monolayers at the air-water interface. These fundamental studies
will provide the information necessary for future elaboration and understanding
of this area which has significance in both environmental and medical fields.
The air-water interface is prevalent in biological and environmental systems. It
is proposed that the chemistry at these boundaries will be unique relative to
either of the components (i.e., air or water). Thus, a clearer understanding of
the fundamental processes which occur at this type of interface will be
beneficial to mankind as ozone damage to human tissue is a major issue.
