University of Massachussetts - Amherst has several researchers who would
benefit from access to supercomputing. Through this grant for connection to
NSFNET, they will be able to access six federally-funded supercomputing centers
which are linked by the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). The campus
will be connected by a medium speed (56,000 baud per second) communication line
to the JVNC network as part of a New England extension to their already existing
consortium network. This communication line as well as the gateway/router will
be provided by the John von Neumann Center through a supplemental grant to their
current award. Network management service will also be provided by JVNC.
