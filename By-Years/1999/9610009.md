9610009 Businger This project is part of the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol
Characterization Experiment (ACE-2) which will be conducted in June and July,
1997 over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic Ocean as an international
collaborative effort. The main objectives of ACE-2 are to study the properties
of atmospheric aerosols relevant to radiative forcing and climate using
aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements. In a prior NSF-supported
project led by this PI, smart tetroons were developed and tested whose altitude
could be controlled through variable ballasting achieved using an expandable
balloon inside a pressurized constant volume tetroon. Smart tetroons were
deployed successfully during the field phase of the ACE-1 experiment in 1995 to
track air parcels. Smart balloon track information is provided through an
onboard GPS receiver and pressure, temperature, humidity and rainfall sensors
which collect additional data that are transmitted along with the position data
to a research aircraft. The motivation for the development of this capability
was to use the instrumented smart tetroons for data collection and tracking in
Lagrangian chemistry and boundary layer physics experiments without the threat
of balloon loss through groundings. In this project, the next generation smart
balloon will be developed and constructed. The transponder will be enhanced with
the addition of two-way communications. This will allow the operating parameters
and the altitude control strategy to be adjusted from the aircraft during an
experiment, and provide for more efficient data transmission via radio. To
overcome the effects of precipitation loading and to extend the pressure range
of the balloon in general, the superpressure smart balloon will be constructed
from a new fabric which affords a tenfold larger dynamic lift range than the
original fabric. The new balloon will also have a spherical shape which provides
improved surface area to volume ratio. The instrument package, pumps, and
transponder design will be integrated with the new balloon and undergo tests
prior to deployment in field experiments.
