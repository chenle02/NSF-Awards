This award supports cooperative research between Dr. Robert Buchanan,
University of California at Berkeley, and Professors Wu Minxian and Shi Jiaonai,
Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology, on catalytic proteins in carbon
metabolism in plants. The regulation of plant cystolic enzymes which function in
line with photosynthetic processes is not yet well understood. Through this
collaborative project, experts in two fields essential to improving
understanding of this regulatory system will contribute to ongoing research
between these two laboratories which has already yielded improved understanding
of the chloroplast thioredoxin system. This research is supported under the
U.S.-China Protocol on Cooperation in Basic Sciences.
