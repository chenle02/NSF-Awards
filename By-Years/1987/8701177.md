A Grant to help support a Gordon Conference on Statistics in Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering is recommended at $3,000 out of FY87 funds. This conference
will provide an excellent opportunity for the interchange of ideas between three
disciplines. Research statisticians will be exposed to important real problems
in chemistry and chemical engineering, applied chemists and statisticians will
learn firsthand about new statistical methods that can be used in their work,
and research chemists and chemical engineers can test their statistical ideas
with statisticians.
