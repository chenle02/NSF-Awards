9402161 Pitnick This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Scott Pitnick of
Arizona State University in a research collaboration with Prof. Edward Pfeiler
of the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Guaymas
campus. The investigators intend to use allozyme variability of four cactophilic
Drosophila species, endemic to the Sonoran Desert, to characterize the genetic
structure of all four species and to compare the genetic structure of each
species at different seasons in the context of resource availability. They will
also examine the relationship between genotype and differential tolerance to
thermal extremes. The four Drosophila species endemic to the Sonoran Desert have
been an important model for studies of ecological genetics. Their usefulness,
however, has been limited by the lack of knowledge of the genetic structure of
these populations and how genetic structure varies with resource availability
and with season. The proposed work, through complementary use of facilities and
expertise, will increase our understanding of the field. ***
