This research focuses on the development of computational tools for analyzing
and comparing sequences. An important aspect of this work is the collaboration
with scientists in the biological sciences. Particular emphasis will be placed
on the development of computational tools for the detection of multiple repeated
regions and tandem repeats in both DNA and protein sequences. These regions are
very important as they have been associated with regulatory, stabilizing, and
evolutionary sites. Many such repeated regions are difficult to detect because
the repetitions are inexact, sometimes exhibiting a low percentage of identical
symbols. An analysis will be conducted to gain more insight into the difficult
problem of determining the threshold for statistical significance of such
repeats. The efficient identification of multiple repeats requires a subtle
similarity measure. This will require the identification and representation of
optimal as well as near optimal alignments between subsequences. An empirical
comparative study will be conducted to assess the applicability and significance
of the new algorithms. Interactive activities include teaching a seminar to
encourage a dialogue between students from different disciplines; visiting local
high schools; organizing group meetings with undergraduate interns; and
interacting with the graduate students; participating in journal clubs,
colloquium and seminars; and engaging in joint research with other members of
the Biochemistry, Medical Informatics and Genome Center at Stanford University.
