A Bayesian Decision Model for Process Development Based on Cost and Quality
Outcomes Abstract Automobile manufacturers currently use two approaches to
determine when to accept a production tool: Conformance to Specifications (the
tool produces products within design specifications) and Functional Build (the
tool produces products that function as the customer expects). This project will
develop an analytic framework for deciding which of these is appropriate, and
the associated policies for optimal tool testing before using the tool in a
production setting. The objective of this research is to provide manufacturers
with a decision tool, based on available cost of quality data from existing
accounting systems, that will reduce total manufacturing costs. This is in
contrast to current accounting practices, which drive separate cost centers
within a large organization to suboptimize performance relative to their own
budget. Thus, the decision models developed by this research will cut across
organizational boundaries to provide manufacturing firms with optimal financial
and quality results. The first phase of the research will benchmark die buyoff.
This will allow identification of the metrics (financial and quality) currently
used to track process development. The output of this initial research will be a
set of die construction and product quality performance measures that will form
the framework of the decision model. The second phase of the research will focus
on the development of methods for obtaining and tracking the performance
measures previously identified. The third phase will represent the construction
of models, combining methods from decision analysis, Bayesian statistics, and
accounting systems, to focus on developing the methodology that optimizes the
decision process for the entire organization.
