DMS 9626819 Wolpert Bayesian hierarchical models are introduced to account for
uncertainty and spatial variation in the underlying intensity measure for point
process models. Inhomogeneous gamma process random fields and, more generally,
Markov random fields with infinitely-divisible distributions are used to
construct positively autocorrelated intensity measures for spatial Poisson point
processes, used in turn to model the number and location of individual events. A
data augmentation scheme and Markov chain Monte Carlo numerical methods are
employed to generate samples from Bayesian posterior and predictive
distributions. The methods are developed in both continuous and discrete
settings, and are applied to problems in forest ecology and other fields.
Spatial patterns are an important aspect of statistical data in many fields of
investigation-- disease mapping, where spatial patterns may help us learn about
causes or patterns of susceptibility to specific diseases; agriculture, where
spatial patterns, influenced by soil types, economics, and regional agricultural
traditions, may help us predict yield; and forest management, where spatial
patterns help us learn about past land-use and help us anticipate problems (for
example, susceptibility to insect infestations) and management opportunities
(the harvesting of overly populous species). The present research exploits
recent advances in computing hardware and algorithms and in mathematical
probability theory to develop new and better statistical models and numerical
algorithms for exploring spatial pattern data. The new statistical models and
numerical algorithms are applied to problems in the Environment (studying
changing patterns of forest speciation and biodiversity in this Federal
Strategic Area), Disease Mapping, and Transportation Theory (helping to predict
commuter traffic flow in an evolving urban environment, supporting the Federal
Strategic Area of Civil Infrastructure).
