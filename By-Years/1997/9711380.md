The goal is to develop a computer system to support geographically separated
researchers performing cooperative experimental research in robotics. This
system uses vision techniques under the control of smart planners to acquire a
visual model (combining 3-D data and texture maps) of the physical environment
where the experiment takes place. It provides real-time graphic renderings of
the experiments on the researchers' graphic workstations along individually
selected viewpoints. Hence, each researcher is able to OBSERVE the experiments
using his/her own controllable virtual camera. The initial exploration will
focus on one major component of the envisioned system, the automatic
construction of a 3-D model of an experimental robotic site. This will be used
to analyze basic issues that will also be encountered in the other components of
the envisioned system, in particular the effect of uncertainty on the
interaction between a user and a remote experimental site. This is a
collaborative effort between R. Bajcsy of the GRASP laboratory at the University
of Pennsylvania and J. C. Latombe at Stanford University.
