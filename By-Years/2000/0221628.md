This is a three-year research project to understand the role of convection in
forcing equatorial waves, and the effects of these waves on the dynamics of the
middle atmosphere. The tool to be adopted for this investigation is the National
Center for Atmospheric Research's Whole Atmosphere Climate/Chemistry Model
(WACCM), a comprehensive numerical model spanning the range of altitude from the
Earth's surface to the lower thermosphere. The focus of the project are the
equatorial waves, forced in the tropical troposphere by transient convection
heating, that propagate upward into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower
thermosphere. It is expected that this project will have broad impact on
theoretical, numerical and observational aspects of wave propagation, dynamics,
and chemical composition of the middle atmosphere.
