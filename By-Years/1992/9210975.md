Dataflow analysis techniques which lead to better compilation comprise the
focus of this project. These are applied to high performance Prolog as well as
concurrent logic languages and wide-spectrum languages. First techniques for
recognizing dead data structures are verified and prototyped and then
compilation methods which utilize them are developed. Then these as well as
techniques for detecting single-consumer data structures and deadlock are
applied to concurrent logic languages and wide-spectrum languages. A theoretical
methodology for power comparison is then applied.
