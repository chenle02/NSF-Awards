The goal of this research is to develop mathematical principles and new
methodologies for problems in and applications of digital image processing, and
study their associated mathematical foundations. The emphasis is on combining
partial differential equation (PDE) techniques with multi-resolution wavelet
representations. In particular, we focus on two different image processing
applications: wavelet inpainting (filling in missing or damaged wavelet
coefficients), and PDE image compression. To achieve the tasks, we will
integrate several high level mathematical tools including geometrical PDE's,
multi-resolution harmonic analysis and variational frameworks together with some
state-of-the-art engineering methods in image coding, such as group testing
wavelet (GTW) algorithms for image compression. The key is to exploit the power
of multi-resolution properties of wavelets while at the same time use PDE
techniques to systematically and explicitly control the geometrical information
in the image so that salient features, such as edges and corners, can be
recovered in the reconstructions. Efficient computation algorithms will be
designed and analyzed.

Image compression and inpainting are two typical tasks of image processing. Due
to the large number of pixels of digital images, most of them have to be stored
in compressed format. The current international compression standard (JPEG2000),
which is largely based on wavelet representation, is one of the most popular
schemes. Image compression has been used everywhere in our daily life, examples
include images transmitted on the Internet, wireless communications, medical
images (such as MRI), satellite images. Efficient compression methods are highly
desirable and the universal goal is to represent the most salient features
(typically geometrical structures) using minimal possible resources. This is one
of the objectives of this project. Image inpainting refers to automatic
procedures to fill in incomplete, missing or damaged image information. Such
loss is often unavoidable in many applications such as wireless transmission,
intelligence, homeland security (airports' screening), robotic path finding in
unknown environment, three-dimensional object reconstruction from two-
dimensional medical images. Because many digital images are stored in wavelet
formats, and damages to such formatted images correspond to loss of wavelet
coefficients, wavelet inpainting demands special attention. Again, a key
objective in filling in the missing information is to restore missing
geometrical properties. We will investigate new models and methods for wavelet
inpainting and related mathematical theories.
