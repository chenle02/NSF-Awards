This project is mathematical research in ergodic theory, which studies the
average behavior, over the long run, of transformations or groups of
transformations acting on an appropriate underlying space. More specifically,
Professor Robinson will investigate joinings of ergodic group actions, with two
main objectives in mind. The first is to see how joinings lift to extensions; a
result of this will be new lifting theorems for ergodic mixing properties. The
second part of the project seeks to construct or identify new examples of group
actions with interesting joining properties.
