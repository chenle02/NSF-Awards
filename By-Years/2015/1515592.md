This project is aimed at investigation of collective behavior of large groups of
individual agents that is typified by swarming. In addition to its intrinsic
scientific value, understanding collective behavior observed in nature (such as
in flocks of birds and schools of fish) is expected to facilitate the ability to
control technological swarms in the form of nanoparticles delivering drugs or
micro-robots performing assemblies and conducting searches. There is a variety
of models that provide superficially similar output, that is, they all generate
some sort of collective motion. However, there is a lack of studies that
distinguish among swarming models and determine their relevance with respect to
experimental observations. This project develops a bridge between different
mathematical tools to describe swarming behavior and experimentally relevant
measures of such behavior in application fields ranging from biology to robotics
and from marketing to opinion formation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;For many common
mathematical models, characterizations of swarms are elementary (for example,
flocking or milling) and are based on simple global quantities (that is, average
velocity or angular momentum). In contrast, this project focuses on more complex
observables unveiling key attributes of swarms and swarming models. For
instance, the speed of information propagation is crucial in swarming to avoid
obstacles or predators and can be characterized through the analysis of
different types of traveling waves. Similarly, interaction with boundaries and
other swarms generate internal excitations in the form of standing waves.
Connecting swarming behavior and observables requires investigating both micro-
and macro-scales. Therefore, this project will combine tools from information
theory and statistical physics (micro-models) with the analysis of partial
differential equations (macro-models).
