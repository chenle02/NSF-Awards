9415371 Jannasch The principal objective of this project is to study the major
growth characteristics of those microorganisms that are actively growing and
mineralizing organic carbon in the deep-sea. The project will test the
hypothesis whether adaptation to in situ temperature and pressure (psychrophily
and barophily) of deep-sea bacteria are invariant with nutrition. More
specifically, whether oligotrophy (adaptation to growth at extremely low
nutrient levels) and barophily are metabolically linked in the microbial deep-
sea flora. Earlier observations during the last research period with batch
culture studies at various pressures and with continuos culture studies at 1
Atm, resulted in data that clearly indicated an effect of substrate
concentration on barophilic activity. The data also demonstrated the need for
working with typical oligotrophic bacteria in the presence of substrate
concentrations lower than those inherent to batch culture and the need to carry
out growth experiments in steady state cultures under pressure. To this end a
new pressurizable chemostat has been designed and constructed. This project will
employ existing pressure equipment in combination with the new capability to
enrich for deep-sea bacteria at low substrate levels in the pressurized
chemostat. The pressurizable chemostat will be used to obtain deep-sea samples
in the absence of decompression for the isolation of truly oligotrophic
barophiles. The significance of this work lies in the fact that the microbial
turnover of the largest portion of dissolved organic carbon in the biosphere,
the oceanic portion, is unknown. Data clarifying the metabolic strategies of the
adapted deep-sea bacteria will be of great value for calculation of the global
carbon cycle. ***
