Hybrid offspring are often sterile, and the genetic causes of this reproductive
isolation provide clues about how new species originate. This project will use
the house mouse to study the genetics and evolution of hybrid sterility. House
mouse species are relatively young, making it possible to understand the
genetics of an important reproductive barrier at an early stage in the
speciation process. Genetic mapping will be used to identify regions of the
genome that cause hybrid male sterility between species of house mice. The rate
at which DNA is exchanged across natural hybrid zones will be measured to test
the prediction that the hybrid sterility regions cause species to remain
distinct. The evolutionary relationships of house mouse species will be
reconstructed using new genome sequences and statistical tools.

This research will advance understanding of the genetic basis of speciation and
fertility. This work will set the stage for identifying specific genes involved
in speciation using the powerful resources that are available for house mice.
Many of the same genes affect fertility in mice and humans, so results from this
project could point to genes that contribute to male infertility in humans. Two
post-doctoral researchers will be trained through participation in this project.
Additionally, information from the project will be incorporated to develop an
internet tutorial on the process of speciation that will be distributed for use
by high school biology teachers.
