This project supports the activities including technical meetings of a U.S.
Planning Group to develop a comprehensive research plan for a U.S. Japan
Cooperative Structural Control Research Program. This effort will be concerned
with a new generation of `intelligent` aseismic structural control systems
suitable for strong earthquake loads. The activities of the U.S. Planning Group
will parallel those of the Japan Planning Group which are already in progress in
response to an effort supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science. This project is a part of the on-going activities of the U.S. Panel on
Structural Control Research, a group created to provide technical coordination
and guidance to NSF's initiative on structural control research.
