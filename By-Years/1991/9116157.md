This three-year award supports cooperative research between Thomas C. Halsey of
the University of Chicago and Bertrand Duplantier of the Theoretical Physics
Laboratory at the French National Center for Scientific Research, Saclay. The
investigators will cooperate on problems in condensed matter physics of
disordered, fractal geometric systems. Utilizing partial differential equations
expressed in terms of random walkers, they will study problems involving
conductivity, pattern formation in corrosion and surface impedance at rough
semiconductor-metal interfaces. Dr. Halsey brings to this collaboration
experience in numerical work and scaling arguments for the behavior of random
walks near rough surfaces. He has developed a number of fast numerical
algorithms to address these problems. This is complemented by the French
investigator's analytical background and mathematical techniques in generating
exact results. Their combined efforts in numerics, scaling and exact results
will contribute to the solution of these problems. It will also advance our
understanding of the basic physics and chemistry involved in electrical
conductivity, corrosion and surface interactions.
