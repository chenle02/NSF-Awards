The project focuses on the management storage and analysis of large scientific
databases. A cornerstone of the activity is the Karhunen-Loeve procedure which
in a mathematically well defined sense provides an intrinsic and ideal
representation for many forms of scientific data. The development of the
snapshot method allows this procedure to be applied to hitherto unmanageably-
large databases. This method is applied to the following cases: optical imaging
of cortical activity using fluorescent dyes; a new simulation of the turbulent
jet; and sea surface measurements obtained by telemetric means. Each of these
cases leads to gigabyte or larger datasets. Lossy and lossless data encoding
techniques are developed and melded in this project. New methods, including the
wavelet and Wigner transform are developed for the visualization and
presentation of large databases. Application of these methods to on-the-fly data
acquisition and compression of large datasets is investigated. Results of this
project will provide a set of tools which will make possible the collection,
compaction, analysis, rapid exploration, visualization, progressive browsing and
communication of exceedingly large databases of the sort encountered in
engineering, pattern recognition and electrophysiology.
