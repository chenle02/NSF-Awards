This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award
is to advance the manufacture, the fundamental understanding, and the device
application of graphene-nanocrystal metamaterials or hybrid graphene-nanocrystal
structures, i.e., graphene sheets with discrete nanocrystals decorations on
their surfaces. Specific tasks to be performed include experimental and
theoretical characterization of the metamaterials, particularly electronic and
physical interactions between nanocrystals and graphene sheets with various
external stimuli; investigation of methods for low-cost and large-scale
manufacturing of such materials; and exploration of their use for gas sensors.
The availability of affordable hybrid nanostructures and their fundamental
properties will open up new opportunities for nanoscience and nanotechnology and
accelerate discoveries and inventions. The synergistic response from the
nanocrystal and the graphene can be harnessed for various innovative device
applications, including gas sensors, biosensors, and photovoltaic cells.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the project results will enable a wide
range of innovative applications of graphene-nanocrystal metamaterials with
optimal properties that can be tailored for specific conditions. The new sensor
to be demonstrated will be attractive for environmental monitoring and directly
benefit society. The project will train both graduate and undergraduate students
in areas of graphene engineering and applications, and will reach the broader
student population through a course module on hybrid nanostructures, integration
of small nanotechnology projects into existing curricula at both UWM and UT, and
training of science teachers. Additional efforts through "Science Saturdays"
will be used to attract more underrepresented students to STEM fields.
