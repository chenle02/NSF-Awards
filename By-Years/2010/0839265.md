This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for development of
Nanospring mats for electrodes in next generation ultracapacitors. The mats have
high surface area for integration into ultracapacitor devices.

The high specific power of ultracapacitors coupled with their ability to be
rapidly charged and the potential for lightweight structures make these devices
of significant interest for automotive applications in hybrid and fully electric
vehicles.
