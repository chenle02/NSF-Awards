9303444 Fink We are the first group to identify a novel, 5S rRNA like sequence
present in the genomes of sporulating bacteria like Bacillus species. Analysis
of the functional significance of this sequence may reveal a mechanism for
transnational control of bacterial gene expression, which has not been examined
in great detail. We will use molecular genetic techniques to assess the
functional significance of this sequence. This work has the following three
objective: 1) To examine the expression of the 5S rRNA like gene in B. subtilis
cells. We will use northern hybridization to detect the level of 5S rRNA like
material present before and during sporulation. h h # 2) ( To determine the
nucleotide sequence of the 5S rRNA like gene from B. Subtilis cells. From a
library of B. subtilis DNA, we will isolate a clone containing the 5S rRNA like
region and discern the nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA. 3) To identify the
genetic location of the 5S rRNA like gene in B. subtilis and to study its
biological significance. We will map the gene by genetic crosses and attempt to
delete this chromosomal region to study effects on the cell. %%% The results of
this small grant for Exploratory Research may lead to a general model for
transnational regulation in differentiating bacterial cells. ***
