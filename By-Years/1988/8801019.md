In contemporary African nations, men and women often adapt differently to the
post-colonial world. While much is known about male responses, women's
institutional responses have received less attention. To remedy this situation,
the researcher will look at Hausa female healers who belong to the Bori
possession cult in Niger. She will analyze cultural, social, and health related
aspects in order to discover how the cult has historically adapted to recent
changes in Niger. This research will establish how increasingly women in West
African societies utilize health related voluntary associations in order to
stabilize their social and power positions in rapidly changing situations. Women
are a major economic and social force in Hausa society. Hausa cultural influence
is pervasive and extends beyond Niger, from Nigeria to Egypt. Understanding the
behavior of Hausa women is thus crucial to understanding all of northern Africa.
