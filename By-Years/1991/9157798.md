As a PYI awardee, Dr. Humphrey will quantitate the mechanical characteristics of
blood vessels. The work will compare experimental data obtained in excised blood
vessels with those predicted by a mathematical analysis of the vessel mechanics.
The research will lead to a better understanding of the mechanical
characteristics of living tissues, and should eventually lead to the development
of better tissue substitutes.
