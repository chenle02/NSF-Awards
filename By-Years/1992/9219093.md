PI and collaborators will conduct a carbon isotopic study to locate the
Paleocene/Eocene boundary, by its postulated carbon isotope excursion, in the
classic marine and non-marine sections in northwestern Europe. This boundary
marks an important paleoceanographic and paleobiologic shift, currently the
focus of interest for a large group. This study will also facilitate attempts to
reconstruct depositional history of the European basins in a sequence
stratigraphic framework. Detailed sampling of sections in Paris and Belgian
basins will be followed by isotopic analyses of soil carbonates, marine micro-
and macrofossils. Microfossil correlation will use DSDP Site 550 on Goban Spur,
which also provides a carbon isotope-reference section.
