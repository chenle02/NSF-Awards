Molecular hydrogen is the main constituent of the atmospheres of the gas giant
planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The relative abundances of ortho-
and parahydrogen are inferred from the ratio of the observed strengths of pure-
rotation, vibrational-overtone, and Raman-scattering transitions involving the
rotational levels J = 1 (ortho) and J = 0 (para). At most altitudes and
latitudes the ortho/para ratio is not in statistical equilibrium at the local
temperature, which is interpreted as resulting from vertical and horizontal
transport from lower hotter or colder regions. Modeling atmospheric circulation
requires a quantitative understanding of the rates and mechanisms of ortho-para
conversion, which appears to take roughly 30 to 100 years.

The two candidate mechanisms are collisions with paramagnetic aerosols and with
the weak magnetic moment of ortho-H2. The better known mechanisms involving ions
or Hatoms or four-center bimolecular atom exchange are inoperative at the
relevant low altitudes and low temperatures. An important constraint on
atmospheric models could be provided by a quantum mechanical treatment of
nuclear spin coupling in collisions of ortho-H2 with ortho- and para-H2. To
provide a quantitative basis for interpretation of atmospheric observations, Dr.
David Huestis will perform quantum mechanical calculations of cross sections and
temperature-dependent rates for ortho-para conversion in collisions of H2 with
H2, including electronic structure, matrix elements of Hamiltonian operators
involving nuclear spin, and coupled-channels quantum dynamics.

A broader impact of this research is that it will contribute to advancement of
discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning
through participation of a postdoctoral fellow, graduate, and undergraduate
students. An additional broader impact of the proposed work is its fundamental
nature as an unsolved problem in quantum mechanics and chemical kinetics. ***
