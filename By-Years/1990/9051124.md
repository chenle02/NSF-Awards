Through the purchase of and development of related courses and experiments,
Knox College has expanded and modernized its chemistry curriculum The
acquisition of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer has allowed the creation of
an innovative and comprehensive laboratory to accompany the new Environmental
Chemistry lecture course. Ion chromatographic equipment, atmospheric sampling
devices, and alternate gas chromatographic detectors were also acquired and
implemented within the laboratory portion of the environmental course. The
flexibility of the GC/MS is permitting its usage to fortify several other
laboratory offerings. A new Inorganic Chemistry course and a revised Organic
Chemistry feature spectral characterization of synthetic products using the
GC/MS and existing spectroscopic instruments. The Instrumental Analysis
laboratory has been updated by adding contemporary GC/MS experiments while
trimming usage of several out-of-date instruments. Undergraduate research is
employing the GC/MS and its spectral library on a routine basis for structural
identification and verification. The institution contributed an amount equal to
the NSF funds to the project.//
