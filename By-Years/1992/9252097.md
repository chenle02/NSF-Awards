The Center serves a variety of lower division biology classes, with a current
focus on the non-science major including elementary education majors. A key
objective of the Center is to create a positive and literate approach to science
among these students. Studies of molecular biology are used as the basis of
advancing understanding of biological principles. Equipment includes computers
for data analysis and electrophoresis systems for data generation.
