As graphs are widely used to represent entities and relationships in
information, social, biological, and cyber-physical systems, knowledge generated
from graph analytics is crucial to the success of sciences, commerce, health
care, and national security. In graph analytics systems, input/output (IO)
remains the main research challenge because graph processing requires a
relatively small amount of CPU cycles. This research investigates multiple
facets of the IO challenge from cache, memory to disks. The proposed research
delivers IO-efficient computer systems for graph analytics, advancing the state
of the art in this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research produces a
comprehensive performance analysis of graph analytics systems. A novel IO
architecture for graph data and metadata is developed to efficiently utilize IO
bandwidth of underlying storage devices and maximize the hit ratios in memory
and caches. New designs of graph systems deliver transformative innovations in
the area of big data processing. During the course of this project,
undergraduate and graduate students, especially under-represented students,
participate in computer systems and big data research. In addition, the PI
mentors students in local high schools and collaborates with industry.
