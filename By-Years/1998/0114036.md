The goal of this research project is to develop new techniques to handle
uncertainty in object-oriented dynamic databases. The approach consists of
developing a new data model and associated algebra; developing query
optimization techniques for inexact queries; and development of indexing methods
to support probabilistic uncertainty in dynamic databases. This research effort
develops new theory, tools and technology to support various types of
probabilistic uncertainty in object-oriented dynamic databases. The experimental
research is linked to spatial databases with applications in the field of
Geographic Information Systems. By adding support for uncertainty in database
management systems, this research project will substantially increase the power
and flexibility of database management in a broad class of business, social,
scientific and engineering endeavors where uncertainty is measured and used.
