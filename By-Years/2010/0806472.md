This S-STEM project supports scholarships for academically talented and
financially needy students in mathematics, sciences and computing. This project
builds on lessons learned from a previous CSEMS project to provide a learning
environment producing highly qualified scholars who will contribute to a 21st
century workplace. This project aggressively recruits scholars from area high
schools, two-year colleges, and universities. In addition, the project supports
a bridge program for scholars between the participating community colleges and
the university. The project advertises the scholarships through brochures,
posters, a website, and meetings with math and science teachers in regional high
schools. The recruited student population has high financial need and includes a
large percentage of underrepresented groups. An Advisory Committee of university
and community college faculty from targeted disciplines selects the scholars
each semester and serves as advisors for the scholars. The project creates
community among the scholars through required participation in a tailored
learning community and in a yearly one-hour project course where the scholars
work for a mock company to produce a marketable product. Fields trips and
speakers provide the scholars with exposure to industry professionals.
