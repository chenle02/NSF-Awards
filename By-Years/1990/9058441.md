Intelligently assessing relevance is a central issue in AI. Whether in
diagnosis, problem solving, or explanation, AI systems must determine the
information in a database that isrelevant to the task. Assessing relevance is
difficult because it depends on context. This work focuses on resoning
symbolically about relevance of cases or features in context in a
computationally tractable way. Integrating expanded domain theories, where such
theories are often ill-defined or partial, into the assessment of relevance is a
primary goal of the work. The ultimate goal of this approach is to design an
intelligent tutoring system that will train students to argue with cases.
