Fefferman has been working to find efficient algorithms to interpolate
multidimensional data by an interpolating function that is "nearly as smooth as
possible" (under various interpretations of the phrase in quotes); and
investigating a possible self-similar breakdown scenario for the surface QG
equation, an incompressible fluid equation in 2 space dimensions. Stein has been
working on finding general theorems that guarantee that relevant operators
arising in several complex variables are bounded on appropriate function spaces.
He has also been working to develop the asymptotics of stock-price distributions
for basic models involving stochastic volatility.

Fefferman: Interpolation of data is important for many purposes in science and
technology. (Nearly) incompressible fluids occur in nature, but there is little
fundamental understanding of how they flow. Stein: Methods of harmonic analysis
used in studying operators on function spaces have vast applications in
understanding a variety of phenomena in science and technology. There is also
great utility in better understanding the nature of solutions of stochastic
differential equations.
