Four problems in the area of electron transport and relaxation phenomena in
disordered systems are discussed: 1) application of the generalised master
equation to Anderson localisation, 2) polaron hopping in site-diaordered
systems, 3) absence of lacalisation when bond-symmetric correlations exist
between the site-diagonal and site-off-diagonal energies, and 4) spin-lattice
relaxation below 1K.
