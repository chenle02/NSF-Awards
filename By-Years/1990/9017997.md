This research is concerned with soft x-ray spectroscopy studies using radiation
from the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) for the excitation of emission
spectra. The work involves a collaboration between the University of Tennessee,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and National Institute of Standards and
Technology scientists. The research represents a continuation of the studies of
the electronic properties of solid systems such as high Tc superconductors,
boron compounds, rare gas solids, and impurity systems. There will be an effort
to pursue threshold excitation studies and also hybrid laser-synchrotron
radiation studies. In the third year of the program it is intended to initiate
new studies at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
The work at ALS will be extended to dilute impurity systms and to threshold
studies using high resolution photon excitation into localized excited states.
