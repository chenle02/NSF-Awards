The Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project is an international collaborative
effort to study the behavior ecology and sociobiology of Leontopithecus rosalia,
to conserve a significant portion of the biodiversity remaining tin the Atlantic
Forest of Brazil. The Atlantic Coastal Forest has the highest level of endemism
of any part of South America. Among primates there are, in addition to several
endemic species, tow genera that occur naturally no where else on earth. The
golden lion tamarin is one of these. Ä±The muriqui, or woolly spider monkey
(Brachyteles) is the other.! They only survive because of Reserves such as Poco
da Antas where Dietz is doing his study. The project is unique among primate
studies because not just a few, but a large number of groups are being
monitored. Knowledge of their social behavior will allow an improved capability
of keeping the remaining few individuals successfully in captivity. The mating
system of tamarins, generally, is among the most complex of any group of
primates. The detailed study of many groups, using marked individually
identified animals, whose genetic structure will be known through DNA
fingerprinting, will continue to be the best and most thorough study of the
variable social system of any tamarin. Keeping these rare animals alive in the
wild depends on (1) maintaining their habitat, (2) knowing their social
structure, behavior, and ecology (3) genetic management of remaining
individuals, and (4) successful reintroduction of captive species into the wild.
Already this project has increased the number of tamarins in the wild by 25-
30%| The infrastructure of the proposed research includes training Brazilian
students, construction of facilities, training of Brazilian administrators and
guards in the Reserve, and improvement of the conservation ethic of local
communities.
