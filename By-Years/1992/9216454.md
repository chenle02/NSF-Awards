This project is to develop and apply novel discrete dynamic models to analyze
and characterize the migration and proliferation of anchorage-dependent and
contact-inhibited cells. These models are based on cellular automata and should
accurately describe cell population dynamics during all stages of contact-
inhibited migration and proliferation. Experimental efforts will focus on
obtaining accurate values for the main model parameters: (a) cell division
times, and (b) cell locomotory parameters, that will be measured by using
computer-assisted analysis of endothelial cell locomotion. All experimental
results will be systematically compared to model predictions to determine the
predictive capabilities of the theoretical models.
