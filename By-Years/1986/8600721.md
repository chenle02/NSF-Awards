Structural response modification factors (R-Factor) relate the actual earthquake
response of structures at significant yield level to the elastic response as
represented by the response spectrum computed from strong-motion records. As a
result, R-Factors provide a basic mechanism through which strong-motion data can
be applied in the seismic design of many building types. The objectives of this
research project are to assess the R-Factor concept in general, to evaluate
currently available R-Factor values through the analyses of strong-motion
records and building response data, and to develop guidelines for assigning and
utilizing R-Factors in the seismic design of commonly used structural systems.
The improvement and refinement of the R-Factor approach and the development of
R-Factors for specific building types will significantly benefit the engineering
community and the construction industry nationwide.
