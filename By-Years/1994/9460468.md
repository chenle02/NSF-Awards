This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the development
of a supersonic nozzle beam source of 'active nitrogen' to be used in the
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of nitride materials. The approach involves
'seeding' a heavy (and relatively inert) nitrogen precursor gas in a light
carrier gas and using supersonic expansion to accelerate the precursor molecules
towards the substrate surface with an energy sufficient to cause bond
dissociation. The resultant species would be a free radical and thus, highly
reactive. Further variation of the translational kinetic energy of the nitrogen
precursor species by use of different seeding gases will enhance the mobility of
the metal and N species necessary to produce Group III nitride monocrystalline
thin films with limited defects. This project represents a joint effort of
Aerodyne Research, Inc. in collaboration with the Material Science and
Engineering Department at North Carolina State University.
