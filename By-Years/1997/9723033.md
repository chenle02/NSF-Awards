9723033 Randall Drumming on the ground to create mechanical vibrations is an
important means of communication in open, desert environments, and is widespread
among desert rodents. Both solitary kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, from North America
and social gerbils, Rhombomys, from Central Asia exhibit footdrummming in the
presence of predators. Because this behavior costs time and energy and is
dangerous, it must provide some benefit. The objective of this study is to
determine why desert rodents place themselves at risk by footdrumming in the
presence of predators. Behavioral observations and experiments with snake and
mammalian predators in the field will test predictions that solitary kangaroo
rats footdrum to communicate directly to the predator that the rat is alert and
the predator's chances of successful capture are low, while social gerbils
footdrum to warn relatives and offspring of danger. Results of the study will
contribute to our understanding of footdrumming as a unique form of mammalian
communication and its function as anti-predator behavior in ground-dwelling
desert rodents. The study should lead to a greater understanding of how
predation acts as a selective force on prey behavior and contribute to recovery
programs of endangered species of kangaroo rat.
