This research will focus on two topics: (1) the almost everywhere convergence
of weighted averages, and (2) spectral type of rank one transformations. The
first problem operators on probability spaces and the study of sequences of
measures for which the corresponding operators fail to converge. In the second
study, rank one transformations has been a source of numerous and important
examples in ergodic theory; however, their spectral type has not been studied in
depth. This research is in the general area of modern analysis where researchers
examine the theory of operators and transformations on various spaces of finite
and infinite dimension.
