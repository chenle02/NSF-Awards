This project will conduct laboratory and field investigations into the
molecular-level transformations in the macromolecular component of dissolved
organic matter in seawater that are caused by photooxidative processes. The
hypotheses to be tested in the research are: 1) that photooxidation represents a
major process for remineralization of both allochthonous and autochthonous DOC
in the ocean; 2) that terrestrial (riverine) DOC, especially its lignin
component, is preferentially destroyed by photooxidation in comparison to marine
DOC; 3) that photoprocesses in the ocean are predominately destructive, not
constructive, to DOC; 4) that these photooxidative processes impart a unique
molecular level signature on DOC that can be distinguished by Pyrolysis-GC-MS.
The approach will be to examine the relative rates of photooxidation and
macromolecular oxidation products of "endmember" sources of DOC in laboratory
experiments and simultaneously determine the distributions of reactive starting
materials and photooxidation products in areas of the ocean where natural
gradients can be expected. Examining oceanic processes affecting DOC at the
molecular level is fundamental to understanding the transport and fats of
material, particularly carbon, in the marine environment. Thus, this research is
addressing an aspect of current concerns relating to climate, a present problem
of planetary significance.
