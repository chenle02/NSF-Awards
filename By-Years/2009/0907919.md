In this project, Dr. Steven J. Desch of Arizona State University will undertake
a theoretical study of how young stars are contaminated by ejected material from
nearby supernova explosions. Supernova contamination of forming planetary
systems has many observable consequences for the elemental abundances of stars.
The contamination determines the inventory of short-lived radionuclides such as
Aluminum-26 or Iron-60 in young stellar systems, and is a major driver of
planetary evolution and the delivery of bioessential volatiles to Earth-like
planets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine the effects of supernova
contamination, Dr. Desch and his students will numerically model the interaction
of supernova ejecta with protoplanetary disks and with fragments of molecular
clouds on the verge of collapse. They will also create a computational tool to
allow exploration of dust dynamics and thermal evolution in these and other
astrophysical flows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research connects
research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while at the
same time educating undergraduate and graduate students, including one named
student from an underrepresented group. The proposed research will create a
platform on which to expose a younger generation to a multidisciplinary
scientific process. The investigators will incorporate research developments
from this proposal into the classroom as part of a recently revamped School of
Earth and Space Exploration.
