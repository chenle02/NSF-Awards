A grant has been awarded to Dr. Thomas Demere at the San Diego Natural History
Museum (SDNHM) to study the fossil record of baleen whales and to document the
dramatic anatomical modifications that members of this group have undergone over
the past 35 million years. Given the popular interest in living baleen whales,
it is surprising that we still lack a clear understanding of the genealogical
relationships of the modern species. It is also surprising that the baleen whale
"family tree" is so poorly resolved, with many fossil "branches" based on rather
sketchy evidence or, even worse, currently unknown. Dr. Demere's study will
include descriptions of critical new fossil specimens, a re-analysis of named
fossil baleen whale specimens housed at foreign and domestic museums, and
determination of specific anatomical features that document the evolutionary
changes that have occurred to the baleen whale skull, lower jaw, "arm," and
body. &lt;br/&gt;This study will be conducted within the context of a broader
collaborative study of baleen whale evolution. The broader study will include
analysis of genealogical relationships of all living species of baleen whales
using data derived from molecular studies, soft anatomical studies, and
osteological studies. When these results are combined with those based on the
fossil record, the outcome will provide the most comprehensive view yet realized
of the evolutionary history of baleen whales. A final aspect of this
collaborative research will be to utilize the vastly improved genealogical
history of baleen whales to track the anatomical and functional changes that
occurred during the development of the diverse feeding styles exhibited by the
modern species (i.e., surface skimming right whales, engulfment feeding fin
whales, and suction feeding gray whales). Highlights of this research will be
incorporated into public education efforts at SDNHM including website pages
(www.sdnhm.org) and exhibit galleries. &lt;br/&gt;
