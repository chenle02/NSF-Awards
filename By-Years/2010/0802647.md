This workshop on Biosensing and Bioactuation will bring together 30-40
researchers from universities, government labs and industry who are experts in
the diverse research topics of interest to those in the BIO, CISE, ENG and MPS
researcher communities and who have a common interest in interdisciplinary
research on biological systems and biologically inspired systems. Participants
will be charged with formulating a vision for what might be possible through
collaborations on the fundamental challenges pertaining to realizing
revolutionary sensing and actuation capabilities that draw upon molecular
biology, biochemical processes and both micro and macro biological systems for
inspiration. This will be a two-day workshop, to be held at the University of
Maryland on Nov. 27th and 28th, 2007. Prior to the workshop, participants will
have posted a one-page vision statement that summarizes their individual
perspectives of potential Grand Challenge Biosensing and Bioactuation research
topics to the workshop web site. The participants, all leaders in their
respective fields, will use the small group working sessions to be conducted at
the workshop to assess potential opportunities for collaborations that could
lead to new insights and discoveries, and with that as a foundation, to develop
a document for broad distribution in which participants contribute to
identification of the state-of-the-art of Biosensor and Bioactuator research,
and provide a visionary look forward that, with the benefit of the larger group
for concept development, reflects opportunities for major research program areas
that will comprise Biosensor and Bioactuator Research Grand Challenges in the
coming decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
