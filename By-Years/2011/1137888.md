Preferences, fashions, and languages change through time. Where this culture
comes from and where it is going is a perennial subject of scientific and
philosophical debate and a continually fascinating topic of popular speculation.
In the last half century, population geneticists have revealed much of the
genetic history of the human species, yielding a story of our migration and
relatedness that has revitalized anthropology, archeology, and ethnology. The
story of culture sometimes fits the story of the genes, but sometimes
contradicts it and always changes more quickly. This project takes central
insights from population genetics, especially coalescent theory that explores
lineages backwards in time to see how they converge or coalesce into common
ancestors, and appropriates these insights to a study of culture. Through both
mathematical theory and empirical data, this project aims to implement
coalescence as a central tool by which to understand the history of culture.
This will pave the way for solutions to persistent questions relating to the
speed and timing of cultural change and divergence, the degree of contact
between cultures, and even the mechanisms behind these changes. Tests of
progress on these questions will be conducted on bird song (the best studied
nonhuman example of culture) as well as human language. This work will be
conducted by an academically and ethnically diverse team of scientists including
specialists in evolutionary biology, anthropology, mathematics, and cultural
change.
