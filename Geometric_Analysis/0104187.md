We propose various directions for studying embedded minimal surfaces in three-
manifolds. This includes the study of the convergence of such surfaces, how they
degenerate and whether or not their Morse index is bounded. There are many
possible applications of results along these lines including to the spherical
space-form problem, the topology of three-manifolds with positive scalar
curvature etc. In addition, these results should yield new insight into minimal
surfaces in Euclidean space.

This project focuses on minimal surfaces in three-dimensional manifolds.
Minimal surfaces are critical points for area (e.g., soap films are least area
surfaces) and arise naturally in many problems in mathematics and in the other
sciences. Many of the classical results in this area are on least area surfaces.
In contrast, our main interest is in high index (i.e., highly unstable) embedded
minimal surfaces with bounded topology - a well-known example is given by the
standard helicoid. Roughly speaking, the point of some of our theorems is that
the behavior of the helicoid is typical.
