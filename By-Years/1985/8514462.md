Based on the PI's analysis of seasonal probability plots from 29 gages in
Wisconsin, seasonal effects seem to be an important factor on flood frequency
distributions by attenuating flood peaks. Thus, this project will focus on
investigating and documenting the impacts of these seasonal effects, with some
attention given to over-bank attenuation effects. Exploratory data analysis on
flood series in drainage basins in Wisconsin and three adjacent states
(Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota) will be conducted to identify the basins in
which floodplain effects are large. A physical model of flood hydraulics and
hydrology will be used for better understanding the role of the seasonal
effects.
