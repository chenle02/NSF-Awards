This is a study of the geochemistryof mantle-derived, spinel peridotite
xenoliths from localities in the Basin and Range Province and the adjacent
Colorado Plateau, as well as the transition zone between the two provinces. The
heart of the study is the anlysis and modelling of the REE and Sr and Nd
isotopic compositions of clinopyroxene seperated from the bulk peridotites, but
xenolith population systematics and mineral composition will be investigated and
will be particularly important in choosing representative samples for study. In
addition to standard analytical techniques, secondary ion mass spectrometry will
be utilized to measure relative REE abundances in single cpx grains. Present-day
mantle composition beneath the two tectonic provinces will be characterized and
for each locality a model will be developed. This will include observed
heterogeneity (or homogeneity) and where possible, the inferred age and nature
of fractionation events. Ultimately models for all localities will be integrated
to provide a regional model for the systematic variation of mantle composition
as it relates to large-scale crustal tectonism.
