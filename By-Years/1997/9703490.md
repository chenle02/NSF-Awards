Yinyu Ye Complexity theory is the foundation of computer algorithms. The goal
of the theory is to develop criteria for measuring effectiveness and efficiency
of various algorithms and difficulty of various problems. The term
``complexity'' refers to the amount of resources required by a computation. In
this proposal, running time or number of arithmetic operations is the major
resource of interest. The aim of the proposal is to further develop the
complexity theory of linear programming (LP). In particular, we analyze
``condition'' numbers that determine the degree of difficulty of an LP problem,
and ``precondition'' the problem using Partial Knowledge. Therefore, we study
whether or not certain kinds of partial knowledge could help in solving this
problem and how they impact the complexity of the problem. If such knowledge is
helpful and available, then an experienced owner of LP problem instances might
be able to use it to solve them more effectively. In general, progress in the
area of developing efficient algorithms for solving large-scale optimization
problems will be of great importance in improving the efficiency of
manufacturing systems, communication networks, aircraft routing, multiple-flow
operations, and resources planning. Strengthening research in this area will
contribute to the national interest in industrial competitiveness and scientific
knowledge. Businesses, large and small, use LP models to optimize
telecommunication networks, to schedule traffic flows, to control manufacturing
processes, to plan financial investments, to minimize production costs, etc. LP
has been the mostly used applied mathematics and computation tool. Historically,
research developments on LP have dramatically widened the scope of its
applications. Many problems, which were "unsolvable" 15 years ago, are now
solved in few minutes and in real time. The anticipated findings and discoveries
resulting from this proposed project will strengthen and improve theoretical
results and practical performance of LP algorithms further, and may lead to the
development of new high-performance algorithms for a variety of computational
problems.
