930964 Fischer This grant provides continued support for a series of annual
conferences on macroeconomics. Past conferences have made a significant
contribution to the testing of empirical implications of new theories as well as
the use of relevant theory to analyze policy issues of current interest. The
conference series will continue to encourage the writing of empirically oriented
papers by both established and promising young economists. In addition, the
series will continue to serve as a forum for communication among economists from
the different schools of macroeconomic thought. The annual conference volume has
become a widely cited and influential research reference. ***
