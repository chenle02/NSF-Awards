Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project
creates a multithreaded programming (MTP) course targeting general-purpose
multi-core processors for the senior-level and graduate-level students in
computer science and computer engineering. In order to overcome the difficulty
of teaching and learning multi-core programming, problem-based learning (PBL) is
used in this course to ease students' transition from the single-threaded
programming model to MTP. PBL-oriented course materials are developed, including
real-life multi-core programming problems, mini-lectures, lesson plans, lab
manuals, reference materials, etc. The course is taught at the collaborating
institutions in two consecutive semesters without and with PBL, and the
effectiveness of PBL is evaluated through analyzing data collected from a
variety of sources, including pre-tests and post-tests, in depth interviews, and
general evaluation forms. The project outcomes are disseminated through
websites, email lists, CDs, publication, and presentations at professional
conferences. &lt;br/&gt;
