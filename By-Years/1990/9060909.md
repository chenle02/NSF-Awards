This is a SBIR Phase I award in the topic area of biological instrumentation.
Ionics Research Inc. will construct, evaluate and refine a machine that is
capable of continuously separating large amounts of biological macromolecules
with high sensitivity. The theoretical basis for the proposed project is solid.
If successful, such device will be useful for the preparatory scale separation
of peptide hormones and other products of biotechnology.
