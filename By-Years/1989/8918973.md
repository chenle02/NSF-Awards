This project combines new molecular biological approaches with biochemical
approaches in the analysis of the regulation in the ascomycetes. Aspergillus
nidulans, of the synthesis of two L- asparaginase. The L-asparaginase (encoded
by ahrA) is under nitrogen metabolite repression (ammonium repression), as well
as oxygen repression, both mediated by the positive-acting areA gene product
which regulates approximately 100 different genes. The second L-asparaginase
(encoded by apnA) appears not to be under this type of regulation. This three
year project involves: 1) The isolation and sequencing of the two
L-asparaginases genes. 2) Defining the size of the L-asparaginase genes by
subcloning and complementation or hybridization and the sequencing of these
genes, verifying the genes by gene disruption. 3) Analysis of mRNA produce by
each of these under repressed and derepressed conditions and sizing of the
mature mRNA. This will include measurement of transcript prevalence and rates of
synthesis. 4) Overexpression of these genes in E. coli for further
characterization and collaboration with Dr. D.G. Poplack, M.D., Head, Leukemia
Biology Section, Pediatric Branch, NCI. The significance of this project lies in
its contribution to the theory of gene regulation, enzyme multiplicity and
possible divergent evolution in lower eukaryotes. From and educational point of
view, the project itself can benefit undergraduate student because it can be
divided into a series of separate small projects suitable for students working
in pairs or individually. Each student would learn basic biochemical and
molecular biological techniques.
