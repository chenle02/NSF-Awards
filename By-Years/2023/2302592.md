A central problem in Number Theory is finding integer solutions to polynomial
equations. Some systems of equations have plenty of integer solutions. This
research concerns the distribution of the integer solutions inside the continuum
of real solutions. A wide-range of conjectures imply that in many cases the
distribution of integer solutions mimics a randomly generated set in the ambient
space. Systems of equation that have a large enough group of symmetries are
called homogeneous and they play a central role in this project. These
symmetries can be used to relate different integer solutions to each other and
facilitate the introduction of methods from the theory of dynamical systems to
this research area. The dynamical methods have been immensely successful in
solving long standing problems in number theory. The major objectives of this
project are to make progress on long-standing problems about equidistribution in
number theory, to expose undergraduate students to number theory and prepare
them to graduate studies, and to prepare graduate students to conduct research
at the intersection of number theory and dynamics.

The focus of this project is the chaotic behavior of periodic subgroup orbits on
homogeneous spaces, and the randomness exhibited in the asymptotic behavior of
automorphic forms. Early breakthroughs include Linnik's results about the
equidistribution of integral points on the sphere and Margulis's solution of the
Oppenheim conjecture regarding the values attained by an irrational quadratic
form at integer points. To make progress on these topics, this project will fuse
and expand results from homogeneous dynamics and analytic number theory.
Specifically, the proposed research relies on measure rigidity techniques from
homogeneous dynamics, the study of relative trace formulae and the theta
correspondence from the theory of automorphic forms, and sieve methods from
multiplicative number theory.
