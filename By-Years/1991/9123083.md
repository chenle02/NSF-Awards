Program Summary: The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to
acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of
oceanographic data. This proposal from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
(WHOI) requests funding for equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded
research cruises aboard the R/V's KNORR, ATLANTIS II and the OCEANUS. The KNORR
and the AII were constructed with NSF support, and the OCEANUS is owned by the
NSF. All three vessels are operated by the Institution and provide extensive
support to NSF funded oceanographic research projects.
