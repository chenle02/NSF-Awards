The PI is proposing to work on various aspects of the inner model program, which
is the program for constructing inner models for large cardinals. He will
concentrate on problems coming from descriptive inner model theory and will work
on advancing the theory of hod mice. The long term goal of the project is to
prove the Mouse Set Conjecture, which is a central conjecture in descriptive
inner model theory. Immediate goals include advancing the core model induction
technique beyond its current levels, and computing better consistency lower
bounds for the failure of square at a measurable cardinal.

Mathematics is the language of science; it is what is used to express scientific
predictions and theories. Mathematics is simply the most fundamental and
indispensable part of science. However, just as scientific achievements must be
tested for their validity, mathematical discoveries too must be tested for their
consistency. Mathematical theories are based on axioms known as the axioms of
Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Provided that the
proofs from ZFC and its various extensions are correct, it is believed that the
resulting theories are correct. Set theory is the part of mathematics that deals
with the consistency of ZFC and its extensions via Large Cardinal Axioms (LCA).
Because of the celebrated Godel's incompleteness theorem one cannot hope to
prove that ZFC or any of its extensions are consistent. Nevertheless, one can
hope to provide naturally occurring models for ZFC + LCA in the same spirit that
the set of natural numbers is the natural model of the axioms of Peano
Arithmetic (PA). PA is the axiomatic system that guides and controls the usage
of arithmetic in everyday life. The inner model program is a set theoretic
program whose primary goal is to construct such canonical models for ZFC + LCA.
The proposed project is a contribution to the inner model program. One specific
objective of the proposed project is to advance the most successful recent
method for constructing natural models for various extensions of ZFC, the core
model induction, to new levels, and thus to construct natural models for
extensions of ZFC that were unreachable before.
