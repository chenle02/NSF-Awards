CAREER: Application-driven Combustion and Fluid Flow Imaging,
CTS-0348208&lt;br/&gt;Lester K. Su, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns
Hopkins University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work encompasses
the development and application of planar laser imaging techniques for
investigating problems in combustion and turbulent fluid flows. It pays
particular attention to molecular mixing, with an eye to rigorous experimental
assessment of models used in simulations of non-premixed, turbulent combustion.
Planar imaging methods are capable of direct visualization of turbulent flow
structures and are thus inherently well suited for assessing simulation methods
(such as large-eddy simulation) that are rooted conceptually in the structural
organization of turbulent flows. This work includes the development of a
velocimetry technique for gas-phase turbulent flows that is based on scalar
field measurements, which can be applied in a priori testing of mixing and
combustion models, and the use of Rayleigh scattering and planar laser-induced
fluorescence methods to investigate differential molecular diffusion in multi-
species turbulent mixing problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
research program will contribute to increased efficiency and reduced
environmental impact of combustion systems by improving the understanding of the
underlying turbulent mixing process and facilitating the development of more
accurate simulation methods. Combustion of fossil fuels will remain significant
to the industrial economy for the foreseeable future, and efficient and clean
combustion is crucial for sustainable development. In the course of this work,
the PI also addresses the issue of stagnant enrollments in university
engineering departments. New courses are being developed to make engineering
education reflect current trends in engineering practice, and the issue of
diversity in engineering is addressed in a way that recognizes the different
obstacles faced by different under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;
