9423083 Overhauser The objective of this project is to acquire a deeper
understanding of the interactions between electrons and the interactions between
helium 3 atoms in condensed matter. Applications include one particle energy
spectra, phase transformations, collective excitations, dynamic scattering
processes, transport phenomena, broken translation symmetry, superconductivity,
and the superfluid phases of helium 3. %%% This award supports the ongoing
research of a prominent investigator who received the National Medal Science
from President Clinton in 1994. He is known for asking penetrating, fundamental
questions about systems that others think are understood. He also focuses on
resolving major discrepancies between experimental results and previous
theories. He will investigate eight projects which center on a better
understanding of the interactions between electrons or between atoms in various
condensed matter systems. ***
