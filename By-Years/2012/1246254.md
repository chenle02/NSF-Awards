This project is supporting a special themed issue of The Earth Scientist, the
quarterly journal of the National Earth Science Teachers Association (NESTA) on
climate-change education. The issue includes submissions from climate-change
educators that compile existing resources, many recently developed, that are
suitable for K-12 Earth- and Space-Science classrooms and based on peer-reviewed
science. The issue is being distributed at NESTA and the National Science
Teachers Association (NSTA) events and conferences and is available for download
at the Windows on the Universe website.
