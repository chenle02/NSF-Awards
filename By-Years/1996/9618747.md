Abstract LICHTENBERGER, A. W. AST-9618747 Funds will be used to support four
initiatives in the development of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS)
mixers for submillimeter radioastronomy receivers. In the first of these tasks
integrated balanced Nb mixer circuits will be developed to reduce atmospheric
and local oscillator noise in SIS receiver systems. Micromachined SIS mixer
circuits will be investigated as a basis of receiver design for observing
extended sources. Traveling wave mixers based on Nb/Al edge junctions will be
fabricated and evaluated. In the fourth task ion beam etching techniques will be
used to produce bolometric mixers with very small dimensions.
