Predictive maintenance is a subject of great interest to U.S. industry, to the
academic community, and to employers in the region of suburban Chicago served by
the college. In response to the needs of the business and industrial communities
it serves, the college has created an eight-course, 23-credit Predictive
Maintenance (PDM) certificate program to provide basic education in this
emerging field of work at the technician level. The PDM certificate combines
four newly developed courses with four existing courses in the college's
Electro-Mechanical Technology curriculum. The eight courses range from the
basics in industrial electricity and technical mechanics to advanced techniques
in signal analysis and statistical process control. Collectively, the courses
provide fundamental education in predicative, corrective, and preventive
maintenance and a significant amount of hands-on experience using the data
acquisition systems and industrial monitoring instrumentation. The primary
target population for the PDM program is composed of individuals who are already
employed in the field and who are interested in improving their knowledge and
skill levels in order move to higher level jobs in industrial maintenance.
Critical to the implementation of the PDM program is the addition of equipment
for an integrated system that can provide hands-on experience in using state-of-
the-art data acquisition systems and industrial monitoring instrumentation. *
