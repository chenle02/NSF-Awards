0318835&lt;br/&gt;Brown&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and students from
the University of Colorado-Boulder in a collaboration with Kjell Erksson of the
Department of Astronomy and Space Physics at the University of Uppsala. The
technical focus of the project is to develop accurate models of the conditions
in the extended atmospheres of evolved cool stars. The complementary expertise
of the US and Swedish groups will make it possible to model the inhomogeneous
wind outflow from evolved giants and super giants, model the carbon monoxides
lines in dwarfs and giants, measure stellar magnetic fields using Zeeman
splitting and state-of-the-art radiative transfer codes, and establish
evolutionary positions and masses of late-type giants and super
giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this collaboration are that
it increases interactions between US researchers and those in Sweden, it
promotes collaborative opportunities and career development for US students, and
it enhances the infrastructure for research and education by laying the
groundwork for future international research and education opportunities,
especially through a planned international summer school on Analysis and
Modeling of Stellar Spectra.&lt;br/&gt;
