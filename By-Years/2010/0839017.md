Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers from the University of Colorado at
Boulder will construct and deploy a number of low powered UV photometers to be
placed on long duration stratospheric super pressure (constant volume) balloons
to be launched during the joint US-French CONCORDIASI project
(http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/concordiasi/ ) to take place from McMurdo, Antarctica
in 2009. The photometers will in turn be used to measure in situ ozone (O3)
concentrations aloft, as the balloons drift in the Antarctic polar vortex. From
the unique vantage point of this platform, the resulting near-Lagrangian ozone
measurements, acquired at the onset of the austral spring (Sept-Nov), will allow
detailed observation of the developing annual ozone depletion event. Balloon
flight data will be compared with modeled predictions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion of the progress of the research, including
progress towards reversal of seasonal ozone depletion events since adoption of
the Montreal Protocol, will be coordinated with mid level and high school
classroom activities at the Denver School of Science and
Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the
