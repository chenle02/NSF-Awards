9322437 Collins This REU Site award provides an opportunity for twelve
undergraduate students to gain research experience synthesis and
characterization techniques.. The students will be participating in on-going
research projects, including: ionic exchange waveguides in soda-lime glass;
manophase clusters in insulator hosts by synthesizing and characterizing the
infrared reesponse and thermal properties of dielectric materials confined to
porous borosilicate glass and alumina; crystal growth and characterization of
ternary telluride crystals; spectroscopic studies of glasses for nonlinear
optical applications; surface characterization of modified surfaces of zinc-
cadmium-telluride single crystals using electron and ion-beam spectroscopies;
and photoconductivity studies of mercury iodide and lead iodide. %%% The goal of
this program at Fisk University, a Historically Black University, is to provide
undergraduate students with a successful research experience in on-going
research projects which will serve to teach students the scientific approach to
problem solving, as well as advanced methods of materials synthesis and
characterization, and motivate more students to obtain professional/advanced
degrees. Increased participation from other institutions will be emphasized and
where possible, students from different schools will be paired together to
foster a better learning environment.
