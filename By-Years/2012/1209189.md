The University of New Hampshire (UNH) ADVANCE Institutional Transformation
program, in keeping with the institution's mission of inclusive excellence, has
as its overall goal to increase the number, retention and success of women
faculty in the STEM disciplines. Based upon careful analysis of a University
climate survey, several strategies are employed that include, but are not
limited to strategic changes in recruitment and retention policies and
practices; department chair professional development; formal mentoring policies;
a wage equity analysis; and, flexible workplace policies. Coupled with these
strategies is a rigorous social science study aimed at investigating the impact
of gender equity institutional transformation on the representation and job
satisfaction of women faculty at UNH. It is expected that results from this
project and outcomes of the research study will seminally inform the current
gender equity literature. Thus, this project has the potential to serve as a
model for other institutions who identify comparable challenges in hiring,
promoting, and, in general, advancing women STEM faculty.
