The key goal of the proposed research is to experimentally measure quality
(Q)-factors for c-axis oriented Gallium Nitride (GaN) nanowires (NWs) over a
large ensemble of NW dimensions, while simultaneously developing novel
multiscale, coupled physics computational models to quantify the dominant loss
mechanisms. A particular emphasis will be placed on understanding size and
surface effects on the relative importance of the individual loss mechanisms
across a technologically relevant range of length scales. Experimentally, this
will be achieved by providing, for the first time, a comprehensive body of
experimental data on mechanical resonance position and resonance linewidth for a
large ensemble of c-axis GaN NWs, and over a wide range of NW lengths (1 to 20
microns), diameters (10 to 100 nm), vibrational frequencies (100 kHz to 100
MHz), and temperature (4 K to 400 K). Novel multiscale modeling approaches,
including the surface Cauchy-Born model and coupled nanoscale energy and
momentum equations that capture, for the first time, surface stress effects on
both the thermal and mechanical fields, will be developed to simulate and
quantitatively predict Q-factor degradation due to intrinsic surface losses and
thermoelastic damping of NWs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research
will make original contributions in the understanding of how surfaces are
implicated in the mechanical losses of GaN NWs. It will additionally elucidate
the fundamental mechanisms governing size, and temperature effects on energy
dissipation in GaN NWs, while delineating the length scales at which each loss
mechanism dominates. This project will further quantify, for the first time, the
errors introduced in NW modeling if standard bulk continuum models that neglect
surface effects are scaled down to the nanoscale. The project further focuses on
the involvement of under-represented minorities in the nanoengineering research
and education process. It will leverage the training of future nanoengineers in
both nanoscale modeling and experiment by the integration of the proposed
research into the curriculum. Results and insights will be broadly distributed
through professional and physics educational websites.&lt;br/&gt;
