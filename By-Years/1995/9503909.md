9503909 Martin This spectrometer will be used by six research groups in the
departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and
Chemistry at Iowa State University, and in the Physics Department at Coe
College. Currently supported research projects on chalcogenide and oxide
glasses, amorphous and polycrystalline thin films, polycrystals, crystals, and
photosynthetic systems will benefit from increased speed in data acquisition,
dependability, reliability, and ease of use with this new system.
