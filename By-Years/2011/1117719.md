Broadband cellular networks are emerging to be the most common means for mobile
data access worldwide. Predictions from industry analysts indicate that the
volume of data through cellular data networks will increase exponentially in
near future. Understanding of the mobile data traffic via measurement and
analysis is critical for the development of resource management techniques for
these networks. While spectrum resources are of great concern, this project
specifically focuses on the ?energy? required to operate the cellular network
infrastructure, specifically base stations. The project undertakes a significant
modeling exercise with two goals. One goal is ?intellectual,? driven towards
understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of mobile traffic and discovering
possible structure or relationships. The project uses state-of-the-art machine
learning tools to develop models using large-scale data collected directly from
the operators? networks. Such modeling will bring new insights that in turn will
help to deploy and manage future generation cellular data networks. The second
goal is ?utilitarian.? Here, techniques are developed to predict base station
loads for use in resource management, specifically energy. Algorithms are
designed to exploit energy-optimization opportunities to turn off specific
network resources based on the forecasted load.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
has significant broader impact. It develops technologies to appreciably reduce
energy consumption in cellular networks. Overall, this exercise will both reduce
cost, and contribute to the environment. The project also contributes to several
'green? initiatives in both institutions and to the education and training of
graduate students.
