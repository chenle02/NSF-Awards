An award is made to Rhodes College to support the acquisition of a fluorescence
activated cell sorter (FACS) to enhance the research of faculty and training of
undergraduate students at Rhodes College and institutions in the Memphis area.
This instrument allows separation of small particles, including living cells,
from large populations and is based on very specific features such as particle
size or the presence of a protein. As cells are isolated, very detailed
information can be gathered about each cell and the living cells can be further
studied. Addition of the FACS instrument will transform the ability to train the
next generation of scientists in Rhodes faculty-led coursework, mentored
research, and outreach programs at this research-active Primarily Undergraduate
Institution (PUI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument allows fast and precise
analysis and separation that is very robust so that it will help scientists and
undergraduate students answer a broad range of biological questions, including
the how genes function, how cells respond to stress, and questions regarding
biodiversity in ecological systems. Projects will focus on (1) epigenetic gene
regulation; (2) parental control of gene expression; (3) response to viral
infection; (4) metal intake in a type of Salmonella bacterium; (5) immune system
response to a type of fungal pathogen; (6) vitamin dependent cell cycle
progression; (7) phytoplankton communities in freshwater ecosystems; and (8)
speciation response to changes in ploidy. This work will be shared with the
scientific community through presentations at national conferences and
publication with undergraduate co-authors in peer-reviewed
journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
