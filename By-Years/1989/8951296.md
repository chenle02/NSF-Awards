This project develops computer-device interfacing in introductory and
intermediate physics laboratories for Pre-Engineering students. Computer-device
interfacing introduces students to an important and growing aspect of science
and engineering. It allows experimental investigations with a more modern focus.
It allows data acquisition and analysis procedures that would not be available
with traditional equipment. To this end several experiments have been developed
for the introductory courses, on a pilot basis, and others will be developed.
Some of the requested equipment will allow the outfitting of a complete
interfaced laboratory for 20 students. The college is also developing computer
interfaced experiments for an electrical measurements laboratory course for pre-
engineering students, and the remainder of the requested equipment will outfit
this laboratory. The experiments in this lab will be of a more sophisticated
nature, with students working with commercial interfaces in a more realistic
way. All software has been, or will be, written by members of the project. The
new experiments will all be classroom tested and then revised for maximum
educational impact before they become an integral part of the laboratory
curriculum. The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
