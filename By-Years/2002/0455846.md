BSCS and the Center for Science Teaching and Learning at Northern Arizona
University are proposing a five-year research study that determines the
potential for improving the quality of teaching and learning by improving high
school teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). The proposal team will
design and deliver a professional development program for science teachers that
is based on the use of educative curriculum materials, is designed around the
elements of transformative professional development, and purposefully and
explicitly integrates efforts to improve secondary science teachers' content
knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and skill, and helps them to apply this
knowledge to the context of their own classroom. The outcome of this program
will be research-based information about the influence of the professional
development program on teachers' PCK and the related impact of PCK on student
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
