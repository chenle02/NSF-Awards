It is the purpose of this project to measure the thermodynamic and physical-
chemical properties of Antarctic stratospheric cloud particles. These polar
stratospheric clouds (PSC's) are believed to be made up of nitric acid,
hydrochloric acid and water, and they are almost certainly play very important
roles in the destruction of ozone over Antarctica. The grantees will manufacture
equilibrium solids in the laboratory under near- stratospheric conditions using
classical physical-chemical techniques, based on controlled partial freezing of
carefully prepared solutions. The vapor pressures and thermodynamic properties,
such as heats of vaporization, will be measured directly using diode laser
spectroscopy. The work is considered to be crucial for better understanding of
the chemistry that takes place on the PSC particles.
