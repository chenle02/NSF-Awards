9727982 Campbell Biochemistry of eukaryotic nitrate reductase (NR; EC
1.6.6.1-3), catalyzing NADH/NADPH driven reduction of nitrate to nitrite in
plants, algae and fungi, has been studied in this laboratory for 20 years. The
investigator has studied structure and function of NR, including modeling part
of its three-dimensional structure. Natural sources provide only small amounts
of NR and to advance biochemical understanding, recombinant expression of NR and
active fragments has been successfully used. The investigation will involve
recombinant expression of active holo-NR in Pichia pastoris, a methylotrophic
yeast, for producing purified enzyme needed to obtain complete 3-D structure.
Mutant forms of NR will be used to study functionality in the Mo-molybdenum
pterin cofactor binding site (Mo-MPT), nitrate reducing active site and subunit
interface. A model of NR is being derived using the sulfite oxidase 3-D
structure. Studies of NR's catalytic mechanism via spectral and steady-state
kinetic analyses will be done with pre-steady state kinetics and EPR spectra
done via collaboration. Existing mutants of ligands to Mo-MPT will be analyzed
in comparison to wild-type enzyme via x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. These studies will yield a complete
and detailed picture of NR structure and function and guide future studies.
Nitrate reductase is a unique member of a multicenter redox enzyme family; these
catalyze long-distance electron transfer. NR is important in agriculture since
it serves as the first enzymatic step in nitrogen accumulation by plants. NR
also has importance in biotechnology for addressing environmental problems
arising from nitrate pollution of ground and surface waters. NR is a "green"
catalyst for nitrate test kits for analysis of water and part of a system for
eliminating nitrate pollution of potable water via enzymatic denitrification.
Basic research on NR is paying off for society since it is a tool in
environmental biotechnology.
