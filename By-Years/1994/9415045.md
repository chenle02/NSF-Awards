The National Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee are
jointly funding renovation of the University of Wisconsin System Great Lakes
Research Facility (GLRF). The modernization will focus on laboratories for
research and research training in geochemistry, biogeochemistry, microbiology,
limnology, plankton ecology, and aquatic ecology/behavioral ecology. The
upgrades will provide modern research space in the building which was originally
constructed in 1965 as a manufacturing plant and subsequently outfitted for
research in 1973 and 1978. Specific improvements involve major changes to the
basic infrastructure, as well as targeted laboratory and laboratory support
facilities. New plumbing facilities including drains, water, gas, deionized
water and air delivery systems will be installed throughout the research space.
A two-way video/data LAN microwave link will be installed to connect the main
UW-Milwaukee campus with the GLRF. Finally, new fixed equipment including fume
hoods, laboratory counters, walk-in refrigerators, growth chambers and
incubators will be replaced or added, as appropriate, to a selected group of
laboratories.
