A joint effort by the NSF, University of Hawaii, and the privately funded
Schmidt Ocean Institute in 2014 surveyed the seafloor along the western Hawaiian
Ridge and obtained nearly complete coverage in water depths greater than 50 m of
the 2500-km-long chain of extinct volcanoes. This exceptional data set will be
used to study the strength of the tectonic plate. The gravity data and seafloor
maps record the downward bending of the tectonic plate when volcanos are built
on it. Models will be used to simulate this bending and provide an estimate of
the strength of the tectonic plate. The results will complement, or could even
revise, results produced by experimental methods in which the strength of rock
samples is measured in the laboratory. The project will contribute to the
understanding of earthquakes which requires an understanding of rock strength.
The project will also contribute to the professional training of graduate and
undergraduate students in advanced STEM fields. In addition, a graduate student
seminar will be developed whose topic will be on the strength of the plate, and
guest lectures will be given remotely via Skype and made available on iTunes
University and YouTube sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rheologic properties of the
Pacific Ocean lithosphere will be investigated along the older section of the
Hawaiian Ridge. In this area, volcanoes of different sizes have erupted on crust
of roughly the same age (about 85 Ma). This will allow the researchers to
isolate the effect of the size of the load and age of the load from the effect
of the thermal age of the lithosphere in their models of the lithosphere
response to the loads. The researchers will use multibeam bathymetry and gravity
data collected in this region to quantify the rheological laws that control the
flexure of the underlying lithosphere and thus, characterize the strength of the
lithosphere. This study could motivate revisions to our understanding of
lithosphere rheology overall.
