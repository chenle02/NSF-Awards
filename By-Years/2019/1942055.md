Billions of people depend on software systems every day, but software remains
buggy and vulnerable. Software testing is the predominant approach for software
quality assurance (QA), and hundreds of thousands of developers are involved in
QA activities on a daily basis. Developers heavily rely on intuition,
experience, and familiarity with a code base when developing tests, and when
reasoning about test effectiveness and consistency. However, experience varies
widely, which has negative impacts on software quality and developer
productivity. Addressing these challenges, this project develops practical end-
to-end solutions for effective and consistent software testing that integrate
well with existing QA practices. It aims to substantially increase the quality
of the software that pervades modern technology, by providing developers with a
framework and methodology for systematic software testing with quantifiable
efficacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to advance
software quality by making software testing more effective, predictable, and
consistent. To achieve this goal, the proposed research co-develops a new
mutation-based testing approach along with a methodology to quantify its
efficacy. Specifically, this project (1) develops models for program context and
test goal utility, (2) builds upon these models and develops a learning-based
approach for context-sensitive predictions of test goal utility and ranking test
goals, and (3) develops a probabilistic method that assesses how representative
a set of test goals is for bugs encountered during software development. In
addition to the research artifacts, this project will provide publicly available
artifacts that enable training of a new generation of software
engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
