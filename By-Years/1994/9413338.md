9413338 Chang Calculations of single and multiphoton ionization, resonance
energies and widths of doubly excited states, fine structure level splittings
and oscillator strengths will be performed in divalent atoms using the B-spline
technique. The aim is to obtain a quantitative understanding of the role of
electron correlation in atomic continuum processes. ***
