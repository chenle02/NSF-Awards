They will (1) study the systematics of EuS and other ferromagnetic insulators in
contact with metals and as tunnel barriers of thin film tunnel junctions; (2)
use the new technique, which allows for the first time tunneling measurements of
spin-orbit and Fermi-liquid effects in many metals; (3) look for spin effects in
heavy-electron and high temperature superconductors; (4) study the exchange
effects with ferromagnetic metals, magnetic domains, and magnetic effects at
surfaces for H = 0 to 30 T. This program will (1) give an understanding of
exchange effects between ferromagnetic insulators and superconductors,
ferromagnetic metals, and paramagnetic metals; (2) give a quantitative picture
of electron tunneling through ferromagnetic insulators; (3) permit new
measurements giving fundamental results in superconductivity, ferromagnetism,
and electron-spin effects in normal metals.
