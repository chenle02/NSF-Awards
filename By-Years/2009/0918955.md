Biological Sciences (61). The Virtual Cell development team is expanding its
existing collection of high-quality, animation-based educational modules that
feature molecular and cellular processes (http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations).
These animations are freely accessible from the VCell download site
(http://vcell.ndsu.nodak.edu/animations/downloads/), and are widely used by
teachers as stand-alone videos or incorporated into personal learning tools. The
publicly available NDSU Virtual Cell Channel on YouTube is used by learners at
all levels (http://www.youtube.com/user/ndsuvirtualcell) to better understand
these cellular and molecular processes. This project is expanding the VCell
collection by 1) developing additional animations for widespread (including
international) distribution; 2) creating Biology-in-the-Hand applications,
pioneering WWW-delivered learning modules for use with portable media players;
3) broadening the utility of the animations by offering the narration in other
languages; and 4) utilizing a recently developed National Educational Media
research framework to better understand those aspects of animations that aid
learning. In accomplishing these goals, the sponsoring institution is
collaborating with three partner institutions that have previously developed or
used animations for biology education: East Carolina University, the University
of Colorado, Denver, and the University of Toronto. These institutions are also
serving as tests sites to measure the impact of specific animation designs on
student learning. The major product from this project is a suite of high quality
animations that can be accessed as stand-alone learning tools or embedded in
learning applications that can be downloaded and accessed anytime/anywhere by a
diversity of teachers and learners. Development of the animations is being
guided by learning research that provides for better understanding of those
components of an animation that aid student learning and that allow for
effective delivery on mobile devices. The multiple-design concepts being
incorporated by the project are making the animations attractive to a larger
learner base, and allowing teachers to reconsider how complex processes may be
taught.
