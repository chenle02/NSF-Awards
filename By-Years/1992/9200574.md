This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
research by Dr. Colin P. Horwitz of the Chemistry Department, Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, on manganese(II) complexes of Schiff bases. These
compounds promote 4-electron reduction of molecular oxygen and form metal
complexes which often incorporate one or more of the oxygen atoms. The goal of
the research is to investigate the mechanism of reactions of this type, and test
the validity of a proposed reaction pathway involving a Mn(III)-molecular oxygen
Schiff-base anion. Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods will be used to
detect the intermediates and examine the effect of structure on the reactivity
of the complexes. The Schiff bases will be modified to provide electronic and
structural changes in the metal complex which will help to stabilize the
intermediates. %%% A number of mechanisms have been proposed for these
reactions, and this study will help to clarify how molecular oxygen binds to
manganese and how manganese promotes the cleavage of the O-O bond. The results
will increase understanding of the behavior of oxygenase enzymes which contain
manganese and assist in the design of Mn-based catalyts capable of partial
oxygenation reactions with molecular oxygen.
