9311764 Bansil The processes of phase separation in polymer solutions and gels
are of importance both technologically and from a fundamental viewpoint. An
understanding of the kinetics of these processes is crucial to either promote or
prevent phase separation in the fabrication of composite materials. Small-angle
light scattering and video microscopic techniques will be used to study the
kinetics of phase separation processes via the mechanisms of spinodal
decomposition and nucleation in polymer solutions and gels. By combining these
two methods it is possible to explore phase separation kinetics from early to
late stages and also to determine the time-evolution of both the structure
factor and the real-space morphology. The aim of the proposed study is to
determine the relationships characterizing the time evolution of the domain
structure following a quench into the two phase region. ***
