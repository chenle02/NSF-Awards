Accurate mathematical analysis and efficient numerical methods play an
increasingly important role in studying partial differential equation models in
the petroleum industry. The goal of this project is to carry out research in
mathematical analysis and design of high-order-accuracy numerical methods for
the modified Buckley-Leverett (MBL) model, which is a partial differential
equation model for water-drive secondary underground oil recovery. When an
underground source of oil is tapped, a certain amount of oil flows out on its
own due to pressure difference. After the flow stops, there is typically a
significant amount of oil still left in the ground. One standard method of
"secondary recovery" is to pump water into the oil field through an injection
well, forcing oil out through a production well. In this process there will be a
water and oil mixture created. The MBL equation models the evolution of the oil
saturation in the entire oil reservoir, in particular, at the production well.

This research project combines mathematical analysis, design of numerical
schemes, and computational techniques. The mathematical analysis is based on
partial differential equation theory, and the numerical methods under
development are based on state-of-the-art discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes.
The results will be cross-validated using data from laboratory experiments. The
investigator plans to carry out the following specific research tasks: (1)
extend the well-developed 1D MBL model to 2D and 3D fully nonlinear and
linearized MBL models; (2) determine the approximation error induced by
employing the MBL model on a spatial domain smaller than an entire reservoir;
(3) design high-order-accuracy discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to
numerically solve the MBL model; (4) study the nonlinear asymptotic stability of
the traveling-wave solutions of the MBL model; (5) employ experimental data to
cross-validate both the analytical and computational conclusions. The project
involves a postdoctoral associated and a graduate student in the research. The
investigator also plans to develop a new graduate-level course on numerical
solutions to water-drive oil recovery models.
