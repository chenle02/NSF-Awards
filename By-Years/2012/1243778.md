Objective: This project will explore modulation of an optical beam by another
optical beam on the picosecond time scale, using newly developed semiconductor
microcavity structures. Our goal is to show high efficiency of this method so
that it can be developed for optical communications applications. A particular
goal will be to demonstrate amplification, in which the modulation of the output
beam is greater than that of the input beam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit: This method is based on the generic method of switching between strong
coupling and weak coupling of electronic and photonic states, which has been
demonstrated in numerous microcavity systems, including at room temperature. The
switching method we will explore can be easily adapted to a number of different
structures in which strong coupling has been demonstrated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: If this method works efficiently, it can
be a transformative method for optical communications, allowing modulation of
light by another light beam at the same wavelength on picosecond time scale in a
compact structure. In particular, because of the single-wavelength operation,
cascading of devices, in which the output of one device becomes the input of the
next, is possible. This can impact the entire optical communications industry,
because optical switching methods known to date suffer from various problems,
including needing beams of different wavelengths, very large structures, or very
high input beam power.
