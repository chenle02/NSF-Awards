The Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh has
designed a research project to examine the process of and outcomes of informal
(out of school) web-based learning. "Conceptualizing and Assessing Web-based
Informal Science Education" will be a three-year research study to document and
analyze how the informal learner, both as an individual and in a social group,
uses and learns from web-based activities. The PIs will also develop a framework
and tools for evaluating informal web-based learning environments and guidelines
for effective web-based learning activities. This research will use web sites
developed by museums and that are complementary to exhibits in those museums.
These sites are being selected because according to the PIs, "museums and other
nonprofit developers are already going beyond traditional content to create true
virtual informal learning environments." The outcomes of this research will
include a better understanding of the cognitive and social processes that occur
as learners engage in web-based activities; a framework and tools for evaluating
informal web-based learning activities; and a web-based annotated bibliography
relevant to this research. &lt;br/&gt;
