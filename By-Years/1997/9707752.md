The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University will purchase
workstations which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: 1. Algorithmic strategies for discrete optimization
problems 2. Industrial applications of nonlinear dynamical systems 3. Modeling
of composite materials 4. Simulation in stochastic modeling 5.Applications to
cryptography
