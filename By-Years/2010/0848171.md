With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Prof. Frank
Bright of the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, and his
group are studying the development of reagentless nanoscopic optical sensors for
detecting and quantifying a wide variety of analytes. The work addresses three
main aims: (i) creation of molecularly imprinted sensors with silicon quantum
dots in porous silicon material surfaces; (ii) elucidating the effects of
imprinting/surface chemistry and nanoscopic feature size on analytical figures
of merit; and (iii) assessing device applicability to a variety of small
molecule and protein analytes. The specific chemistry, techniques, methods and
theoretical underpinnings developed in this research will provide a powerful
platform for detecting small molecular targets and proteins in complex
milieu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the broader scientific impact of the
research, the research will result in the training of female and
underrepresented minority students and postdoctoral researchers in Prof.
Bright's laboratories. Prof. Bright and his postdoctoral and graduate student
colleagues will also be participating in educational and outreach efforts at
Buffalo's Native American Magnet School to provide meaningful educational
opportunities for young American Indian students.
