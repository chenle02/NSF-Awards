There is a considerable need for alternative techniques for the rapid separation
of biological macromolecules. The PI proposes using the principle of Lorentz
forces (i.e., a combination of electrical and magnetic fields) to effect a
separation. While the theoretical basis for Lorentz forces is well known, its
applicability to biological macromolecules has not been examined. This proposal
seeks to test experimental conditions to demonstrate the feasibility of using
Lorentz forces for biological separations.
