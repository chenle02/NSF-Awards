In this project, the effects of school-level, neighborhood-level, and individual
level variables on youth crime are analyzed using a dataset that is combined
from a multi-level survey and the Census. This study addresses the complex issue
of adolescent crime in contemporary society by taking into account youth
capacity to make decisions and by examining adolescents in different areas in
the U.S. in the 21st century. It considers contemporary adolescent crime as a
product of the interrelationship between decision-making and various social
contexts in youth life including school environment, neighborhood milieu, family
dynamics, and other important domains. Results from this project will help
develop recommendations for youth crime reduction strategies and will facilitate
collaborations between sociologists, criminologists, educators, decision makers,
and other stakeholders on strategies concerning adolescent crime prevention.

This analysis will use a unique dataset constructed by combining data from a
recently conducted multi-level survey of over 2,000 middle and high school
students from 40 schools in several metropolitan areas in the U. S. (ISRD, Wave
III), the U.S. Census, and the National Center for Education Statistics.
Different types of quantitative analyses will be employed, such as multi-level
modeling, to address the cross-level interactional effects of predictors on
adolescent crime.
