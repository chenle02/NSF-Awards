Under the direction of Dr. Patrick Kirch, Ms Dana Lepofsky, a graduate student
at the University of California/Berkeley, will collect data for her doctoral
dissertation. Her research focusses on the prehistory of the Society Island
group in Polynesia and she will conduct extensive survey and limited excavation
in a variety of environmental zones on several islands. In particular, her work
will focus on the development of agriculture and her survey will note the
position of agricultural fields and associated structures such as irrigation
canals. Limited excavation will provide radiocarbon samples for absolute dating.
The relationship with habitation sites and monuments will also be noted. In a
second aspect of the project MS Lepofsky will examine the relationship between
agriculture and environmental change to determine the extent to which
agricultural practices are first responsible for, and secondly responsive to
upland erosion which resulted from deforestation. With these data MS Lepofsky
should be able to trace the development of prehistoric agriculture over time.
Oceanic anthropologists are extremely interested in the extreme variation in
social complexity observed on different Polynesian islands. In some cases large
and complex chieftainships developed while in others groups remained relatively
small and egalitarian. This situation has provided an excellent test case to
examine the processes which underlay cultural development. The model most widely
accepted today links development to environment and the nature of the
agricultural system employed; it postulates that the development of intensive
agricultural systems are necessary for advanced degrees of social complexity.
From this perspective the Society Islands are of particular interest because
ethnographic data indicates considerable complexity but little agricultural
intensification. Ms Lepofsky's research will determine if, in fact, this is the
case. This research is important for several reasons. The Society Islands are
not archaeologically well known and the results of this work will interest a
large number of researchers. It will shed light on the relationship between
agricultural practice and soil erosion in Pacific island settings and on the
processes which underlay the development of complex societies. It will also
assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
