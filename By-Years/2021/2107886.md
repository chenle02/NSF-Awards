The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will explore the
market need for an efficient automated biopsy diagnostic process. Annually, 2.5
million Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies are performed in the US. Twenty
percent of these FNAs will prove to be inadequate for diagnosis or downstream
molecular testing. This failure results in patients being re-admitted for repeat
FNA biopsies and, as a consequence, insurers, hospital, physicians and patients
lose time and money, and patients have added anxiety as they wait for medical
results. This failure amounts to over $3 billion in annual losses from all
parties. The proposed technology would improve patient access to high quality
cancer diagnostics and reduce unnecessary repeat procedures due to
inefficiencies in the biopsy processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project aims to validate the need for an automated biopsy process. The Rapid On-
Site Evaluation (ROSE) technology checks the adequacy of a specimen as part of a
Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Although FNA is usually image-guided (e.g.
through a computerized tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound guidance), the
procedure itself is still regarded as a (semi-) blind procedure. It is not
unusual to have inadequate (sometimes acellular) specimens that lack a
sufficient amount of appropriate material, leading to diagnostic or therapy
guidance failure, increased cost and unnecessary physical and emotional
consequences for the patient. The proposed ROSE technology may vastly increase
sampling efficiency and improve the patient experience, while reducing
costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
