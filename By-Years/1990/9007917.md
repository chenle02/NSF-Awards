The research is on a methodology for efficiently analyzing high performance MOS
and bipolar circuits but with capabilities for predicting the analog behavior.
Prototype software is being developed for analyzing logic path delays. The
algorithms are based in the asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) method which
enables the analysis of general RLC interconnect models. The AWE capabilities
are being used to develop a waveform analyzer for high speed bipolar and MOS
logic gate and interconnect models. Specific topics being investigated are a.
evaluating the logic stage waveforms, b. developing gate delay models for both
technologies, c. modeling the coupling between logic states, d. statistical
waveform analysis, and e. analyzing deformed logic stage models.
