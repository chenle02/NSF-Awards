This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) funds a twelve-month
exploratory research effort for development of a systematic way to organize and
navigate computational science curriculum concepts and elements to successive
levels of detail in a hierarchical framework using concept maps. It is
anticipated that an outcome of this exploratory effort will be the creation of a
curriculum content authoring tool for web-based content that would allow faculty
to design a curriculum so that students can explore computational science
concepts based on natural conceptual linkages between ideas rather than based on
specific course content.
