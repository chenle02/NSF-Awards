This project targets an important aspect of online privacy by giving users the
ability to hide their communication patterns through anonymous communication.
Anonymous communication mitigates the "dossier effect," where third parties can
accumulate enough information about users to construct a detailed profile,
regardless of the use of encryption. This project addresses two key research
issues in anonymous communication: scale and performance. To support large user
bases, it is necessary to redesign the current centralized architecture of
anonymous communication systems and replace it with a peer-to-peer one. The
project studies the myriad security, privacy, and performance issues introduced
by such a change. Better performance will improve the usability of anonymous
communication to make it a reasonable option for routine Internet use. The
ultimate goal is to make anonymity technology accessible to all people for
appropriate uses and to integrate it into basic Internet protocols.
