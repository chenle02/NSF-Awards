Professor Onak of California State Los Angeles University will conduct studies
of carborane chemistry with funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program; the award is made through the Research in Undergraduate
Institutions program of NSF. The research to be conducted focuses on the
reactivity of carboranes. Specifically, experiments will be conducted to probe
the partial cage opening of closo-C2B6H8 and other carboranes with hydride ion,
amines, and fluoride ion. Carborane rearrangements and equilibria among
carboranes will also be explored, as will cage growth and insertions. 2D NMR and
IGLO calculations will be prominent among the methodologies to be used. %%%
Chemical research will be conducted on the reactivity of molecules that are
based on cage-shaped clusters of carbon and boron atoms. These molecules place
the carbon atoms in extraordinary environments in which they can be bonded to as
many as 6 other atoms. Experiments will be conducted to discover, assess, and
develop methods to "open" the cages, to alter the arrangement of the atoms
within the cages, and to increase the number of atoms that constitute the cages.
This fundamental research will lead to general insights regarding the chemistry
of cage-type molecules.
