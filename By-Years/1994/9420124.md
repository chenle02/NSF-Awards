9420124 Pierce Plants accumulate phytoalexins as one of several active- defense
mechanisms. These infection-induced, low molecular weight, antimicrobial
compounds have been shown in several host/pathogen systems to accumulate in
planta to concentrations sufficient to account for pathogen inhibition, judging
from in vitro bioassays. The question remains whether they are essential for
resistance. If plants rely on phytoalexins for a significant fraction of their
resistance, then genes controlling phytoalexin synthesis are worthy targets for
genetic manipulation with potential for crop improvement. This project will test
the necessity of phytoalexins for resistance to bacterial blight in cotton by
producing transgenic plants with altered ability to accumulate phytoalexins and
evaluating their resistance following inoculation with Xanthomonas campestris
pv. malvacearum. By manipulating phytoalexin accumulation apart from other
aspects of the hypersensitive resistant response, the project will provide a
clearer understanding of how plants need to react in order to successfully fight
disease.
