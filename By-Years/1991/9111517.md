Blue ribbon studies have noted the poor state of training of students in
observational aspects of atmospheric sciences. Previously, the Principal
Investigator integrated "hands on" field experience with a formal graduate
course. This course on the physics of clouds included a two week field component
which provided students with actual experience on a research aircraft from the
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The Principal Investigator
proposes a similar effort associated with studies in remote sensing. In this
case, the field component will include a two week field trip to the CHILL
national radar facility at Colorado State University. The students will have use
of the radar with guidance being provided by the Principal Investigator and
nationally recognized radar meteorologists from Colorado State University and
the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Each student will be assigned a
research area which will include weather targets of opportunity as well as
previously collected case studies which can be replayed over the radar system.
