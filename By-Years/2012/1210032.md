This action funds Huanan Zhang of University of Michigan to conduct a research
project, entitled "Gold Nanorods for fast detection of prions in complex
biological fluids," during the summer of 2012 at Jiangnan University in Wuxi,
Jiangshu Province, China. The host scientist is Professor Chuanlai Xu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop a new approach for
misfolded protein detection that takes advantage of unique properties of
nanoparticle assemblies, and existing knowledge of protein detection on
nanoparticle assembly.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
