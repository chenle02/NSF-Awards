Understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and uncovering the
particle-physics origins of dark matter and dark energy are some of the most
fundamental questions in our quest to understand the Universe at both
microscopic and cosmological scales. The PI's on this project will investigate a
wide range of innovative ideas in particle physics and cosmology: theoretical
descriptions of the mechanisms of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), such
as supersymmetry and extra dimensions; collider phenomenology; grand unified
theories and quantum gravity; dark matter and particle cosmology. Much of this
research will be of direct relevance for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which
recently started its operations et the European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN), as well as for several other upcoming landmark
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is also envisioned to have
significant broader impacts. The HEP Theory group at UC Irvine plans to play an
essential role in UC Irvine's QuarkNet program, where high school teachers and
their students are introduced to current research in high energy physics. These
efforts will be complemented by additional public outreach activities, the
training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and professional
service.
