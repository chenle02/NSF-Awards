Abstract

African American and Latina/Latino Adolescents' Perceptions of and Responses to
Racial Discrimination

William David Wakefield

Student achievement typically has been defined as performing well on academic
coursework and successfully advancing through each grade level until graduation.
However, in today's multiethnic, multiracial, culturally diverse society,
another factor that may influence academic achievement for ethnic minority young
people is their perceptions of discrimination in U.S. society. Discrimination
likely influences orientation toward school and subsequently academic
achievement. This research is grounded in the disciplines of adolescent
development and social psychology. Two facets of particular interest in this
study include better understanding factors influencing adolescents' perceptions
of discrimination and subsequent thinking about how to respond to racial
discrimination.

This project has three goals: (1) to develop a clear understanding of how
adolescents' understand and think about perceived discrimination that they may
likely encounter at school and outside of school using developed quantitative
measures and through development of qualitative interviews; (2) to disseminate
the results to a national audience through peer-reviewed documents and
presentations and including undergraduate and graduate research assistants in
national conference participation, presentations, and publications; and (3) to
create a viable and sustainable research and mentorship program within the
Interdisciplinary Program in Child Development at California State University,
Northridge. This program will mentor and train underrepresented undergraduate
and graduate students in social science research skills and critical thinking
through multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to understanding
ethnic minority adolescents' development using a multi-tiered approach. This
program will ultimately assist in preparing future minority child & adolescent
development scientists for application into M.A. and Ph.D. programs.
