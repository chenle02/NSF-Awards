9321741 POE Assessing the frequency of occurrence of repression or state
terrorism within the world's sovereign states is an important, difficult, and
controversial task. Yet, despite increased worldwide interest in human rights
and the regular publication of profiles of national human rights situations, we
still require more systematic knowledge as to why regimes resort to repression.
This investigation seeks to develop a theory explaining why regimes use state
terrorism against citizens, to develop the data necessary to test that theory,
and to analyze the applicability of that theory to the repression record of the
world's nations during the last two decades. The theory will include the factors
previous research has linked to the use of state terrorism, but it will also
include new possible causes of repression not yet analyzed using empirical data.
The investigators will test the applicability of the theory for (1) the entire
global sample, (2) different regions and time frames, in order to judge whether
the determinants of repression vary across time, or differ depending on the
region of the world one examines. This should allow the researchers to develop
better "causal" models of repression that take into account both the direct and
indirect effects of the factors they find to be important in their earlier
analyses. When these analyses are completed, the investigators plan to work
toward a global human rights monitoring system based on a broad base of
empirical information and designed to help them foresee positive and negative
national trends in repression. ***
