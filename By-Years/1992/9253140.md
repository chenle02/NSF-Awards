This activity aims at a systemic examination of the educational, technological
and financial terrain that extends beyond the present very modest frontier of
educational telecommunication activities by schools to over- the-horizon network
applications. It aims at affecting NREN planning and experimentation, which
should, in turn, produce data on costs, educational benefits and demand that can
affect public and private sector investment decisions. It aims too at developing
an initial consensus among educators on the role of wideband network
applications that goes beyond the technologically and educationally modest
experimentation presently visible. Project outcomes include three documents. The
principal document of some 50 to 60 pages includes a suite of experimental
designs and a summary assessment of their educational potential by educational
policy and decision makers. Three designs, more and less educationally radical,
technologically advanced and financially expensive are aimed at improving
science and mathematics education; and structuring new options for school
reform. A shorter secondary document describes educational needs for group
software products, information services and educational databases. A final
document describes some options for allocating costs and for financing
educational use of local and wide-area network applications. Dissemination is
planned in both print and conference formats.
