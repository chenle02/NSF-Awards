A test, low-rise building and a meteorological tower have been built on open,
flat terrain at Texas Tech University. The test building can be rotated
automatically on a tract and is fully instrumented to gather structural external
and internal pressures due to high winds which are quite prevalent in the area.
Winds are characterized by measurements taken at the 160 ft tall tower and data
is recorded in digital form. The present project is to finalize the calibration
of the instrumentation in the building and the tower, and to start acquiring,
analyzing and disseminating field wind and building surface pressure data.
