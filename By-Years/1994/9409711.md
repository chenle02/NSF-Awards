The PI proposes to investigate high performance work teams. His partner in this
Private Sector Initiative, Sara Lee Knit Products, has found considerable
variation in the performance of the work teams implemented throughout their
organization. The PI will test work team performance models in three textile
plants. Qualitative and quantitative analyses will be performed on a 12-month
longitudinal data set containing work team performance measures, employee
perceptions, and team composition information.
