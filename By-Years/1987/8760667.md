This research is to provide a novel means for constructing braces which support
the limbs of persons who do not have the musculature to support themselves. The
PI will mix thermo- plastics with synthetic fibers. This composite should
substantially increase strength, yet significantly reduce weight. An
experimental investigation of the composite can be used to quantitate the
physical properties after it has been formed. Experience will direct the PI to
produce the right composition for the necessary strength and rigidity. If
successful, this research could lead to a new generation of external supports
for limbs.
