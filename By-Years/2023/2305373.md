The field of homotopy theory is the study of mathematical structures that are
insensitive to deformations. It is applicable whenever one is interested in
studying qualitative aspects of a system, emergent properties of a statistical
ensemble, or whenever there might be imprecision in the specification of the
state of a system. In recent years the methods of homotopy theory have found use
in fields as diverse as the physics of materials and the study of algebraic
equations. This project aims to bolster these relationships with new tools from
homotopy theory, and is focused on applications to classical algebraic geometry
and the theory of manifolds. Broader impacts of this project include work with
students and postdoctoral researchers.

In more specialized terms, the work in this proposal involves two main themes of
study. One describes advances in motivic homotopy theory that achieve the goals
of a longstanding vision concerning an interface between complex analysis,
algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. It exhibits a very close alignment
between the topological construction of vector bundles over smooth algebraic
varieties and the much more challenging construction of algebraic ones. Another
aspect of motivic homotopy theory studied is the structure of cohomology rings
of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces in that setting. The other theme offers a new
approach to the "Immersion Conjecture," which is one of the most famous theorems
about general manifolds, and promises to simplify and clarify the notoriously
complicated existing proof. Part of this line on the Immersion Conjecture
involves spaces which are potentially models for spaces BO/I_n constructed by
Brown and Peterson that are understood only weakly.
