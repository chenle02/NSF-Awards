This travel grant supports two US participants to attend the International
Workshop on Stochastic Image Grammars (SIG-11). The notion of stochastic image
grammars encompasses hierarchical representations of objects and events
occurring in images and video, and their associated learning and inference
algorithms. The virtue of image grammars lies in their expressive power to
represent an exponentially large number of object and event configurations by
using a relatively much smaller vocabulary, and a few compositional rules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics, machine learning, natural language processing,
and cognitive psychology experience a resurgence of stochastic grammars. In
computer vision, however, this momentum seems to be present only in the area of
2D object recognition. The main objective of the workshop is to promote
interdisciplinary research among these traditionally separate scientific
disciplines toward grammar-based formulations of a wider range of vision
problems, beyond object recognition, such as, e.g., 3D structure from motion,
and activity recognition. The workshop is also aimed at reducing the apparent
disconnect between research groups working on image grammars, by addressing the
need for a unified theoretical framework. To this end, SIG-11 provides a forum
for sharing research experiences in grammars between the vision community and
the keynote speakers who are experts in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and
natural language processing. Solicited peer-reviewed papers are expected to be
published in the proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computer
Vision.
