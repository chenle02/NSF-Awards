In today's era of big data, we frequently encounter large amounts of data that
are geometric, or that may be represented as points or objects in geometric
spaces. There is a growing need for the design of efficient data structures that
can process and answer queries about such geometric data quickly. This project
focuses on some of the most fundamental and central data structuring problems in
computational geometry, and explores new ideas to obtain improved results on
these longstanding problems. The research project will be integrated with the
development of courses for undergraduate and graduate students that incorporate
the latest research findings on geometric data
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the fundamental problems studied are
point location and nearest neighbor search. The project will also investigate
geometric data structure problems in new settings that arise from modern-day
applications, including distance-related problems in high dimensions, distance-
related problems concerning unit-disk graphs (frequently used to model ad hoc
wireless networks) and other types of geometric graphs, and streaming algorithms
that can process high volumes of geometric data quickly with a limited amount of
storage space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
