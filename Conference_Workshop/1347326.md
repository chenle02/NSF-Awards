This award will support an NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conference to be held at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham, June 16-20, 2014. The topic is Quantum
Spin Systems. The distinguished lecturer will be Professor Bruno Nachtergaele
from UC Davis. The lectures will address foundations, but also recent
developments such as Lieb-Robinson bounds and their applications to statistical
mechanics and quantum information theory.

The NSF/CBMS program focuses on important and timely research, with 10 lectures
delivered by a leading researcher. We will fund approximately 30 participants,
especially including graduate students and young researchers. A critical aspect
of the NSF/CBMS conference is the production of a monograph by the distinguished
lecturer. Bruno Nachtergaele's notes on quantum spin systems will be very
welcome both by students and practitioners in the field. One of the applications
of the mathematical topic is quantum information theory, including quantum
computation.
