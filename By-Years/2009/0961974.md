Most volcanism occurs along plate boundaries, along mid-ocean ridges and
volcanic arcs. Broadly speaking, the causes of volcanism in these setting is
understood, while the causes of the lee voluminous volcanism that occurs in
plate interiors remain obscure. This project will test the novel hypothesis that
intraplate volcanism along the Hawaiian Arch and along some continental margins
is caused by interactions between rising plumes of mantle material and the
overlying lithosphere by a combination of numerical and analog (physical)
modeling. The results will shed light on the interaction of the lithosphere and
the underlying mantle. This project will lead to better understanding of
Hawaiian volcanism, in which there is broad public interest. Broader impacts
public lectures on this topic and training of students in numerical methods and
geodynamic numerical modeling.
