This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to establish the relative
contribution of three distinct mechanisms in improvement of damaged bone tissue
mechanical properties. The three mechanisms evaluated are: (a) changes in whole
bone structure by a process termed modeling, (b) replacement of damaged tissue
with newly formed intact tissue by a process termed remodeling, and (c) repair
by cells embedded in bone termed "osteocytes". These three mechanisms are
expected to improve mechanical properties of damaged bone at the mm-scale,
micro-scale and nano-scale over periods of days, weeks, and months,
respectively. Deliverables include the development of a novel image correlation
technique to determine strains within bone, development of analytical and
computational models validated using experiments to analyze the relative
importance of the three distinct repair mechanisms, and the development of new
courses to educate and provide research experiences to students and high-school
teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
provide a fundamental understanding of the hierarchies of repair of damaged bone
at different length- and time- scales. This research will provide insight into a
novel mechanism that can contribute towards substantial improvement of damaged
bone material properties, i.e. the repair process mediated by osteocytes. These
studies will lead to knowledge regarding dynamic factors that affect bone
quality, while providing another cellular repair mechanism that can be targeted
by pharmaceuticals to reduce fracture risk. Graduate and undergraduate student
training will be provided and research results incorporated into classes. In
addition, the PI will provide classroom instruction in conjunction with
laboratory research experiences to broaden participation by minorities, high-
school students and K-12 teachers.
