0414300 Harmon This proposal by UC Merced and the Center for Embedded Networked
Sensing (CENS) at UCLA targets the greater San Joaquin River basin (SJRB) for
distributed, networked sensing of watershed quality.&lt;br/&gt;Creating a large-
scale sensor network that integrates in-situ and remote sensor data with state-
of-the-art simulators and adaptive management tools will require interdiscipline
collaboration of the highest caliber, and will result in an observational
network that reveals previously unobservable phenomena. The sensor network will
serve as a model for elucidating trends and differentiating between cyclical and
episodic trend drivers, including interannual and spatially distributed
variations in water cycle components from changes created by global warming and
intermittent events, such as brush fires, droughts, and El Nino episodes.
