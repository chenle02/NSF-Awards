Twelve undergraduate students from across the nation will spend ten weeks
during the summer at the J. R. Macdonald Laboratory at Kansas State University
to engage in research in experimental and theoretical atomic physics. Many
exciting and challenging experiments in atomic collisions are being carried out
at the JRM Laboratory which is equipped with a variety of accelerators and a new
EBIS source for producing multiply charged ions. These undergraduate students
will share the excitement of research and to gain experience in using these
unique facilities through their participation in carrying out research with the
large body of faculty and graduate students in the JRM Laboratory. This
experience will help students in making decisions toward a career in scientific
research.
