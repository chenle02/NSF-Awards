This project is developing a novel approach to natural language generation,
applying it to computer-aided text and speech generation for people with
physical disabilities. Many people who cannot speak because of physical
disability utilize text-to- speech generators as prosthetic devices. However,
users of speech prostheses often have more general loss of motor control, and
despite aids such as word prediction, text entry is slow and difficult. For
typical users, current speech prostheses have output rates less than a tenth of
the speed of normal speech. This prevents natural social conversation, since it
completely disrupts the usual processes of turn-taking, and can lead to negative
effects on the listener's attitude to the prosthesis user. The main focus of
this research is the investigation of techniques which can improve rates
sufficiently for more natural conversation to be possible, without sacrificing
flexibility of content. This new approach employs a combination of a wide-
coverage grammar, corpus-based word frequency data, and conversational
templates. Applied to speech prosthesis, it enables the production of full
sentences from minimal user input in a context-sensitive way. The approach can
also be applied more generally for efficient production of formulaic text like
the structured reports used widely in business and government.
