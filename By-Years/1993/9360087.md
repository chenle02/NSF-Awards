9360087 Ahmed Technologies based on the injection of lime directly into flue gas
ducts in order to control sulfur dioxide show promise as being simpler and less
costly than acid-rain control approaches. Up to now, typical sulfur dioxide
removals with lime alone have been low (40 to 60 percent), and sorbent
utilizations have been not satisfactory. Sorbent Technologies Corporation
researchers have proposed a concept to significant improve sulfur dioxide remove
efficiency and sorbent utilization. By coating the lime onto an inexpensive
support phase, expanded vermiculite or perlite, and moistening the combination
slightly before introducing it into the duct, extremely high sulfur dioxide
removals were possible. By recycling the sorbents, high utilizations could be
achieved. The concept was examined at U.S. SPA's North Carolina laboratories
with good results. This Phase I project will continue the proof-of-concept
testing at Sorbtech's laboratories, specifically aimed at developing a
performance model and testing the model by characterizing how changes in process
and sorbent variables affect sorbent performance. The new technology represents
a low-cost solution to the current acid rain problem. If fully developed, it
should be attractive to utilities and industrial firms that burn coal or fuel
oil. ***
