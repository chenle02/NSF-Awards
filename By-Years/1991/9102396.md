The fundamental process of the low frequency noise in High Tc YBCO films and
devices will be investigated. Experiments will be conducted on line strips,
microbridges and dc SQUID's of various sizes. The YBCO films will be fabricated
in-house in collaboration with Dr. Carmine Vittoria of Northeastern University
by laser ablation on MgO. In addition YBCO films fabricated by e-beam co-
evaporation on LaAl03 will be provided by AT&T and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. These
studies of fundamental processes are designed to examine existing noise models
for superconductors, namely, temperature fluctuation, flux motion, critical
current fluctuation, and quasiparticle scattering models.
