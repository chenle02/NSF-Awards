The objectives of this research and development program are to provide an
improved performance and erosion analysis tool for the industrial and scientific
communities; and to develop design criteria for the manufacture and
commercialization of a reliable slurry jet pump of high performance and
durability. To meet these objectives, a comprehensive numerical simulation
program was developed for evaluating particle transport and erosion
characteristics in a slurry jet pump. A parametric design is being developed to
identify a family of prototype designs. An experimental evaluation is also
performed to quantify pumping performance and erosion characteristics for the
validation and improvement of the numerical simulation model. With the improved
model and experimental data, an efficient, erosion-tolerant, slurry jet pump
will be designed for a follow-on commercialization by industry.
