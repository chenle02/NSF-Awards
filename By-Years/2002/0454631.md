The project proposes to develop multiple choice items and instruments to be used
to measure the understanding of grades 5-12 students on selected NRC standards
in physical and earth/space science for grades K-4 and 5-8. Instead of
traditional multiple-choice items the project team will use existing knowledge
based on student alternative conceptions to develop misconception-based
diagnostic tests. These tests will use as distractors the alternative
conceptions that students often have in regard to scientific concenpts. The
project will move through a series of well designed steps in terms of item
generation, expert review and validation, instrument piloting, larger field
tests and finally use instruments in pilot studies to determine if students who
have been using particular curricula met particular NRC standards as measured by
these new instruments.
