The primary objective of this research is to design improved methods of
visualizing uncertainty in scientific displays. A secondary objective is to
identify and calculate uncertainty from data and algorithms. Almost all
scientific data contain uncertainty, which are as important to the proper
interpretation of the results as the original data. However, very few
visualization techniques depict uncertainty. This research will take two
approaches: mapping uncertainty information as an additional piece of data and
creating new visualization primitives and abstractions. The researchers will use
experimentation, metrics, and application expert(s evaluations to find the right
combination of techniques. Visualization is a valuable tool in understanding
large amounts of data and the phenomenon represented by these data. Complete
specification of data should include uncertainty. The resulting techniques
should significantly improve all visualization and graphics applications where
data uncertainty is a concern.
