Southern Ocean primary production derives largely from microalgal photosynthesis
in the water column and in sea ice. While production in open waters appears low,
production in the marginal ice zones appears to be high. Recent evidence
suggests that sea ice production may account for a substantial fraction of
Southern Ocean ecosystem production. This Accomplishment-Based Renewal proposal
will continue the sea-ice algal productivity studies carried out by Dr. Sullivan
and his team. Their results and those of others suggest that ice algal
productivity is limited by light availability and temperature rather than
nutrient availability. This project will focus on the photobiology of individual
sea ice microalgal species using high resolution microphotometric techniques,
high performance liquid chromatographic techniques, and track
microautoradiography. Laboratory efforts will characterize the photosynthetic
parameters for the individual species which dominate in various microhabitats of
the Antarctic sea ice system. This will provide the data set necessary for the
development of models of sea ice ecosystem productivity.
