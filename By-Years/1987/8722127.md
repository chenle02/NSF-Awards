Large Three-component seismic data sets from microseismic and controlled sources
in a widespread variety of tectonic and lithologic environments - geothermal,
deep crustal, ocean floor, seismotectonic, and sedimentary - have yielded
evidence for anisotropic shear wave velocities. The observed effect of
anisotropy, called shear wave splitting, is an analog of optical birefringence
in calcite, and for the upper crust may be interpreted in terms of a population
of oriented vertical microcracks or fractures in the crust. As fracture
populations, particularly aligned fracture populations, tend to control
hydraulic conductivity in crystalline and sedimentary rock, there is a wide-
ranging interest in identifying, interpreting, and modeling the seismic evidence
for in situ volumes of aligned fractures. The study and interpretation of
oriented crack fracture system in the crust is the principal purpose of the AGU
Chapman Conference on Seismic Anisotropy in the Crust to be held at the
Lawrence-Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, California, May 31 to June 4, 1988.
