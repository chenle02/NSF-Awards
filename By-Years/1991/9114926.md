Dr. Allan Muth is Director of the P. L. Boyd Deep Canyon Research Center. The
Center is part of the University of California Natural Reserve System, and is
administered by the University of California at Riverside. The Center is
adjacent to the San Bernadino National Forest and encompasses habitats ranging
from desert canyon floor below sealevel to Upper Sonoran life zones. Dr. Muth
proposes construction of a residence for visiting scientists, drilling a water
well for the Station, renovation of an existing building into several labs, and
acquisition of basic lab equipment for the renovated labs. The proposed
construction and renovation will increase the research productivity of the
Center, and will facilitate more in- depth studies of desert ecology and
physiological adaptations to heat and water stress. Research on these topics is
especially important for management and conservation of the fragile desert
environment, and for a better understanding of the effects of global climate
change.
