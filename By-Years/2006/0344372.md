Knowledge of global patterns of biodiversity are based on aboveground
ecosystems, even though these systems are integrally linked belowground. This
grant will be the first to extend our knowledge of the unseen world in soils by
determining if soils have regional and global patterns and hotspots of
biodiversity and how these relate to aboveground diversity and ecosystem
functioning. Using molecular techniques and ecosystem techniques, this research
will integrate knowledge at the species level to ecosystem function.
Establishing knowledge on soil biodiversity has implications for management of
invasive species, for prioritizing sites for conservation, and for determining
how global terrestrial ecosystems function.
