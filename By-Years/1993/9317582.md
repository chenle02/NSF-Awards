The cultural heritage of most Native American tribal groups incorporates
considerable knowledge of and experience with the natural world. Some of this
traditional knowledge includes detailed understanding of habits, ecological
communities and cycles, seasonal variation, microdistributions, plant ecology,
animal behavior, and the recent history of plant and animal species. Despite
these powerful cultural traditions, Native Americans are the most
underrepresented minority in the sciences in general, and in environmentally
oriented sciences in particular. Our goal is to introduce Native American
college students early in their careers to environmental research under the
close supervision of top scientists in the field, giving them the opportunity to
work on research projects during their undergraduate careers. Native students
completing this program should be competitive with the best college graduates in
the country from any institution in terms of hands-on research experience.
Student will begin their training in basic research methods at Haskell Indian
College, transferring in their third year to University of Kansas to complete
the B.S. degree. Mentorship activities will be provided throughout their
experience at both Haskell and Kansas. A long-term goal of the program is to
train and develop Native American professionals who will not only carry on
research in Environmental Biology, but will also teach courses and supervise
research in the environmental sciences at Native American institutions of higher
learning such as Haskell.
