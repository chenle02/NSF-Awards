Gardner, Florence U. of California, Berkeley This doctoral dissertation proposal
examines the use of temporary employment within two European companies located
in their home sites to that use in transplanted sites in the Greenville-
Spartanburg area in South Carolina. The research will be conducted through two
comparative case studies. The first case study will compare the use of temporary
employment in the home facilities of BMW and Michelin Tire and their transplant
facilities in Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina. The second case study will
compare the use of temporary employment in transplant facilities of these two
companies to that of the indigenous textile industries of several companies in
the same area. Data on workforce, job categories, employment variation, wages
and gender-sex will be gathered through semi-structured interviews with
personnel managers, union officials, permanent workers, and temporary workers at
each site. The work will contribute generally to the topic of economic
restructuring but more specifically to industrialization through foreign direct
investment in the use of contingent employment relations by identifying the
regional variation in the use of temporary work and the locality dependent
dimensions of this use.
