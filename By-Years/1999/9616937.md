The goal of this project is to produce a book-length examination of the early
agricultural context of genetic research in the United States, and of the
significance of that context for the development of genetics as a discipline.
The aim is to produce both a study of U.S. genetics in its first thirty years
and a case study of the relationship between institutional context and
intellectual content. More specifically, the study will document the prevalence
of Mendelian genetics in agricultural institutions, explain that involvement in
terms of U.S. agricultural policy and characteristics of those institutions, and
examine the implications for genetics research of the practical and theoretical
emphases of agriculture. The central purpose of the study is to demonstrate that
U.S. genetics, in its early decades was an agricultural discipline, and that
during this period its successes and failures were consequences of agricultural
policy and science that also went on to shape policy and science. When
completed, this study will be the first disciplinary history of genetics
focusing exclusively on the early decades within the United States.
