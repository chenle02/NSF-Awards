Abstract Retakh/Tabachnikov/Lanzani

The Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Arkansas has hosted
a series of annual conferences, focused on topics of current international
research that are also related to research activity within the Department. This
conference is focused on complex dynamics, and features several of the
international leaders in the field as well as many young investigators. Most of
the requested support is enable a substantial number of graduate students and
young researchers to attend the conference. There is also substantial support
from the Department. This award is to partially support this seminar.
