The Solar Wind 8 Conference, a major international space science conference,
will be held to discuss and learn about the solar and stellar winds. This
proposal will partially support participant costs for the meeting. Topics to be
discussed include: (1) corona and solar and stellar wind acceleration, (2) solar
wind composition and internal state, (3) solar wind structure, dynamics and
evolution, and (4) outer heliosphere, boundaries and interactions with the local
interstellar medium.***
