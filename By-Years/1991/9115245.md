The Duke University Marine Lab at Beaufort, North Carolina, is one of the
country's most active centers for marine research and for graduate training in
oceanography. The University has recently commissioned the Research Vessel Susan
Hudson, a 57' ship for coastal ocean research. Dr. Joseph Ramus, Director of the
Duke University Marine Lab, has requested shipboard equipment for water sampling
and for collecting plankton and bottom samples. The University also proposes to
renovate the pier and dockside electrical facilities for the new research
vessel. The proposed instrumentation and facilities renovation will have an
immediate impact on the many resident and visiting students and researchers at
the Duke University Marine Lab. The R/V Hudson will begin her active career
earlier and with more immediate capabilities for research and teaching. The
proposed improvements will convey significant benefits to a wide audience of
biologists and oceanographers.
