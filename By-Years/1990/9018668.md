A pilot study is propoosed to evaluate the usefulness of 15/N/14N ratios for
studying the sedimentary nitrogen cycle. Denitrification in marine sediments,
particularly on continental shelves, is a principal sink for combined nitrogen
from the ocean and in addition to nitrification is known to strongly fractionate
nitrogen isotopes. For sediments, coupled nitrification-denitrifcation and
transport control of fluxes are likely to strongly modify these fractionation
effects. Initial objectives will be to determine whether nitrogen isotopic
signals are sufficiently large such that they are both coherent and
interpretable. Model analysis suggests that this will be the case. Sites in
Buzzards Bay-MA, along a transect between the Gulf of Maine and Bermuda will be
studied. &amp;15N values for pore-water NO3-, NH4+, and sediment PN will be
determined downcore and flux chamber experiments will be carried out to
determine the net isotopic effect with respect to the water column. Incubation
experiments of core slices will be carried out to determine microbial
fractionation factors.
