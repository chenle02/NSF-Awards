The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
for undergraduate instruction and research. The instrument is being used in
experiments investigating gas phase reactions in the Physical Chemistry
Laboratory course, and the analysis of reaction mixtures and natural products in
advanced courses in analytical and inorganic chemistry. Extensive use of the
instrument is being made by undergraduate students engaged in research projects
investigating the synthesis and structure studies of Schiff base coordination
compounds as possible laser materials and the synthesis of silicon compounds of
theoretical interest.
