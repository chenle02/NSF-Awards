This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER),
examines the&lt;br/&gt;antecedents of public support for U.S. military
incursions into foreign states. In particular, it will&lt;br/&gt;examine the
factors that motivate U.S. citizens to support the proposed invasion of Iraq
through&lt;br/&gt;methodologies developed in social psychology. The current
international situation presents a&lt;br/&gt;unique yet perishable opportunity
to gather empirical data that address this topic. A growing body&lt;br/&gt;of
evidence suggests that individuals make punishment decisions on the basis of
just deserts rather&lt;br/&gt;than utilitarian justifications such as deterrence
or incapacitation. The present research will&lt;br/&gt;examine whether citizens
-- contacted through a nationally representative survey -- respond
to&lt;br/&gt;potential military action against sovereign states in a similar
manner. Specifically, it is&lt;br/&gt;hypothesized that support for war will be
determined primarily by an individual's perception that&lt;br/&gt;the foreign
state is deserving of the invasion, and that the invasion represents a morally
appropriate&lt;br/&gt;and proportional response to prior acts of harm. It is
further predicted that concerns with&lt;br/&gt;incapacitation (e.g., limiting
Iraq's ability to wage war), deterrence (e.g., inhibiting other
potential&lt;br/&gt;"rogue nations" from threatening U.S, interests), and
general utility (e.g., economic outcomes) will&lt;br/&gt;be only weakly related
to attitudes about the invasion. These studies represent an important
step&lt;br/&gt;forward in tracing individual psychology to matters of
international relations, and will provide a&lt;br/&gt;test of whether micro-
level theories of punishment can be extended to include macro-
level&lt;br/&gt;situations.&lt;br/&gt;
