The partners of the Louis Stokes Missouri Alliance for Minority Participation
(LS-MoAMP) are proposing to move the consortium into a Phase II initiative. The
new phase focuses on increasing baccalaureate production by fifteen percent
annually over a five-year period. A primary strategy proposed to support that
objective is to include all four-year public institutions in the partnership for
Phase II, increasing the collaborative by four institutions: Truman State
University, Missouri Western State College, Missouri Southern State College, and
Northwest Missouri State University. This addition is expected to increase
participation by twenty-five percent. The alliance's baseline and degree target
is adjusted to reflect this addition.
