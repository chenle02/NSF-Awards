&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will focus on improving the energy
efficiency of various drying processes. Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)
and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) are collaborating to
establish the proposed center, with WPI as the lead institution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center (CADR) will conduct industry-relevant
research in developing novel dehydration technologies to reduce energy
consumption by focusing primarily on agricultural and food processing, chemical,
forestry products, pharmaceutical, and textile industries. By focusing at the
intersection of mechanical and systems engineering with the agricultural and
food sciences, and pharmaceutical research, the center intends to assemble a
diverse and complementary set of researchers and industrial partners who are
uniquely suited to tackle several "grand challenge" types of problems in food
production, agriculturally-derived materials, and in chemical, forestry
products, and pharmaceutical industries. The flow of basic science and
applications among each of the technical areas will provide a cross-disciplinary
and translational research environment that will attract top researchers and
active industrial participation to the Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed center (CADR) will assist U.S. leadership in sustainable manufacturing
via improving the corresponding processes efficiencies. Dissemination of results
will be facilitated through the industry relationships that each collaborating
institution has developed through extensive previous industry/university project
work. Direct transfer of these results to industry will permit more rapid
adoption of new sustainable processes. CADR envisions a national yearly
symposium that will expand on the regional conferences. The new concepts
discovered by the Center will also be incorporated into traditional transport
phenomena coursework, equipping a new generation of engineers with the tools
necessary to implement sustainable manufacturing practices. CADR personnel at
WPI and UIUC are committed to cultural diversity to promote the participation of
minority students in the Center's work.
