Numerical modeling based on the boundary integral method is to be applied to
the study of liquid film stability under the action of gravity, surface tension,
and shear. The films will be considered as highly viscous, and the usual
simplifying approximation, whereby film thickness variations are assumed to
occur with wave lengths much larger than the film thickness, will not have to be
used. The development of film instabilities will be followed numerically into
the regime where surface deformation has become very large. The research is
relevant to phenomena in film technologies such as coating, lubrication, and
foams.
