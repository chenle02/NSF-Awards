0414274 Schnoor The specific objective of this proposal is to bring together key
researchers and agencies to plan a large-scale environmental analysis network to
analyze and (ultimately) improve water quality, economic activity, and
sustainable practices in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). This planning
grant will fund an expert group of researchers with field facilities in the UMRB
to: 1) report the best ideas for a UMRB Environmental Cyberinfrastructure (CI)
Network for future implementation; and 2) sponsor a Workshop on developing a
unique basin-scale network that will serve as a prototype for a national network
of real-time, remotely sensed, continuously-modeled river basins (part of
CLEANER) which utilizes accessible sensors and data bases, and enters results
into a national data base operating with common platforms and open architecture.
