With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Paul
Baures from Keene State College and colleagues Brian Anderson, James Kraly,
Richard Blatchly and Denise Junge will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The
proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially
in areas such as (a) medicinal chemistry research on inhibitors of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and cholera; (b) conformational analysis of
imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (I45DA) derivatives; (c) development of nature-
inspired antifreeze coatings; (d) peptide-lipid self-assembly; (e) structural
characterization of resveratrol isomers and derivatives; (f) synthesis and
characterization of ionic liquids; (g) synthesis and mechanistic studies of
metal catalysts; (h) synthesis of dopamine D1-agonists; and (i) studies of
structure-function relationships of inorganic
complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This
instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at
Keene State College but also at Saint Anselm College and other neighboring
institutions and local industrial partners.
