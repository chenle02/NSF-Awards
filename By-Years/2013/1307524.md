This planning project entitled PARTNERS FOR SUCCESS: Building Partnerships to
Increase Success of Underrepresented Minorities in Physics at the University of
Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is developing an innovative model to attract, retain,
and bridge underrepresented minority students to graduate school in physics. The
project aims to develop partnerships between Minority Serving Institutions
(MSIs) and degree granting institutions. The main idea is to develop a well-
structured mentoring and support model between the participating institutions
that will be institutionalized for sustainable impact.

Attention is paid to the students' steps of the path, from pre to post
baccalaureate. The project seeks to first attract students to the discipline and
then provide them with effective mentoring and a wealth of research
opportunities at the MSI. Then in partnership with doctoral degree granting
institutions, students are assisted in overcoming the challenges they face in
obtaining a doctoral degree in physics. Although this model will be implemented
at the UTEP, a Hispanic Serving Institution, it has the potential to impact
underrepresented minority students throughout the nation due to its
transferability.
