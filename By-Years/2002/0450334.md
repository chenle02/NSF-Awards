This interdisciplinary project team has recently built a new modeling system for
exploring coupled climatic-hydrologic processes by fully integrating all surface
and subsurface terrestrial reservoirs, and their governing dynamics, into a
state-of-the-art regional climate model, the Regional Atmospheric Modeling
System (RAMS). With this tool, i.e., RAMS-Hydrology, the project team will
produce downscaled scenarios of regional climate change impacts on the
terrestrial water cycle and investigate the two-way interactions between the
atmospheric, surface, and subsurface reservoirs that modulate these impacts. The
study will employ the model, along with current understanding of large-scale
climate variability over the past decades and estimates of the range of
potential global climate changes in the future, to examine coupled climate and
water cycle change over North America in the 20th and 21st centuries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First a post-doctoral research associate and subsequently
a graduate student will be involved in the research.
