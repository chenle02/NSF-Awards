This project will train New Mexico science, mathematics and technology teachers
at the secondary level (grades 6-12) to integrate IT concepts and computer
modeling, especially of complex adaptive systems, into their curricula using
StarLogo simulation software, participatory simulations using handheld computers
and related computer technologies. Students and teachers will analyze and
explore (and later design and build) models of complex adaptive systems using a
computer programming environment (StarLogo), and accompanying curriculum
(Adventures in Modeling) specifically built for and tested in middle and
secondary schools. Students will learn 1) design and presentation of information
as they develop computer simulations that must convey certain principles; 2)
system design and analysis, as they design and conduct experiments using their
simulated systems; 3) data analysis tools and techniques as they collect data
from their experiments and analyze it using spreadsheets, graphing tools and
statistics, and; 4) computer modeling and simulation techniques that have broad
applicability across many scientific and technological domains. The existing
StarLogo community will be an immediate national audience for the revised free
software resulting from this project.
