9361378 MacInnes While GaAs and other III-V compound semiconductors have many
desirable properties their practical use has been limited by the poor electrical
quality of its surfaces and interfaces with other materials. For example, in
contrast to the electronic perfection of the Si-SiO2 interface, the formation of
oxides on GaAs results in a high density of surface states that effectively pin
the surface Fermi level at the midgap, causing a high surface recombination
velocity. Because of this, devices such as MISFETs have yet to be fully realized
on GaAs, and the performance of devices sensitive to surface recombination is
hindered. Since the incorporation of any passivation stage within the growth of
the device structure is a particularly desirable, MOCVD offers an attractive
candidate for in-situ passivating layer growth. It is the goal of this work to
develop Gallia's proprietary GaS technology for MOCVD passivation of III-V
devices as an integral part of device manufacture. In addition, new passivating
materials will be developed for III-V compound semiconductors other than GaAs.
