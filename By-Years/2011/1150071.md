Proposal ECCS 1150071

Project Abstract

Objective The research objective of this proposal is the investigation and
development of widely and continuously tunable terahertz quantum-cascade lasers
and other active devices based upon monolithic and voltage tunable metamaterial
waveguides. These waveguides are based on the transmission-line metamaterial
concept in which the dispersion relation is tuned by electrical control of
integrated capacitive elements. Goals include demonstration of widely tunable
terahertz laser sources in various configurations, including tunable distributed
feedback lasers, tunable master-oscillator power-amplifiers, and beam-steerable
phased-array THz laser emitters.

Intellectual Merit The intellectual merit is the integration of tunable
metamaterial concepts with laser waveguides, in which propagation is sensitively
dependent on values of embedded circuit elements. This approach can achieve a
much wider range of tunability than can be achieved using temperature or other
electrical techniques, with a high degree of monolithic integration. The
demonstration of amplifier and distributed feedback configurations will allow
the output power to be scaled to several milliwatts or greater with a directive
beam pattern.

Broader Impacts The broader impacts lie in the development of a new approach for
achieving tunable semiconductor lasers. Additionally, terahertz technology
requires improved sources and detectors for sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy.
The core of the educational plan is to enhance undergraduate research within the
Electrical Engineering department through the development of a coordinated
publicity, outreach, and training program, as well as directly employing
undergraduates in this research. Multiple campus resources will be leveraged to
attract and fund underrepresented minority students to this research and
engineering in general.
