In this proposed research, Dr. Coleman and his colleagues at the University of
Georgia will investigate and concentrate on factors influencing the structural
and functional complexity of soil faunal communities, on interactions among
fauna and with their bacterial and fungal prey, and on the effects of these
interactions on higher plants. In their work, they will also attempt to make
correlations between community structure and ecosystem function, which they feel
is an essential step in unifying "population" and "ecosystems" approaches in
ecology. The work is of great interest to soil biologists and ecologists but has
major implications for management practices in agricultural systems and
forestry. The Program recommends funding.
