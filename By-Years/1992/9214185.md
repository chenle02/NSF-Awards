This project, submitted under the Academic Research Infrastructure Program,
will support research instrumentation for the School of Mathematics at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. As shaped by the
developing interests of its faculty over the years, the School of Mathematics
has been primarily concerned with five broad areas: topology; analysis and
global analysis; Lie groups, algebraic groups, automorphic functions and number
theory; algebraic geometry; and logic. In recent years, there has also been
growing emphasis on mathematical physics, dynamical systems, and nonlinear
analysis; in 1991-92, there was a special focus on computational fluid dynamics.
These emerging interests have increased needs for access to advanced computing
facilities. The project will support the acquisition of advanced computing
resources.
