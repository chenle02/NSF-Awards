The hydrogenases of anaerobic organisms are fascinating metalloenzyumes that
incorporate unusual and unexpected coenzymes to catalyze unusual oxidations and
reductions. Three types of hydrogenases have been characterized to date from
sulfate reducing bacteria: the first from Desulfovibrio gigas contains non heme
iron and redox active nickel (NiFe); the second from D. vulgaris contains
exclusively non-heme iron (Fe) and the third purified from D. baculaturs
contains non heme iron plus equivalent amounts of nickel and selenium (NiFeSe).
The immediate objectives are to develop the basic enzymological, biochemical and
stuctural information required to understand the biological function of nickel
and the roles of sulfur and silenmia in nickel catalysis. Specific aims are 1)
to purify and characterize the (NiFeSe) hydrogenase; 2) To evaluate the
potential of Se as a probe of the catalytic significance of nickel; 3) to study
the activation of the (NiFe) hydrogenase; 4) to probe the catalytic redox
cycling of the (NiFe) hydrogenase; 5) to determine the DNA sequences of the
hydrogenase genes; 6) to study the mechanisms involved in cellular localization
of the (NiFeSe) hydrogenases; and 7) to determine by site specific mutagenesis
the amino acid residues responsible for the liganding of the four redox centers
of the (NiFe) hydrogenases.
