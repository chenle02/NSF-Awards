The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 400 MHz FT-NMR for use throughout
the undergraduate curriculum. As a result of a recently completed an extensive
review and revision of its curriculum the Department has reorganized the basic
four core semesters and introduced new required courses in Synthesis and in
Instrumental Methods of Analysis, together with a set of new elective courses.
As perhaps the single most important structure determination method in chemistry
today and as one of the best ways students can make observations directly tied
to molecular structure, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is playing a
central role in the revised program.
