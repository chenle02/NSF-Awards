This award supports undergraduate and graduate students studying at US
institutions, including at least two institutions serving historically under-
represented populations, to participate in the 38th Annual Meeting of the
American Society for Precision Engineering (ASPE); Boston, Massachusetts; 13-18
November 2023

This award will enable student teams to participate in an international
precision engineering design challenge, and provide opportunities to meet,
exchange ideas, and learn from students, faculty, researchers, and engineers,
from international and domestic universities, industries, and government
facilities. The Annual Meeting of the American Society for Precision Engineering
is considered a globally-leading professional gathering in the precision
engineering field; hence, in addition to nurturing a global manufacturing
vision, participants will learn the latest results and innovations in these
fields.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
