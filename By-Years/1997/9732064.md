9732064 Christensen This Research Experience for Undergraduataes (REU) Site
grant will support a minimum of eight undergraduate research assistants in Solid
Earth Geophysics for each of the next three summers. The program will give
undergraduates majoring in geology, geophysics, physics, and closely related
disciplines, experience in the types of research conducted at the Geophysical
Institute. The program objective is to acquaint undergraduates with the exciting
research opportunities in the various fields of geophysics concentrating on
seismology, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, paleomagnetics, geodesy,
tectonics, glaciers and sea ice, and remote sensing, and encouraging the
undergraduates to go on to graduate school in these or other scientific areas.
Women and minorities will be particularly encouraged to apply. ***
