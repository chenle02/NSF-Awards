Two cohorts, each consisting of ten junior mathematics and science majors, are
receiving three-year scholarships while they complete both undergraduate and
masters degrees. Annual scholarships of $10,600 and $14,000 are awarded during
the undergraduate and graduate years respectively. During the five year program
the scholars fulfill the New York State teaching certification requirements. The
scholars' education is enhanced by intense field experiences in schools as well
as internships in some of the informal learning institutions in New York City
with a focus on science and mathematics. The scholarship program builds on the
work already begun through the Teacher Academy - a program that recruits and
educates undergraduates using a cohort model to become STEM majors and secondary
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars clinical experiences and fulfillment
of their service obligations primarily occur in the Brooklyn Public Schools.
