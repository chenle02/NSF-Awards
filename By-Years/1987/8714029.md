The problem of visual sensing appears in many applications ranging from medical
imaging to industrial processes and underseas engineering. A project was
supported by NSF and conducted by the American College of Radiology to study
Engineering Research in Visual Perception: Man-Machine Optimization. This
project was considered Phase A of a planning and assessment task. The project
report contains the reference material for a Workshop to be conducted as Phase B
of the task. This Workshop will expand the subject matter of the Phase A report
to encompass the research needs of a broad technical audience interested in
subjects that include basic research of visual perception to the systems and
design levels of computer visualization. A multidisciplinary approach will be
stressed.
