In this project, Dr. R.R. Galazka of the Institute of Physics, Polish Academy
of Sciences, Warsaw, will cooperate with Dr. J.K. Furdyna of the University of
Notre Dame under the U.S.-Poland Marie Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund to research
"Physics and Technology of Semimagnetic Semiconductors Ä±SMSC!," or
semiconducting alloys whose lattice is composed in part of substitutional
magnetic atoms. The researchers will focus on: (1) Fe-based SMSC (sp-d exchange
interaction between band electrons and Fe++ in a II-VI crystal host; the
position of Fe++ level with respect to the band structure of the material); (2)
SMSC involving IV-VI hosts (band structure of the allows; the exchange
interaction between magnetic ions; the influence of band structure and carrier
concentration on magnetic properties of the materials); and (3) localization
phenomena in SMSC (donor and acceptor levels; the shape of the acceptor wave
functions; spin-related phenomena; magnetic-field-induced semiconductor-metal
Mott transition). This project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program
objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
