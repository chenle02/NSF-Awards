The long term goal of this work is to delineate the factors which control
electron transfer in biological systems specifically in cytochromes c and b5.
(1) The role of protein surface charges will be evaluated by studying
cytochromes with altered electrostatic surfaces. (2) The rate constant for
electron transfer is thought to decrease exponentially with distance; this
distance dependence may in turn be a function of the driving force for the
reaction. Dr. Dixon will make a series of cytochromes b5. with increasing steric
bulk at the electron transfer site. Rate constants at different driving forces
will be measured. The resulting matrix of rate constants will be used to assess
the dependence of electron transfer on distance and driving force. (3) Dr. Dixon
will use NMR techniques to measure both electron transfer rate constants and
protein motions for a series of cytochromes c in an effect to understand the
molecular basis of conformational and reorganizational control of electron
transfer. Particular emphasis will be placed on the structure of cytochrome c as
a function of ionic strength, on the kinetics of the reversible loss of the
axial methionine and on the roles of residues near the heme in controlling
electron transfer.
