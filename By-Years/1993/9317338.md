9317338 Vittoria Technical abstract: Standard lithographic techniques will be
used to construct a planar microwave device which will be capable of measuring
microwave resonance signals over a probe area of 0.1 x 0.1 micron2 of a magnetic
thin film. Current operational devices probe areas of 100 x 100 micron2.
Measurements of the microwave resonance spectra as a function of probe size will
be performed on standard metal films. It is expected that these devices will be
useful for the study of magnetic thin films and multilayers, fine powders, and
single magnetic domains. Non-technical abstract: Many interesting magnetic
phenomena occur on a very small (less than 1/1000 of a millimeter) scale. These
are often related to structurally small objects such as fine powders but also
include microscopic magnetic phenomena. Standard magnetic characterization
techniques can determine only an average property. It is proposed to build and
test a device which will be capable of performing magnetic measurements on a
scale of 1/1000mm. The device will be useful for studying a variety of thin
films as well as magnetic powders. ***
