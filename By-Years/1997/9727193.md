INT 97-27193 Klabunde This U.S.-Bulgarian cooperative research project is on
"Nanoscale Metal/Boride Particles Containing Rare Earth Elements." The principal
investigators are Dr. Kenneth Klabunde of Kansas State University and Dr. Iovka
Dragieva of the Bulgarian Central Laboratory for Electrochemical Power Sources.
The researchers will carry out projects on the synthesis and characterization of
mixed metal-boride nanoparticles of interest in magnetism and other
technologies. The Bulgarian group will continue and improve their borohydride
reduction schemes for producing such composites and will learn another approach
- metal vapor synthesis. The U.S. group will continue and improve their metal
vapor approaches and will also improve their earlier nonaqeous borohydride
reduction techniques. The complementary expertise of the two groups could lead
to nanoparticulate forms of interesting materials that in bulk are among the
strongest permanent magnet materials known. This project in chemistry research
fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S.
and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and capabilites in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
