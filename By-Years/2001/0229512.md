"Seeing in the Dark" will be a prime-time PBS special about stargazing --
described in the proposal as "the interaction between starlight and human beings
who have a look for the love of it, whether just learning the constellations or
doing amateur astronomy so advanced that it sometimes rivals professional
research." The project teaches "hands-on" astronomy drawing heavily on new
technology (large, inexpensive "Dobsonian" telescopes; charged-coupled light-
sensing devices [CCDs}; and the Internet) that make astronomical observing
practical for millions to whom it has previously been at best a remote
possibility. The video will be supported by an extensive outreach effort that
includes informal, family projects and formal, in-class exercises. The
Astronomical Society of the Pacific will be a major outreach partner. There also
is a companion book, "Seeing in the Dark," published by Simon & Schuster.
