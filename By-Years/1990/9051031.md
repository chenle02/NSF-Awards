The Physics Department is improving and upgrading the laboratories associated
with modern physics and optics courses. The students are performing experiments
using modern methods of intensity and wavelength measurements in the visible and
infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The project involves the use of
a monochromator, sources of optical radiation, light chopper, lock- in amplifier
and pyroelectric detector as major instruments. This instrumentation is being
used to perform a set of experiments dealing with nature of light and light
matter interaction. The experience gained with this instrumentation enables
students to use light as a probe in experimental investigations and sharpen
their experimental skills. The university is matching the award with an equal
amount of funds.
