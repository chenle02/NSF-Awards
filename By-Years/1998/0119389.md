WORKSHOP: ACL'2001 Student Research Workshop



This is funding to subsidize expenses of student participants in the Student
Research Workshop organized in conjunction with the Association for
Computational Linguistics Conference (ACL'2001), which will be held July 6-11,
2001, in Toulouse, France. The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)
is the primary international organization in the field of natural language
processing and language engineering, with two regional chapters, Europe (EACL)
and North America (NAACL), of approximately equal size. The Association's annual
conference, which is the major international meeting in the field, has
traditionally rotated between North America and Europe but was held last year
for the first time in a Pacific Rim location (Hong Kong). The ACL Student
Workshop is an inexpensive yet highly effective means of encouraging young and
upcoming computational linguists. The intimate workshop format, in addition to
affording student participants sufficient time to present their research (20
minutes) and receive feedback from a panel of established researchers in the
field (15 minutes), encourages them to begin building a rapport with established
researchers. Through feedback from the panel and other student participants,
this nurturing effort will pay dividends by providing the students with
invaluable exposure to outside perspectives and guidance on their work at a
critical time in their research in this rapidly changing research field.
