A combination of theoretical modeling and experiments is aimed at exploring the
control mechanisms which determine transport and dynamics within the boundary
region between two miscible fluids differing in density and composition. The
role of stresses induced by concentration and density gradients will be
investigated, and also whether these might act in a manner equivalent, to
surface tension in the interface between immiscible fluids. Results will be
applicable to prediction and control in various interface and two-phase liquid
areas such as miscibe displacement in porous media, emulsions, and dispersed
two- phase mixing and dispersion.
