A curricular innovation is being implemented that involves the introductory and
intermediate courses offered during the first two years in the chemistry
curriculum. There are three critical components to this project: l) to integrate
both inorganic and organic chemistry throughout the first two years of
introductory and intermediate chemistry; 2) to fashion a laboratory sequence
that promotes student understanding of the qualitative and multidisciplinary
aspects of chemistry, including the use of modern instrumentation at the
introductory level; and, 3) to create lecture and laboratory texts for use with
such innovations. A unique advantage of this sequence, absent in the
"traditional," "organic first," and "two cycle" approaches, is the overall
matching of topic development to student ability over the two-year sequence.
This approach builds from an empirical basis those unifying concepts of
chemistry throughout a two-year sequence. By removing the barrier separating
organic from inorganic, both major and non-major chemistry students will be
exposed to a more integrated view of chemistry, and will have fundamental
concepts reinforced with the widest possible variety of chemical examples.
