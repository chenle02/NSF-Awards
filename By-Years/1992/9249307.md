The long term goal of this project is to determine the crystals structures of
heme containing enzymes. The main tools to be employed this work are those of
protein x-ray crystallography. The project focuses on the crystal structure
determination of lignin peroxidase (or ligninase) and mutant forms of cytochrome
c peroxidase. %%% This new structural information is expected to broaden our
data base on two fundamental mechanistic questions: first, the mechanism by
which heme enzymes activate molecular oxygen and/or hydroperoxides; and second,
the mechanism by which electrons transfer between proteins in intermolecular
complexes.
