The objectives of this research are to determine what factors limit or regulate
populations of migratory birds that breed in the north temperate forests and
winter in the Neotropics. The basic question concerns whether these factors
operate more importantly in summer breeding areas at temperate latitudes, in
neotropical winter quarters, or during both seasons. Through demographic and
experimental studies, hypothesis will be tested to determine (1) if limitations
occur in both summer and winter, (2) if habitat occupancy is determined by
social dominance (despotism) or other preemptive behavior, (3) if individuals
vary in fitness among habitats, that is, the demographic consequences of
despotic habitat selection, and (4) what ecological variable affect habitat
quality and therefore fitness. Emphasis will be on differential fitness among
habitats in both summer and winter, including second-growth forests,
agricultural lands, and other human-modified habitats. The results will advance
our understanding of the population dynamics and community relations of these
migrant bird species, as well as the factors affecting their population
abundances. Such information also will contribute to the development of sound
and effective conservation policies.
