Proposal Title: PECASE: Intracellular Signaling Networks in the Immune Response
Institution: North Carolina State University

The objective of the proposed research is to study T lymphocyte (T cell)
regulation at the intracellular level, with a focus on molecular signaling
processes initiated by the cell surface receptors for the cytocines,
interleukins (IL)-2 and (IL)-4. The specific objectives of this research
include: (1) the quantitative analysis of pathway crosstalk interactions in IL-2
receptor signaling, using interventions that target specific intracellular
molecules, (2) the characterization of the cooperation of IL-2 receptor-mediated
signaling pathways in mediating T cell life (proliferation) and death
(apoptosis) decision making, and (3) the elucidation of the synergistic effect
of IL-2 and IL-4 on T cell expansion at the level of signaling network
interactions. This research could provide new information to help modulate cell
function, with potential application being the elucidation of therapeutic
strategies.

This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a
Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in
May 2004.
