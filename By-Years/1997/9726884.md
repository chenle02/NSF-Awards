9726884 Housen Marine sediments can provide continous records of geomagnetic
field behavior that connot be obtained from continental sediments or volcanic
rocks. Single-magnetic-domain particles of magnetite produced by magnetotactic
bacteria have been proposed as important recorders of magnetization in marine
sediments. Yet, the role of biogenic magnetite in the magnetization process
remains poorly understood. The P. I.s will conduct a series of experiments based
upon recent advances in rock-magnetism designed to measure the abundance and
orientation-distribution of magnetofossils in marine sediments. These
experiments will help to establish the role (or lack thereof) of magnetofossils
as remanence carriers, links between magnetotactic bacteria and sediment redox,
the degree of magnetofossil preservation, and the inter-relationships between
these factors and the lock-in of magnetic remanence in marine sediments. ***
