Our society is currently producing and collecting tremendous amounts of data,
which needs to be sifted through and categorized meaningfully in order to lead
to informed decision-making. From social networks to biological ones, the
problems of community detection and clustering are paramount to understanding
the nature of the network; as such, efficient and reliable algorithms for these
problems are of utmost importance. Devising, analyzing, and benchmarking such
algorithms often rely heavily on random matrix and random graph theory, as
studies have shown that large network characteristics can often be replicated
(and more easily studied) via random graph models. Thus, good theoretical
results on the spectra of large random graphs are needed to understand the
typical behavior, as well as the limitations of community detection algorithms.

The PI will work on a variety of problems, ranging from the theoretical
(spectral of random graphs) to the applied (proposing and analyzing community
detection algorithms). Some of the models considered will include the Stochastic
Block Model and variants thereof, especially at the limit of sparseness (when
average node connectivity is either large and constant or goes to infinity
slower than any power of the network size). On the more theoretical side, the PI
will work on problems from spectral gap (which controls properties like mixing,
but also the possibility of exact community recovery in certain networks) to the
empirical spectral distribution (which can be used to establish the nature of
the network). The PI will also work on threshold bounds for various regimes of
community detection in these graph models, and will produce software for
numerically computing the asymptotical spectral distributions for a large
variety of random graphs.
