This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports infrastructure
upgrades at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) that will ensure
the viability of current NOAO assets for supporting research by the ground-based
astronomical community. The funds are designated to support forefront
astronomical optical and infrared research by replacing failing and outdated
systems at NOAO telescopes and data handling facilities and to ensure the
continued safety of operations at NOAO observatory sites for visiting scientists
and staff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of $5.6M is awarded to address
infrastructure problems associated with on-site safety, facility maintenance,
operational efficiency, energy conservation, and modernization. These activities
will improve the longevity of government-owned facilities, reduce the cost of
facility operations, enhance energy conservation, improve the safety of visiting
scientists, staff and visitors, and improve the quality and quantity of data
acquired with the telescopes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOAO facilities are used by
the US astronomical community to address outstanding problems in forefront
astronomical research. Through these upgrades, NOAO's ability to support this
research will be substantially enhanced. In addition NOAO participation in
programs to broaden participation in research, such as its ongoing student
programs, will benefit from improved observing and data handling capabilities,
making it easier for students to work with forefront astronomical observations
