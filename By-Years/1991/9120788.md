This research is concerned with the applicability of a lexical- based framework
to the problem of interlingual machine translation. There are two tasks relevant
to this goal. The first task is the augmentation of an existing lexical-semantic
representation to include temporal, aspectual, and spatial information, all of
which are necessary for adequate machine translation. The second task is the
construction of routines for automatic acquisition of lexical entries based on
this representation. In general, the project aims to test hypotheses that
support the view that a lexical-based parametric framework can be built to
accommodate interlingual machine translation, and provide and adequate basis for
capturing temporal, aspectual, and spatial information.
