Dr. Karen E. Kerr has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Kerr received her doctoral degree from the University of Chicago
under the supervision of Professor Takeshi Oka. Dr. Kerr will continue research
at the University of California at Irvine under the sponsorship of Professor
Vartkess Apkarian. Her postdoctoral research will target the relaxation dynamics
of atomic impurities in solid helium. Alkaline earth metals doped in a helium
matrix exhibit a strong coupling to the matrix. The research will examine host
motion in these systems using time-resolved pump-probe techniques. The work will
contribute to our understanding of relaxation processes in model solid systems.
The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
