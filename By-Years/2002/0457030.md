Gustavo Scuseria of Rice University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program for research on the development and application
of novel exchange-correlation functionals for improving accuracy in ground-and
excited-state density functional theory (DFT). He is developing functionals for
improving accuracy in calculations of excited states of molecules and solids, as
well as devising new approximations for time-dependent current-density
functional theory. Applications to carbon nanotube problems of practical
relevance, molecular electronics and excited states of large molecules of
biological interest are being made. In terms of broader impacts, the methods
being developed in this project will significantly enhance the current
capabilities of the scientific community to model and study molecules and
materials with more accurate electronic structure tools. The research is having
a considerable impact on many areas where quantum molecular modeling is
routinely employed, including the chemical, pharmaceutical, and defense
industries, where new materials and chemical processes are routinely studied. In
particular, the projects to be pursued include new concepts like local hybrids,
the use of screened Coulomb potentials, the inclusion of the current density in
functionals, and novel approximations to the calculation of excited states. The
application projects center on carbon nanotubes, which promise substantial
improvement of thermal and electrical conductivity in advanced materials.
