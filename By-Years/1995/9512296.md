9512296 Lewandowski This request is for equipment and instrumentation that will
be used to assemble an Advanced Materials Deformation and Manufacturing Process
Simulator (AMDMPS). The broad range of manufacturing processes that can be
performed with the AMDMPS facility will enable the response of advanced
materials to realistic manufacturing conditions to be determined with great
accuracy. Such experimental data are required as inputs into advanced process
control models. In addition to generating constitutive equations capable of
predicting the deformation behavior of a material, the AMDMPS facility will
serve as the focal point of a Rapid Prototyping Laboratory where new techniques
in computer integrated manufacturing and process automation will be
investigated.
