This project will provide a computer automated, zero-field AC- susceptometer
with four probe AC-resistivity and a I Tesla superconducting solenoid, allowing
magnetic phase diagram determinations of materials over moderate applied fields.
This instrumentation will be used in a variety of new and continuing research
areas for which magnetic susceptibility and/or resistivity measurements play a
crucial role. Specific projects include (A) general characterization of high
temperature cuprate superconductors, (B) field induced orientation of
polycrystal mosaics of high Tc superconductors, (C) non-linearity and frequency
response of the magnetic behavior of high Tc superconductors, (D) magnetism and
transport properties of conductive organo-metallic polymers based on valence
averaged binuclear metal aggregates, (E) low temperature zero field
susceptibility and Ho vs T phase diagram behavior of complex flourides of high
spin Iron III. This instrumentation is not presently available at Northeastern
University. It will be shared by faculty in the Chemistry and Physics
departments, and will be made available to other users as needed.
