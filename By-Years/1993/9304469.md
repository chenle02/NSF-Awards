9304469 Shoelson Growth factor/insulin stimulation of the respective tyrosine
kinase receptors results in the physical assembly of macromolecular protein
complexes at the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. These protein-protein
associations are mediated by interactions between phosphoproteins and additional
cytoplasmic proteins having Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains (ca.100 residue,
modular phosphotyrosine binding pockets). Recently several methods were
developed to analyze structure/function relationships between intact
phosphoproteins and SH2 domain proteins and truncated versions of both. These
findings suggest that phosphoprotein interactions with PI 3-kinase SH2 domains
might regulate enzyme function by an allosteric mechanism. This project proposes
to extend these observations and determine whether SH2 domain occupancy is a
generalized mechanism for regulating catalytic activity. Two members of each SH2
protein class will be analyzed: tyrosine kinases Src & Lck, other enzymes PLC-
gamma & SH-PTP, and putative linkers PI 3-kinase p85 & Crk. %%% Many growth
factors and related hormones like insulin activate receptors with intrinsic
protein tyrosine kinase activity to elicit a wide range of biochemical
responses, which ultimately lead to changes in cellular differentiation,
metabolism, morphology and proliferation. These studies explore how a class of
soluble proteins called SH2 domain proteins contributes to the regulation of
signal transduction mediated by these hormones and growth factors. ***
