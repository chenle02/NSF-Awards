Bodega Marine Laboratory is a coastal research facility operated by the
University of California at Davis. The Lab is located north of San Francisco,
and has provided research facilities for resident and visiting scientists since
1966. Dr. James Clegg, Director of the Lab, proposes construction of a state-of-
the-art facility for molecular biology. The proposed facility would support
isolation of organic compounds, protein electrophoresis, polymerase chain
reaction amplification of nucleic acid sequences, and full capabilities for
amino acid, DNA and RNA sequencing. Marine biologists are becoming increasingly
dependent on the tools of molecular biology for their research. Marine
microbiologists, population biologists, systematists, marine ecologists, and
physiologists regularly turn to molecular techniques to identify organisms and
to analyze their metabolic properties. The proposed facility will foster new
research collaborations and will increase the Bodega Marine Lab's impact as a
community resource among biologists.
