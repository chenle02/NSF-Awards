Zinc oxide is a promising semiconductor material for electronic applications due
to its low cost, ease of synthesis, and unique optical properties. However, one
challenge that has prevented this material from being more widely commercialized
is the difficulty in controlling its electrical properties through a process
known as doping. If full control of zinc oxide?s electrical properties can be
achieved, it would allow for low cost light sensors or light emitting diodes.
The researcher?s thesis has focused on stabilizing the doping process in zinc
oxide. As a part of the EAPSI program, the researcher will be working with Dr.
Naoki Fukata at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) in Tsukuba,
Japan to integrate zinc oxide and silicon nanostructures together for improved
photodetectors. By reducing the device features to the nanoscale, the device?s
sensitivity can be improved. Dr. Fukata specializes in the growth of silicon
nanostructures, and has access to the facilities needed to characterize this
material.

Historically, doping zinc oxide to make it p-type has been challenging due to
the low formation energy of compensating donor defects. If stable p-type ZnO
could be realized, it would be a cheap alternative to other materials like GaN
which is currently used in optoelectronics such as laser diodes and
photosensors. It was found that antimony (Sb) could be used to produce low
temperature, solution grown p-type ZnO nanowires with an unprecedented stability
of 18 months. While the researcher has produced p-n homojunctions between n- and
p-type ZnO, in order to broaden this material?s applicability, it is also
worthwhile to study its interactions with other semiconductors. Working with Dr.
Fukata, the researcher will grow p-type ZnO nanowires on n-type Si nanowires in
order to produce a heterojunction structure. By reducing the material to high
surface area nanowires, enhanced photodetectors with unique optoelectronic
properties will be produced. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration
with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
