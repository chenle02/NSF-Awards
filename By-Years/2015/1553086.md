Modern techniques for data gathering?arising from medicine and bioinformatics,
internet applications such as web-search, physics and astronomy, mobile data
gathering platforms?have yielded an explosion in the mass and diversity of data.
Concurrently, statistics, decision theory, and machine learning have
successfully laid a groundwork for answering questions about our world based on
analysis of this data. As more information is collected, classical approaches
for inference and learning are insufficient, as additional concerns
arise?computational resources, privacy considerations, storage limitations,
network communication constraints? outside of statistical accuracy. This prompts
a basic question: how can multiple criteria be balanced while maintaining
statistical performance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To bring statistics and machine
learning into closer contact with other desiderata, this research involves the
development of procedures that trade between scarce resources in principled and
optimal ways. Such trade-offs have been difficult to characterize, as current
tools for providing fundamental limits (such as information theory in
communication) do not connect disparate areas. Three concrete sub-areas serve as
bases for this research. The investigators study the interplay of computing with
learning, estimation, and optimization by connecting notions of computation?such
as memory accesses or synchronization in distributed systems?to data analysis
tasks. Second, the research investigates adaptive and robust procedures?and
associated statistical costs?that will become more important given increasingly
long-tailed and messy data. Thirdly, the investigators study privacy in
estimation, using information and decision-theoretic tools to characterize the
tensions between statistical accuracy and sensitive data disclosures. Combined,
these lay the groundwork for a theory on the use of data in the face of
constraints, along with a functional and practical understanding of procedures
that balance scarce resources against statistical accuracy.
