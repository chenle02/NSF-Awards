9601996 This award provides support for the Mid-America Drosophila Stock Center
at Bowling Green University. The center maintains a large collection of mutant
strains of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an organism widely used in
basic investigations of genetics and developmental biology. On request, samples
of mutant strains are provided for use in research and education. The collection
was originally established in 1960 at the Institute for Cancer Research in
Philadelphia using strains from the personal collections of H.J. Mueller and J.
Shultz. The collection moved to Bowling Green University in 1996 and, since
then, has grown to include over 4,000 strains isolated by a number different
investigators. During the period of this award, it is expected that the most
useful strains will be shifted to a similar, but larger, NSF-supported
collection at the Indiana University. This merging of the two collections is
expected to increase the effectiveness with which collection holdings are made
available to the research community in the future.
