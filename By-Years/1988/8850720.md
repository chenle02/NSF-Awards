Investigations in Mathematics: Alternatives to Traditional Assessment will
develop assessment techniques and tools that help teachers and eighth grade
students focus on students' understanding of and ability to communicate about
essential mathematical ideas in a wide range of realistic and imaginative
situations. The Lawrence Hall of Science will assemble a group of
mathematicians, mathematics educators, and mathematics teachers to create a
collection of tools, called "investigations", and a process for using them which
integrates assessment and instruction. In each investigation, students will be
required to read, understand, conceptualize, and represent a problem situation;
to use mathematical skills and knowledge to make sense of the situation; and to
communicate their thinking in a form that can be understood and evaluated.
Investigations will give students the opportunity to consolidate and apply their
mathematical understandings to the solution of complex problems. Included in the
package will be teaching suggestions for the introduction of investigations,
ways to assist students as they work on investigations, sample scoring schemes,
and ideas for giving students feedback on their work. The investigations will
focus on the most important mathematical ideas of the curriculum.
