9552917 Robinson Hampton University will initiate a 3-week, summer residential,
Young Scholars project in mathematics and physics, followed with academic year
follow-up activities. The project will serve 24 high potential students who will
be entering grade 7. The program will focus on student involvement in mathematic
and physics projects with Hampton University mathematics and physics professors,
scientists from a Department of Energy site, the Continuous Electron Beam
Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and NASA Project goals are to enhance mathematics
and physics skills and to stimulate their interest in science-related fields
among young scientists.
