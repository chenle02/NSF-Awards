With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Albert J. Fry of the Department
of Chemistry at Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT. The research will extend
the PI's investigations of physical organic electrochemistry. The anodic
oxidation and the chemical reactions of organosilanes and related substances
will be studied. Compounds containing silicon, which is just below carbon in the
periodic table and more electropositive than carbon, readily give up an electron
to a negative electrode. A second group within the same molecule such as a
remote phenyl ring can assist this electron transfer. This research will explore
the dimensions of this "remote effect" in order to determine what other groups
facilitate electron transfer and to evaluate the possibility of replacing
silicon with another element in order to discover additional synthetically
useful reactions. These investigations will be complemented by computational
studies aimed at developing methods for accurate estimation of the redox
potentials of organic substrates and determining the nature and stereochemistry
of ion-pairing and other interactions between organic cations and anions in
solution.

A diverse, multiracial group that includes both graduate and undergraduate
students will carry out this research. The project will train students in the
important areas of electrochemistry, synthesis, and computational chemistry.
This research is expected to have broad positive impact on mechanistic and
synthetic electrochemistry and on the development of catalysts with unique redox
properties.
