This research program represents a continuation of the collaborative effort
between F.J. Spera and D. A. Yuen in studying the dynamical evolution and
physical properties of crustal magma bodies by means of state-of-the-art
numerical techniques on supercomputers. It will focus on two themes: (1) To
continue the study of double-diffusive convection, which represents a unique
feature of magma chamber fluid dynamics. (2) To initiate a new computational
program in the determination of nonequilibrium transport properties of silicate
melts from molecular dynamics. The goal is to obtain some basic understanding of
the effects of pressure and shear-rate on the viscosity and diffusion
coefficients of magmatic substances. These research areas will contribute to our
understanding of the physics of melts and the dynamics of magma transport.
