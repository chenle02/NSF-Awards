This collaborative proposal brings together engineering education researchers
from one institution (Oregon State University) and learning scientists from
another (University of Washington) in a two-year project involving two studies
designed to investigate how productive disciplinary engagement is supported and
constrained in a collaborative virtual engineering task in a capstone course. In
one study, sociocultural and affective frames will be brought to bear on extant
data (already analyzed cognitively) in order to explore interactions within five
student groups working on the task, and between groups and instructor. These
secondary analyses will focus on patterns of engagement, discourse processes,
and social context of the groups embedded in the larger context of the course
with the aim of shedding light on the ways in which engagement and learning
develop. The second study will entail analyses of primary data (collected via
pre- and post- surveys of students in the capstone course) to investigate the
relationship of the experience in the virtual laboratory groups and student
learning, interest in engineering, and post-graduate plans.
