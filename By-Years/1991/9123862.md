Quinto will pursue problems in the mathematical analysis of Radon transforms
and in tomography with two major objectives. The first is to prove injectivity
and support theorems for generalized radon transforms in the setting of real
analytic measures on real analytic submanifolds. The second is to solve two
problems in tomography. Namely, the non-destructive evaluation of rings and
rocket exit cones, and a dose plan algorithm for cancer radiation therapy. The
mathematics in this project is as follows. Take a manifold (surface, solid, or
higher dimensional analogue) and a function defined on it. Suppose the manifold
is sliced up in some fashion and the average of the function over each slice is
known. The problem is to reconstruct the original function. A good example is
the function that gives the density at each point of a solid body whose inside
is not directly accessible . X-ray images give average densities along lines in
the direction of the beam. Tomography is the science of deducing densities
inside the object from an economical number of these images.
