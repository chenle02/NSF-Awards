0334238&lt;br/&gt;Lee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year U.S. France (INRIA)
cooperative research awards supports visits to France by Craig Lee of Aerospace
Corporation and Eric Coe, a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern
California. It adds an international dimension to Aerospace's ITR (Information
Technology Research) award in active networks and grid
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this bilateral effort, Laurent Lefevre and
researchers at INRIA (Institut National de la Recherche en Informatique et en
Automatique), the Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon, will work with Aerospace
Corporation on a general infrastructure for active network-enabled or topology
aware middleware services that are easily accessible from grid applications.
INRIA is directly involved in the e-Toile project to deploy a French
experimental grid platform to include active middleware support for quality of
service and reliable multicast. The e-Toile grid provides a test bed to evaluate
middleware prototypes for (1) reducing communication demand; (2) content-based
routing communication; (3) interest and time management for distributed
simulation; (4) reliable multicast, event services: and (5) network quality
services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S.-France project takes advantage of
access to a unique e-grid test bed with a wide geographical distribution in
France. Topology aware middleware services are applicable to many different
domains from distribution simulation to ad-hoc networks and grids. With such
wide applicability, these communications services eventually will be used by a
wide segment of society. &lt;br/&gt;
