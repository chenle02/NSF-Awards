The American Physical Society, in cooperation with the American Association of
Physics Teachers, will operate a continuation of the project, "Participation of
the Physics Research Community in Undergraduate Curriculum Development". The
previous grant supported two workshops: the first in Santa Fe in June 1990, and
the second in Denver in November 1990. The workshops resulted in specific
recommendations in two main areas: (1) the infusion of core courses with results
from modern research topics, and (2) the upgrading of the junior/senior physics
laboratory with modern experiments and the dissemination of good experiments. To
achieve the next step, pilot programs in these two areas will be supervised by
the APS and AAPT. Based on the results of the pilot testing, full proposals will
be developed.
