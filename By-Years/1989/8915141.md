The objectives of this research are the analysis and interpretation of
polarization observations made with the new polarimetric radar in West Germany,
in 1988 and the acquisition of new measurements. The latter will include
differential propagation phase shift and differential backscatter phase shift.
These and other measurements are designed to improve the ability to infer and
discriminate the microphysical structure of clouds and precipitation.
