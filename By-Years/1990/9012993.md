The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr.
William McCoy of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Dr. Vojen Lozek
of the Geological Institute, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences is to study loess
deposits of the middle- and late-Pleistocene age in Czecho- slovakia and the
Great Plains. To determine relative chronology and paleoclimatology, the
researchers will compare the loess records within the context of the oxygen-
isotope record of the deep sea. Results are expected to help us understand the
global picture of continental climate change throughout the Quaternary, and in
particular help define the role of dust in the mechanism of global climate
change. This project involving climate dynamics and geology fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
