Using simulated as well as real datasets we shall examine methodological and
theoretical aspects of spatial models relevant to numerous topics in population
biology. Our approach focuses on examination of gene-frequency surfaces, spatial
autoocorrelation analysis, and generalizations of the Mantel test. We shall
examine four separate topics. 1) Population biological inferences from gene-
frequency and other surfaces. 2) Theoretical investigations of distributions of
measures of spatial autocurrelation under null hypotheses of population
biological interest. 3) Boundary detection and significance testing of detected
boundaries. 4) Testing of biological distance matrices against design matrices
representing specific alternative hypotheses. Under each of these topics several
individual research problems are planned. The results of these endeavors will
greatly facilitate inferences from patterns to process in a wide variety of
problems in population biology.//
