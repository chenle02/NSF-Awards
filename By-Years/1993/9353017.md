9353017 Marin City College of New York (CUNY) seeks to provide enrichment
experiences for a six week commuter program in environmental science for 50
high-ability and high-potential ninth and tenth grade students from the city of
New York. During the six-week period the students will work in teams of twenty-
five and sub- groups of five solving real-world environmental problems. They
will be assisted by environmental scientists and university professors.
Activities include seminars, field investigations, individual career counseling,
research project, and dialogue and visits with various scientists. Follow-up
activities during the academic year will involve students using their summer
experiences to develop individual projects. The selected students will enter the
project as a special program within the Bronx High school of Science. ***
