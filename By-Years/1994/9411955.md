The proposal is for the acquisition of an injection-seeded ND:YAG laser that
will be used in two types of experiments. The first is a "filtered" Rayleigh
measurement which can be combined with simultaneous Raman spectroscopy to obtain
both temperatures and concentrations. The second application is for laser-
induced incandescence, a technique recently promoted at Penn State. The
equipment will be used in several projects including combustion studies
conducted in well-stirred reactors, turbulent and laminar diffusion flames, and
Diesel engine and rocket chambers.
