Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology initiated in the
proof of concept CCLI grant #0127439 distributes some software engineering
student project implementation to other courses during the same term at the same
university in an intra-curriculum manner. The sharing of the implementation
burden allows these students to focus more fully on the rightful objectives of
the software engineering course. Students in the other courses are excited when
their own course projects become a useful part of a larger system. This project
expands this methodology to include courses at other universities. North
Carolina A&amp;T (under a sub-award of this grant) and Appalachian State in this
project develop a synchronous methodology of inter-university collaboration
applicable when institutions are similar in terms of programming language,
academic calendar, location, etc. DePaul University (under a sub-award of this
grant) assists in developing an asynchronous methodology when the institutions
are dissimilar.&lt;br/&gt;
