The objective of the project is to develop and validate a biosphere model for
arctic tundra that is linked to satellite observations. Such models provide
land-atmosphere boundary forcing for atmospheric circulation models. By linking
the biosphere model to satellite observations, performance of the biosphere
model over the Arctic Slope can be monitored and an annual estimate of depth and
moisture content of the active layer with a spatial resolution of ~40 kmthe
resolution of the 37 GHz channel of the Defense Meteorological Satellite's
Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) should be possible. The biosphere model
will be an adaptation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research's
Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) and will draw heavily from our
Michigan Cold Region Radiobrightness (MCRR) model. The MCRR model currently
applies to prairie that is subject to diurnal and annual freezing and thawing.
The new biosphere model will be extrapolated from this project's field sites to
the Arctic Slope in general through use of SSM/I data and through cooperative
observations with other Arctic System Science projects. This project is a
contribution to the Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interaction component of the Arctic
System Science (ARCSS) Program.
