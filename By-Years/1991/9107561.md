Nitrate assimilation in the fungus Neurospora, particularly the steps connected
with nitrite assimilation and reduction to ammonium ion, is the object(s) of the
proposed research. An analysis of the sequence organization and regulated
expression of the nitrite reductase structural gene, "nit-6", and a comparison
of its properties with those of "nit-3", its coordinately regulated partner, is
an immediate goal of the research. The information obtained will be exploited in
experiments designed to probe structure:activity relationships in nitrite
reductase.
