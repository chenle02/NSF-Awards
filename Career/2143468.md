This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Nonparametric methods are a basic toolkit for analyzing
multivariate and high-dimensional data in modern statistics. However, many
standard nonparametric methods are known to face two key challenges. First, the
performance of these methods is usually sensitive to multiple subjective choices
of tuning parameters. Second, the methods developed for the purpose of
estimation typically cannot be directly used for statistical inference. This
project aims to systematically develop a new paradigm of multi-dimensional
nonparametric methods under natural shape constraints that simultaneously
resolves these two critical issues. In particular, the shape-constrained methods
to be developed in this project will not only be fully automated without ad-hoc
tuning, but also enjoy simultaneous optimal estimation and inference merits. The
project will integrate research with education through course development,
research mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students, especially those
from underrepresented groups, and summer programs.

This project will focus on two complementary categories of research problems.
Problems in the first category aim at understanding the potentials of a class of
non-standard generalized block estimators, and the drawbacks of standard methods
such as the maximum likelihood or least squares. Problems in the second category
aim at developing fully automated inference procedures for several canonical
local and global inference targets using the non-standard methods, in a few
related models. The common ground for the solutions to these problems lies in an
emerging research area of non-standard distributional characterizations of
multi-dimensional shape-constrained estimators initiated recently by the PI and
his coauthors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
