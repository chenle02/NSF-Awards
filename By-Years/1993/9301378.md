This research project will develop a flexible manufacturing system based on a
high-precision laser writing machine, for the direct generation of rotationally-
symmetric diffractive optics with continuous profiles in photopolymers. This
machine will serve to combine advanced computer-aided optical design and
automated process control of the manufacturing station. The integration of
optical design and manufacturing process control will reduce cost and cycle time
of high quality diffractive optics. Successful implementation of the
manufacturing system will improve prospects for the long-term commercialization
of diffractive optics. Important potential applications of the technology
include medical instrumentation, optical data storage and computing systems,
head-up and head-mounted displays, laser reprographics, space-based optical
sensors, and precision optical testing.
