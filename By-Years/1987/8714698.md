This proposal is to develop the use of robotics as a teaching aid for the
severely disabled. It addresses the neglected area of personalized education for
the severely handicapped. This one-on-one type of education has to date been
both too expensive and too time consuming. It takes a lot of individual time and
effort to help a severely handicapped child. By using robotics to replace the
idle time which is spent without instruction, the educational experience of
these children should be enormously impacted.
