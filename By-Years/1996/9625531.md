The goal of this project is to develop compilation techniques to support
efficient machine-independent programming of high-performance multiprocessors
through implementation of COSMIC, the "Communication-Optimizing, Shared-Memory
Integrated Compiler." To achieve high performance, COSMIC will apply
optimizations for locality, synchronization, communication, and memory system
effects. COSMIC follows two basic guidelines. First, it uses compilation
techniques for message-passing machines to retain most of the benefits of
explicit messages. Second, it exploits architectural and operating system
support available on shared-memory multiprocessors to improve flexibility and
performance. A novel characteristic of COSMIC will be its ability to take
advantage of the multiple coherence protocols and hybrid message-passing support
found in software Distributed -Shared-Memory (DSM) systems and Flexible-Shared-
Memory system (FSM) machines. To evaluate the impact on the performance of
scientific applications, COSMIC will be tested on programs from benchmark suites
such as Perfect, NAS, SPEC, and SADIE, as well as representative applications
(e.g., CHARMM, MOLDYN, DSMC, EULER, NRL Flame) from fields such as computational
chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, and computational combustion.
