&lt;br/&gt;Critical Points of Variational
Integrals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract of Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt; Xiaodong
Yan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to study the regularity of critical
points of multiple integrals in the calculus of variations; especially some of
the integrands that arise from nonlinear elasticity. Also some questions that
generalize well-known results in classical analysis. One project is to
investigate conditions on the integrands that guarantee certain partial
regularity of critical points. In particular the regularity of certain systems
that are models in nonlinear elasticity will be studied. This will include both
compressible and incompressible materials. Another project is to study the
regularity and qualitative properties of the solutions of certain systems of
nonlinear integral equations. These systems are closely related to the systems
that arise in the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
questions to be studied in this project are important technical results in
analysis and the calculus of variations. Any results would be of considerable
interest as there has been much research on these, and related, subjects during
the last twenty years. The problems in nonlinear elasticity may lead to insights
into the behavior of exotic materials while the other problems may be of
importance for some questions in geometry.
