This grant supports outside-China travel for three U.S. university scientists
to attend the Workshop on Scientific Uses of China Digital Seismographic Network
Data in Beijing, PRC, in May, 1991. The CDSN has provided an invaluable new data
set for a part of the world that has lacked significant seismographic coverage
in the past. The data is useful for general studies of the earth's structure and
for earthquake hazard research conducted by both U.S. and PRC scientists. The
meeting is organized under the US/PRC Earthquake Studies Protocol. China's State
Seismological Bureau, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science
Foundation are the members of the Protocol. This travel and symposium is
important to the successful conduct of U.S. projects of earthquake hazards
research planned or underway in the PRC. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
