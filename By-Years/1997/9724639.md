Abstract- Long CTS-9724639 A system is assembled for simultaneous high-volume
computation and high-performance real-time visualization linked with high-speed
networking connections. The parallel computing system is centrally located,
while the visualization capability is distributed to sites convenient to primary
users. The system includes an expandable 16-mode parallel computer system and
four distributed visualization engines. Initial applications include fundamental
physics of turbulence-acoustic interactions, emissions and control of
combustion, large eddy simulation of reacting flows, molecular-dynamic
simulations of laser ablation, Monte Carlo analyses of the physics of fluids,
and supercritical fluid applications.
