9617715 Markle This is a pilot study to develop a series of software tools and
instructional materials to test the concept of delivering instructional packets
for grades 3-5 through the Internet. The materials are to be highly-interactive,
thematic activities to encourage collaborative problem solving. The student
materials will be accompanied by on-line teacher professional development,
support materials, and special activities to encourage parents to become
partners in the education process. The project proposes to develop a model for
how to exploit the capabilities of new technologies and access to the Internet
for science education. The themes in the materials will align closely with NSES.
If successful, the project will seek support to develop a comprehensive program
of Internet-based instructional materials in science for grades 3-5
