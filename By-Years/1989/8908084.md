This is a novel electrical/computer engineering approach to the difficult
problem of deducing physical information from acoustic signals. This research
will address issues concerning nonlinear propagation effects in order to predict
propagation of sound waves through inhomogeneous, nonlinear, tissue media. A new
era is emerging, namely, non-invasive visualization of internal organs. This
proposal suggests a new means for accomplishing this goal. This is a high-risk,
high-gain proposal. This type of research could substantially contribute to
visualization of internal organs without the use of ionizing radiation.
