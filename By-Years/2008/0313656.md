This U.S.-Brazil award will support Drs. Philip L. Cole and Jorge A. Lopez to
sponsor students to attend the Fifth Latin American Symposium on Nuclear Physics
(V LASNP) to be held in Santos, Brazil on September 1-5, 2003. The co-organizer
from Brazil is Dr. Roberto V. Ribas, Universidade de Sao
Paulo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this activity is to promote dialog among
faculty members and students of North American and South American institutions.
Through exchanges of ideas it will allow those involved to find common research
interests and goals. This will strengthen the link between US and Latin America
within the broad scope of the international nuclear physics community and will
provide the students with a first-hand view of research carried out in an
international context. Not only will this experience contribute to a globally
oriented workforce but also it might serve to encourage future researchers to
pursue future work in a part of the Americas that has not attracted as much
attention from US researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
