There is very little systematic data on volcanic emissions because of the lack
of suitable monitoring equipment. The available data show a very significant
correlation between volcanic activity and emissions. Therefore, there is a great
need for new instrumentation that will provide the needed data to understand and
model the role of geochemistry in volcanism. The proposed research is a
collaboration between volcanologists and gas sensor specialists to develop and
use advanced instrumentation for systematic monitoring of important volcanic
gases (e.g., HC1, CO2, SO2, H2S, HF, H2O and temperature). Recent advances in
microsensor technology and electronics will be exploited to develop a rugged,
low power, low cost, field worthy monitoring system. The units would be designed
to collect and transmit real-time emissions data for a period of six months
without any manual intervention. The data acquired by the instrumentation is
expected to stimulate the development of new models of volcanic behavior.
