The proposal requests partial support for young physicists to attend either of
the two sequential 44th Rencontres de Moriond conferences: (1) Electroweak
Interactions and Unified Theories and (2) QCD and High Energy Hadronic
Interactions. The first conference (March 7-14, 2009) addresses Electroweak
Interactions and Unified Theories. The subjects are Flavor Physics,
Astroparticles and Dark Matter Searches, Neutrino Physics, new particle
searches, Theories beyond the Standard Model, and Precision tests of the
Standard Model. The second conference (March 14-21, 2009) addresses Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) and High Energy Hadronic Interactions. The topics to be
covered include new physics and associated phenomenology, search for the Higgs
boson, production and decay of b and c quarks, properties of the top quark, high
PT physics at the Tevatron and LHC, commissioning of LHC detectors, recent
developments in QCD, new theoretical developments in particle physics, Small x,
saturation and forward and spin physics and Heavy Ion collisions. Both
conferences will take place in La Thuile, Aosta Valley, Italy. The funds will be
used for travel and registration expenses for young scientists, primarily post-
docs and un-tenured assistant professors.
