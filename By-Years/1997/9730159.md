Ingall 9730159 The importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine
organic carbon cycling is now widely recognized. The essential nutrient
phosphorus in DOM is potentially a significant source of P for algal and
microbial metabolism, however little is known about the chemical composition and
cycling of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). The PI, Ingall, proposes to study
the chemical composition and structure of DOP and particulate OP in the coastal
and open oceans. Efforts will be focused on that fraction of the DOP pool that
is isolated with a tangential-flow ultrafilter, and hence is expected to
represent the colloidal or high molecular weight fraction of DOP. Samples will
be obtained from previously collected and newly collected field samples, as well
as from controlled laboratory culturing and decomposition experiments. These
samples will be analyzed using newly developed 31P NMR techniques. The results
of this study are expected to lead to the quantification and identification of
organic P compounds, and are thus an important step in gaining a more complete
understanding of P cycling in the oceans. Ingall (OCE-9730159)
