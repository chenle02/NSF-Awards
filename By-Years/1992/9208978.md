This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
UCLA who is studying the adaptation of Laotian Hmong immigrants to California.
The project involves interviewing and participant observation of evolving gender
roles and awareness of the political situation they confront. By participating
in a gardening project and teaching photography to Hmong children, the student
will study their perceptions of changing gender roles and conflict management in
work settings and their interaction with government institutions. The underlying
problem is to see which aspects of their traditional identity the immigrants
will try to maintain while adapting to new gender, work, and political roles.
This research is important because the Hmong immigrants are a unique group,
having migrated to the US in response to the Vietnam war. Understanding the
details of how they are adapting to US culture and society will help policy
makers deal with the immigrant community at large.
