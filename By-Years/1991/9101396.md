Although its origins are highly abstract, stochastic approximation is a
technique used widely as part of computational algorithms, for example simulated
annealing. This research addresses at a fundamental level three current
difficulties: failure to converge to a global minimum, random errors that do not
form a martingale, and insufficiently rapid convergence, i.e., poor
approximation for reasonable but finite sample sizes. Progress on each one of
these should indicate directions to pursue in the modification and improvement
of current algorithms.
