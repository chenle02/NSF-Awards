This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the
unmet needs for effective analysis of protein phosphorylation, a process where a
phosphate group is added to a protein to change its function. Protein
phosphorylation is a crucial modification of proteins; its abnormalities have
been implicated in many diseases. Therefore, assessing the phosphorylation
status of individual proteins or classes of proteins, qualitatively or
quantitatively, has become a routine but extremely important step in the
majority of life science research labs. Existing technologies have glaring
deficiencies, including low reproducibility, poor recovery, high cost, reduced
selectivity and prolonged experiment time. The platform technology to be
developed during this Phase II project will greatly alleviate these shortcomings
by providing lucrative, general approaches for phosphorylation analyses. The
technologies will enable general phosphorylation detection, cost-effective
cancer inhibitor screenings, and kinase/phosphatase activity quantitation for
new drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential
of this project is the development of platform technology to improve a set of
biochemical assays, thus enabling the discovery of new therapeutic targets and
drugs. Protein phosphorylation and kinase inhibitors as drug targets are
currently at the peak of research and development (R&amp;D), responsible for
over 30% of the total drug discovery expenses. These R&amp;D activities could
greatly benefit from the proposed technologies due to their innovative design
and versatile features for optimum efficiency, and the ability to reproducibly
explore phosphorylation events in unprecedented depth. These should provide
invaluable tools and address needs of many bioscience research labs/facilities
in academic and industrial settings.
