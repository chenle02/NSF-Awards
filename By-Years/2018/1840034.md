The Research Security Operations Center (ResearchSOC) provides the research and
education (R&amp;E) community with cybersecurity services, training, and
information sharing needed to make scientific computing resilient to
cyberattacks and capable of supporting trustworthy, productive research. The
R&amp;E community has particular challenges regarding cybersecurity: a large
span of size and autonomy, the use of diverse infrastructure (scientific
instruments, sensor networks, sequencers, etc.), the highly collaborative and
dynamic nature of scientific work, and acquiring the scarce domain expertise
expertise needed to support cybersecurity in the research
context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these challenges, the ResearchSOC
leverages existing cybersecurity services from Indiana University, Duke
University, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and the University of
California San Diego. It tailors these service to the needs of the R&amp;E
community and combines these operational services with the establishment of a
community of practice for sharing knowledge and expertise, and operational
intelligence. The ResearchSOC also offers outreach and training targeted at
educating research project teams and the higher education information security
community regarding information security for research. The ResearchSOC is
engaging with the cybersecurity research community to discern how it can advance
research activities and make data available for research purposes in order to
improve the overall state of the art in information
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
