The goal of the Global Centroid-Moment-Tensor Project (GCMT Project) is to
analyze and quantify all moderate and large earthquakes occurring worldwide
using seismic data, and to provide the most comprehensive record of global
seismic strain release available. Data from global seismographic networks are
collected from the IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) and from individual network
operators in near-real time for the analysis of large earthquakes. Additional
archived data are later retrieved from the IRIS DMC to determine final results
and to investigate events of smaller magnitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major
objectives and activities of the GCMT Project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Systematic
determination of moment tensors for earthquakes with magnitude M&gt;5 globally,
and archiving of the results in the GCMT catalog.&lt;br/&gt;2. Rapid
determination of moment tensors for earthquakes with M&gt;5.5 globally, and
quick dissemination of the results ("quick CMTs").&lt;br/&gt;3. Curation and
distribution of the GCMT catalog, which contains moment-tensor results for the
period 1976 to the present, currently more than 35,000 earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;4.
Routine detection and location of seismic sources using surface waves.
&lt;br/&gt;5. Investigation and reporting of the quality of seismic waveforms
from the Global Seismographic Network other seismic networks. &lt;br/&gt;6.
Systematic analysis of earthquake sequences of special importance.
