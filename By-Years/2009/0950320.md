Professor Royce W. Murray of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is
supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to
study the electrocatalytic oxidation of water by solution-dispersed iridium
oxide nanoparticles, and to enhance the analytical capabilities for determining
the composition and properties of very small nanoparticles. Specifically, the
research plan seeks a better understanding of the mechanisms by which un-
supported and supported iridium oxide nanoparticles are effective as water
oxidation catalysts, and seeks the development of new measurement techniques to
determine the detailed composition and surface chemistry of
nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;The central aims of this project are to develop
techniques to enable the control of the size and determine the composition of
nanoparticles and to advance our understanding of the mechanisms in
electrocatalytic water splitting. This should ultimately contribute to the
design of nanoparticle-based devices such as photochemical energy conversion
systems and sensors. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in
cutting edge electrochemical techniques with relevance to alternative energy
research.
