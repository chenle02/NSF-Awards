Abstract 9618319 Novak This CAREER Program award provides long-term support to
measure the magnetic field configuration of the nucleus of our galaxy. The
technique used deduces the direction of the fields by measuring the polarization
of submillimeter emission from gas and dust near the core of the galaxy. Long
grains of dust align themselves with magnetic field, which leads to a net
polarization of the emitted far-infrared radiation. Maps of the morphology of
the fields will sensitively test models of galactic formation. The project is
particularly cost effective because it will make use of a telescope which will
be at South Pole for other purposes and will extend its usefulness to over-
winter operation. As is expected in all CAREER awards, graduate and
undergraduate students are involved with the hands-on experimental aspects of
this challenging experiment, including working at South Pole. ***
