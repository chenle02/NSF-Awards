Abstract

Center for Child & Family Research: A Conference

Laurie Dinnebeil & Chris Bergin

The purpose of this conference is to bring together key personnel from the
major universities and service agencies in Northwest Ohio to discuss the
feasibility of collaborative research to address the needs of children and
families. The conference is specifically targetted to achieving consensus for a
research agenda and to solidify plans for creating a research center. Expected
outcomes will be a set of research priorities and an implementation plan to move
toward establishing research collaboratives and possibly a research center on
children and families.
