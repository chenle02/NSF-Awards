This award supports the participation of 15 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Stochastic Analysis on Infinite Dimensional Spaces, to be held
January 4-8, 1994 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The co-organizers are Professor Hui
Hsiung Kuo, Louisiana State University, and Professor Hiroshi Kunita, Kyushu
University, Fukuoka, Japan. The objective of the seminar is to exchange
information on stochastic analysis related to Lie groups, stochastic partial
differential equations, stochastic flows and analysis on Wiener functionals,
large deviation, white noise calculus, and stable laws. Both the United States
and Japan have leading scientific researchers in the field of stochastic
analysis on infinite dimensional spaces. The field has been growing rapidly
during the last two decades because of its diversified applications and
mathematical theory. The time is right for researchers from both countries to
have in-depth discussions on the state of the art in this field.
