9500260 Manikopoulos The main objective of this project is to complete the
existing Turbonet multi-processor prototype system; this will enable the
researchers to investigate how to combine effectively the shared memory and
message passing paradigms in a realistic multi-computer structure for selected
classes of algorithms. Turbonet is a prototype system which physically
implements both paradigms. It is a desirable system, in terms of its
cost/performance ratio, to utilize in many computationally challenging
applications of practical significance. This work is aimed to alleviate the
weakness of parallel systems based solely on shared memory or message passing.
An additional important issue to be aided in this work is load balancing which
is a major problem in a growing number of scientific applications that give rise
to programs with dynamic execution profiles.
