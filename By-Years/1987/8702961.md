Parthenogenetic Reproduction and It's Correlation to the Presence of a Single
Trematode Parasite in Freshwater Snails. This award recommendation is made under
the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists and
Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign contries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants of international cooperation in science
and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research career. This research project will
address the problem of correlation between the capability of the freshwater
snail, Potamorpyrgus Antipodarum, of parthenogenetic reproduction and the
presence of a single trematode parasite. The purpose of this study is to
directly test the a priori prediction that sexual snails are more resistant to
infection by the trematode parasite than are asexual snails - a necessary
condition for the maintenance of sex by natural selection resulting from
parasitism. The project is under the direction of Dr. Curtis M. Lively,
Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson,
AZ 85721, U.S.A., and Dr. C. L. McLay, Head, Department of Zoology, University
of Canterbury, Christchurch 1, New Zealand. This award recommendation provides
funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,
stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, language training, if required,
and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
