The project is to measure the force and deformation of individual floc of
particles using a specially designed piston-cylinder apparatus. The relations
between the applied compressive force and the floc porosity and structure will
be determined. The effects of process variables on the structural
characteristics will be assessed. The results will be used to develop a theory
for the uniaxial compression based on the percolation theory with the moving
boundary of the cylinder.
