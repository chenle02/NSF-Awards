This Presidential Young Investigator Award supports the mathematical work of
Professor Frederic Bien of Princeton University. Dr. Bien's research aim is to
bring to bear on several problems in mathematics and science his expertise in
the representation theory of groups. Within mathematics, he will work on
deciding precisely which nonlinear differential equations can be integrated by
the inverse spectral transform. In theoretical computer science, Dr. Bien will
work on expanding graphs, which may model ideal communication networks. He will
also apply his knowledge to the field of neural networks. Group theory began in
the early nineteenth century as a description of operations that might be done
successively, and also undone, as a ninety-degree clockwise rotation is undone
by the ninety-degree counterclockwise rotation. Lie groups were developed in the
late part of that century by the path breaking Norwegian mathematician Sophus
Lie, who was interested in the most fundamental questions concerning
differential equations. Now, one hundred years later, group theory pervades
modern science, and the utility of Lie groups in many branches of mathematics,
as well as in physics, has continued undiminished.
