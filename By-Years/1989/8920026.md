This research project focuses on two major questions: (1) Do animal signals
convey specific information about objects and events in the environment? (Are
they representational?) and (2) Is the production of signals reflexive, or do
animals have the ability to emit or withhold signals depending on the
availability of an appropriate receiver? (Is there an intent to communicate?).
Dr. Marler's experimental approach is based on the discovery that birds will
respond to videotapes, both of stimuli that elicit signals, such as images of
hawks, and of other birds, as an acceptable audience for signal production.
Domestic chickens have a large repertoire of vocal signals, including different
calls associated with the discovery of food and with sighting a predator such as
a hawk. Dr. Marler will manipulate the form of video images to explore what
characteristics a bird image must possess to qualify as an acceptable audience
(size, color, parts of the body, behavior), and to determine the relative
contributions of visual and auditory audience properties. Other experiments will
pursue indications that the optimal audience may vary depending on the kind of
information that signals convey (aerial predators versus ground predators,
optimal or sub-optimal food items, etc.). These studies will throw new light on
what the communicative signals of animals actually mean, and the extent to which
they share some of the important characteristics of human language.
