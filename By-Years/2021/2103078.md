The research team seeks to use the Pleistocene record of Indian Monsoon
variation to examine how subdecadal rainfall dynamics change under disparate
mean-states and global boundary conditions to refine the current understanding
of the Indian Monsoon systemâ€™s response to climate forcing. Although Pleistocene
archives have provided several essential insights into Indian Monsoon dynamics,
inferences into subdecadal monsoon variability have been absent due to
insufficient sample resolution. Previous reconstructions indicate strong mean-
state monsoon responses to variations in insolation and greenhouse gas forcing,
but the manner in which subdecadal variability is modulated across these periods
is unclear. The current research effort focuses on periods with vastly different
greenhouse gas, insolation, and ice-volume conditions to outline the sensitivity
of monsoon seasonality and its short-term variability to global climate change.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will apply imaging and mass spectrometric
techniques to extract subdecadal hydroclimate signals from previously collected
archives from terrestrial and oceanic realms of the Indian subcontinent.
Specifically, the team will use previously collected cave stalagmites from
peninsular India and sediments from Site U1446 in the Bay of Bengal, for which
coarser-scale records of paleomonsoon variability have already been
generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research is to help confirm or
refute the following hypothesis: (1) seasonality and interannual monsoon
variability exhibit a fast (instantaneous) response to gradual insolation
forcing; (2) summer and winter monsoon dynamics vary out-of-phase with each
other across disparate Pleistocene climate states; and (3) seasonal rainfall in
the core monsoon zone and peninsular India is modulated similarly by external
forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include integrating
state-of-the-art geochemical techniques alongside paleoclimate dynamics to
advance knowledge on how climate forcing modulates short-term Indian Monsoon
variability and its extremes. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar
and will significantly expand her research portfolio. The project will also
support undergraduate researchers from underrepresented backgrounds at the
University of Arizona and will involve southern Arizona high school students
through the SARSEF program. This work will strengthen previously established
collaborations between US and Indian scientists, which has enabled successful
collection of samples in a societal responsible and mutually beneficial
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
