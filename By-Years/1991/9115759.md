Under an SBIR Phase II grant, a laser diagnostic instrument will be further
developed for the diagnosis of bubbles due to cavitation in flow systems. The
principle of the diagnostic method is phase doppler interferometry.
Identification of particles as either solid or bubble, and determination of
orientation and shape of bubbles, will be attempted with the new instrumentation
first in preliminary validation experiments and then in actual cavitating
conditions. Cavitating flow diagnosis will permit better understanding of, and
development of better predictive models for, flows applicable in chemical
engineering, nuclear engineering, and biological systems.
