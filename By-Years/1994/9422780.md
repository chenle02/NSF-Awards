ABSTRACT SBR-9422780 Hoffman, Donna Vanderbilt U This Research Planning Grant
(RPG) addresses the problem of marketing in computer-mediated environments
(CMEs). The research models CMEs as large-scale (e.g. national or global)
networked hypermedia environments, of which the Internet is the first and
current global implementation. The central thesis is that a CME is fundamentally
different, in nature, scope, and characteristics from other media. Traditional
media include both mass media (e.g. television, radio, newspaper, magazines and
direct mail), as well as personal communications (e.g., word-of-mouth). Numerous
characteristics differentiate CMSs from traditional media. This research will
investigate both decision-making characteristics which affect consumer behavior
in a computer- mediated environment, and media characteristics which are
intrinsic to this environment and have implications for marketing and
communications strategy. The goals of this planning stage are: 1) a
comprehensive literature review encompassing all disciplines relevant to CMEs,
including marketing, behavioral decision theory, consumer behavior, advertising,
communication, psychology, computer-mediated communication, and computer
science; 2) a proposed integrated theoretical framework for marketing in a
computer- mediated environment; and 3) a consequent set of testable propositions
that flow from the framework which will form the foundation for a longer term
research program on CMEs and marketing theory.
