This study explores the instructional implications and educational potential of
a new synthesis of reading and mathematics aimed at fostering critical thinking
and a deeper understanding of mathematics as a discipline. Building on current
research in mathematics education, reading comprehension, and critical thinking,
a framework for using "reading to learn mathematics" is developed and
implemented in secondary school mathematics classrooms using a collaborative
research model. Instructional units which introduce strategies for comprehending
mathematical texts other than traditional textbooks from the core of this new
synthesis. The study has three phases: (1)conceptual work developing the
theoretical framework and instructional implications; (2) professional
development for teachers who will implement "reading to learn mathematics" units
in their classrooms; (3) collaborative research with teachers on the
implementation of these units. Data from audio and video tapes of classroom
instruction, in-depth interviews, and case studies will be analyzed to
understand how students and teachers interpret and use "reading to learn
mathematics" and what students gain from their participation in these
experiences. The study will also examine how teachers' beliefs and practices are
influenced by participation in collaborative research. The interdisciplinary
nature of this research and its emphasis on collaboration will provide insights
into teaching-learning strategies which reconceptualize the goals of school
mathematics.
