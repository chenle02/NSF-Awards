This is an investigation of the feasibility of depositing hard-to-plate metals
from a supercritical fluid and of the fundamental physicochemical phenomena
associated with such a process including electrode kinetics, solution
conductivity, and dielectric behavior. Initial studies will be on the recently
demonstrated process for electroplating aluminum on copper from a supercritical
mixture of toluene, ethane, aluminum bromide, and potassium bromide.
Electrodeposition of titanium will also be examined. If successful, this
approach offers a broad range of possible metal platings with metals possessing
desirable properties with respect to electrical conductivity, chemical
catalysis, or corrosion resistance. These new materials could find application
in a variety of electronic and structural materials applications. Extension of
the approach to alloys and semiconductors may also be possible.
