9622761 Leckband This proposal is a request for funding for a surface force
apparatus facility with capabilities for both normal and shear force
measurements. The objective is to establish a molecular force measurement
facility that will enable researchers in materials and surface science to
directly measure the molecular surface forces associated with well-defined
chemistries and structures of material surfaces. Such measurements will
facilitate: (1) determinations of the fundamental relationships between
molecular composition, structure/organization, and the molecular forces that
ultimately control material interactions, and (2) direct testing of theories
that describe these interrelationships.
