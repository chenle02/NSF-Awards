This study will evaluate the feasibility of a plant cell culture process to
produce a protein product. The system which will be studied is the production of
a protein, trichosanthin, from plant cell cultures of Trichosanthes cucumerina
and Trichosanthes kirilowii. Trichosanthin is a fairly well characterized
protein that has been reported in the literature and may have significant value
as a human therapeutic agent. In addition to improving the understanding of the
important engineering aspects of plant cell cultures, the development of plant
cell culture process technology for trichosanthin may lead the way for
development of processes for production of other ribosome inactivating proteins.
