The Maryland Science Center (MSC) seeks funding for a planning grant to
investigate the potential of Science on a Sphere (SOS), a NOAA-developed
research tool that projects real meteorological and geological data sets onto a
large suspended globe. MSC will evaluate a temporary installation of SOS as a
public exhibit and school group learning tool, as well as hold a workshop for
staff from other museums and prepare a report for dissemination.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT: SOS offers a way to present real data on earth and planetary
sciences not possible in a two-dimensional format. An advisory group of exhibit
and education professionals from three other science centers (Tech Museum, San
Jose, CA; SciPort, Shreveport, LA; Arizona Science Center, Phoenix, AZ) and NOAA
will add expertise in the evaluation of SOS, which will be carried out by RMC
Research Corporation.

BROADER IMPACT: SOS has the potential to become a new tool for science center
presentations nationwide. Testing and evaluation results will be shared with
other science centers at the ASTC Annual Conference and other means of
dissemination.
