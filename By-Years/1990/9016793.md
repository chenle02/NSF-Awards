Miconia (family Melastomaceae) is a large and diverse genus of tropical shrubs,
some of which are relatively rare. The genus itself is not well-marked and
probably is not monophyletic. In addition, the intrageneric boundaries are
unclear with respect to assignment of the species to the various sections.
Therefore, the genus is in need of in-depth taxonomic revision. The PI proposes
to initiate this task with an analysis of phylogenetic relationships among the
species of section Chaenopleura, which is restricted to the West Indies. This
aspect of the investigation will be based primarily on gross morphology and will
involve the use of mainland species to polarize character transformations and
parsimony-analyses to derive patterns of evolution in the genus. The PI then
proposes to revise the section based on his phylogenetic analysis; to write a
monograph to include complete, detailed descriptions; and to write a key to the
species. He and a collaborator will collect fresh specimens for the study.
