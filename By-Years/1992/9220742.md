Dr. James and his colleagues will undertake a comprehensive experimental
investigation of the electron impact excitation of the Lyman and Balmer series
of atomic hydrogen. Excitation of atomic hydrogen by electron impact remains the
key testing ground for the development of fundamental theories electron-particle
interactions and these experiments will confront theory with direct
measurements.
