A state-of-the-art desktop scanning electron microscope (SEM) system will be
purchased for faculty and undergraduate students at Lafayette College to conduct
research and design projects and to expand research training in both engineering
and the sciences. This instrumentation will extend the research concentrations
and capabilities of the individual investigators while also facilitating
collaborations between departments. In addition to its high-quality and high-
resolution imaging capability, this user-friendly instrumentation is equipped
with electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for compositional analysis and
employs a suite of software applications that provide compositional mapping,
three-dimensional surface roughness reconstruction, and fibermetric analysis,
all of which are integral to the described research activities. The system also
includes a variety of sample holders that permit a diverse array of materials to
be imaged at different orientations. The instrumentation provides analysis that
is critical to the thorough understanding of the dimensions, form, and function
of the objects being studied. Application areas include the study of materials,
lab-on-chip or optoelectrical devices with submillimeter components, geological
samples, and biological and/or bioengineered systems.
