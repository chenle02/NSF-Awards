The Mississippian System in the southeastern U.S. represents the interaction
between two main paleotectonic and paleogeographic realms, a carbonate dominated
one associated with the craton and a terrigenous realm associated with
extracratonic sources. The research seeks to establish a detailed foraminiferal
biostratigraphic zonation leading to an integrated time-stratigraphic/facies
framework for Middle and Upper Mississippian rocks in the region. Results of the
study will allow determination of mutual relations between facies extending
across the broad region encompassing the southern Appalachians, southern
Cumberland Plateau, and Black Warrior basin. This work will provide information
for analyzing the paleogeographic and paleotectonic evolution of the southern
Appalachians and will provide important data regarding the nature and position
of the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary.
