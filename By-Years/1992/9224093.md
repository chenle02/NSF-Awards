*** 9224093 Malone How important are managerial tools like total quality
management, business reengineering, and information technology? The goal of this
project is to provide a firmer theoretical and empirical foundation for
understanding and using them. To do this, the project will include (1)
collecting examples of how different organizations perform similar processes,
and (2) representing these examples in an on line "process hand book" which
includes the relative advantages of the alternatives. The handbook is intended
to help (a) redesign existing organizational processes, (b) invent new
organizational processes that take advantage of information technology, and
perhaps (c) automatically generate software to support organizational processes.
A key intellectual contribution of the work is expected to be a novel approach
to representing processes at various levels of abstraction. This approach uses
ideas from computer science about inheritance and from coordination theory about
managing dependencies. Its primary advantage is that it allows users to
explicitly represent the similarities (and differences) among related processes
and to easily find or generate sensible alternatives for how a given process
could be performed. ***
