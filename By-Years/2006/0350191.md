In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Philip J. Reid of the University of Washington will
conduct research on the photochemistry of simple halogenated species (ClOCl,
ClNO and OClO) in condensed phases. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop
a deeper understanding of the homogeneous and heterogeneous chemistries of these
atmospherically important species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the applications
of the present work towards developing a deeper understanding of some
particularly important atmospheric species, the work supported through this
award provides an opportunity for training of graduate and undergraduate
researchers in physical and environmental chemistry. Prof. Reid will continue to
actively address issues that impact the academic careers of members of groups
who are underrepresented in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
