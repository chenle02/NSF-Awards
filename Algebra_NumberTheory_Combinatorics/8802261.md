The principal investigator will study a number of computational and algorithmic
issues which are relevant to many research problems in design theory. One of the
most significant algorithmic questions to be studied is the isomorpohism problem
for linear codes. Also investigated will be various decomposition problems and
algorithms which will aid in their study, with the focus on the decomposition of
Steiner systems and hypergraphs in general. Besides being of interest from an
algorithmic point of view, the computational studies proposed will provide
needed insight into difficult problems involving designs, hypergraphs, linear
codes, and finite geometries.
