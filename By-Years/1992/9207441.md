The eggs and embryos of several species of hydrozoans contain endogenous
calcium indicators similar to aequorin. These preparations offer unique
opportunities for studying the role of calcium in early development. Two calcium
transients, one at fertilization, and another at cleavage, are crucial for
normal development. This project will employ photon counting techniques and
image intensified video microscopy methods to determine if the fertilization
calcium transient is due to a calcium wave, and microinjection experiments to
determine what second messengers participate in its initiation and propagation.
Cytokinesis in hydrozoans is slow and requires external calcium. Photon
counting, fluorescent dye injection, and drugs will be used to investigate how
the calcium transient during cytokinesis is regulated. Voltage dependent calcium
channels first become functional about one hour after fertilization. These
channels play a major role in rapid calcium influx but very little is known
about the developmental events that lead to the onset of channel function. This
project will define the factors that are responsible for initiating calcium
channel function in hydrozoans. When calcium rises in the cytosol of cleavage
stage embryos, calcium is simultaneously transported from the endoplasmic
reticulum to the external medium. This project will identify the mechanism that
mediates this calcium efflux.
