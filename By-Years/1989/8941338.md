This project continues studies on free amino acid transport and its role in
osmotic regulation. Phosphorylation is being studied as a key regulatory
mechanism during salt stress. The hypothesis to be tested is that the
intracellular levels of the readily metabolized amino acid osmolytes appear to
be controlled by accumulation behind a well regulated metabolic blockade to
catabolism within the mitochondria rather than by an increased rate of synthesis
or by an activation of "overproducer genes" as is seen in some bacteria.
Adaptation to salt stress at the cellular level is a complicated biochemical
process. Cells must regulate their internal salt concentration and this has
serious implications for the regulation of cell volume. This project
investigates how the levels of free amino acids are involved in this
process.***//
