Over the past few years, cloud computing services like Amazon's EC2 have
commoditized computing resources. Despite this success, cloud computing
primarily targets users whose virtual machines (VMs) are rarely idle, as cloud
users are typically billed for the amount of time the VM is awake, not how much
work it does. Thus, services that are long-lived but mostly idle a significant
fraction of the time are prohibitively expensive for many potential users of
cloud computing. In this project, the PIs are developing a finer-grained model
of cloud computation based around lightweight instances. Lightweight instances
are more akin to processes than virtual machines; they allow clients to only pay
for their actual usage of cloud resources, and to not have the complexity and
overhead of running an entire operating system. The lightweight instance
approach has the potential to bring the benefits of cloud computing to a variety
of users for whom it is a poor fit today. The PIs are exploring a new, finer-
granularity model for cloud computing, wherein the cloud makes it appear that
all client instances are running all the time, but may actually swap them out
while idle to permit statistical multiplexing. Compared to today's VM-based
model and container-based model, the proposed process-based model provides a
much higher level of abstraction, and lets clients run long-lived, mostly-idle
services much more cheaply than is possible today. If successful, the research
would open up a wide variety of new applications and architectures: processes
could cheaply be run in the cloud on behalf of end users, providing them with
the ability to run long-lived services cheaply.
