Science curriculums must include exposure to the current techniques and tools
of the discipline, as well as to accepted principles and theories. "Molecular
modeling" - using computational power to dynamically model or simulate complex
chemical systems - is rapidly establishing itself in both academic and
industrial settings as one of the most powerful and exciting tools for probing
chemical phenomena. This project has brought the technique into the
undergraduate organic chemistry, so that the curriculum properly reflects how
organic chemistry is practiced and what chemists actually do; provides the
student with an exciting and powerful tool for exploration and testing of many
fundamental principles of organic chemistry - principles not easily illustrated
in either the lecture or the laboratory; facilitates a deeper understanding of
fundamental principles of molecular structure and molecular energetics; and
attracts more majors by making the curriculum exciting and by allowing students
more creativity in their study. To implement the program, the department
acquired computational hardware and software to integrate molecular modeling
into the second-year chemistry course as a basic tool for exploring molecular
structure, molecular energetics, and chemical reactivity. The goal of the
project is to introduce students to the use of the computer for modeling complex
systems. This curricular development has substantially enriched the educational
experience for students in a core-course which is central to the training of
chemists, biologists, and students going into health related careers. The three
Claremont colleges, Pitzer, Claremont McKenna, and Scripps contributed to the
project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
