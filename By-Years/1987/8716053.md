This grant provides for the continued analysis of electric field and auroral
x-ray data that were acquired on a series of eight balloon flights (out of 10
attempted launches) from the South Pole Station in the austral summer of
1985-86. The data set is unique, and when compared with data from other sources
such as South Pole ground based instruments and magnetically conjugate radars it
should provide new insight into the processes that accelerate magnetospheric
electrons into the atmosphere. The data will also be compared with satellite
data to determine the conditions during which several different auroral
phenomena occur. This project was carried out in conjunction with the University
of Maryland. Funding is also provided for the support of undergraduate students
under the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program. The University
of Houston and the scientists are uniquely equipped to carry out this research.
