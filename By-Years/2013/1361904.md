The research of the I/UCRC for Advanced Composites in Transportation Vehicles
will span from material development to manufacturing process improvements.
Multi-functional nano-composites, natural fiber composites, materials for
extreme environments, and out-of-autoclave composites will be investigated while
multi-scale material modeling will capture mechanisms at different length and
time scales. The durability, damage tolerance, and fracture behavior of
composites will be studied. Integrated optimization of material-product systems
will be pursued through hierarchically decomposed design optimization
methodology. Damage diagnostics and prognostics are intended to enable Condition
Based Maintenance for improved safety and reduced life cycle cost.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed I/UCRC has the potential to increase the use
of advanced composite structures in aerospace, automotive, and naval vehicles
and result in U.S. industrial growth. Advances through center research can lead
to reduction of vehicle weight and lower energy consumption compared to current
metallic structures and could conceivably alter the current design paradigm for
composite materials. Center work is targeted to result in the interdisciplinary
and collaborative training of science and engineering students, dissemination of
results at technical meetings and in the archival literature, and increased
exposure of K-12, community college, and university students to STEM.&lt;br/&gt;
