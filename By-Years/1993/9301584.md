9301584 Spencer The objective of this project is the development of highly
reliable and safe control strategies for structural protection using stability-
based hybrid controls. More specifically, the research project will (1) develop
a probabilistic framework for stability-based, uncertainty tolerant control
design for maximizing the reliability of structures operating in their linear
range; (2) develop stability-based, nonlinear, hybrid control strategies for
application to systems including, but not limited to, active base isolation
systems and variable parameter control device; (3) integrate the developments of
(1) and (2) into a combined design strategy for both structure and controller so
as to achieve the maximum overall reliability inherent in the controlled
structure; and (4) conduct proof of concept tests of control strategies so that
the most promising control architectures can be thoroughly evaluated and
verified before being tested at national laboratories such as NCEER. By means of
the reliability approach delineated in this proposal, efforts can be directed
toward facets of the hybrid control problem which will yield the most reliable
and cost effective solutions. The successful completion of this research is
expected to enhance the possibility of economic and practical implementation of
hybrid control of linear and nonlinear structures for earthquake hazard
mitigation. ***
