It is proposed to address the question of how intuitive and concise linear model
concepts and techniques can be extended to nonparametric settings and it is also
proposed to develop nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics that can be
used for dimensionality reduction and to address the question of adequacy of
particular models. More precisely, it is proposed to focus on procedures that
are counterparts to such commonly used linear model ideas as regression
coefficients, correlation coefficients, ANOVA decompositions, and principal
components. In addition, it is proposed to consider nonparametric tools for
model building, identification, and diagnostics including tests for linearity,
partial linearity, additivity, etc. All estimators to be considered depend on
smoothing parameters needed in estimation of curves and surfaces. A large part
of the research will address the problem of developing reliable data-based
methods for smoothing parameter selection. With the advent of computer data
bases of unprecedented size and complexity and with dramatic increase in
computer power, it has become increasingly more desirable and possible to
develop general models, concepts, and procedures that can be used to study
relationships between variables and to construct models less dependent on
specific assumptions. It is proposed to extend commonly used linear model ideas
and techniques to this more general setting and to assess the adequacy of models
with simpler structure.
