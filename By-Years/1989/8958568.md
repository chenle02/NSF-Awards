Wawrzynek The focus of this research is on designing application- specific VLSI
architectures, specifically for the generation of realistic musical sounds using
parallel processing and VLSI technologies. The approach is to develop
mathematical models for the motions of physical musical instruments, and to
numerically solve these models to produce sounds using "synthesis by
simulation." The design of efficient and fast application- specific VLSI
computing architectures is crucial to the success of this project due to the
requirements on massive computations and on real-time human interaction. The
focus of this research is on the integration of the vector coprocessor, designed
to accelerate neural net computations, into a supercomputer designed for
connectionist computations. This supercomputer will use the high-speed CMOS
techniques under development and may include provisions for analog I/O.
