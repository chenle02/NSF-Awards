An information-processing, resource-allocation theory is used to investigate
motivational and self-regulatory mechanisms as they affect the acquisition and
maintenance of complex decision-making performance in jobs demanding highly
skilled performance. Air traffic controllers will be used at the target skill
group in this project. Key determinants of self-monitoring strategies and
competency judgments, their interrelations, and their associations with
performance are evaluated using an integrative aptitude/treatment interactions
approach. Three studies examine the influence of the information environment on
self-regulatory activities and task performance. These studies have implications
for the development of training interventions to maximize on-task attentional
effort and skill development in cognitively demanding, information-rich jobs. A
second series of studies examines cognitive ability, task conception, and
motivational determinants of individual differences in competency judgments of
aspects of performance. The findings of these studies have implications for
understanding the role of conative processes in skill acquisition, as well as
for the development of more precise non-cognitive selection measures for the
prediction of performance in complex jobs involving protracted training. The use
of a high-fidelity work task simulation permits the integrations of laboratory
findings with results obtained in two longitudinal field studies, and provides
critical information for ultimate implementation in training and on-the-job
situations.
