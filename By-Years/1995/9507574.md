9507574 Jensen Theoretical investigations into experimentally accessible
problems in quantum chaos continues. The research includes studies of scarred
wavefunctions, stabilization of atoms in super- intense fields, excitation and
ionization of atoms by single- cycle pulses and ballistic electron transport in
semiconductor microstructures. ***
