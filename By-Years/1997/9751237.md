The Biology and Chemistry departments have recently joined efforts to formulate
an Undergraduate Program in Biotechnology designed as an emphasis within either
a biology or a chemistry major. This program will enhance classroom and
laboratory instruction by training students in the modern laboratory
methodologies of biotechnology. Relevant equipment being requested includes 12
molecular biology workstations (set of three micropipettors, a mini-gel
electrophoresis box &amp; power supply, a picocentrifuge, and a vortex mixer).
Dry-bath incubators, safety splash shields, automatic pipet-aids, micro-
centrifuges, Mini-protean gel boxes &amp; transblot inserts, water baths, and
orbital mixers will be shared by the stations. Individual equipment items being
requested include the following: thermocycler amplitron &amp; printer,
refrigerated micro centrifuge and table-top centrifuge, fluorometer,UV
spectrophotometer, UV transilluminator &amp; documentation system, Sequencing
System, vacuum concentrating speed dryer, and low pressure automated liquid
chromatography unit. This program will improve the curriculum by: 1) allowingfor
effective instruction of the principles and technologies associated with current
Biotechnology applications through a new course, Molecular Biology (BIO 4325),
anG enhancement of existing courses, Genetics (BIO 3325), Cell Biology (BIO
4352), and Biochemistry (BIO OR CHM 4361,4362 AND 4362) 2) including relevant
biotechnology applications in lower division courses for science major such as
General Biology (BIO 2101,2102, AND 2103) The focus of this program is
consistent with the departmental goal of effectively preparing students for
careers in the health sciences, research, teaching, and the biotechnology
industry.
