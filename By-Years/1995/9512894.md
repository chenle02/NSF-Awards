9512894 Pullin This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research between Jorge Pullin
of Penn State University and Reinaldo Gleiser of Universidad Nacional de Cordoba
in Argentina addresses the use of higher order perturbation theory in the
analysis of the collision of two black holes. They will work with Richard Price,
known for his work on higher order perturbation theory. The general problem of
the coalescence of binary star systems and black hole binaries for prediction of
gravitational wave forms is the subject of an NSF Grand Challenge. Pullin is a
young PhD who has published several works on black holes and gravitation. Most
work to date in this area has depended on supercomputer simulations which are
hard to check theoretically. The proposed work, although approximate, can serve
as a check on other methods. It extends earlier first order calculations to
obtain the accuracy needed for prediction. ***
