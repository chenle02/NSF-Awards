9713682 Jaillet This research investigates key aspects of real-time dynamic
problems in logistics and transportation. The goals of the research are to (1)
systematically analyze and integrate the most promising paradigms/solution
strategies for dealing with real-time vehicle routing and scheduling problems,
(2) formulate adequate corresponding generic models, and (3) develop, analyze,
and implement algorithms for solving them. The focus of the research is on the
rigorous mathematical analysis of canonical models which would capture the
essence of this new class of problems. A main theme of the methodology will be
on the integration of a priori optimization, on-line strategy, distributed local
heuristics, randomization, and Markov decision process. Interest in the
development of real-time and dynamic models of fleet operations and of fleet
management systems which are responsive to change in demand, traffic network and
other conditions is emerging in many industries and for a wide variety of
applications. Managing and making use of the vast quantities of real-time
information made available by navigation technologies, satellite positioning
systems, automatic vehicle identification systems and spatial GIS databases
requires the development of new models and algorithms. This research holds the
potential for significant advances in both the theory and applications of such
models and algorithms.
