Neural computation requires very high computing bandwidths for real-world time-
varying classification problems. This project is developing a low cost
multiprocessor signal processing system to provide these high bandwidths. The
multi-processor will be transparently integrated with an existing neural-network
software package that provides a simulation environment for dynamic neural
networks. The combination of fast hardware and easy to use software will make
fast neural computing affordable in a PC environment.
