This project deals with a long-standing problem related to randomness. Consider
a ball on a frictionless table. If the ball is set in motion, it will travel
forever, making perfectly elastic collisions with the walls. If the table is a
square or an equilateral triangle, there are only two possible behaviors: either
the ball repeats the same periodic path forever, or it travels completely
randomly in the entire polygon, eventually visiting every part of the table.
This project is directed toward the basic mathematical problem of understanding
the behavior of a ball when the table is a more general polygon. This is a basic
problem arising in physics and statistical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project concerns the interrelated analytic study of trajectories on rational
polygonal tables, moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic differentials, and the
dynamics of the action of the group of two-by-two matrices on these moduli
spaces. In recent work with M. Mirzakhani and in part with A. Mohammadi the PI
was able to prove some dynamical rigidity results for this action, which allow
one to understand every (and not just almost every) orbit. This is important for
several reasons. In particular, the surfaces which arise from table trajectories
are a set of measure zero in the moduli space, and ergodic theorems which hold
at every point are needed to prove results about the trajectories. Many of the
results and techniques are based on a loose analogy with the theory of unipotent
flows on locally symmetric spaces (e.g. Ratner's theorem). However, the moduli
spaces of differentials are substantially different and new ideas were needed.
We propose developing these ideas further, both in the context of dynamics on
moduli space and also in the context of other group actions.
