The principal investigator continues investigations of time-dependent partial
differential equations. Typical applications are boundary-layer phenomena in
fluid flow, and modeling atmospheric and oceanic phenomena. The work
concentrates on turbulent flows, problems with different time scales, problems
that are locally not well-posed. It incorporates theoretical studies, numerical
investigations, and the development of new computational algorithms.
