In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. John M. Papanikolas of the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will combine pump-probe methodologies with
nonlinear microscopy to investigate the charge carrier dynamics in one-
dimensional nanostructures and networks on ultrafast time scales. The project
will develop a new microscopy technique that will excite a nanostructure in one
spatial location and probe the dynamics in another, on time scales ranging from
femtoseconds to nanoseconds. Professor Papanikolas and his students will use
this spatially-separated pump-probe microscope to visualize charge carrier
migration through individual nanorods and networks. The project will focus
primarily on nanowires with radial (i.e. core-shell) and axial heterojunctions
with the goal of following carriers as the move through the structure, from one
material to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how size
and shape influence the flow of charge carriers (electrons and holes) through
both individual nanostructures and collections of interconnected nanostructures.
This issue is fundamentally important and critical to understanding many
problems in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Variation in behavior from
structure-to-structure, and even between different spatial locations within the
same structure, is a hallmark of complexity and its presence poses a major
challenge to those wishing to use nanoscale materials in a device applications.
The project will also promote teaching, training, and learning in the context of
a research program. Graduate, undergraduate and high school students will
participate in this research. They will develop the technologically
sophisticated instrumentation, apply those methods to the study of single
nanostructures, and take part in the communication of their results at national
meetings.
