Based upon important concerns, a workshop will be conducted to develop a
strategy that will supply the required number of quality faculty in engineering
for the future. The group with the most involvement with this problem is the
deans of U.S. engineering schools. The deans are organized within the American
Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) into the Engineering Deans Council
(EDC). The number of U.S. students pursuing engineering doctorates is inadequate
to meet the industrial, governmental, and academic needs of the Nation. The
deans will address the problem of increasing the number of quality U.S. students
who pursue engineering doctorates and seek faculty careers. The plan is to
gather the available data, explore alternative possibilities, and hold a
workshop to anlayze the problem and develop possible solutions.
