This proposal is the first phase in establishing a Parallel Applications and
Software Laboratory that will be a component of the Indiana University Center
for Innovative Computer Applications (CICA). This laboratory will build upon the
resources of an established center to provide a facility where a staff of
trained people will work directly with scientists from a variety of disciplines
to design new parallel applications and to study the effectiveness of
specialized tools for parallel programming, program restructuring and
performance visualization. The research mission of the laboratory will be to use
the domain of real world applications to study the problem of designing scalable
parallel software. Our specific research projects for this laboratory are: (1)
To apply and evaluate existing parallel programming tools to real applications
in the physical and social sciences. (2) To investigate the utility of higher
level, object oriented abstraction mechanisms in the design of parallel
applications. In particular, we will use a new programming methodology based on
object oriented design that will allow us to compile programs for a wide variety
of massively parallel architectures. (3) To extend the state of the art in
performance analysis tools so that they are able to predict performance as
machine and problem sizes are scaled. This involves the design of a new
generation of algorithm visualization tools that incorporates parallel
complexity models and static and dynamic analysis of parallel programs with
analytical models of machine behavior.
