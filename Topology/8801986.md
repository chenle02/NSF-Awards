This project investigates collections of all matrices of certain specific
types, viewing the collections as geometric objects. Specifically, it is
concerned with the calculation of the cohomology rings of certain matrix groups
over the finite field of two elements, with coefficients in this same finite
field, and with the application of these results to the detection of torsion
classes in the integral homology of the mapping class groups of surfaces. The
mapping class groups of surfaces with a single fixed boundary component support
a homology operation, or equivalently a double loop space structure, that is
little understood. Maginnis plans to obtain information about this homology
operation by detecting classes in the homology of matrix groups. These matrix
groups will include the upper triangular matrices, a Sylow 2-subgroup of the
general linear group, and symplectic matrices and their Sylow 2-subgroups. He
also plans to study similar matrix groups over the integers.
