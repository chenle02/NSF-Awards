In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program in the
Division of Chemistry of NSF, Professors Neil Donahue and Ryan Sullivan of the
Carnegie Mellon University Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies will
investigate the mixing of organic aerosols under conditions typically found in
the atmosphere. Atmospheric particles consist of rich mixtures, often containing
thousands of different organic compounds in a single particle. The way organic
compounds form mixtures can profoundly influence how rapidly particles grow from
tiny sizes (clusters of a few molecules) up to sizes that influence human health
and climate (of order 100 nm in diameter) as well as their ultimate size. The
research team also engages in outreach, combining the results of this research
with broader issues of climate and health effects as part of the Science and
Engineering Ambassadors program of the National Academy of Sciences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will probe the behavior of individual particles,
either in isolation or in aerosol suspensions, to measure these key properties
for both carefully prepared simple mixtures and rich mixtures consisting of
secondary compounds formed via atmospheric oxidation of more volatile
precursors. A key method will be to prepare two different aerosol suspensions in
separate containers, often using isotopic labels (D or 13C) to ensure that the
constituent mass spectra are completely distinct from one another. After
combining the two suspensions, the researchers will then monitor the evolution
of individual particle mass spectra while the constituents of the two
populations interchange (if they do) via gas-phase exchange. In some cases
variables such as chamber temperature and humidity will be varied. Both the
rates of exchange and the ultimate stable mixing state will be key observables.
