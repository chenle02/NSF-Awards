The objective of this research is to understand, at the enzyme level, the
biochemical events which lead to and control solvent production in the
butanol/acetone fermentation. Elucidation of the control mechanisms of solvent
production will suggest direct butanol selectivity, and yields. The latter
determne the economic feasibility of this important fermentation. The activity
levels of 12 key product-formation enzymes will be measured at various stages.
