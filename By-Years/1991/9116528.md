Fundamental research to improve understanding of adhesion of metallic films to
ceramic substrates using pulsed laser radiation will be conducted. A special
feature of the research is the principle of laser enhanced adhesion. It is
proposed to extend the results of previous work to other metals and ceramics,
and to systematically explore the atomic level aspects of the phenomena to gain
an understanding of the elementary basis for laser-enhanced adhesion. %%% This
research is expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of basic
properties of thin films important to the functionality of electronic/photonic
materials and particular compositional and structural combinations and
configurations relevant to microelectronic circuitry packaging. From an
application point of view, understanding these properties and their relationship
to materials synthesis and processing is highly beneficial to semiconductor
circuit design and fabrication. The results will be of importance in a general
way to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated electronic and
photonic devices and circuits.
