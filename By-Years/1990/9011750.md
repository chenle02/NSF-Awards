New developments in solar flare physics emphasize the need to study solar
flares with high speed resolution, at sampling intervals below one second. This
is an observational effort designed to view flares in the visible spectrum (H
alpha) with newly developed instrumentation combining standard video technology
with an accurate clock/video time inserter. The flares will be analyzed with a
temporal resolution of 1/30th second, to better understand the flare energy
release mechanism(s). The system will be installed on a small telescope and will
be run by undergraduate students with faculty direction in coordination with
measurements at other wavelengths. Participation in MAX'91 and other campaigns
is planned as part of this research effort.
