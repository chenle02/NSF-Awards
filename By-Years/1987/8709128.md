Professor McCluskey's research is in testing of VLSI circuits with a focus on
topics in error detection and fault diagnosis. In error detection, he will study
the phenomenon of transient errors by physical experiments, simulation and
analysis. He is also investigating error detection through methods which involve
verification of a problem answer. In fault diagnosis, he is developing test and
diagnostic procedures that provide guaranteed fault coverage for various types
of faults other than stuck-at faults. These include bridging, intermittent and
delay faults. Methods of generating test patterns to detect complex faults are
being investigated. Research is aimed at better techniques for network
segmentation, pattern generation for segments, and generation of patterns either
on the chip, on board or by program.
