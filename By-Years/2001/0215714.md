DMS-0215714&lt;br/&gt;Scott T. Weidman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wake of the
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on &lt;br/&gt;the United States, the U.S.
mathematical sciences community &lt;br/&gt;has become increasingly interested in
contributing to&lt;br/&gt;homeland security. Many areas of defense and
intelligence &lt;br/&gt;rely naturally on advances in the mathematical sciences,
&lt;br/&gt;and a large number of talented mathematical scientists
have&lt;br/&gt;contributed to those areas over the past 60 years and more.
&lt;br/&gt;The current climate provides an opportunity for expanding
&lt;br/&gt;that pool of mathematical scientists who are actively involved
&lt;br/&gt;in such research. This award will partial support The National
Research Council's Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications, in
conjunction with its Committee on Applied &lt;br/&gt;and Theoretical Statistics,
in holding a workshop, preparing &lt;br/&gt;a report, and posting an on-line
video on "The Role of &lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Scientists in Homeland Defense" in
order to &lt;br/&gt;stimulate the involvement of more mathematical scientists
&lt;br/&gt;in major areas of homeland defense.&lt;br/&gt;
