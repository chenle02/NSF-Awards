A five-day international conference entitled "Reflections on Geometry: 3--
Manifolds, Groups and Singularities" is to be held at Columbia University in New
York City on June 8-12, 2020. Research on the three main topics of the
conference has proceeded at a remarkable pace, in a multitude of directions, and
using diverse methods of study and application. Many exciting possibilities for
current and future research lie at the interface of these areas, with important
potential applications in other subfields of mathematics and physics. The main
objective of this conference is to provide a single forum for a comprehensive
meeting, which will create many opportunities for cross-fertilization of these
blossoming research directions and methods across diverse disciplines.

This conference will focus on new developments that highlight connections
between these fields, and help create new avenues for collaboration. All
conference participants will benefit from the unusual breadth of this
conference, and the opportunity to see connections between topics that first
appeared in distinct research fields. Graduate students and junior researchers
will especially benefit by meeting distinguished researchers, gaining
perspective, learning the current developments, setting goals for further
research, and exploring applications to different fields of mathematics. More
