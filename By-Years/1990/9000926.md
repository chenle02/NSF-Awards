The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute is planning and organizing the
Fourth International Conference on Seismic Zonation (41CSZ) for Safer
Construction and Reduction of Life and Property Losses from Future Earthquakes.
This conference will provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the advances of
nearly a decade in earth sciences, engineering, urban planning, social sciences
and public policy to reduce earthquake hazards at local, regional and national
scales. This award provides partial support for the conference. The conference
is the fourth in a series of conferences previously supported by the National
Science Foundation. This conference will emphasize results of the last decade
pertinent to earthquake disaster mitigation at sites throughout the world. The
conference will provide a multi-disciplinary forum for assimilation and
dissemination of information in support of the U.S. and International Decades
for Natural Disaster Reduction(IDNDR). Dr. Frank Press, President of the United
States National Academy of Science, will serve as the Honorary Chairman.
