The characterization of large computational applications from a systems
perspective is critical to the design of future high performance systems that
achieve good performance on this class of applications. There is a growing
acceptance of the fact that systems research needs to be driven by realistic
applications. This small grant will enable the PIs to study the issues involved
in developing an infrastructure for systems characterizations of applications.
