This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Stephen Lippard, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, to employ metal coordination complexes as reporting probes for
biological nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide is an important molecule that
controls many biological functions including smooth muscle dilation in the heart
and other organs, signaling in the brain, and functioning of the immune system.
This project investigates these roles through the preparation and application of
bright, light-emitting molecules based on transition metal chemistry to track
the generation and translocation of nitric oxide to its biological targets.
Included among the targets are units in proteins that contain iron or zinc bound
to sulfur, and the reactions of these units with nitric oxide and its
derivatives are being investigated to provide benchmarks for interpreting the
chemistry that transduces the action of NO in living systems. Graduate and
postdoctoral researchers on the project are mentors to undergraduate research
opportunity participants at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These
scientists are trained to communicate their work; many subsequently assume key
positions in academic or industrial organizations and some are active in
outreach programs at local schools in the Cambridge and Boston communities.

Sensors for nitric oxide will facilitate the screening of chemical libraries for
inhibitors of the enzyme that produces NO in Gram-positive bacteria such as
anthrax and Staph. aureus, thus providing leads for novel antibiotics. The
chemistry of nitric oxide with iron-sulfur clusters will help guide efforts to
develop catalysts for environmental cleanup since nitrogen oxides are toxic
byproducts of fuel combustion processes.
