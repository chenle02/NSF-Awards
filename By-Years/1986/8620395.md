It is the purpose of this investigation to study the physics and chemistry of
very small atmospheric particles called Aitken particles. The study has three
parts: 1) to develop a climatology of aerosols, that is to determine how the
aerosol size distribution and number concentration varies with the origin of the
air mass being studied; 2) to attempt to confirm the essential features of a
model developed by the proposer called "The Cloud Erosion Model". This model
predicts very definite changes in the size distribution and number concentration
of aerosol as a function of the history of the airmass; 3) to study the possible
production of aerosols by photochemistry in the clean arctic air.
