This project will study and compare the membrane properties of somas and
synaptic terminals in embryonic chick Edinger Westphal neurons. These neurons
are unique among vertebrate preparations in that both cell bodies and terminals
can be studied directly using electrophysiological techniques. Comparison of
Edinger Westphal cell bodies and terminals may reveal patterns of differential
receptor and channel distribution that will increase our understanding of how
membrane properties subserve neuronal function. The first objective will be to
study the membrane properties of neurons in the Edinger Westphal nucleus using
intracellular impalements in a slice preparation. Both passive and active
membrane characteristics will be studied including voltage sensitive currents.
In addition, chemosensitivity to a variety of putative neurotransmitters will be
examined. The second objective will be to study the membrane properties of the
calyciform synaptic terminals formed by Edinger Westphal neurons on targets in
the ciliary ganglion. As in the slice preparation, intracellular impalements,
both current clamp and single electrode voltage clamp, will be used. Passive and
active membrane properties and chemosensitivity will be examined and compared
with the analogues properties of the parent cell bodies in the Edinger Westphal
nucleus.
