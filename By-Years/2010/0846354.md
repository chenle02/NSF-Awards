An award to the Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics at The Ohio State University
and the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) will fund the conversion of
animal sound recordings in the latter institution's collection to digital
format. These recordings are currently housed on analog magnetic tape, which has
a finite lifespan, and degrades in quality with each use. Conversion to digital
format will ensure the preservation of this important collection, and make it
much easier for FLMNH staff to serve clients in the future.

Collections of recorded animal sounds provide an important resource for
scientists interested in the behavior and evolution of animals, for members of
the public interested in natural history, and for various commercial
enterprises. The FLMNH collection of animal sounds is one of the three largest
in North America, and is very strong in birds from the New World tropics, a
center of avian biodiversity. In digital format, users will be able to search
the collection database and audition every recording in mp3 format. The
collection database will also be linked to ORNIS, an NSF-funded consortium of
ornithological collections. Finally, collections of bird sounds will be reissued
in mp3 and CD format for use by birders and by biologists conducting population
surveys.
