High magnification and resolution video equipment and associated measuring
accessories are to be acquired and utilized in an ongoing broadly based research
program on two phase flow in pipelines. The equipment will permit
characterization of emulsions, breaking and forming of coherent ligaments, and
other phenomena occurring in two phase flow of immiscible liquids, with
application to water lubricated pipelines transporting oil.
