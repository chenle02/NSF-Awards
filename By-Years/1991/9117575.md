This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of equipment for the
Paleomagnetism Laboratory of the University of California at Davis. Equipment
items include an alternating field gradient magnetometer, a Mossbauer
spectrometer, a Curie balance system, a magnetic susceptibility bridge, and
ancillary equipment. The laboratory supports the research of the PI, his
students, and on-campus as well as off-campus collaborators. The PI's research
program is concentrated in the behavior of the geomagnetic field throughout
geologic time, applications of paleomagnetic techniques to plate tectonics and
related geologic phenomena, the origin of rock and mineral magnetism, and
environmental magnetism.
