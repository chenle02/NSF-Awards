Griffin 9603940 Photosynthesis and respiration by plants are two biological
processes that transfer CO into and out of year, respectively), and
substantially greater than the annual net increment to the atmosphere from human
activities such as fossil fuel burrung and deforestation (approximately 3.2
billion metric tons per year, combined). The resulting changes in atmospheric
CO2 can feedback and change the rate at which plants exchange carbon with the
atmosphere. As such, the rate and/or extent of future changes in greenhouse gas
emissions are influenced by this feedback loop between plants and the
atmosphere. long-term effects on plant respiration, it is still fundamentally
unclear why it does. Accordingly the goal effects the rate of plant respiration,
thereby providing a more substantial capacity to predict how CO earth~s
atmosphere in the 21~ century.
