Summer Undergraduate Math Research at Yale (SUMRY) is a nine-week summer program
hosted by the Mathematics Department at Yale University with the primary goal of
engaging a diverse group of undergraduate students in original mathematics
research. We hope to build the diversity of the mathematics community by
providing opportunities for women and underrepresented students at this early
stage in their training. The ability to communicate mathematics is emphasized
and groups give weekly presentations, receiving constructive feedback from their
mentors and peers throughout the summer, culminating in talks at regional and
national undergraduate research conferences. We have a weekly colloquium
(learning) seminar where mentors and visiting researchers give accessible talks
on their own research. There are numerous professional development activities,
graduate school admission events and panels, and workshops on presenting and
writing mathematics. Students write final papers and results are submitted for
academic publication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yale is a vibrant international
center for research and students are fully immersed in the Yale research
community during their summer on campus. Each summer 24 undergraduate students
work on one of six projects, each project directed by a faculty mentor. The
mentors choose a problem from their own field of research, which include:
differential geometry, graph theory, homogeneous dynamics, metric number theory
and dynamics, groups and symmetry, combinatorics, hyperbolic manifolds, data
recovery, image processing, and topological data
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
