The investigator proposes to develop innovative numerical methods for
conservative phase field models of multi-phase and complex fluids. The new
methods will becapable of resolving accurately and efficiently the disparate
time and length scales involved in topological changes and complex interface
morphologies, in the dynamics of the micro-scale structures, and in the effect
of stochastic thermal fluctuations in phase transitions. Those capabilities will
be obtained with novel space and time adaptive methods that take into account
the mathematical structure and multi-scale nature of the models and their
solutions. The methods will be designed to be free of high order stability
constraints and will be of optimal computational cost. An effective, innovative
coupling of stochastic and deterministic formulations is also proposed.

Complex fluids found in a wide variety of industrial applications such as
emulsions, foams, and polymeric solutions are characterized by multiple
components, several coexisting phases, and structural heterogeneities spanning a
broad range of length scales. The macroscopic behavior and properties of these
fluid mixtures are a function of the intricate nonlinear coupling of the flow
with micro- or nano- structures. The understanding of the dynamics of these
systems is thus of significant scientific and technological interest. Computer
simulation can play an instrumental role toward aiding in achieving this goal.
The development of these numerical methods is the central objective of this
proposal. The proposed research will be conducted in a multi-disciplinary
environment and will also serve an important education goal: the
interdisciplinary education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.
An integral part of this project is also a sustained effort to promote and
broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and the use of innovative
pedagogic initiatives with ties with the industrial sector.
