Consider the problem of establishing a temporary network in a region hit by some
natural disaster. Such a network would, for example, allow medics in the field
to retrieve patient history from hospital databases, allow insurance companies
to file claims from the field, etc. Ideally, setting up such a network should
involve no more than equipping medics with PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants)
that have radio capability and providing one or more ``gateways'' that connect
this ad hoc network with the outside world. A fundamental problem in setting up
such a network is routing packets between nodes in the ad hoc network. Why is
this a difficult problem? The primary reason is that as nodes move about the
network topology changes and thus routes need to be constantly updated.
Furthermore, natural obstacles may have the effect of partitioning the network
for brief periods of time. Thus, packets enroute to a destination that no longer
lies in a partition may be dropped (even though the partition is short-lived).
Finally, an overreaching constraint on any solution is the problem of very
limited battery life at each mobile. Thus, while a specific protocol may route
packets optimally, it may cause an inordinate amount of power drain causing
mobiles to run out of power quickly. In this research, we will develop routing
protocols that are power-efficient (i.e., the battery life of mobiles is
maximized) while still providing near-optimal routing functionality. In
addition, these protocols will support Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees by
performing demand-based route discovery. Other protocol support for QoS, such as
loss profiles for dynamic adaptation to bandwidth changes, will also be
incorporated. Finally, the routing protocols will implement cache-and-forward
packet routing to deal with short-lived network partitions. Papers and other
