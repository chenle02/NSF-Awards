ARTIN, 97-00925 The most important results of the classical theory of algebraic
surfaces, which date back to the turn of the last century, characterize the
surfaces which contain families of lines: the rational and ruled surfaces.
Recently, some interesting "quantizations" or deformations of these surfaces
have been found. In these quantizations, the functions on a surface are replaced
by operators which do not commute. It is conjectured that the noncommutative
surfaces which are not finite over their centers are precisely the analogues of
the rational and ruled surfaces. The program of research is aimed at carrying
the clasqical theory over to the noncommutative case and proving these
conjectures. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry and
noncommutative algebra. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Noncommutative algebra,
which has roots in in matrix theory and in physics, combined with classical
algebraic geometry may have applications to modern physical theory.
