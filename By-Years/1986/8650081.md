This Leadership Activities Project will provide professional development for 120
outstanding junior and senior high school science teachers. The teachers will
learn concepts and laboratory methods associated with contemporary research at
the frontiers of biology, and they will prepare appropriate lesson plans and
laboratory activities for secondary school students. The biologists making the
presentations have been chosen on the basis of research skills and award-winning
teaching. A feature of the program will be a keynote address and visit with
Nobel Laureate Francis Crick, co-discoverer of DNA. The program staff also
includes science educators from the local school district and from higher
education. This project will address topics at the frontiers of nutrition,
marine biology, genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology, human
ecology, cancer biology, electron microscopy, cell biology, developmental
biology, and computer applications in biological research. The laboratory
program will stress methods and materials in modern cell biology. Products of
the project will include a book, video tapes, and laboratory activities that are
both relevant and appropriate for secondary school students. It is anticipated
that these products will be sponsored in part by local corporations or
organizations. Another anticipated project outcome will be the initiation of
courses or extracurricular activities in selected secondary schools that
stimulate and support students conducting independent research projects.
