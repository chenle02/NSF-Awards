Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of
circulating tryptophan to serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system. While tryptophan hydroxylase is known to be regulated through a
protein kinase- mediated phosphorylation, this key enzyme may also be regulated
at the level of gene expression. Synthesis of an oligonucleotide probe for rat
tryptophan hydroxylase mRNA based on the sequence of cloned, pineal cDNAs has
been achieved. This probe will detect gene sequences by hybridization and mRNA
levels by the sensitive technique of primer extension. Initial results
demonstrate the CNS form of tryptophan hydroxylase mRNA is altered at the 5'end
when compared with the cloned, pineal cDNAs. Pharmacological agents which alter
serotonin levels have an effect on steady-state TPH mRNA levels in the raphe
nuclei--a region of high concentration of serotonergic cells in the CNS. Rat
genomic clones containing the TPH gene will be used to determine the patterns of
expression that lead to tissue-specific mRNAs. These studies will provide
necessary information about TPH structures leading to the development of
regulatory studies.
