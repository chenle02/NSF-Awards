This project is investigating the control strategy for freeway corridors.
Factors, such as, lane changing, merging, diverging, weaving, ramp metering and
interactions with arterials are included in developing a dynamic two and three-
dimensional continuum model. Results will be useful in the area of
communications and control hardware for freeway control strategies.
