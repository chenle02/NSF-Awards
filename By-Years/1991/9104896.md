The Department of Mathematics at the State University of New York at Buffalo
will purchase a configuration of workstations which will be dedicated to support
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, in particular, studying links via closed braids; plastic
deformation of granular material; composed folding in dynamical systems -
analysis and numerical experiment and numerical studies of the Vlasov-Poisson
equation.
