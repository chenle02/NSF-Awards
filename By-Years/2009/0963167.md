This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Funds are provided to renovate the Multi-User Animal Research Facility (MARF) at
Hofstra University, a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. Renovation of the
MARF will create a state-of-the-art research facility supporting a rich research
and research training environment for organismal biology. Areas of the MARF will
be renovated that directly increase the number, scope and range of research
experiments that can be performed. The renovations will provide research rooms
that have precise climate control which to date has been impossible in the MARF.
The renovations will provide experimental rooms with precise temperature
control, improved lighting with reliable light:dark cycles, and appropriate
electrical supply to support modern scientific equipment. The modernized
facility will bring together in a single location an increased number of
research groups spanning multiple disciplines and educational levels. It will
increase research dialog and collaborations between Hofstra and other
institutions. The research programs of all individuals using the renovated MARF
will be greatly enhanced and projects that would otherwise be unfeasible will be
conducted. Experiments proposed in the renovated facility include studies of
physiological and functional performance in lizards, hydrodynamics of feeding in
fishes, and chemoreception in echinoderms. The facility will be a platform to
stimulate progressive thought and conduct new studies, such as those that focus
on the role of temperature in physiological and biomechanical phenomena. This
will stimulate interest in, and desire to conduct research in the modernized
MARF from a broader range of individuals particularly from underrepresented
groups. Increased dissemination of results will come from researchers and
students that use the renovated MARF and present their research at national and
international meetings.
