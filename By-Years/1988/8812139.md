The objective of this grant is to conduct a technological assessment of mobile
robots, and research in this field, in western Europe. In a broad context, this
assessment by a team of outstanding experts in the emerging field of intelligent
robotics, comes under the heading of international interaction. The activity may
be viewed as a combination of the aspects of international cooperation and
international competition. The grant is in response to the call for increased
awareness of work abroad as cited by the National Academy of Engineering in its
report entitled, "Strengthening U.S. Engineering through International
Cooperation -- Some Recommendations for Action."
