Title: DMTCP: Checkpoint-Restart on the Desktop PI: Gene Cooperman NSF Proposal
Number: 0960978

ABSTRACT:

This work builds upon the existing open source, user-space DMTCP package for
transparent, distributed checkpointing. Three goals will be accomplished: (i)
checkpoint-restart of long-running computations on the desktop; (ii) save-
restore of interactive software packages; and (iii) a universal reversible
debugger. The first two goals will allow software development teams to add to
their package a reliable "save workspace" feature --- with no requirement for a
kernel module or other privileged operations. The third goal is to enhance any
debugger with reversibility (e.g. a back-step command), and with a reverse
expression watchpoint command to move backwards from a software error to the
original software fault.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT: While checkpointing has existed for over 20 years, earlier
packages were difficult to maintain. The unprivileged, user-space design of
DMTCP has a five-year track record. It is ideal for integration into other
software, where any end-user requirement for installation of a kernel module or
other administrative privilege is incompatible with widespread distribution.
Finally, DMTCP is the first package able to directly checkpoint a gdb session
(the gdb process and its target process) -- a key feature for the envisioned new
type of reversible debugger.

BROADER IMPACT: Checkpointing and process migration have long been of interest
for science and engineering, but too often suffered from software fragility or
special requirements. The DMTCP approach removes these obstacles. Further, the
wider use of ``time-traveling (reversible) debuggers'' will greatly accelerate
software development due to the greater ease of finding bugs. A NIST report
estimates the cost of software bugs to the economy at $59.5 billion per year.
Finally, the excitement factor of checkpoint-restart on the desktop helps
attract and motivate students toward the learning of sometimes arcane systems
issues in this critical technology.
