This Small Business Innovation Research project proposes commercialization of
innovative oxide based visible and solar blind ultra-violet light detectors
successfully fabricated and tested. The studies clearly indicate the possibility
of growing good quality wide band gap tunable oxide thin films on low cost
substrates such as glass, quartz, silicon, and polyimide for photoconductive and
Schottky UV photodiodes. The detectors fabricated on these substrates show
comparable performance to those of AlGaN on sapphire, and SiC with a high
responsivity and UV to visible rejection ratio of more than three orders of
magnitude. The feasibility of tuning the detector performance at selective UV
regions is also successful which is achieved through innovation of the
composition control in the wide band gap oxide layer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
company will extend this technology to commercialize the low cost UV detectors
and large format detector arrays for UV radiation monitoring systems for
personal safety and consumable products, and exploit additional capabilities
beyond the scope of the existing Si, GaAs, and AlGaN technologies.
