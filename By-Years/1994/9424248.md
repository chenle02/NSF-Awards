9424248 COBURN This project will provide support for shipboard scientific
support equipment for the research vessels ATLANTIS II, KNORR and OCEANUS,
operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and dedicated to use in
support of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such
items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval
of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing similar activities.
This project will allow the institution to obtain a hydro block, emergency
breathing devices and exercise equipment for the OCEANUS, and a P-Code GPS
receiver and computer for the KNORR. ***
