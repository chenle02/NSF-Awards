The introductory physics laboratory is the first opportunity for most college
students to experience the basic elements of experimental science. It is
important that the experience be a positive and rewarding one. Although most of
our current experiments are interesting, and can teach important concepts,
students frequently get bogged down in lengthy sessions of data taking and
manipulation, activities which they correctly regard as "archaic" and "boring."
This project (part of a 3-year effort by the Physics department to improve the
teaching and equipment in introductory laboratories) seeks to introduce CCD
cameras and 486-based PC computers into the lab, starting with four experiments
from the fall semester. (1) Projectile Motion. Students get a strobed image of a
bouncing superball, showing that the trajectory is a parabola and that the x and
y motions are constant speed and constant acceleration, respectively. The CCD
camera and PC make the (otherwise laborious) data reduction fast and fun. (2)
Two Dimensional Collisions. Pucks collide on an air table and strobed pictures
are analyzed to investigate conservation of linear momentum. Currently, students
spend 1 to 2 hours getting a picture (Polaroid) and analyzing the data. A CCD/PC
system gets a picture in seconds and offers a number of optional studies to the
student -- elastic vs. inelastic, energy conservation, center of mass motion,
varying mass. (3) Kinetic Motion (a new experiment). A 2-dimensional "gas" of
pucks on an air table is excited by shaking walls. Students can measure the mean
free path or speed distribution. (4) An optional experiment measures the motions
of Jupiter's moons. The goal of this proposal is to begin to move the
introductory lab away from step-by-step procedures which lead to an encircled
number, toward a lab where students, using modern sensors and computers, can
have options to explore concepts and try their own ideas. The project is made
feasible by the low costs of highly capable CCD camera systems and 486-based
personal computers.
