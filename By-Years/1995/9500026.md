9500026 Manduca The Keck Geology Consortium, which consists of 12 predominantly
undergraduate colleges and universities, proposed to support 13 minority
students per year in their existing summer research activities. Two types of
projects will be offered: five- week summer projects for students who have
completed their sophomore year and year-long projects for students who have
completed their junior year. Students will be paired with faculty from their
home institutions to assure oversight and suppmrt during the academic year. Both
the supporting faculty and the minority students will participate in the annual
Keck Research Symposium in Geology. Past experience in this program indicates
that these students will continue successfully into post-baccalaureate education
and/or careers in geology.
