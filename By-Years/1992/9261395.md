This project concerns the development and evaluation of a portable on-line
x-ray diffraction system for in-situ monitoring of critical material properties
in thin film vapor deposition systems. An available x-ray type transducer, the
position sensitive scintillation detector, will be modified for use in sputter
reactor environments. Issues to be addressed include the thermal and physical
isolation of the device from the reactor environment, while retaining its
positioning flexibility. The feasibility of using the modified system for in-
situ x-ray diffraction monitoring of sputtered film growth will also be
evaluated. Successful in-situ monitoring of critical microstructural material
properties would greatly enhance process control in a wide variety of
manufacturing processes involving solid state crystalline materials processing.
Such a device would also be useful in on-line non-destructive inspection and
quality control.
