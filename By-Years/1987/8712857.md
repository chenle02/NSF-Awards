Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research projects on the
Juneau Icefield, Alaska. For 40 years, research in the earth sciences,
emphasizing geology, glaciology, geophysics, glaciometeorology, geobotany and
surveying, has been conducted on this icefield. With cooperation between the
University of Idaho's Glaciological and Arctic Environmental Sciences Institute
and the Foundation for Glacier and Environ- mental Research, this
research/educational activity aims at a total systems study of one of North
America's largest icefields. Under supervision of professors of unique
experience, drawn from the University of Idaho and other universities, each
undergraduate will select a research project and be encouraged to exercise as
much independent judgment and initiative as possible in its development.
Undergraduates selected will be earth science students who demonstrate scholarly
aptitude, motivation, and research potential. Because the research experience
will involve field work in rugged glacier terrain, physical stamina will be
necessary. The staff will be available throughout the season for advice and
help, including lectures, seminars and site specific instructions in
methodologies to insure an effective research experience.
