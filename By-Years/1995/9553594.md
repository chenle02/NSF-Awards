Rutherford 9553594 The publication of the National Science Education Standards
and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy demonstrates a strong national consensus
on specific learning goals in science. However, developing a curriculum to help
students and teachers become science literate requires a more diverse, but
focused, set of materials than exists. Preservice and inservice professional
development must prepare teachers to adequately evaluate and adapt curriculum
materials. Funders and policy makers involved with development and adoption of
materials must align their decision-making processes with science literacy
goals. A procedure is needed for evaluating the extent to which materials
address Standards or Benchmarks. This project is to refine an existing process
for evaluating materials, provide an evaluation mechanism with examples and case
studies, disseminate the process, and develop a cadre of developers, teachers
and teacher educators who understand it and can advocate for its use.
