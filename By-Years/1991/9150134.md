Under this contract, the National Science Teachers Association, through its
Special Projects Office, will carry out the program of Presidential Awards for
Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching as directed by the Program
Director for the program. In each state and in four other jurisdictions
(District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Department of Defense Dependents
Schools, and the territories of the Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana
Islands, and American Samoa), a nomination and selection process will be carried
out to identify six secondary and six elementary teachers, half of each group in
mathematics and half in science, who epitomize outstanding teaching in those
fields. These awardees will then be the nominees from which four teachers (two
elementary, two secondary, two science, two mathematics) from each state or
jurisdiction will be selected for the Presidential Awards for Excellence in
Science and Mathematics. These Presidential Awardees, each with spouse or guest,
will be brought to Washington for approximately one week of recognition
ceremonies and professional activities. This contract provides for all
arrangements for and expenses of the nomination, selection, and Washington
activities to be handled by the contractor.
