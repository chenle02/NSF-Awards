DARPA, NSF, NASA, and DoE all have requirements to connect their CONUS grantees
and contractors with a computer network to colleagues and facilities in the
United Kingdom. In the past, these needs have been met by each Agency
individually, through individual procurements of low-speed (9600 to 56,000
baud), typically satellite, circuits between networks at affected sites on
either side of the Atlantic. Substantial economies of scale exist in the
telecommunications industry. Through discussions leading to mutual agreements,
the agencies are able to meet all their needs for US-UK computer connectivity by
sharing a single fractional-T1 (512 kb/s) fiber-optic circuit. DARPA have agreed
to act as the agent for procuring the circuit; the purpose of this project is to
compensate DARPA for NSF's agreed-to share of the cost.
