Holography is one of the most difficult concepts to understand in a quantitative
manner, as it is intimately tied to the quantization of gravitational theories.
Recent advances in string theory have shown that it is a concept that can be
realized in dualities between gravitational theories and non-gravitational
theories. The PI proposes to study Strings in polarized plane wave (PP)
backgrounds. The PI proposes to examine the relationship of the correlation
functions of large R-charge operators in "momentum" space to objects in the
string theory (or supergravity) in the pp wave background. The PI also wishes to
investigate properties of giant gravitons and the implications for the stringy
exclusion principle. Finally the PI intends to investigate how noncommutative
gauge theories living on a brane couple to linearized supergravity backgrounds.
