Spoilage and pathogenic bacteria affect the quality and safety of fresh produce
such as strawberries and mushrooms. The surfaces of these products can be
naturally contaminated with molds such as Botrytis cinera and bacteria such as
E. coli O157:H7. For many years foods have been treated with antimicrobial
agents however, packaging materials may also provide the same benefits using
similar or different additives. A packaging system that allows for slow release
of an antimicrobial agent into the produce could significantly increase the
shelf life and improve the safety of fresh produce. The use of these packaging
systems is not meant to be used as a substitute for good quality control
standards. It can, however serve as an additional protective measure to help
ensure safe and high quality foods.
