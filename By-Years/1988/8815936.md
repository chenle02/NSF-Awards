This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mass transport through ion exchange polymer films. Different
microstructures of ion exchange polymers, which exhibit local short range order
(5 to 100 nanometers), will be induced through thermal processing as well as by
sorption in microstructured substrates such as polycarbonate membranes and latex
spheres. The microstructure of the polymer layer will be evaluated by infrared
and X-ray spectroscopies and its transport-selectivity determined by
electrochemical methods. Mathematical models will be developed for the
relationships between these properties. Mass transport through ion exchange
membranes and its enhancement through electrostatic effects is an important
field both scientifically and technologically, with implications for biological
systems. Development of generalized relationships describing their transport
characteristics will facilitate optimization of separators for specific
applications, design of catalysts with active sites situated in microstructured
matrices that control the transport of selected species, and fabrication of
modified electrodes for electrochemical catalysis and analysis.
