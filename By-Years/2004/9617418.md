Robert W. Field of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to further develop and exploit molecular
quantum defect theory (MQDT) in an ongoing effort to investigate scaling (with
n*, l and ml) in molecular electronic spectroscopy. Specifically, he will use
Stark switching spectroscopy to study core non-penetrating molecular Rydberg
states or two-color resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization to study the core-
penetrating Rydberg series of alkaline earth monohalides. Initially, he will
focus on relatively simple systems such as the alkaline earth monohalides, then
gravitate to more complex systems including larger polyatomic molecules. His
overall objective is to exploit, uncover, and test unconventional models which
might eventually describe the electronic structure and dynamics of entire
families of molecules: all properties, all states, all dynamical processes. A
few comments about the practical significance of these experiments are
warranted. Why should we care about the electric multipole moments of cations?
All +1 cations have the same monopole, so this dominant aspect of the
interaction of the cation with the outside world is independent of the molecule.
Ion-specific long-range interactions, on the other hand, derive from the higher
multipoles (and their normal coordinate displacement derivatives). These
multipoles and derivatives control the mechanisms and rates of resonant long-
range ion-molecule, ion-electron, and possibly ion-surface energy and angular
momentum exchange. The information obtainable from systematic studies of core-
nonpenetrating Rydberg states would yield valuable insights into a wide variety
of processes occurring in plasmas.
