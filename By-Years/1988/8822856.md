In 1986, the new AISC Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specification
was introduced which makes the limit state design of steel buildings as an
alternate to the traditional Allowable Stress Design. LRFD represents a major
advancement in steel design technology that is based on safety reliability
concepts and an explicit consideration of factored loads and limit states.
However, the Specification is primarily intended for designs governed by gravity
or wind loads. Thus, in regions of high and moderate seismicity, supplemental
special detailing requirements are necessary to provide adequate structural
ductility and energy absorption commensurate with the degree of earthquake risk.
The currently available seismic detailing provisions are in allowable stress
terms and, therefore, are not directly compatible with LRFD. The development of
a set of seismic design provisions, for the first time in LRFD format, has
recently been completed by an expert AISC Subcommittee. Only the preparation of
an appropriate Commentary remains before this needed document can be published
and broadly distributed for LRFD design applications. This project will support
a concerted effort over the next 3-6 months on the Commentary to finish this
document and satisfy the urgent needs of engineers and building code officials.
This will help maintain proper design practice and safety levels as LRFD is used
for seismic conditions. The tasks will include review and listing of related
research references, thorough explanation of background material and practical
implications of criteria, and discussion/artwork of additional general
suggestions not covered directly by the provisions.
