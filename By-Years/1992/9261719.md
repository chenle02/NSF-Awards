Today, everything from computers, consumer electronics, to military equipment
is driven by micro-chips, the first link in the chain of technology for the
microelectronic industry. In order to extend the flexibility and capacity of
device and system design, microelectronic packaging is becoming as important as
silicon fabrication. Among existing encapsulation methods, plastic packaging,
which accounts for eighty percent of the market share, will continue to play a
major role in the growth of the microelectronic industry. The performance
reliability of plastic packaging, greatly depends on the performance of the
encapsulants and manufacturing methods. Traditionally, design and manufacturing
for microelectronic encapsulation with plastic packaging are conducted in an ad
hoc manner based on experience and intuition, which is costly and time
consuming. The study is aimed at establishing the scientific basis and attaining
an engineering solution for characterizing the process. It will employ
experimental, analytical and computational efforts to develop an efficient,
reliable analysis tool. The results of the research will improve understanding
of the process and facilitate simultaneous engineering by means of computer
simulation.
