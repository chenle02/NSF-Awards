This proposal requests salary subvention for three academic staff members
involved in the critical step of editing manuscripts and certain other final
costs of preparing The Jepson Manual: Vascular Plants of California. The Jepson
Manual is a comprehensive, authoritative, concise, accessible, and up-to-date
treatment of the botanically richest region in the United States (ca. 7,800
infrageneric taxa, or at least a quarter of the higher plant taxa of North
America outside Mexico). It has been in preparation for eight years and now
involves 180 contributing authors and a staff of seven; it will be published by
the end of 1992. The Jepson Manual Project is of national significance because
of its role in stimulating systematic research, its close relationship to the
Flora of North America Project, the richness and complex relationships of
Californian plant taxa (many of which are endemic or endangered), and its
development and use of several new kinds of information. The single, reasonable
priced volume is designed as a bridge between the developers and dispensers of
systematic information (systematic botanists) and the highly diverse, potential
users of that information.
