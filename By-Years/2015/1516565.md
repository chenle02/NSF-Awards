This research project is concerned with the mathematical modeling and analysis
of certain types of behaviors in superconductivity and nonlinear optics. Many
problems arising in physics can be modeled by nonlinear partial differential
equations, and some of these differential equations generate solutions with
interesting structures, such as pulse-like solutions that model light traveling
through fiber optics or vortex solutions that arise in fluids and condensed
matter physics. This research aims to understand some of these structures. In
the first case, the behavior of large numbers of vortices in superconducting
materials (a typical feature of certain classes of superconductors) will be
studied. In the second case, how vortices are generated in superconductors will
be examined. The third project will consider numerical algorithms that are used
to compute pulse-like solutions that arise in nonlinear
optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will focus on three problems arising
in applied mathematics. The first project will study the mean-field behavior of
asymptotically large numbers of vortices arising in superconductivity. The
analysis requires handling asymptotically large numbers of vortices, each of
which has asymptotically large energy. To do so, refined estimates will be
developed for tracking concentrations of energy. The project on the
understanding of vortex nucleation in the time-dependent setting should help to
understand the transition to the mixed-vortex state in Type-II superconductors.
Finally, the project on iterative methods for computing bound states will study
why certain methods are unconditionally convergent, which should lead to better
algorithm design.
