Modern data centers are becoming the next computing platform for the Internet.
These massive farms of computer servers are an indispensable component of the
information age, enabling applications like web search, social networks, cloud
computing, as well as distributed file and video sharing. The problem of storing
and processing massive amounts of information over networks is significant and
challenging.&lt;br/&gt;Still, most existing distributed storage systems
represent information by suboptimal replication schemes combined with ad-hoc
networking protocols. This research is focused on understanding, on a
fundamental level, how to represent, store, and process information in
distributed storage systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research
involves the design of novel distributed storage codes that use network coding
theory to address modern storage challenges. As is well known, general multi-
source information theory problems can be notoriously intractable. This research
focuses on the framework of storage networks and builds on recent results of the
PI to investigate: 1) Dynamics of coded storage systems. How to maintain coded
information representations over networks. Prior work has demonstrated the key
role of network coding for such problems but the fundamental bounds remain
unknown for several cases of interest. 2) Interference Alignment for Network
Coding. Interference alignment techniques were introduced to mitigate wireless
interference at the physical layer but also have surprising applicability in
distributed storage and other network coding problems. This research is
developing a novel mathematical framework that interprets interference alignment
techniques through optimization theory. This project is strongly coupled with
educational developments and outreach through an online wiki bibliography and
online tutorial presentations.
