This research address the general problem of resource finding in distributed
systems. The premise is that existing solutions to this problem cannot be used,
without a substantial performance penalty, in systems where the location
information needs to be updated rapidly or when the system contains a large
number of nodes. The use of multicast communication to reduce the cost of
resource finding is investigated. In broadcast networks, the algorithms to be
explored will make use of the hardware support provided for multicast in many
network interfaces. In point-to-point networks, the task is to formalize the
notion of a search algorithm and to study the problem of finding search
algorithms that minimize the average bandwidth or time when a probability
distribution is defined for the location of a resource. The problem of
implementing multicast communication in point-to-point networks is studied. Many
of the algorithms for finding remote objects will be implemented in the Clouds
distributed operating system.
