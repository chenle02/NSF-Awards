This award supports a conference entitled: The 1993 John H. Barrett Memorial
Lectures -- Infinite Dimensional Stochastic Differential Equations. The
conference will be held March 25-28, 1993, on the campus of the University of
Tennessee. The theme for these lectures will be infinite dimensional stochastic
differential equations. Each invited speaker will present a series of three
expository lectures surveying a topic which lies within the realm of the chosen
theme. The main objective of the conference is to provide the participants the
opportunity to gain a rapid and concise introduction to the rapidly developing
fields of infinite dimensional SDE's and the related measure valued processes.
