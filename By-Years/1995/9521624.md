The National Center for Supercomputing Applications is requesting $32, 423 in
supplemental funding to the cooperative agreement to support a two-day workshop
on Advanced Computing for Biological Imaging. The workshop will be held April
28-29, 1995 in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the
University of Illinois. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for
discussion about integrating imaging modalities used in biological research with
advanced computing systems. The goal of the workshop is to bring together
researchers and developers for an exchange of applications, techniques and
technologies. The proceedings of the workshop will be published as a special
issue of the Biological Bulletin. The printed proceedings will be supplemental
with Internet access to a WWW server containing images and animation. ***
