Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses
absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. The acquisition of
an FTIR spectrophotometer is crucial for enhancing the research and teaching
environment of the modern chemistry department. In the Chemistry Department of
the University of South Dakota, the instrument will serve as the focal point for
three projects and three additional projects will make use of the
spectrophotometer. The main projects include: 1) Spectroscopic examination of
structure-function relationships at solid electrodes used in electroanalytical
chemistry 2) Infrared determination of kinetic acidity through measurement of
hydrogen-deuterium exchange 3) Infrared examination of chemical species
incorporated into alkali halide crystals Auxiliary projects that will make use
of the instrument are: 1) Synthesis of boron hydride derivatives 2) Study of
photochemical reactions of unsaturated acids and esters 3) Kinetic studies of
gaseous reactions of SOx The FTIR spectophotometer will represent a significant
addition to the research instrumentation available to faculty and students at
this RUI institution.
