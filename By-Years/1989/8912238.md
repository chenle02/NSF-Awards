The technique of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy allows chemists to
conduct extremely precise high resolution studies on materials containing
unpaired electrons (paramagnetic compounds). Such studies reveal information on
molecular structure that is unavailable by any other technique. This award from
the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at
Rutgers University, New Brunswick to acquire an ESR spectrometer. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) Structure and dynamics of free radicals and radical ions generated
by laser flash photolysis 2) Structure and of ground state and phosphorescent
triplets 3) Magnetic interactions in copper and manganese containing proteins 4)
Mechanism of the substitution radical nucleophile reaction 5) Free radicals
generated on the surface of porous solids 6) Magnetic properties of ceramic
conductors.
