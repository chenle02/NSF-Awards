This award will provide support for research in geometry at the University of
Oklahoma. It is aimed primarily at introducing graduate students to research in
geometry through research in finitely starlike sets. The goal of the research is
to obtain Krasnosel'skii numbers for finitely starlike sets, both in the plane
and in higher dimensions. There are two basic problems to be considered, each
motivated by existing results for starshaped sets. The first concerns the
development of Krasnosel'skii - type (Helly - type) theorems which determine
whether a set S is finitely starlike, while the second concerns the development
of theorems which reveal the measures of the F - stars in S for F any finite
subset of S. This is a very basic area of geometric research. It is expected
that graduate students working in this area will be prepared for work in many
other areas of research as well, building on the fine program in geometry
already in place at Oklahoma.
