The first part of this project focuses on infinite systems of stochastic
equations. Such systems provide natural models in their own right, but results
in this part of the project will also provide essential tools for the study of
the stochastic partial differential equations to be considered in the second
part. The second part of the project will develop methods for representing
solutions of stochastic partial differential equation in terms of infinite
systems of "particles." These particle representations provide powerful tools
for analyzing and approximating the associated models. In some cases, the
particle representations arise naturally from the phenomenological
interpretation of the stochastic partial differential equation. In others, they
simply provide a mathematical tool for its analysis. The particle systems are
typically specified as solutions of infinite systems of stochastic differential
equations, and uniqueness results to be developed in the first part of the
project will play a critical role in obtaining the desired representations. The
third part of the project continues work on models of intracellular reaction
networks. One goal will be to provide algorithms that simplify the application
of earlier work on model reduction. A second will be to extend the earlier
results to models that take into account the spatial structure of the cell.

The study of stochastic processes is concerned with mathematical descriptions
of natural phenomena governed by "random" or "chance" mechanisms. Mathematical
models of such phenomena may attempt to describe variation in time, in space, or
both. The research to be performed is concerned with developing methods for
specifying these mathematical models, approximating complex models by simpler
ones, and constructing models addressing specific scientific applications. One
fundamental approach to specifying models of stochastic phenomena is to
formulate equations with stochastic inputs whose solution is the desired model.
Different stochastic equations may determine the same model, and different
equations may provide different insight into the model and the phenomenon the
model addresses. The project is concerned with how to develop and exploit
multiple representations for classes of models that arise naturally in physical,
biological and financial systems.
