This project explores structures that lie at the intersection of combinatorics,
representation theory, statistical physics, and integrable systems, with
potential significant impact on several fields, including applications to
shallow water waves, translation in protein synthesis, and scattering amplitudes
in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The central structures in the mathematics
of the project are Grassmannians, which parameterize subspaces of vector spaces
and are ubiquitous in mathematics, appearing variously as projective spaces in
projective geometry, compact smooth manifolds in differential geometry, and as a
scheme in algebraic geometry. Grassmannians play an important role for spatial
recognition in computer vision, in coding and communication theory, in studying
shallow water waves in physics, and in the computation of scattering amplitudes
of subatomic particles. This project explores features of remarkably rich
subsets of real Grassmannians called totally positive and totally non-negative
Grassmannians. These structures constitute refinements and extensions of the
classical theory of positive definite and positive semi-definite matrices and
representation theoretic work in the context of Lie Theory, and their structure
will be studied from topological, representation theoretic, and combinatorial
points of view. This project also seeks to increase the visibility of women
mathematicians via a series of lectures at the University of California,
Berkeley given by distinguished women.

More concretely, this project concerns several interrelated questions
surrounding the positive Grassmannian, Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials, and
the asymmetric exclusion process. In particular, the research will investigate:
a new polytopal manifestation of mirror symmetry for flag varieties; the
topology of the positive Grassmannian; the structure of soliton solutions to the
Kadomtsev?Petviashvili equation coming from the Grassmannian; the combinatorics
of the amplituhedron, a new generalization of the positive Grassmannian; and
combinatorial formulas for Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials and asymmetric
simple exclusion process probabilities using rhombic tableaux.
