This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to further
develop ATX-Red, an in vivo imaging agent that becomes fluorescent in the
presence of the enzyme autotaxin. Autotaxin and its product LPA are involved in
numerous biological functions that generally involve cell movement, and their
dysregulation is associated with many diseases including cancer, fibroses,
cardiovascular disease, and others. In Phase I ATX-Red generated highly
informative images in living organisms, essentially ?lighting up? tumors. In
Phase II ATX-Red metabolic stability will be improved and increased performance
will be demonstrated. Then ATX-Red will be used to monitor progression and
treatment of breast cancer and pulmonary fibrosis in
mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are improvements
to basic research, drug discovery, clinical diagnosis and disease treatment,
with the ultimate result being an improvement to human health. ATXRed will be an
indispensible tool to the many basic research fields associated with autotaxin
and LPA, where questions regarding autotaxin in vivo were essentially
unanswerable prior to the development of this tool. In addition to its usage in
the research arena, ATX-Red will aid development of therapeutics. Currently
significant efforts are underway to develop drugs targeting autotaxin pathways.
ATX-Red will likely be employed in the extensive in vivo experimentation needed
to develop these compounds. Human patients also stands to benefit from this
research, since ATX-Red could act as a companion diagnostic for pharmaceuticals
targeting diseases associated with autotaxin dysregulation. Further clinical
applications might include diagnosing disease and even directing surgical
resection of tumors.
