Dr. Patrick J. Walsh has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Walsh's doctoral degree was from the University of California
(Berkeley) under the supervision of Professor Robert G. Bergman. Dr. Walsh
intends to continue research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under
the sponsorship of Professor K. Barry Sharpless. Dr. Walsh's area of
postdoctoral research and training will be the application of transition metal
catalysis to synthetic organic chemistry. His long-term research interests are
concerned with the asymmetric aziridination of olefins by transition metals. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
