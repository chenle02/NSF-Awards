The objective of this research program is to investigate certain aspects of
earthquake strong ground motions that are relevant to engineering research on
earthquake hazard reduction. The focus is on the prediction of strong ground
motions using geological and geophysical information on the earthquake source,
the propagation path, and the local site effects at the location where the
motions are recorded. The research addresses two topics: The first is to predict
the strong ground motions that would occur as a result of the rupture of the
Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault. The second addresses a key issue in
strong ground motion prediction; namely the development of effective methods to
determine the parameters in proposed earthquake source models. Measured and
estimated earthquake-induced strong ground motions are the starting point for
engineering research into earthquake hazard mitigation. Some sort of estimate
has to be made of the expected ground shaking at a particular site: this
research is addressing very promising approaches to improvements on these
estimates. Thus this research is expected to make a fundamental contribution to
improving the accuracy and effectiveness of earthquake hazard mitigation.
