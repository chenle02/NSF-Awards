The Ohio State University will initiate an eight-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in mathematics for 65 students entering the 9th through 12th
grades. This summer program will provide a vivid apprenticeship to a life of
exploration for mathematically talented students. Students are exposed to higher
mathematics: definition, theorem, and proof in the spirit of "discovery" through
the power of intensive involvement. Daily problem sets are directed by lectures,
seminar, and student counselors giving the students countless hours of tutorial
time. Visits by mathematicians and scientists working "in the field" and a
program library help outline existing career choices and the academic
backgrounds necessary to make intelligent choices.
