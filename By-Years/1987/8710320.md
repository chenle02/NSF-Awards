This research is an Engineering Initiation Award that aims at the design,
construction, and testing of a first- generation smart tactile sensor. The
current limitations on these sensors are more in the area of signal processing
than transducer production technology. Analog signal processing offers
advantages in speed, simplicity, and accuracy when compared to digital signal
processing. This research focuses on the development of analog signal processing
circuitry for smart tactile sensors. The first generation smart tactile sensors
proposed will have continuous-time outputs of the total force applied to the
array and the location and extent of the contact area.
