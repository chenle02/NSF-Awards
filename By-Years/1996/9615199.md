ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : DEB-9615199 INVESTIGATOR(S) : FERNANDEZ, RUSTAD, KAHL,
NORTON INSTITUTION: UNIVERSITY OF MAINE The aims of this research are to
continue treatment and monitoring of a paired watershed experiment at Bear Brook
in northern Maine, with an emphasis on changes in soil base cations,
particularly calcium. Base cation depletion is well-recognised as a potential
problem in soils that have been subjected to acidic N deposition but few data
exist from well-controlled, long-term experiments. The Bear Brook watershed has
been periodically treated with ammonium sulfate since the fall of 1989 and is
believed to be approaching N saturation. Since 1993 the relationship between
base cations and strong acid anions has changed, such that labile Ca and Mg may
be depleted in the soils as Al losses increase. Continued monitoring will allow
tests of a series of hypotheses about controls and mechanisms of cation
retention and leaching in temperate forest soils.
