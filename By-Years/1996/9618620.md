Project Abstract Bargaining between two parties (a union and a firm, a buyer and
a seller, or two governments, for example) is one of the most common economic
occurrences, but economists are far from having a definitive understanding of
how it works. This project involves two innovations in the way bargaining can be
studied. The first is a model of bargaining that is more flexible than those
analyzed in the past: it allows for a bargainer to engage in subtle `reputation-
building` behavior, trying to convince her opponent that she is unlikely to make
a concession in the near future. Technically, the `endogenous perturbations`
that are introduced result in substantial predictions that have a plausible
flavor: Bargaining typically involves long periods of inactivity, followed by
concessions of noticeable size that are often greeted by a degree of reciprocal
compromise. The second innovation recognizes that one difficulty in reaching
agreement is that bargainers may genuinely differ in their perspectives on what
a natural or fair agreement would be. While the first party understands this,
she has no way of knowing what the second party's actual perspective is. This
unfortunately gives the second party an incentive to convey the impression
(through words and actions) of having a relatively severe, or self-serving,
perspective. The losses sustained by the bargainers in reaching an agreement
sometimes lead them to cling to an agreement even when it is no longer very
suitable (external circumstances having changed), for fear of the consequences
of rocking the boat. This could form the basis of a theory of inertia in dynamic
models. `Sticky prices` are of major importance for the central questions of
macroeconomics; price inertia in oligopolistic markets is a leading application
of the `perspective in bargaining` model to be studied.
