The feasibility of using electrokinetics to remove organic contaminants from
soil and groundwater will be investigated. A better understanding of the
fundamental aspects of electrokinetic soil processing is indispensable to state
and federal environmental programs and to the private waste management industry.
Improvement of electrokinetics soil processing could result in a significant
impact on waste remediation technology in the nation.
