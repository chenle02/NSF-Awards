Muskingum Area Technical College (MATC) and Ohio University- Zanesville (OUZ)
will initiate a four-week, commuter Young Scholars project in Environmental
Science for 20 students entering grades 9 and 10. The project will focus on life
sciences, engineering and technology, earth science, computer science, and math
as they relate to environmental studies. Ecology provides the focus for this
interdisciplinary hands-on experience. Students will travel to state parks, a
wildlife preserve, a fish hatchery, and EPA lab, a water treatment plant, MATC's
Natural Resources Center, and a variety of fully-equipped labs at the sponsoring
institutions.
