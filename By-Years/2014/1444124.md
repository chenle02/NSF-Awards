The ubiquitous phenomenon of massive data (including data streams) imposes
considerable challenges in data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
About 15 years ago, terabyte datasets were still considered `ridiculous.'
However, modern datasets managed by Stanford Linear Acceleration Center (SLAC),
NASA, NSA, etc. have reached the perabyte scale or larger. Corporations such as
Amazon, Wal-Mart, Ebay, and search engine firms are also major generators and
users of massive data. The general theme of data reduction and summarization has
become an active and highly inter-disciplinary area of research. This project
proposes to develop various approximation techniques, which generate a
"fingerprint" or "sketch" of the massive data by transforming the original data.
These `sketches' are reasonably small (hence easy to store) and can provide
approximate answers which are usually good enough for practical purposes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns the fundamental problems of
processing/transforming massive (possibly dynamic) data. In particular, it
focuses on (A) developing systematic fundamental tools for effective data
reduction and efficient data summarization; (B) applying these tools to improve
numerical analysis, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. Two lines of
theoretically sound techniques for data reduction and summarization will be
developed and further improved: (1) the method of stable random projections
(SRP), effective in heavy-tailed data; (2) the method of Conditional Random
Sampling (CRS), mainly for sparse data. Concrete applications of SRP and CRS
will be investigated. Widely-used basic numerical algorithms can be rewritten by
taking advantage of SRP or CRS. Popular methods/tools for exploratory data
analysis will also benefit considerably from the development of data reduction
techniques.
