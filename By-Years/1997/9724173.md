9724173 Rea This award provides support for Professor David Rea, of the
Department of Geological Sciences of the University of Michigan and several of
his colleagues to travel to Lanzhou, China to assess the feasibility of
collaborative research on the Miocene to Recent rocks and sediments deposited to
the north and east of the Tibetan Plateau. The area concerned appears to contain
a unique record of the detailed behavior of the Earth's magnetic field; of the
geologic and climatologic consequences of the Tibetan uplift, and of mammalian
evolution during this time of significant global change. The U.S. team has been
invited to China by Professor Li Jijun, Dean of the Resources and Environment
School of Lanzhou University. P: eap/REA Abstract.doc
