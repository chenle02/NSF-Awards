This award provides 60% of the costs of upgrading a thermal ionization mass
spectrometer operated and maintained in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
at the University of Wyoming. The University is committed to providing the
remaining 40% of the funds required to complete the project. The upgrade
consists of taking a single collector machine and converting it to a six
collector configuration which is now required by the laboratory's need for
isotopic analyses of large numbers of small individual samples.
