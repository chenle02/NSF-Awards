In order for ionospheric tomography to reach its potential as a three-
dimensional global imaging system, its resolving capability must be increased so
that small scale effects and temporal effects can be measured accurately. This
proposal is for the development of two key components necessary for achieving
such high resolution imaging. This research will develop (1) a thorough
resolution analysis system and (2) compensation techniques for unavoidable
physical constraints. This project will provide a better understanding of both
the ionospheric imaging system and the field of ionospheric tomography.
