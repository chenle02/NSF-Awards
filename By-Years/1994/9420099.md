This project is working to make rapid prototyping and reverse engineering
facilities available over wide-area computer networks. It includes several
research thrusts along with an integration effort to ensure that the facilities
will be usable remotely with little on-site intervention. The project has four
major thrusts: (1) development of algorithms for checking consistency of
geometric descriptions; (2) development of new languages based on constructive
solid geometry for communicating geometric descriptions; (3) connection of rapid
prototyping equipment to a wide rear network, with device drivers and server
software to allow remote access; (4) connection of a 3D scanner to the network
for remote access.
