This dissertation enhancement grant supports a U.S. graduate student enrolled
at the University of Florida, Mr. Peter VonDoepp, working under the guidance of
Dr. Goran Hyden, Professor of Political Science, to do field research in Malawi.
The project will study the potential of churches to serve as elements of a
democratizing civil society, employing as case studies, Malawi's Catholic Church
and the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian. It will assess the churches as
agents of political transformation, and as influences on habits and practices at
the grass roots. The study will be conducted with the cooperation and assistance
of the Department of Religious Studies at Chancellor College, the University of
Malawi. At a time when democracy in many developing countries is under challenge
from ethnic conflict and religious pluralism, this study by a promising young
researcher can potentially yield important insights on the relationship between
religion and political behavior. Malawi is one of the less-studied polities in
Africa. This collaboration with the foreign institution provides a basis for
future cooperation throughout the researcher's career.
