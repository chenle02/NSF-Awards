Parkland College's "Young Scholars Computation in the Sciences" program will
have 30 bright, highly motivated students in an intensive three week exposure to
up-to-the-minute scientific computer applications. During the first week,
presentations will be made by scientists at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), faculty from the University of Illinois and
Parkland College, and local business persons whose companies are built around
computer applications. The students will (1) learn about how the Center has been
helping may scientific fields with Cray Supercomputers, (2) learn about
expanding fields such as computer simulations and visualizations, artificial
intelligence and algorithm development, (3) learn how mathematicians,
physicists, astronomers, astrophysicists, chemists and engineers are using
scientific workstations such as those from Sun and Apollo, (4) see
demonstrations and have hands-on experience with a variety of computers. During
the last two weeks, the Program will provide student assistantships. Each
student will be matched with a faculty preceptor whose expertise is a field of
interest to the student. The pair will devise a project utilizing computational
resources at Parkland College and complete it in the two week period.
