This project will improve the knowledge and teaching background of teachers. The
program will provide 90 hours of instruction in environmental science and
ecology. Five environmental concepts will be explored during the 24-day period.
Each week's instruction will include guest lectures, hands-on workshops, field
trips, and interviews with community leaders. The course will meet daily
throughout the month of July. Participants will be required to submit a group
project as part of the Summer Program. The results of the activity will be
presented to all participants of the program. Participants will be K-12 teachers
from the St. Louis metropolitan area. A minimum of three years teaching
experience is required. Participants must have approval from their supervisory
or principal to attend and release time for a post-institute day.
