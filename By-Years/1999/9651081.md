The primary goal of this project is to transform the traditional manual
cartography lab into a modern computer cartography lab. In the process,
secondary goals of providing Internet access to a wide range of Geography and
Environmental Studies students as well as updating the existing facilities used
for teaching GIS have been set. These goals are being achieved by establishing a
14-seat LAN computing lab. A variety of software packages are being installed
that will give cartography students exposure to the full range of applications
currently associated with the field of cartography. In addition, each
workstation in the lab can be assigned its own IP address and connected, through
the universities larger network, to the Internet. The primary audience being
affected by this project is upper-division geography and environmental studies
majors. The impact of this project can be evaluated based on student testing and
employer interviews.
