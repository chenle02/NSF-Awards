The theory of complexity aims to understand which computational tasks can be
solved efficiently, and which cannot. This theory is essential for the
development of most computer systems, which need to process large amounts of
data within limited time or memory. It is also the basis for most modern
cryptography and electronic commerce. A fundamental objective of the theory of
complexity is to prove "lower bounds" for important computational tasks, that
is, to show that these tasks cannot be solved efficiently. The goal of this
research is to develop new approaches to lower bounds, and to use them to make
progress on long-standing open problems. The project is broad: it spans several
sub-areas of complexity, and will foster cross-fertilization between mathematics
and computer science. Its education plan includes the development of new courses
with accompanying publicly-available material, including lecture notes and
videos, as well as training of graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project focuses on four,
mutually-enriching lines of investigation. The first builds on a connection,
recently established by the investigator, between a set of conjectures in
Fourier analysis and lower bounds for computing functions via polynomials. One
goal here is to prove new lower bounds using this connection, or refute the
conjectures. The second line is about lower bounds for sampling tasks, data
structures, and circuits, which are also linked via connections established by
the investigator. The third is about lower bounds for computing functions via
low-rank matrices. Finally, the fourth is about lower bounds for computing group
products via low-communication protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
