The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry (CHE)
and the Metals Program of the Division of Material Research (DMR) will support
the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award of Prof. Petra Reinke of
the University of Virginia. Prof. Reinke and her students aim to form for the
first time magnetic nanostructures on silicon surfaces. Theoretical predictions
indicate that the shape, position and bonding of the Mn-nanostructures on the
Si-surface determine the magnetic properties of the assembly. Prof. Reinke will
observe the assembly of the Mn-nanostructure with atomic scale resolution in a
scanning tunneling microscope, use this data to tailor the Mn-Si structure,
characterize the magnetic properties of these structures and evaluate their
suitability for incorporation into spintronics devices. The study aims to
unravel the connection between the atomic scale structure and bonding and the
resultant magnetic properties of a Mn-nanostructure. It may strongly impact the
field of spintronics device development.
