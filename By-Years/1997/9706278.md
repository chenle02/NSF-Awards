This project involves a cultural anthropologist and a psychologist from Harvard
University studying the adaptation of recent (within 6 months) immigrant
students 10-14 years old (Koreans and Vietnamese from Asia, Dominicans and
Haitians from the Caribbean, and Mexicans and Salvadorans from Latin America) to
secondary school in the Boston area. The project will get massive amounts of
data over five years to observe how students (75 in each ethnic category) adjust
to their new country, and to explain the troubling fact that among nearly all
immigrant groups today school achievement declines with increasing length of
residence in the US. Four student research assistants will interview students in
depth and get a variety of measures of their psychological and social
adjustment. Methods include participant observation, focus groups, formal
psychosocial measurements and perusal of academic records. The specific research
questions will focus on the family system, the cultural models of schooling, the
relation of social, cultural and economic capital to schooling success,
neighborhood factors, time allocation, peer networks, and gender. This research
is important because the declining school performance of most immigrant groups
associated with increased length of residence in the US is greatly troubling to
this society. This longitudinal study will provide a significant comparative
case study to give insights into causal factors affecting this phenomenon, which
will be available to be used by school administrators and policy makers to
improve the situation.
