This award is to research and develop flexible forming of sheet metal with the
aid of a programmable die, in conjunction with closed loop control of the
forming process. In concept this implies a sheet metal forming process driven
only by the geometric data, as defined by a Computer Aided Design (CAD) system,
that can also adapt to part shape changes and material and forming condition
uncertainties. This work will focus on two major issues. They are (1)
fundamental exploration of discrete tool forming mechanics and a concomitant
machine design to identify and achieve maximum forming fidelity, process
accuracy and speed, and (2) refinement of the deformation transfer function
concept for general three-dimensional complex sheet metal parts using numerical
simulation and experiments. The final outcome of this research is the
elimination of long set-up and tooling developing times currently associated
with the sheet metal forming process. This will not only reduce time and costs
associated with this process but also allow the economical processing of small
lot production of complex sheet metal parts. The sheet metal forming process is
a major component in the manufacturing of many durable goods and the results of
this research will enhance the efficiency of that sector of industry.
