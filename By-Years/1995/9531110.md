This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research and education on polyoxometalates by Dr. Richard G. Finke of
the Chemistry Department, Colorado State University. New classes of
polyoxometalates will be synthesized, characterized, and tested as oxidation
catalysts. Detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies will be included. Methods
will be developed to use the polyoxometalates to support organometallic
derivatives for catalytic use. Also, a novel method for using molecular oxygen
and aldehyde as co-catalysts for oxidation of important olefins such as
propylene and ethylene will be explored. Polyoxometalate anions are complex,
negatively-charged groups which contain a number of metal atoms, such as
tungsten and titantium; oxygen atoms; and phosphorus. In this research, new
classes of these anions will be synthesized and developed as oxidation
catalysts. The robustness and inertness of these species make them advantageous
for this application, and an approach which uses molecular oxygen as an oxidant
is environmentally benign.
