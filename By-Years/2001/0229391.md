EAR-0229391&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Seismologists have long known that
friction is one of the fundamental processes operating during earthquake rupture
and slip, the actual physical mechanism behind the frictional behavior we
believe we see in earthquakes remains elusive. There are strong physical
arguments that at the high slip rates seen in earthquakes, frictional heating of
pore fluids could dynamically reduce the frictional stress, greatly increasing
the stress drop. Under even more extreme conditions, frictional melting of the
fault zone may further affect the frictional environment. We propose to
investigate these processes by coupling a 1-D hydrothermal/poroelastic model for
heat flow and fluid behavior with a 3-D dynamic faulting model for rupture and
slip behavior. Using this combined method, we will be able to investigate the
effects of thermal fluid pressurization and rock melting on fault stress, and
determine the resulting effects on fault motion and radiated seismic waves.
Behaviors predicted by our models can be compared with seismic data for
verification.
