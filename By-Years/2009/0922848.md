This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Arne Gericke and his colleague Edgar A. Kooijman will acquire a surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) instrument. The research uses include projects aimed at
studying: 1) lipid mediated protein functions; 2) exchangeable apolipo- and
lipid droplet protein-lipid interactions; 3) the investigation of androgen
regulation of hormone responsive genes; 4) the investigation of propofol/PKC
interaction; 5) the characterization of protein phosphatase 1 gamma 2
interaction with inhibitors; and 5) the characterization of DNA and RNA
quadruplex formation. In a novel approach, it is planned to assemble ordered
mesoporous organosilicas (OMOs) on an SPR chip surface to develop OMOs that can
be used for sensing applications or in environmental remediation.

SPR biosensors are analytical instruments used to study biomolecular
interactions. An SPR biosensor measures changes in refractive index of a
solution close to a surface. The changes can be caused by changes in
concentration of an analyte that occur on binding to a surface-bound ligand.
Changes over time can reflect association and dissociation and thus, affinity.
This instrument will be used by undergraduates in their research. It will also
be used in a biophotonics cross-disciplinary course under development jointly by
Kent State's Chemistry, Physics and Biology departments to improve the education
of undergraduate students in this vital scientific area prior to their entering
the workforce or graduate school.
