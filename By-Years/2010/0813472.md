Partial support is provided for the US-Japan Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics,
which will be held in Santa Monica, California, on September 14 - 18, 2008. The
purpose of this meeting is to continue the exchange of research findings among
the US and Japanese thermofluids community in this area, with particular
emphasis on nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics.

With respect to the intellectual merit of the conference, there are limited
opportunities for in-depth discussion of two-phase transport phenomena at
existing meetings, especially with international participants. The re-emergence
of nuclear energy as a potential source of non-carbon-emitting electric power
brings the field of two-phase transport phenomena into greater prominence. This
conference will enable a number of US and Japanese researchers to address
fundamental issues in two-phase transport, which inhibit increased adoption of
nuclear energy and other technologies.

The broader impacts of the conference include findings of potential benefit to
the nuclear industry and to other technologies. Some of the NSF support will go
to female and under-represented minority researchers. The results of the meeting
will be disseminated in either book form, or in a special issue of a relevant
international journal.

This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program,
by the Particulates & Multiphase Processes (PMP) Program, and by the Fluid
Dynamics (FD) Program, of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and
Transport Systems (CBET) Division.
