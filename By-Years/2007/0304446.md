In this proposal, we will develop high-resolution photoacoustic techniques for
generating and detecting acoustic vibrations in nanoscale systems and
demonstrate the feasibility of this system in the characterization of doubly
clamped NEMS beam resonators.

The current NER proposal seeks to overcome these resolution problems in
photoacoustic microscopy and demonstrate its applicability to nanometer scale
devices: NEMS. To accomplish this, we will develop an optical near-field
photoacoustic microscopy system that will allow us to generate and detect
acoustic and thermal vibrations in NEMS devices. This system will have a
modulated CW laser (up to 5 GHz) for excitation and a CW probe laser will be
used to monitor the local displacement and temperature, respectively. High
spatial resolution will be obtained by incorporating a high refractive index
solid immersion lens (SIL) to overcome the diffraction limit in air. The SIL
based technique is well suited for the generation and detection of acoustic
waves in NEMS devices because it allows for reduction of laser spot size below
the diffraction limit in air while maintaining the optical throughput necessary
for high sensitivity interferometric detection. The proposed research effort is
aimed at evaluating this experimental technique, which will act as an enabling
technology and help answer fundamental questions regarding the energy flow
through these devices. This NER effort will allow for an initial feasibility
study on high-resolution photoacoustic microscopy of NEMS and provide the
foundation for future development of near-field optical probes for the
generation and detection of acoustic phonons in nanoscale structures. Graduate
student support is also included in this effort. The students will have a truly
interdisciplinary educational experience and receive training in the areas of
near-field optics, acoustics, and nanoscale mechanics. This NER specifically
addresses the following themes:
