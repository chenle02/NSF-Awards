This grant provides funding for the study of multichannel supply chain
management with opaque service enterprises. The study will provide insights into
how consumers react to the opaque service enterprises by analyzing the consumer
behavior in a multichannel environment with uncertain demand. At the retailing
level, competition among opaque and non-opaque retailers will be scrutinized by
unitizing dynamic pricing, ordering, and revenue management techniques. The
interaction among retailers and suppliers will be modeled while taking capacity
allocation, wholesale price contract, and other dimensions into consideration. A
menu of multiple transparency levels will be designed to optimally exploit the
market. The entire supply chain efficiency and social welfare optimization will
be factored into the managerial insights. Supply chain coordination mechanisms
will be discussed in a variety of circumstances including the coexistence of
opaque and non-opaque distribution channels under competition.

If successful, the results of this research will lead to the development of a
framework in dynamically determining the optimal ordering and pricing in
multichannel opaque market when there are stochastic demand and supply; the
evaluation of optimal bidding strategy for heterogeneous customers; the design
of new business models using different transparency and opaque levels to serve
the various consumer segments; and the development of new techniques for
analyzing the dynamic interaction between the opaque retailers and suppliers.
These research activities together will offer a deeper understanding of the
operational structure and the mechanism of opaque internet market which is
becoming part of our daily life. The proposed approaches will also be useful for
analyzing other multichannel systems, such as an auction channel model, and the
revenue management problems for a supply network.
