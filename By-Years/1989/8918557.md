This action would provide funds for continued research in elementary particle
physics: A continuation of experiments E665 (deep inelastic muon scattering) at
Fermilab and E777 and its successor E851 (rare decays of the K+ meson) at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory. The E665 effort will involve analyzing data from
the 1988 run, the completion of two Ph.D, theses and several papers. The
fabrication of new apparatus and the preparation for the 1990 data taking period
(January-November). For E777/E851 the main effort will be analysis of data taken
in 1988 and 1989 which will lead to improved limits on the occurrence of very
rare decay modes of the kaon (pi+ mu+ e- and pi+ e+ e-). Also planned is the
development of new experiments including instrumentation for the Super
Conducting Super Collider.
