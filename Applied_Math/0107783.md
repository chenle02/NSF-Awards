NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0107783 Mathematical Sciences: Fifth Mississippi State
Conference on Differential Equations & Computational Simulations

Abstract

0107783 Shivaji

This award supports U.S. participants (invited speakers, young researchers, and
graduate students) in the Fifth Mississippi State Conference on Differential
Equations & Computational Simulations on May 18-19, 2001. The objective of the
conference is to provide a forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers
from academia and industry can exchange ideas concerning theoretical, applied,
and computational developments in differential equations and associated
simulations. The conference is the fifth in a series of biennial meetings on the
subject. With the rapid development of high performance computing and
communication, and robust and efficient mathematical/numerical algorithms,
computational simulation has emerged as an essential tool for engineering
analysis and design environment. This has fundamentally changed the way
underlying principles of science and engineering are applied to research,
design, and development. These computational simulations involve (i) a system of
differential equations representative of the physical phenomena (mathematical
model); (ii) a numerical method to simulate the mathematical model; and (iii) an
efficient sequential/parallel/distributed computing environment. Successful
simulations require interdisciplinary collaboration between various scientific
and engineering fields. This conference is an opportunity for workers in these
fields to discuss important recent results.
