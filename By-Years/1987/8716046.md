This award is in support of a geological field trip to the Scotia Arc of
Antarctica as part of the U.S. contribution to the International Geological
Congress which will be hosted by the United States in 1989. The participation of
Argentina and Chile as co-hosts has been requested, as well as the co-
sponsorship of the Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research (International
Council of Scientific Unions). This will be the first professional geologic
field trip to Antarctica. This geological field trip is significant for the wide
dissemination of Antarctic geological knowledge and for the testing of over a
decade's research into the paleoenvironmental and tectonic evolution of the
Scotia Arc and Antarctic Peninsula. This field trip is planned for the austral
summer of 1988-89 on board the RV POLAR DUKE and will bring together scientists
expert in all phases of comparable tectonic settings and geologic problems
elsewhere in the world. The field trip is an important aspect of the Antarctic
geosciences and will point to new directions for future research in this
important area.
