9320856 Rotemberg This research explores two related issues of organization
structure. The first issue is why conflicts arise and why the conflicts take on
predictable forms. The second aim is to understand the process for allocating
formal authority. In the study the basic question that is asked is which groups
and individuals tend to be put in charge of various decisions? In order to
understand the process, the study concentrates on the canonical conflict between
marketing and production departments. Usually, the manufacturing section wants
to produce relatively few products on a large scale while the marketing section
would prefer to have a "complete product line". One explanation for this is that
past activity within the firm has led employees in different areas to learn
different things. On the second issue of formal authority, the study seeks to
develop a model where costs to information flow lead firms to put certain
individuals in authority but the authority and power do not always reside in the
same person. The results from this study would provide a basis for understanding
the cases where firms benefit from putting valuable employees in authority and
those where they do not. ***
