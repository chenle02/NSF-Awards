This research will investigate the effects of limited sample sizes on the design
of statistical pattern recognition systems. Although an important and
fundamental problem, relatively little is known regarding the relationships
between dimensionality, distribution, and the number of samples required to
design effective classifiers. In practice, use of a finite design set results in
classifiers with performance that is degraded from their potential performance.
The goals of this research are to (1) provide an analysis of the effect of the
finite sample set on the design of pattern recognition systems, and (2) to find
new classifier design procedures that most effectively use the available design
set, and extend these results to other pattern recognition problems such as
feature extraction or clustering.
