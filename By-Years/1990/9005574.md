Carotenoids are essential components of the photosynthetic apparatus of
bacteria, algae and higher plants and serve critical roles in light-harvesting
and protection against photosensitized oxidations. Although the roles of
carotenoids in light-harvesting and photoprotection are clearly established, the
details of the excited singlet and triplet energy transfer reactions required
for these are poorly understood. Drs. Albrecht and Owens propose to investigate
the in vivo photophysics of photosynthetic carotenoids in several bacterial and
algal pigment-protein complexes. Primary emphasis will be placed on providing a
mechanistic description of singlet energy transfer from carotenoids to
chlorophylls. Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy will be used to study the
dynamics of singlet and triplet transfer reactions and to identify heterogeneous
carotenoid function. Resonance Raman techniques, including Raman excitation
profiles, will be used to probe heterogeneous carotenoid functions in vivo.
