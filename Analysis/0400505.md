Problems in harmonic analysis and several complex variables

Abstract

Many of the fundamental questions in complex analysis are closely related to
the regularity properties of solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The
principal investigator plans to study Lp-Sobolev and Holder regularity for the
interior and tangential Cauchy-Riemann complexes on smoothly bounded,
pseudoconvex domains in Cn when there is at least some gain of regularity in the
standard Sobolev spaces (e. g. for finite-type domains, in any dimension). In
particular, he will focus on the following basic problems: (1) Determination of
the precise relation, up to smoothing operators, between the Bergman and Szego
projections; (2) Transference of Sobolev and Holder estimates from the interior
to the boundary of such domains (and vice versa), and connections to
nonisotropic maximal hypoellipticity; (3) Kernel estimates for the Neumann
operator and for the canonical solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann operator, based
on properties of certain generalized singular integrals on the boundary. The
principal investigator anticipates that his work will also provide insight into
questions concerning global and exact regularity for arbitrary smoothly bounded,
pseudoconvex domains.

The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of the broader
question: how are the regularity properties of solutions to a system of partial
differential equations (with prescribed boundary conditions) on a given domain
related to the ones for an associated system on the boundary? Some of the
methods introduced by the principal investigator should have applications to
other PDE that arise in the physical sciences. He expects to pursue this
possibility along with independent interests in nonlinear dispersive wave
equations, and he will also contribute to the wider dissemination (among
graduate students and other researchers) of modern methods in harmonic analysis
and several complex variables.
