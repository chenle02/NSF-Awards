The proposal is asking for partial travel support for US based graduate students
and other mathematicians to attend a major conference in topology, Dubrovnik VII
- Geometric Topology to be held on June 26- July 3, 2011
(http://www.math.utah.edu/dubrovnik/). This is a great opportunity for the
junior mathematicians to familiarize themselves with the frontiers of research
in this very active subject and in the future contribute to it. In addition,
many of the participants (e.g. six of the main speakers) are anticipated to be
women. Based on initial inquiries, it is also likely that several of US based
mathematicians that will be supported on this grant, if funded, will be women.

Topology studies generalized notions of spatial structure. It is a fundamental
part of modern mathematics and has applications as far ranging as robotics,
fluid mixing, tomography, computer networks, algorithms complexity, linking of
DNA, and many others. International conferences are fundamental to the strength
and development of mathematics, and as such are a fundamental part of the
international colaboration as well as of the development of the national science
core and the scientific infrastructure. This conference will combine the latest
results in Geometry, Topology and Group Theory. The Dubrovnik conference has a
long and a very successful tradition bringing together researches from different
areas mathematically and geographically. In many ways the Dubrovnik conference
series has been an indespensible tool for collaboration in Topology. No doubts
that this conference will advance top quality research in Topology while
facilitating broad and deep interaction among adjacent mathematical research
areas such as Group Theory and Differential Geometry and between abstract and
applied research.
