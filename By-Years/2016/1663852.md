The University of Southern California will conduct a workshop to identify and
address issues that impact career pathways for African American students in
physics and astronomy. Diverse experts from Pk-12, higher education, industry,
and professional societies will convene to (1) identify evidence-based
approaches to mitigating barriers to African American students? academic
performance and workforce participation, (2) discuss strategies for more
rigorous, third-party evaluations of programs or activities designed to increase
the representation of African Americans in physics and astronomy, and (3)
propose research topics focused specifically on underrepresentation in the
physics and astronomy workforce. The two-day workshop coincide with the annual
meeting of the National Society of Black Physicists and will employ a
?strengths-based, pathway model? approach to discuss an action-oriented,
systematic, data-driven strategy to broaden the participation of African
Americans in physics and astronomy. The workshop will result in knowledge that
can be used by various stakeholder communities, including community colleges, to
design effective interventions to reverse the negative trends in physics and
astronomy. It also will catalyze collaborations to implement innovations to
broaden participation in those disciplines.
