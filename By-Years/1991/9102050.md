The innovations expected during the efforts carried out in this project relate
primarily to the integration of expert system technology into mechanical design
and finite element analysis. The resulting software will provide an efficient
three-dimensional design tool that will make expert skills available to the
novice user without requiring an exhaustive background in the finite element
theory and terminology. This availability is likely to reduce design time and
productivity. The design-representation system (DRS) will represent the design
in a format that may be addressed by a variety of other applications. Feature-
based design is gaining popularity and the intended generality of the DRS will
represent an advance in this domain. This project presents some challenging
obstacles that will need to be overcome during its implementation. The
application of expert system technology to mechanical engineering is a
relatively new field of research, and there is little prior work in this area.
It is expected that the research will capture the qualitative nature of analysis
practices in the form of an integrated kilobyte and also improve the
capabilities of computer-aided design via artificial intelligence techniques.
