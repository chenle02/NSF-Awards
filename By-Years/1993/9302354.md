The observations of the middle and upper atmosphere that can be made at Bear
Lake Observatory are vital to the CEDAR objectives of studying coupling among
different regions of the atmosphere. Mid-latitude observations provide a very
different perspective of coupling compared to those made in the auroral zone and
polar cap or in the equatorial region. There are two categories of problems that
are particularly amenable to study from a mid-latitude site, and these are being
pursued from BLO. The first studies atmospheric processes where the influence of
magnetospheric processes are minimal. The other studies extensions of
magnetospheric influences into the mid-latitude region, which may occur from an
expansion of the auroral region towards the equator or from enhancements of
ring-current effects extending poleward.
