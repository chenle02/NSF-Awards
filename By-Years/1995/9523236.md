ABSTRACT CMS9523236 PI: Dowding and Finno, Northwestern University Monitoring of
slope movement in soils has been inhibited by the level of manual operation
required for most monitoring equipment in current use. Time Domain Reflectometry
(TDR) is an emerging technology in the field of Geotechnical instrumentation.
This research will develop a TDR cable/grout system that will deform in soil
shear zones, in a manner similar to that now observed with shearing in rock
joints. These localized shear zones have been observed in soft clays.
Development of this system will allow direct transfer of TDR measurements for
real time soil slope monitoring, and the necessary compliant cables will be
developed in the context of this research. The TDR-based device will allow on-
site or remote access, and can overcome many of the problems related to
inclinometer use.
