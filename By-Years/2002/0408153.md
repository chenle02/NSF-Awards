Environmental gradients are an inescapable consequence of living on earth, with
altitudinal gradients being one of the most extreme examples. For instance, the
distance from the base of the Sierra Nevada to the peak of Mount Dana (3,979 m,
Yosemite Park, CA) is a mere 60 miles. Yet, the average temperature drops
approximately 24 degree Celsius - the equivalent of traversing over 3,700 miles
in latitude. These changes in air temperature are accompanied by a 37% decrease
in air density and dramatic changes in resources, ultraviolet exposure,
humidity, and predators. High altitude conditions are challenging; and not
surprisingly, species diversity decreases precipitously above moderate
altitudes. Flying insects may be particularly challenged at altitude because
their ability to fly will be compromised by both cold temperatures and thin air.
This research investigates how altitudinal gradients impact insect physiology
and evolution. To accomplish this goal, the fruit fly, Drosophila pseudoobscura
will be collected from a range of altitudes in Yosemite Park, CA to determine:
1) the direct and interactive effects of temperature and air density on
development, fitness, and flight ability, 2) the relative contributions of
"beneficial acclimation" and "localized adaptation" to this species' success
across a wide range of altitudes, and 3) whether local adaptations are
evolutionarily maintained along the altitudinal gradient despite extensive gene
flow due to the presence of chromosomal inversions. This research will promote a
better understanding of how air density and temperature interactively affect
insect locomotion and fitness, potentially facilitating the development of more
accurate models to predict the impacts of environmental change. In addition, it
will help clarify the antagonistic relationship between natural selection and
gene flow along environmental gradients.
