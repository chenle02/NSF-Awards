9408977 Morrison Research into the theoretical treatment of low energy
vibrational and rotational excitation of simple molecules such as H2 and N2
needed for a fundamental understanding of the interactions of electrons with
molecular targets will be pursued. In addition, a new project involving the
collision of Rydberg atoms with noble gases will be initiated to study the
effects of alignment and orientation on the behavior of low-energy cross
sections. ***
