This project will upgrade instrumentation in the Trace Metals Laboratory at
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. The Trace Metals Lab of MLML has been a world
leader in studies of the role of metals in regulating primary production in the
ocean over large spatial and temporal scales. Moss Landing scientists have
played a major part in developing new analytical methods for trace elements in
aquatic systems. They have also played a key role in making freshwater chemists
aware that there are significant methodological errors in previous measurements
of metals in freshwater systems. As a result, MLML has served as an important
center for training and development of analytical methods for trace chemical
analysis. In the past 5 years,6 graduate students have finished MS degrees
working with Trace Metals Lab staff and instrumentation. In addition, there have
been a number of visitors to the lab from the US and overseas.
