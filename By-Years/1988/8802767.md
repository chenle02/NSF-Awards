The purpose of this project is to model the Earth's outer core as a thick
rotating spherical shell containing an inviscid, perfectly conducting fluid of
constant density in the presence of a basic toroidal magnetic field. The
propagation of slow hydromagnetic waves in this model is to be studied using
multiple- scale asymptotic techniques. The project will emphasize the
relationship between the direction of wave propagation, the spherical geometry,
wave trapping and instability. Possible explanations for the westward drift of
the Earth's magnetic field will be sought.
