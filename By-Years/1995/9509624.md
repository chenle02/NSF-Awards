9509624 Rigney The tribological behavior of aluminum alloys containing hard
and/or soft components will be studied. The purpose is to develop guidelines for
the design of bearing materials for use in sliding applications, such as
automotive uses, with the hope that the results will allow the gradual phase-out
of lead in these materials. The work is primarily experimental and involves
tribological testing and post-test characterization of Al-Pb, Al-Si, Al-Pb-Si
alloys as well as more complex compositions with closely controlled size and
distribution of the secondary phase. The work includes a collaboration with the
Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Solid State Physics in Chernigolovka.
That institute has developed a technique based on the use of magnetic and
electric fields for producing very fine microstructures in bulk materials of
immiscible components, such as Al-Pb and Al-graphite and will provide the
various alloys for testing. ***
