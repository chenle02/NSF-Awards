9300196 Cagan The shape annealig algorithm is used to generate network
topologies for flow systems. Shape annealing combines the concepts of shape
grammars and the stochastic optimization technique of simulated annealing to
produce optimally directed design configurations. Applications of the shape
annealing algorithm to network flow problems include piece layout, structural
topology generation (such as trusses), and land use and transportation problems.
Application requires a shape grammer that models the characteristics of the
design space and evaluation function on the design
