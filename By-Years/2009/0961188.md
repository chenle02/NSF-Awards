This award purchases a new Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for
geosciences research at the University of Minnesota. The instrument is used to
support analyses of seafloor hydrothermal vent fluids and other geological
materials, as well as train graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the
art geochemical techniques. The institution has provided a strong commitment to
the sustainability of the instrument by improving the associated laboratory
facilities and providing technical support. NSF-related broader impacts of the
purchase are primarily in building infrastructure for science at the host
institution, student training, and support of research for a faculty member
whose gender is under-represented in the sciences.
