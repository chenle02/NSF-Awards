Theoretical research will continue on the study of interfaces and non-
equilibrium systems driven to steady states by an external field. In an ongoing
exploration of bulk singularities in driven systems, multi-point correlations
will be investigated in models with a uniform drive, annealed random drives,
repulsive interactions, and many species. Another area of study involves the
interfaces in driven systems. Particularly, the effects of driving on roughening
will be studied and selection mechanisms for the variety of bulk phases induced
by different boundary conditions will be investigated. Additional studies will
be undertaken on the interplay between bulk and interfacial fluctuations;
morphological transitions due to curvature dominated closed membranes; and,
conceptual questions associated with capillary wave theory. Long term projects
include a thorough analysis of finite size effects and quenched impurities in
driven systems, a wider class of competing dynamical models and applications to
a variety of other related phenomena. %%%
