This award is the first year base funding of a five year Presidential Young
Investigator Award. The research addresses destrous manipulation with tactile
sensor-equipped multifinger robot hands, micromanipulation with millimeter-sized
cooperating mobile modules, and understanding of nonlinear dynamics to control
an acrobatic robot. The goal of these robotic systems is to manipulate and
explore environments that are currently inaccessible due to size, distance, or
cost.//
