ABSTRACT CTS-9521374 An Engineering description of multi-phase flows by
necessity must be made on the basis of macroscopic equations in which the phase
inhomogeneties are accounted for in an average sense, rather than in detail. The
difficulty in formulating the models resides in the fact that any averaging
procedure applied to the fundamental equations of continuum mechanics leads to
models containing more unknowns than equations. The fundamental problem is then
that of closing the equation set, namely of determining "constitutive relations"
that express some unknown quantities in terms of others. This is the central
theme of the proposed research for the case of disperse flows, such as particles
in a fluid phase. The problem will be attacked by relying on a new method for
deriving averaged equations and on the state-of-the-art numerical direct-
simulation techniques. Both tools have been previously developed under NSF
support. The new averaging procedure expresses the unknown in terms of integrals
over the particles surfaces that can readily be calculated from numerical
simulations of the motion. The computations will be carried out by means of a
space-time finite-element method implemented on massively parallel
supercomputers. The insight into the structure of the equations that, if
successful, will derive from this research promises to answer long-standing
questions as to the mathematical structure of the equations and their
relationship to observe phenomena. The enhancement of the numerical techniques
necessary to carry out this research constitutes in itself a significant
advancement in the current direct numerical simulation capabilities. This
research will be carried out in conduction with Professor Tayfun Tezduyar of the
University of Minnesota (Twin Cities) who has a separate grant from NSF. ***
