Abstract

This project involves interdisciplinary research in which algorithmic approaches
are developed to design and analyze adaptive experiments. An adaptive
(sequential) design is one whose characteristics change in accordance with
information arising from the ongoing experiment, as opposed to classical
statistical designs where such characteristics are set in advance and remain
fixed throughout. Adaptive designs have a wide range of application in clinical
trials, destructive testing, behavioral ecology, computer performance
prediction, adaptive control, etc., where they have the potential to reduce the
expenditure of experimental ``resources'' such as time, money, or quality of
life. Unfortunately, adaptive designs are difficult to analyze and optimize.
Exact analytic solutions are rarely available, and thus, historically, such
designs have been predominantly approached via asymptotic methods and ad hoc
approximations. Computationally, adaptive designs require significant time and
space that has often made exact calculations infeasible.

This project will expand the size and scope of solvable problems by developing
new computational approaches for creating and evaluating designs and utilizing
state of the art computational facilities. Attention is directed to problems
that are important in applications, with a major emphasis on supplying
researchers greater flexibility in modeling their statistical and cost
objectives. For many of these problems, exact optimality will be unattainable,
and thus techniques for producing near-optimal designs will also be pursued.
Several of these techniques are based on optimizing smaller or simpler problems
and extrapolating their solution structure to larger or more complex problems.
This compliments analytical, asymptotic work and provides new insights into the
structure of solutions. In other cases, a shift from serial algorithms to
parallel ones will be used to address the additional complexity.
