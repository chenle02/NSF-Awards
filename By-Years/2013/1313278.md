This collaborative proposal brings together the theoretical and observational
skills from two researchers to conduct a study of L-dwarfs, which are relatively
cool brown dwarf stellar objects. They will use optical and infrared
spectroscopy and photometry of approximately thirty L- dwarfs to constrain and
revise models of the atmospheres and evolution of low mass stellar objects. They
will use archive data from Spitzer IRAC and 2MASS surveys, and new data from a
1.3-m telescope in Chile and 2.4-m MDM telescope. They will focus on determining
accurate values of effective temperature, mass and metallicity of the dwarfs,
and to better understand why many young brown dwarfs are not as luminous as
models predict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the research
training of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups from the City
University of New York system, supporting the AstroBetter blog, producing
planetarium videos and other public outreach activities through the American
Museum of Natural History.&lt;br/&gt;
