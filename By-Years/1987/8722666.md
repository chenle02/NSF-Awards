The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V POINT SUR, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
University. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumenta- tion will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -A pc computer system
for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities, -replacement
10-liter and 5-liter water sampling bottles for collecting discrete seawater
samples at specific depths, -several precision reversing thermometers, and -a
Rhubidium frequency standard to enhance scientific navigation capabilities. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the organization
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
