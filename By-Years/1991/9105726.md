The purpose of this proposal is to study chloroplast mRNA processing, with an
emphasis on mRNA splicing, as a way to enhance our understanding of chloroplast
biogenesis and function. Previous results have posed intriguing questions about
the processing and splicing of a gene cluster in spinach chloroplasts that
encodes four of the nine chloroplast ATP synthase subunits. Preliminary data
suggests that chloroplast mRNA splicing may result in multiple branch points
within the same intron. One of the three objectives of this proposal is to
investigate those preliminary results. The PI has detected splicing activity in
spinach chloroplast extracts. Tow objectives of this proposal are dedicated to
the stabilization and initial characterization studies on this in vitro splicing
activity. It is not known whether splicing is a rate limiting step in the
control of gene expression, but it is an indispensable step in the production of
several essential gene products. In this proposal, the plan is to study
chloroplast splicing both in vivo and in vitro in order to begin to understand
this complex process and the factors that regulate it. Chloroplast gene
expression is regulated by several factors including light, heat stress, and
physiological factors. This work will help to elucidate control points that
regulate chloroplast biogenesis and function.//
