The objective of this project is to enhance the educational experience of
graduate students in the engineering design research community by sponsoring
their travel to an international workshop on developing and publishing journal
articles from conference papers. Participants are selected from the best
student-authored papers submitted to the annual American Society of Mechanical
Engineers conference on design engineering research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
program will benefit the best of our nation's new design researchers by building
their skill in publishing articles in scholarly journals. They will also receive
the opportunity to build relationships with other researchers from the US and
from around the world.
