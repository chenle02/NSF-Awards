As big data applications continue to grow in size and number, it is of crucial
importance to deal only with measurements that are informative for a specific
inference task in order to limit the required sensing cost, as well as the
related costs of storing or communicating the data. To this end, this project
develops a new paradigm of compressive sensing for random processes, where the
signal compression and reconstruction strategies are designed to be task-
cognizant, hinging on useful signal statistics rather than the original random
signals. This research leads to major sensing energy savings, and can benefit a
plethora of energy-efficient sensing applications such as location-aware
services, weather monitoring, spectrum monitoring, and radio
astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to
significantly reduce the cost of sensing as well as the related storage and
communication requirements by offering innovative sensing approaches tailored to
the inference task of interest. Different from existing compressive sampling,
the proposed research leverages the inherent structures of signal statistical
information in order to enable reliable inference from sparsely sampled data,
rather than solely relying on signal sparsity to enable compression. As such, a
new approach to sparse sensing is introduced for random processes, which reveals
the fundamental limits of compression in relation to the degrees of freedom
inherent to the underlying statistical structure, even in the absence of signal
sparsity. Efficient inference techniques and deterministic compressive sampler
designs are put forth to affect major savings in the sensing costs while
achieving the desired inference quality. These basic results open up
opportunities for efficient handling of data-intensive sensing applications in
which inference from random processes is of foremost importance.
