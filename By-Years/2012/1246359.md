Intellectual Merit: This research will investigate how Antarctic peatbanks have
responded to documented past warm climates on the Western Antarctic Peninsula
over the last 1000 years. The work will extend understanding of climate controls
on peat carbon accumulation to Antarctic peatbanks thus enabling a bi-polar
perspective of ?first responder? ecosystem processes under warmer climate
conditions. Understanding climate and ecosystem histories will help reveal
processes and mechanisms that control the functioning of these and other polar
ecosystems. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate outcomes of ?natural
climate-warming experiments? that have occurred in the AP region at 65 degrees
south over the last 1000 years. They will focus on two warm climate intervals in
the Western Antarctic Peninsula: (1) the recent and ongoing warming of up to 6Â°C
in the last century, and (2) the Medieval Warm Period that occurred ~800 years
ago. By collecting and analyzing peat cores and other biological and
environmental data, the investigators will derive an independent temperature
reconstruction from oxygen isotopes of moss cellulose over the last 1000 years
to assess peatbank carbon response to documented warm climate conditions. The
overall goal of the proposed project is to document formation ages and temporal
changes in carbon-accumulating ecosystems over the last millennium in response
to climate change as reconstructed from independent proxies. Also, their data
will allow the investigators to understand the nature of reconstructed climate
change in relation to atmosphere circulation and ocean conditions.

Broader impacts: This research is directly relevant to understanding polar
processes affecting soil carbon dynamics and will support an early career
researcher. This project will provide training for undergraduate students,
graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow and will develop teaching modules and
outreach activities on polar climate and ecosystem changes.
