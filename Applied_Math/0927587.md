The aim of this interdisciplinary collaborative research project is to develop a
novel model reduction technique for forced dissipative infinite-dimensional
dynamical systems by employing basis functions computed using upper bound
theories. Like popular Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based methods, this
approach associates the condensed variables needed for model reduction with
coherent structures and captures nonlinear interactions between these linear
modes via Galerkin projection and finite-dimensional truncation. Unlike
empirical POD methods, however, this new method does not require extensive data
sets from experiments or direct numerical simulations of the governing partial
differential equations (PDEs) and thus yields truly predictive reduced models.
The theoretical and computational methodology will be developed in the context
of a particular physical system, thermal convection in fluid saturated porous
media, that is of considerable environmental and technological importance and an
ideal testbed for new ideas.

This research will contribute to the development of a general methodology for
deriving simplified mathematical models of highly complex dynamical systems
arising in diverse areas of science and engineering. In many applications of
interest (e.g., control of various fluid flows to achieve drag reduction for oil
pumped in pipelines or for air flowing past commercial jets, or for estimation
of carbon dioxide sequestration by porous rock material for reducing global
warming), direct numerical simulations based on the complete governing
mathematical equations are infeasible using even the world's fastest high-
performance supercomputers. This project will address these challenges using
novel mathematical techniques to derive simplified equations directly from the
governing physical laws that are amenable to practical computation and analysis.
