Professor Gay and his coworkers will undertake three investigations involving
the scattering of polarized electrons by Atoms and molecules. (1) Superelastic
scattering of the spin polarized electrons from energy-rich, long-lived atomic
excited states. In superelastic scattering some of the internal energy of the
atom transfers to the kinetic energy of the electron at the time of collision.
(2) The effect of helicity or "handedness" in electron scattering. Many
naturally occurring molecules have one handedness but not the other but not
both-- this study is a search for the fundamental physical reason behind this
"natural" preference. (3) A systematic study of helium excitation and subsequent
fluorescence to determine if this process can be made a highly accurate standard
for electron polarimetry.
