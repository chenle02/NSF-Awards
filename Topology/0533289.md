The purpose of the conference is to honor Karol Borsuk's life and work on the
100th anniversary of his birth by bringing leading researchers in geometric
topology from all over the world and exchange the latest ideas in the field. The
Organizing Committee consists of Robert J. Daverman and Jerzy Dydak (University
of Tennessee), Tadeusz Januszkiewicz (Ohio University), Krystyna Kuperberg
(Auburn University), Slawomir Nowak (University of Warsaw), and Stanislaw Spiez
and Henryk Torunczyk, Chair (Polish Academy of Sciences). The main speakers
include M.Bestvina (University of Utah), A.Dranishnikov (University of Florida),
J.Cannon (Brigham Young University), M.Davis (Ohio University), S.Ferry (Rutgers
University), and K.Kuperberg (Auburn University). Emphasis is placed on
involving junior faculty and graduate students in the meeting by organizing two
workshops led by Bestvina and Dranishnikov. Those workshops will have special
sessions for graduate students only led by junior faculty (former students of
the main speakers).

The main topics of the International Conference and Workshops on Geometric
Topology are currently very active research areas. Many of the participants of
the meeting will have strong research records, and it is expected that the
exchange of ideas will lead to significant future results and stimulate
international collaboration. An effort will be made to involve graduate students
and other young researchers in the meeting as speakers. By bringing graduate
students from the United States we plan to make students from Eastern Europe
aware of the educational opportunities in the US and at specific universities
here. This exposure to the international mathematical community will also
present an excellent opportunity for American students and young researchers to
learn about professional preparation in other countries and establish ground for
future interaction.
