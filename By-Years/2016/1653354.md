The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to develop a
comprehensive framework for the design of and optimal resource allocation in
star-shaped stochastic networks with a central control node. The central node
serves to manage system risk by pooling a portion of the resources of each
individual node and underwriting a node that falls below a threshold value. This
project will advance methodologies in both operations research and stochastic
analysis. Such systems arise in many contexts, including distributed retail
operations, where resources are inventories of goods and backordering is
allowed, and financial networks, where resources are cash and other capital
assets and individual nodes may experience cash shortfalls. The education plan
will broaden participation of females in STEM fields through a structured week-
long outreach activity with female high school students and by organizing
special sessions for junior female researchers to interact with senior female
executives in the risk management and financial industry at an annual national
conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resources of the central node and individual
nodes are modeled as multidimensional marked point processes, and first passage
times are characterized and studied. Optimal contributions from each node to the
pooled central node are determined by considering individual nodes' stochastic
behavior in a cooperative game-theoretic setting, and the Nash equilibrium of
these games will be studied. The case where the central node has an independent
Brownian component that can enhance system operation will be also be considered.
The developed models will be calibrated with available data.
