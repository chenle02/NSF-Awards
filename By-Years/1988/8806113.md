This research project is designed to a) further characterize the internal
dynamics of selected proteins, b) focus on the effects of viscosity, pressure
and temperature on the dynamics and function of proteins and c) develop
fluorescence acquisition and analysis protocols for a more realistic and
accurate relationship between physical models and experimental data. Dr. Eftink
will use the methods of multi-frequency phase/modulation fluorometry and solute
fluorescence quenching reactions to characterize the emission of individual
tryptophan residues in selected proteins. The dynamic properties of proteins are
a matter of fundamental importance in the understanding of ligand binding,
catalysis, cooperative effects, protein-protein recognition and other functional
aspects of proteins. It is clear that there is an important need to know more
than the static three-dimensional structure of proteins in order to unravel the
mysteries of their function. Molecular-dynamics calculations can provide
insightful simulations of possible events, but these calculations must always be
guided and/or supported by empirical experimental measures of protein dynamics.
Solute quenching and other fluorescence techniques have contributed greatly to
the present data base regarding the fluctuations in proteins on the nanosecond
time scale. Further development of these fluorescence techniques should enhance
the ability to relate photophysical kinetic models to fluorescence data.***//
