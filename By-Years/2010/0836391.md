This project is a three year effort to theoretically investigate mechanisms and
effects of infrasonic waves generated by thunderstorms and aurora. The
infrasonic waves correspond to acoustic waves in the frequency range 0.02-10 Hz.
There is strong experimental evidence that thunderstorms and aurora represent
significant sources of infrasonic wave activity spanning a broad altitude range
from the troposphere up to the thermosphere. This evidence includes
electrostatic production of 0.1-1 Hz infrasonic waves from thunderstorms, recent
discovery of infrasound from lightning induced transient luminous events in the
mesosphere called sprites, and radiation of infrasonic waves from supersonic
auroral arcs and pulsating aurora. The project aims to characterize and quantify
the observed infrasonic signals by undertaking a focused two-dimensional
numerical modeling effort. It will address a limited set of unsolved problems
related to infrasonic wave production by thunderstorms and aurora. The
outstanding scientific questions to be pursued are: (1) What is the mechanism
for the compression and rarefaction infrasonic pulses with periods 0.5 to 1 sec
produced in association with lightning discharges? What is the fate and
predicted signature of these pulses as they propagate downward and upward from
thunderclouds and reach a remote observer after reflections from the ground and
thermosphere? (2) What is the mechanism of the recently discovered infrasound
radiation from sprites? Which physical factors, including both infrasound
generation and propagation factors, contribute to formation of the chirp-like
signatures that are observed? What are the specific features of observed
waveforms, which would allow a remote observer to discriminate between
infrasound radiation coming from thunderclouds at low altitudes and those from
sprites? (3) What is the temporal and spatial structure of the body force acting
on neutral air in auroral arcs that move with supersonic speeds, leading to
auroral infrasound waves observed on the ground? What is the mechanism of the
recently observed infrasound signals from pulsating aurora? Specific activities
include development of a new efficient two-dimensional model of infrasound
propagation using finite-difference time-domain techniques. The new model will
be fully non-linear and will account for realistic temperature and wind
structure in the Earth's atmosphere as well as for altitude dependent
dissipation effects. The model will follow the fate of infrasonic wave packets
at they propagate, reflect, and dissipate in the atmosphere in order to
interpret existing published observations and to make specific predictions for
future observations.
