The Arctic is now at the frontline of climate change as surface air temperatures
warm twice as fast as the rest of the globe. Unprecedented reductions in sea ice
cover are pushing the Arctic into unknown conditions. Among the most critical
components of the cryosphere are high-latitude glaciers, which hold more than
99% of the worldâ€™s fresh water. These glaciers are inherently unstable and thus
sensitive to climate change. We can look to how glacial systems responded to
climate change in the past to better understand future glacier dynamics and to
constrain future projections of glacial contributions to sea level rise.
Evidence is building in support of a thick ice-sheet that spanned the Arctic
Ocean, possibly multiple times, during the past 130,000 years. This project aims
to bring together a diverse array of geologic evidence from the Arctic Ocean and
the surrounding coastal plains, to explore the timing and extent of Arctic Ocean
glaciation during the mid- to late-Pleistocene. This research will help us
better understand whether an Arctic Ocean wide ice sheet existed in the past,
which will in turn help us better understand future ice sheet
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice sheets and ice shelves at high latitudes are
of particular interest in understanding future glacier dynamics because geologic
records suggest that they may advance and retreat out-of-phase with glaciers at
mid-latitudes due to moisture limitations in full glacial conditions. As such,
high-latitude glaciation may display non-intuitive behavior in response to
climate change. The main objective of the project is to improve our
understanding of the extent of glaciation in the western Arctic Ocean during the
mid to late Pleistocene and to identify the main sources of ice that contributed
to ice-sheet build up. The project will build a geographic information system
database of previously collected geologic evidence of Arctic Ocean glaciation in
the Beaufort-Chukchi region, allowing researchers to test the hypothesis that
glaciation was extensive in the western Arctic Ocean at several points during
the Pleistocene. Existing datasets that will be synthesized from data archives,
publications and reports include (1) marine survey data from hull mounted chirp
and multibeam sonars collected by numerous scientific cruises to the region, (2)
marine sediment cores, and (3) terrestrial records of glacial erratic boulders
and ancient raised beach ridges. Results from this research will improve our
understanding of how high-latitude ice sheets can behave during periods of
climatic change. This project will support one MSc student and a female early
career PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
