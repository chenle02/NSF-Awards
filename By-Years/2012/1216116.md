The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is conducting two workshops
to provide technical assistance to minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to
increase their participation and competitiveness in NSF's Math and Science
Partnership (MSP) program. The technical assistance will be in the form of
annual two-day workshops to assist three-person teams from MSIs in further
developing their ideas for MSP proposals for the FY 2012 and FY 2013 MSP
competitions. Each institutional team will consist of a science, technology,
engineering, or mathematics (STEM) faculty member, an education faculty member,
and a representative from a local/regional school district. Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), and
Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) with accredited teacher education
programs will be specifically targeted. Following each workshop, the workshop
agenda, with links to workshop presentations, are posted at QEM's website. Also
posted are selected abstracts of currently funded MSP projects that focus on
predominantly minority school districts, so that other interested groups can
benefit.
