This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the Department of Chemistry at
University of California @ Riverside to upgrade a 300 MHz and a 500 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) total synthesis of natural products, (2) NMR
characterization of pollutant transport through porous media, (3) structure-
function played by H-bonded protons with large H-chemical shifts in the insulin
hexamer, (4) conformation analysis and the relationship to biological activity,
(5) stereochemistry of side chain crosslinking in peptides and proteins, and (6)
synthesis, structural and biological studies of biomedically significant natural
products. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
