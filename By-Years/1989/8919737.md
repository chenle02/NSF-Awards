This project will investigate relationships between hormones, mood, and
competitive interactions among men. A commonly held notion among scientists and
lay people is that hormones must play some role in human male aggression,
dominance, and competition. Previous research involving extrapolations from
animal studies, and specific investigations in men has supported this idea. And,
a relationship between hormones and aggressive behavior and mood states in men,
while controversial, is advanced by recent data linking aggressive reaction
patterns and personality characteristics to testosterone levels. Dr. Brian
Gladue has shown that status and mood changes in men cause short- term changes
in testosterone levels. Using saliva assays during competitive states, this
investigator is able to determine testosterone levels using a non-invasive
technique. His work will expand the investigation of mood, affect, hormones and
dominance/competition to better understand temporal aspects of hormone-mood
relationships involving cortisol and testosterone throughout and after
competitive interactions.
