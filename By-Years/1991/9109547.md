This research will plan, build and evaluate a computer-supported cooperative
problem solving environment that teaches people how to solve problems by working
together. The environment is based on a communication competency model that
assumes that a group's effectiveness depends upon the performance of
communication competencies (or skills) that aid groups in solving problems. The
model provides a preliminary categorization of the various communicative
competencies that, in turn, can be represented in a computer-supported
cooperative work environment through online tools designed to support related
communication functions. Several precursors of this system have been developed
by the principal investigator and were designed to teach effective problem
solving skills, assess mission success, and support computer-supported
cooperative problem solving for an information retrieval task. This work extends
that research by developing a special computer-supported interface that can be
used to investigate how to teach people to use communication competencies in
order to solve problems more effectively.
