9315831 Woodburne This award supports a study of terrestrial vertebrates from
lower Cenozoic sediments on Seymour Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. Seymour
Island contains rich and well preserved faunal and floral assemblages in a thick
stratigraphic section that encompasses the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.
Previous work has yielded marsupial and placental mammal fossils. The lower
Cenozoic Sobral Formation contains terrestrial sediments that are likely to
yield substantially more fossil material and this material would represent the
earliest Tertiary vertebrates known from Antarctica. The objectives of this
proposal are to understand the role of high latitude locations in biological
evolution and dispersal of vertebrates in the early Tertiary. This work is
likely to lead to a better understanding of migration patterns and evolutionary
relationships between Australian and South American vertebrates. ***
