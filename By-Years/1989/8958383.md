This award supports research in high-performance precision motion control. One
of the focuses is to establish the theoretical basis for the creation of an
electromechanical spherical stepper capable of three degrees of orientation
motion in a single joint. The ball-joint-like motor is based on the hybrid
permanent magnet and variable reluctance principle and is characterized by
simplicity of structure, compact design, absence of singularities (except at the
boundary of the workspace, and lack of unbalanced rotor body forces. The
proposed spherical stepper has significant applications such as high-speed
plasma and laser cutting where the end-effector is required to orient quickly,l
continuously, and isotropically in all directions. The development of the
stepper presents a challenge in design, modeling, control and implementation.
The initial support of the Presidential Young Investigator Award will permit the
spherical stepper research to include experimental investigation and prototype
development and evaluation.
