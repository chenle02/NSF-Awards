9632069 Wright What happens in our brains when we learn? How much of what
happens is due to processes that first appeared in the brains of ancient
ancestors, and how much is due to more recently evolved mechanisms? The work
proposed here examines, for the first time, the evolution of mechanisms of
learning. Through neurophysiological and behavioral studies of present-day
species with known relationships to each other, we propose to chart the
evolution of specific cellular mechanisms of learning. This approach will 1)
address the question of whether and how mechanisms of learning change across
evolution, and 2) provide new insights into learning mechanisms of modern
species.
