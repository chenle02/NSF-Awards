The physical basis for our understanding of the stellar evolutionary is
ultimately measured in the success of computational models of stellar structure.
The Principal Investigator (PI) has devoted his career to computing models of
stars that permit an understanding of how stars evolve in time from one position
on the "H R Diagram" to another. In the last three years the PI has begun to
extend his expertise to the difficult problems of the evolution of binary stars,
the accretion of hydrogen-rich material onto white dwarfs and its subsequent
gravitational settling and mixing, time- dependent computations of "slow"
neutron-capture nucleosynthesis. A substantial part of the PI's new work will
include hydrodynamical simulations of accretion and mixing. He will continue a
vigorous collaboration with M. Fujimoto and his collaborators in Japan to
include multi-dimensional hydrodynamical physics into his model interior
computer codes. It is anticipated that this marriage will facilitate added
theoretical expertise to both Japanese and U.S. astronomy.
