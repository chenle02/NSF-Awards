The objective of this research is to develop non-volatile computing devices,
which allow the power source to be cut off at any time, and yet resume regular
operation without loss of information when the power comes back. The approach is
to replace all critical memory components with non-volatile units so that
computing state is maintained over power interruptions. The advancement in new
Flash memory devices makes this approach feasible by enabling low-voltage
program/erase (P/E) around Â±2V and a long (projected >1016) cycling endurance to
be integrated into CMOS technology.

This research effort seeks to establish a new paradigm of computing where non-
volatile memory units are used pervasively to enhance reliability against power
source instability, energy-efficiency, and security. The non-volatile computing
devices are especially useful for embedded cyber-physical systems enabling long
running computations and data collection even with unreliable power sources. The
technologies developed from this project can also benefit conventional
architecture in its power optimization and internal security code generation.
The project is a close collaboration between computer architecture and CMOS
technology development groups, where all levels in the design hierarchy will be
visited for system and technology evaluation.

This project integrates its research efforts with education by developing an
undergraduate and Master curriculum that spans over the vertical design
hierarchy in microprocessors. This vertical education will better prepare future
work force in tackling tremendous design challenges spanning many layers of
microprocessors. The results from this project will be made widely available to
both industry and academia.
