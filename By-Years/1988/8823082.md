This research effort examines processes in ordered and disordered alloys that
result from the presence of hydrogen in solution. Hydrogen-induced disorder-
order transitions, lattice rearrangements, segregation, and enhanced metal atom
mobility are being studied in selected alloys. The conditions under which
hydrogen-induced metal mobility occurs are defined.
