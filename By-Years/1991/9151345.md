The goal of this project is to produce scientifically literate individuals
capable of recognizing, analyzing, and solving problems scientifically. This is
accomplished in part by training students in resource retrieval techniques that
allow them to access scientific literature for decision making. Computer
workstations capable of literature retrieval, data acquisition, statistical
analysis, graphics presentation, and report editing allow students to critically
analyze and logically present results from a variety of research projects, and
to integrate language, computer, and mathematical skills into each research
project.
