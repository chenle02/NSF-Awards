9702791 Andino The project will be conducted as part of the NSF CAREER Program.
The science plan is focused on two areas: 1) gas-phase studies (including
reaction kinetics and product determinations) of the hydroxyl radical reactions
with oxygenated organic compounds (e.g., saturated alcohols and ethers); and 2)
heterogeneous studies of the kinetics of the hydroxyl radical with four low
molecular weight hydrocarbons (methane, n-butane, n-nonane and tert-butyl
alcohol) in the presence of chloride, nitrate, or sulfate particles. This
research will utilize a glass-enclosed photochemical reaction chamber and a
combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for measurements of the
chemical reactants and products within the chamber. Complementary ab initio
calculations will be performed to identify likely reaction pathways. These gas-
phase and the heterogeneous studies will improve the accuracy of urban air
quality models by providing essential information about the photochemistry of
oxygen-containing organic compounds and the gas-particle effects on reaction
kinetics. For the educational plan, the investigator will improve teaching
methods for atmospheric chemistry by incorporating modeling activities within
the classroom setting. The environmental engineering courses the PI plans to
develop are centered on aspects of problem-solving including: understanding a
problem, describing its components, proposing a solution(s), and executing the
solution. In addition, the PI has outlined a recruitment program to attract and
retain underrepresented students in environmental science and engineering.
