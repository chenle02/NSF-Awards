The plant hormone auxin is required for many aspects of plant development.
Auxin appears to stimulate cell elongation and cell division in intact plants.
Auxin is thought to be essential for plant cell growth because it is absolutely
required for growth of plant cells in culture. Despite its importance, very
little is known about the mechanism of auxin action. This research proposes to
better determine the molecular details of how auxin regulates cellular events as
a basis for understanding auxin regulation of development at the level of the
whole plant. The focus of this research is Arabidopsis thaliana because it is
particularly well suited to both molecular and classical genetic studies. Genes
involved in auxin action will be identified from mutants which do not respond
normally to applied auxin. One of the mutants isolated in this way is called
auxin resistant 1 or axr1. Certain axr1 mutant plants have been characterized in
the PI's laboratory and the mutants display a number of defects which suggest
defective auxin responses. The AXR1 gene will be cloned and the nucleotide
sequence determined. Genetic studies have shown that the gene lies on chromosome
one, very close to a previously isolated fragment of DNA. This fragment of DNA
will be used to isolate the AXR1 gene using a technique called chromosome
walking. Once cloned, the gene will be introduced into axr1 mutant plants using
plant transformation procedures developed for Arabidopsis. Loss of auxin
resistance in the transformed plants will confirm that the AXR1 gene has been
correctly cloned. The DNA sequence of the AXR1 gene will be determined and used
to deduce the amino acid sequence of the gene product and will be compared with
the sequences of other previously isolated genes. The isolated gene will also
allow determination of which cells in the plant are making the AXR1 gene
product. The molecular characterization of the AXR1 gene should lead to
important new insights into the role of auxin in plant development.
