Dr. Seth N. Brown, Department of Chemistry, University of Notre Dame, is
supported by a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program. Trimetallic
complexes with coordinatively unsaturated titanium centers, each capable of
acing as a one-electron reductant, will be synthesized using a variety of
targeted ligands, possessing amine or hydroxyl moieties, as templates. The
ability of tri-titanium clusters to abstract atoms from small molecules, forming
capped-clusters, via reductive cleavage will be examined. Additionally, an
undergraduate experimental laboratory course will be designed and introduced
into the curriculum as a vehicle to teach students about model-building. The
goal of the course is to develop good experimental design skills in
undergraduates. The reduction of oxygen or nitrogen is a key step in the use of
these titanium-containing molecules by biological systems or in industrial
processes. The proposed studies will provide additional insight into topics
ranging from the biological production of ammonia to surface catalyzed
reactions. The education component of this project will examine new approaches
in undergraduate chemistry education.
