The 1200 kilometer Altyn Tagh fault (ATF) bounds the northern border of the
Tibetan Plateau and is one of the largest active strike slip faults in the
world. Its formation is thought to be associated with the continental collision
responsible for the formation of the Himalayan Mountains in the southern Tibetan
Plateau. As an active fault, understanding the ATF?s history and current
activity hold vast implications for infrastructural development and public
safety, especially given the rapid industrialization of the region. This project
seeks to understand the history of the ATF by quantifying the extent of the
fault in western China and determining phases and magnitudes of fault activity
since its formation ~30 million years ago; research will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr. Shaofeng Liu at the China University of Geosciences,
Beijing whose tectonic expertise and knowledge of regional geology will be
indispensable both in terms of field work and data synthesis.

In order to isolate and understand crustal deformational regimes associated with
the India-Eurasia collision this study seeks to quantify ATF slip history using
a combination of structural mapping, and paleomagnetic, geochronologic, and
thermochronologic sampling; structural mapping will be used to determine fault
extents and kinematics, paleomagnetic sampling will determine fault
displacement, and geochronologic and thermochronologic sampling will constrain
ages of formations and fault activity. This project will provide field data that
will determine whether or not the ATF represents a two stage evolution of the
India-Eurasia collision indicative of a focused, high displacement-rate early
history followed by a more distributed, low displacement-rate deformational
regime. Understanding how intraplate lithospheric deformation changes over time
during continent-continent collisions will lead to a more complete and nuanced
understanding of plate interactions. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research
of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese
Ministry of Science and Technology.
