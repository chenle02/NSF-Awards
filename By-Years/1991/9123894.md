Recent reports have identified the potential lack of qualified scientists and
technicians as a major concern in ensuring that basic ecological research can be
undertaken. This research is of primary importance in addressing current
environmental issues. Neither the scientific nor the policy-making communities
know the demographics of trained ecologists in the United States. There is no
document identifying the number of ecologists employed and their areas of
specialization. Educators, government agencies and research institutions need to
know what training is required for the next generation of scientists. The
Ecological Society of America, Public Affairs Office, will develop, publish, and
distribute a survey assessing the human resources in ecology. The objectives of
the study are to determine the pattern of graduate ecology degrees earned over
the past 30 years; determine ethnicity and gender composition of ecologists
(This information would be compared to the demographic composition of the work
force as a whole); catalog the nation's environmental science capabilities
according to problem area (eg. how many scientists are trained to study the
ecological complexity of global change); and analyze current employment patterns
of ecologists. The resulting human resource survey would provide direction to
ecologists, other scientists, federal and state agencies, educators, and
research institution in setting goals and designing programs over the next
decade.
