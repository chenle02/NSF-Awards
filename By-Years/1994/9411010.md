ABSTRACT R.E. Spall University of South Alabama CTS-9411010 This equipment
grant will assist in the purchase in of advanced post-processing capabilities
for fluid flow visualization. Several projects will be directly impacted
including: (1) numerical simulation of laminar and turbulent vortex breakdown;
(2) CFD simulation and analysis of turbulent, recirculating flows within
combustor type geometries; and, (3) three-dimensional boundary element analysis
of breaking water waves. The acquisition of this equipment is expected to have a
substantial impact upon the research infrastructure at the University.
