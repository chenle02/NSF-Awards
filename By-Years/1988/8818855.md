The research supported by this grant will utilize recent advances in technology
and orbital studies to perform the first systematic physical study of small
asteroids in the main belt. Such a study is critically needed to investigate the
source region for the population of near-Earth asteroids and the collisional
evolution processes within the asteroid belt. The observations, using telescopes
at the McGraw-Hill Observatory and the Lowell Observatory, will reveal the
rotation rates, shapes, basic compositions, and surface properties of
approximately 30 small main belt asteroids. Knowledge of the rotation rates and
shapes of these objects will provide strong constraints for asteroid collisional
evolution models.
