The principal mission of this research program is the continued focus on the
discovery and development of new stereoselective organic reactions. Specific
areas include the development of new methods for the generation of metal
enolates (especially under mild conditions), the exploration of new
stereoselective reactions of chiral enolates, and the development of new aldol
reaction concepts. In complementary studies, the focus is on the develpoment of
a new family of chiral bidentate ligands and the evaluation of their utility in
a selection of important catalyzed asymmetric processes. Such processes include
metal carbene transfer to olefins and dialkylsulfides and enantioselective aldol
addition and acylation reactions proceeding through metal enolates and
metalloenamines. In all such reactions where stereochemical information is
relayed, either from catalyst or one of the reaction constituents in the
creation of new stereogenic centers, a serious effort is expended to understand
the fundamental stereochemical control features of the process under study. %%%
With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division will
support the research of Dr. David A. Evans of the Department of Chemistry at
Harvard University. The research is in the general area of synthetic methodolgy
and is focussed on the discovery and development of new stereoselective organic
reactions. Chemical synthesis provides the capacity to produce new organic
architecture, and chemical reactions are the irreplaceable tools of those
engaged in this discovery process. Consequently, the synthesis activity is a
critical discipline which continues to have important impact upon the fields of
medicine, biology, and materials science. The research in this award is at the
forefront of that activity by developing controlled procedures for the
preparation of chiral molecules by both stoichiometric and catalytic processes.
