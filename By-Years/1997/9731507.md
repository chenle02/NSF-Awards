The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to determine the algebraic
structure of solutions of differential and difference equations. In particular,
the project seeks to find a complete efficient algorithm to compute the Galois
groups of differential equation and specific algorithms to compute properties of
the equations as reflected in these groups (e.g., solvability in finite terms
and solvability in terms of lower order equations). Refined criteria will be
sought that will allow one to construct differential equations with a specified
Galois group and extend the existing solution for connected linear algebraic
groups to arbitrary linear algebraic groups. The recently developed Galois
theory of difference equations will be applied to similar problems for these
equations as well. In particular, effective algorithms will be developed to
determine if difference equations can be solved in finite terms, greatly
generalizing the work of Petkovsek, Wilf, and Zeilberger. Furthermore,
algorithms will be developed to determine the Galois groups of such an equation,
and a constructive solution of the inverse problem for these equations will be
obtained.
