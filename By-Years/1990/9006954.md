The principal investigator will study conformal moduli and the energy of
incompressible flows, and the relationship between circle packings and the
geometry of Riemann surfaces. The first project involves an investigation into
how knot types of field lines restrict arbitrary decreases in the energy. The
second project will be a continuation of earlier work on the convergence of
derivatives for hexagonal packing schemes. The principal investigator will carry
out two projects in the area of geometric complex analysis. The first involves a
study of the behavior of fluid flow. In particular, he will analyze the manner
in which a flow loses energy or slows down when flow lines are knotted. The
second project involves the relationship between how a circle can be packed with
smaller circles, and aspects of conformal complex analysis.
