The Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, with the assistance of regional schools,
has designed a program to help teachers and students to understand the way in
which high performance computing is used by scientists and mathematicians and to
strengthen student interest in both science and in the use of computers. A major
goal of the project is to help to attract students to careers in the
computational sciences. Student-teacher teams will design supercomputer oriented
science or mathematics projects and will compete for places in a summer program
designed to enhance computer skills and to implement the projects. After the
summer sessions, teachers will interact with other teachers at their home sites
to disseminate information and techniques and to integrate the project work into
the school curriculum. Intensive networking between the teachers, students,
sites, and the Supercomputer Center will follow up during the school year. Cost
sharing of $235,00 per year for two years amounts to 85% of the amount requested
from NSF.
