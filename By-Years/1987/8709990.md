This is an exciting project because it tackles fundamental and extremely
difficult problems in economic theory. General equilibrium analysis uses the
classic Arrow-Debreu framework with complete contingent markets. The
contribution of this project comes from developing a more general model with
real and financial markets in which the structure of markets is incomplete. The
degree of incompleteness is not assumed, as it has been in past work, but
determined as part of the equilibrium. Preliminary research has already yielded
some surprising results. For example, a competitive stock market is shown to be
an inefficient mechanism for allocating investment over time. The project
derives other results about the welfare properties of different market
institutions with exchange and production.
