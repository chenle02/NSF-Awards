This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium 2015" that will be held from May 26-30,
2015, on the campus of Purdue University.

This conference is the thirty-fifth installment of the Great Plains Operator
Theory Symposium (GPOTS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group
of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator theory or
operator algebras. The main foci of the 2015 event are the following:
classification of C*-algebras; von Neumann algebras; recent advances in operator
theory; noncommutative geometry; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The
conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs,
and other young scientists to present their work.
