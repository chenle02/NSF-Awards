Pleistocene caldera-forming silicic volcanism active resurgent domes, extremely
high heat flow large earthquakes and unprecedented crustal uplift of 1 m between
1923 and 1975 followed by a reversal to rapid subsidence are properties which
reflect the kinematics and dynamics of the Yellowstone volcanic field--now the
active element of the Yellowstone hotshot. From GPS and gravity observations in
Yellowstone in 1987, 1989 and 1991, a large area (100 km x 50 km) of the
Yellowstone caldera has experienced more than 70 mm of caldera-wide subsidence
which reflects magmatic or hydrothermal fluid migration. This project will
verify this unprecedented deformation and turn attention to the larger-scale
picture of the Yellowstone hotshot within a global framework.
