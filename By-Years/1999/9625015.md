Glenn Martyna is supported by a Faculty Early Career Development Award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to study the microscopic aspects
of chemical reactions in the condensed phase using theoretical methods and high
speed computers. The goal of this research is to exploit and test these modern
computational modeling methods on large systems and to compare the results with
experiment. Reactions in many different environments ranging from surface
confined geometries to bulk solution will be studied. In particular, problems in
electron solvation, chemical reactions in solution, and the structure and
function of zeolites will be studied. The education plan will incorporate
portions of Martyna's research as a supplement to both a first semester graduate
Statistical Mechanics course and a first semester undergraduate General
Chemistry course. In both cases, the visual microscopic nature of the computer
simulations will be used to complement the standard curriculum and increase the
student's interest in chemistry. It will soon become possible to study chemical
reactions in the condensed phase on a microscopic level using modern theoretical
techniques and high speed computers. Reactivity will be examined in many
different environments including surfaces, bulk solvent, in confined geometries
such as found in zeolites, and in clusters. Simulations of the type being
employed by Martyna will ultimately lead to many improvements in the development
and manufacturing of new chemical materials.
