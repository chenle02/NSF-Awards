Montgomery County Community College has upgraded its Environmental Technology
curriculum and is producing a higher caliber technician and is providing
continuing education that is resulting in new careers in the technologies for a
growing unemployed work force. Our program has been developed using DACUM from
the merging of ideas and experiences of engineers, educators, and technicians in
the field. The goal of the curriculum is to give the students a fundamental
background in general environmental theory and application of this theory in
field and laboratory exercises and analysis. The curriculum emphasizes good
field and laboratory techniques, computer-aided data analysis, and both written
and oral communication of results. Equipment has been purchased for the field
and laboratory courses which are designed to reinforce the environmental
principles presented in the lectures. This equipment includes computers,
software and peripherals for performing data analysis and presentation.
