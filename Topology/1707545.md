This project concerns the investigation of problems in noncommutative geometry.
The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study geometry using noncommutative
algebras, which are mathematical objects that have operations of addition and
multiplication; however, the multiplication may not be commutative: xy does not
have to equal yx. The purpose of the project is to investigate a set of
mathematical problems motivated by physics. More specifically, the motivation
derives from a combination of ideas from quantum mechanics, string theory, and
classical areas of mathematics such as algebra and geometry. The
interdisciplinary nature of the research promotes further interaction between
these fields. The project provides excellent opportunities for the investigator
to work with young scientists and to exchange ideas with colleagues from other
countries to promote scientific collaborations.

In noncommutative geometry, one studies geometry via algebras of functions on
noncommutative manifolds. On such a noncommutative manifold, the relevant
objects are no longer points in a space, but rather a noncommutative associative
algebra, or a differential graded commutative algebra. An important class of
noncommutative manifolds can be obtained as deformations of commutative
algebras. The theory of deformation quantization lies on the boundary between
classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories
are very different. Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction
of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative
algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. This
project will focus on the study of homotopy algebra structures in noncommutative
geometry using tools from deformation quantization and Lie groupoid and Lie
algebroid theory. The problems include exploring the Duflo and Todd type class,
establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem, and studying Tsygan noncommutative
calculi in a general framework in terms of Lie algebroids.
