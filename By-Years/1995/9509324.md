9509324 BIELER This award will support collection of DNA sequence data from
representative members of "lower heterobranch gastropod (Mollusca: Gastropoda)
lineages. These molecular data will be combined with data, some previously
collected, from morphological studies involving internal anatomy,
ultrastructural features revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
histological information, as well as external and shell characteristics. These
organisms include several "primitive" groups for which the relationships remain
unresolved. Elucidation of their relationships will also shed light on the
origins of slugs and land snails. The relationships revealed will be of use in
trying to understand the fossil record of these animals. This study will
contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity of an amazing phylum of
invertebrate animals. Many of the members are marine, but others have made
transitions to life on land and in fresh water. Collectively, gastropods or
snails, slugs and their relatives are of much importance to human life, as some
are an important food source and others harbor parasites of both humans and
domestic animals.
