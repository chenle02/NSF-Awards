9512741 Doering This project concerns basic research in theoretical and
mathematical physics. The topics of interest include complex dynamic phenomena
in many-degree-of-freedom nonlinear deterministic systems and few-degree-of-
freedom nonlinear stochastic problems. The primary focus of these studies are
the theoretical challenges presented by (1) turbulence in fluid systems
described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and (2) nonequilibrium
steady states in mesoscopic physics and molecular biology. The modes of
investigation include modern applied mathematics and numerical methods. ***
