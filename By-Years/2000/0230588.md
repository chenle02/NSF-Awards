Abstract

BEST: Bridging Engineering and Science Teaching

The goal of this project is to improve the education of Education and
Engineering students, while simultaneously engaging Engineering and Education
faculty in a collaboration that employs the best available pedagogy. The project
will develop lower level engineering courses that utilize the strengths of both
faculties. The result of this collaboration will be engineering courses that are
more attractive to a diverse range of students and the development of high
school teachers who appreciate engineering design and encourage their students
to explore applied science design issues and careers.

With this planning grant, an inquiry-based pilot course in structural design
will be used to explore the role of an Engineering-Education collaboration in
improving engineering education. A second-year course, ioIntroduction to
Structural Designlr, will be planned and taught. It will be accessible for
Secondary Education majors while maintaining the necessary technical content for
Engineering students. The course will provide the rudiments of structural design
for Education majors and lower-level Engineering students. Students completing
the course will participate in jointly taught coursework, will learn both
technical content and educational methods, and will be prepared for higher-level
coursework within their major. The collaborators will develop a general
methodology for team-teaching of modified engineering content that can be
employed throughout the curriculum in a series of courses to provide content for
Education students. If the first course is successful, a detailed plan for
further collaboration including other collaborative courses, possibly involving
local engineering projects, will be developed.
