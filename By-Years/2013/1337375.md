Information technology is now a major catalyst for innovation across all aspects
of human endeavor. Hence, it is vital to maintain the exponential performance
growth of computing devices that has been the key enabler for information
technology advances for more than four decades. In the past, semiconductor
technology provided us with increasing transistor densities and decreasing power
supplies, allowing us to improve performance without increasing energy
consumption. However, the lack of power supply scaling in current and future
technologies has made all computing systems energy limited. Improving energy
efficiency is a defining challenge and the prerequisite to increasing the
capabilities of all computing systems, from smartphones to warehouse-scale data-
centers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to enable cost-
effective customized computing by bridging the gap between high-level
application development and the design of specialized hardware for energy
efficient computing. Specialization is the prevailing approach for energy
efficient computing, as customized units can eliminate the energy overheads of
general-purpose cores. However, the complexity of designing and
managing customized hardware is currently limiting the benefits from
specialization to high-volume, slowly evolving applications. We will create
domain specific synthesis tools that, given an application written in an easy-
to-use, domain-specific programming language, will generate domain
or application specific hardware: compute units and memory systems. The core of
our approach to domain specific synthesis is a combination of domain specific
languages to capture high-level application information, domain-
specific optimization, parallelism and locality optimization, and hardware
generation from parallelism and locality patterns.
