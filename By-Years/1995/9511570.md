The goal of the research is to understand the behavior of excited state atoms in
electromagnetic fields. Stark and Floquet spectroscopy are employed to measure
atomic polarizabilities and atomic hyperpolarizabilities and a program measuring
the photoionization cross section of two electron atoms has recently begun using
funds from an NSF ARI grant.
