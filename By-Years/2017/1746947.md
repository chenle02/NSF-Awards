The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the restoration of trust in computing
systems. Successful cyberattacks, including mass privacy breaches and the
discovery of device backdoors, have shaken trust in computing, put users at
risk, hurt the economy, and even threatened our national security. The usual set
of ad-hoc, incomplete, and costly approaches simply have not addressed the
problem. This research effort will advance a viable, practical, and holistic
solution that gives users much stronger guarantees of security while lowering
the costs of keeping systems secure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop TigerGuard, a computer
system security architecture that contains the effects of cyberattacks on
existing computer infrastructure. TrustGuard is based on a small, separately
manufactured, and easy-to-verify hardware element, called the Sentry, that
serves as the root of trust. The Sentry is a general-purpose hardware trust
component that, when combined with an application-specific Dynamic Specification
Check (DSC) software component, provides flexible containment capabilities. The
containment guarantees of TigerGuard hold despite design and manufacturing flaws
(known and not-yet-known, malicious and unintentional) in the operating system,
firmware, hardware, and software, including those in the application software
itself. Formal verification of both the Sentry and DSC, a practical effort given
their total size of only a few thousand lines of code, becomes equivalent in
security guarantees to proving hundreds of millions of existing lines of code
correct (including the processor design, memory implementation, hard drive
firmware, the operating system, shared libraries, and the application code).
