9628415 Crippens This project creates and implements a national parent
engagement and education campaign. It provides a framework for all parents to
explore existing and alternative forms of assessment within the context of
changes in current classroom math curriculum and practices. The campaign also
provides a mechanism for enhancing communication between teachers, schools and
parents in order to ensure support for math strategies and practices by all
members of learning communities nationwide. Project products include: * A
thirty-minute documentary on mathematics reform and assessment, to be broadcast
by public television stations, that will also include a viewer's guide and local
publicity materials. * A Community Education Kit containing a Leader's Guide,
Parent's Handbook, and short videotapes. Project materials and activities are
designed for parents of elementary-age children, with a specific emphasis for
materials on grades 3-5.
