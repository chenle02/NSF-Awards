This grant supports the research of W. McCallum and D. Ulmer to work in
arithmetic geometry. Professor McCallum will study descent on Fermat's curve.
Professor Ulmer will study the p-adic valuations of coefficients of modular
forms as well as the Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves. This project falls into
the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest
areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
