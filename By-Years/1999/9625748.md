Design, dimensioning and control of high-speed telecommunication networks
requires a thorough understanding of traffic characteristics of various types of
communication services and the ability to use these characteristics for
performance assessment. Teletraffic modeling techniques existing in the
literature either lead to very large-scale structured Markov chain solution
problems for which available algorithmic approaches suffer from huge CPU time
requirements, or to models for which, at this time, there are no pratically
analytical results for queuing analysis. The PIs do teletraffic modeling
consisting of simple, general and systematic algorithms to model building based
on D-BMAP's (discrete-time Batch Markovian Arrival Process). The modeling
process is desired to capture the first and second order statistics of the
original traffic streams that are known to play the dominant role in teletraffic
performance. Moreover, the PIs propose parallel algorithms for modeling as an
alternative to techniques based on serial procedures for large-scale nonlinear
optimization problems. Such traffic models when fed into single server queues
can be analyzed by the paradigm of M/G/1 or G/M/1 type Markov chains. They
propose to use matrix sign function based algorithms for the associated
invariant subspace computation . These algorithms have high convergence rates
(unlike the linear convergence rates of existing algorithms), they are amenable
to parallelization and, therefore, it is now possible to efficiently analyze
moderately sized M/G/1 and G/M/1 type Markov chains.
