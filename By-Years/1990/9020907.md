This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Diffusivity of Gases through
Aseptic Food Packaging Materials and Seals" at North Carolina Agricultural and
Technical State University in support of North Carolina State Univesity's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Aseptic Processing and
Packaging. This two year project is reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory
Board. The research is studying the effective diffusivity of gases through media
used in the packaging and sealing of foods. The researchers are competent and
have the facilities to perform the research. The Program Manager recommends
North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University be awarded $100,000
for two (2) years.
