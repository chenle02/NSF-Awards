The study of symmetry is frequently useful in mathematics and its applications.
Consideration of the symmetries of a system can yield insight into the behavior
of related mathematical objects. This project seeks to answer the following
question about certain highly symmetric objects: to what extent can they be
distinguished from each other simply by examining them locally? The symmetries
of such objects themselves form a geometric space, and the investigators aim to
understand how the behavior of that space governs the answer to this overarching
question. In particular, the project will explore whether symmetric spaces can
be completely distinguished in the situation when any two symmetries can be
connected by a line. Graduate students supported by the award will receive
training to contribute towards the research, and the investigators will host a
yearly event to encourage undergraduates from underrepresented groups to apply
to mathematics Ph.D. programs.

More precisely, the investigators study linear algebraic groups and their
torsors, over function fields that are defined over a complete discretely valued
field. They will study the relationships among three properties of a given
linear algebraic group: whether the group satisfies the local-global principle
for torsors, whether the group is R-trivial, and whether the group satisfies the
weak approximation property. Implications among these properties have been shown
in the case of groups over number fields, and this project aims to carry over
those implications to groups over the function fields under consideration. Other
goals include describing and bounding the obstruction to a local-global
principle in terms of geometry and extending local-global principles to higher
dimensions in order to obtain results about Brauer groups.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
