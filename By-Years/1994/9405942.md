9405942 Prothero PI will undertake paleomagnetic studies in Miocene strata (age
range 8-18 Ma) bearing diverse and important mammalian fossil faunas and datable
volcanic rocks. Goals are to tie this sequence to the magnetic polarity time
scale and to examine evidence for, and timing of, tectonic rotation.
