Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are an excellent cosmological probe, and
observations of SNe Ia are particularly good at constraining the current cosmic
expansion rate and the nature of dark energy. This project will address the
following questions: What is the expansion history of the Universe and what is
driving the accelerated expansion? Is "dark energy" a cosmological constant,
something more exotic, or do we need to re-evaluate our model of gravity? Is the
"tension" between local and distant measurements of the Hubble constant caused
by systematic errors, or does it point to new physics? As part of this research,
training will be provided to several graduate students and 12 community-college
students in observational techniques. Outreach will be undertaken through public
lectures and the press, and the principle investigator will work with
underrepresented students to transition from two-year colleges to four-year
programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will perform two low-redshift SNe Ia
surveys to (1) reduce the largest source of systematic uncertainty in SN
cosmology, the photometric calibration of the low-redshift SN sample, (2)
further reduce other systematics related to dust reddening and SN physics, (3)
cross-calibrate two of the world's best photometric systems on which 1250
cosmologically useful low-redshift SNe Ia will be observed, (4) produce the
first sample of SNe Ia ranging from 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 observed with a single
telescopic system, (5) obtain spectra of hundreds of SNe Ia, (6) examine
potential distance improvements using spectral data, and (7) produce the
tightest constraints on the nature of dark energy and current expansion rate of
the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
