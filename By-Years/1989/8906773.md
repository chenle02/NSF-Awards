TITLE: U.S..China Cooperative Research (Engineering): Design of Manufacturing
Information Systems Abstract Narrative: This is a two.year collaborative
research project between Timothy Thomasma, University of Michigan.Dearborn, and
Chen Yueqing, Hefei Polytechnic University, Anhui, China. This project will
produce a methodology for designing manufacturing information handling systems
that is well supported by computer.based tools and empirically tested in
experiments performed in >manufacturing organizations. The experiments will be
carried out in Chinese factories, under the direction of the PI and Chen Yueqing
and her colleagues at Hefei Polytechnic University, which is the major
engineering school in Anhui province. This project is sponsored by the National
Science Foundation and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and
the Chinese State Education Commission.
