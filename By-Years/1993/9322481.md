This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
research on charge transfer reactions by Dr. D. Paul Rillema of the Chemistry
Department, University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Complexes, primarily of
rhenium, containing light harvesting chromophores will be synthesized.
Photoexcitation of the chromophore promotes electron transfer between electron
donor and acceptor groups covalently attached to it. The work will yield
fundamental information on the quenching of photogenerated excited states, and
is relevant to solar energy conversion. This is a Research at Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) award and the research will be conducted by undergraduate
students.
