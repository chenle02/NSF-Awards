The goal of this project is to advance the development of compact, next-
generation light sources and other laser-based accelerators. Laser-plasma
acceleration is a key enabling technology for a new generation of compact
particle and radiation sources, but the existing theoretical understanding of
the processes governing electron beam formation in such accelerators is
incomplete. Further advances require development of computational tools with
high physical fidelity, which is the expected outcome of this project. The
project will aid in workforce development at all levels by providing training in
the basic physics underlying advanced accelerator technologies. The research is
expected to benefit society as a whole primarily through advancement of
accelerator technologies based on plasma physics. Knowledge gained in this
project will aid the effort to realize the technological promise of various
laser-plasma accelerators with a wide range of applications from high-energy
physics, astrophysics, and nuclear science to medicine, biology, and
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the development of
improved numerical models suitable for understanding the physics of electron
beam formation and evolution in a large class of laser-plasma accelerators. This
includes the development of a new two-dimensional Eulerian Vlasov-Maxwell
simulation code. Comparisons of results from the new Vlasov-Maxwell solver and
predictions of various particle methods will be used to identify regions of
validity of the particle methods and to determine the key physical processes
involved in electron beam formation and the origins of dark current in laser-
plasma accelerators. The project will focus on studying electron beam formation
in the bubble (or blow-out) regime. The results of this study will also inform
the development of high-fidelity three-dimensional computational tools suitable
for designing both near-term experiments and future facilities.
