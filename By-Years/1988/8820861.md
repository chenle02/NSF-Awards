During development neuroblasts acquire a spectrum of ion channels that gives
each type of neuron its special electrophysiological characteristics.
Developmental signals combine with genetic programs to specify ion channel
types, number, and cell-surface distribution. For some classes of neurons an
important developmental signal is the polypeptide Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a
trophic agent for developing sympathetic neurons. The general aim is to use
patch clamp techniques and microinjection of DNA and proteins to test the ion
channels through phosphorylation pathways such as those involving cAMP, GTP-
binding proteins, or phosphoinositide breakdown products. Using the PC-12
neuronal cell line in tissue culture, The investigators will compare NGF effects
with those caused by artificially enhanced phosphorylation activity to determine
whether they share common biochemical pathways. The specific objectives are: (1)
to determine at the single channel level changes that occur in Na channels and
several classes of voltage-sensitive Ca and K channel after NGF treatment and
after introduction of phosphorylation-enhancing agents, phosphorylation blocking
agents, or agents that promote phosphoinositide breakdown or stimulate
phospholipase A2;j (2) to study the biophysical properties, pharmacology, and
metabolic regulation of ion channels in the growth cone of developing neurites;
and (3) to identify any characteristics of these ion channels, such as their
distribution or metabolic regulation, that might give growth cones their unique
behavior. The long-term goal is to gain information about the process underlying
the selection, distribution, and metabolic regulation of ion channels in
developing neurons. This information will likely contribute to our understanding
of the molecular mechanisms underlying nervous system behavior, both in health
and disease.
