This project will continue studies by Dr. Holger Jannasch and his colleagues on
microbes and microbial processes at a hydrothermal vent site in the Guaymas
Basin. Specific objectives include: 1. quantification of productivity of mat
forming bacteria of the genus, Beggiatoa, per unit of occupied area and per unit
of bacterial biomass; 2. use of mat material to isolate organisms; 3. molecular
studies with gene probes and gene sequencing of mat organisms; 4. quantification
and distribution of high temperature requiring bacteria; 5. studies of survival
and dispersal of vent organisms; 6. phylogenetic characterization of the natural
microbial populations by molecular probes and various genetic studies on the mat
organisms. The project will further extend our understanding of the interesting
and unique microbiota of hydrothermal vents.
