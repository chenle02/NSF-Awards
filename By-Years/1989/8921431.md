This is a proposal to conduct a sequence of experimental tests of a theory of
power use in exchange networks. The work is path- breaking in that it begins to
develop a theoretical understanding of the use of punishment power. Current
sociological theories of exchange and power conceptualize the importance of
rewards, either omitting the effects of punishments or treating punishment
solely as an impetus to leave the field. For situations where that option is
impossible, theory is silent on the scope of its effects and conditions which
modify punishment's effectiveness. Previous experiments have shown reward and
punishment power are used under different conditions and have different effects,
thus supporting the broad outlines of the theoretical extension proposed.
Experiments will be conducted testing a theory which predicts that the two types
will be used depending upon the perceived risk of use and the perceived equity
of their effects.
