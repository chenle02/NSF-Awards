ABSTRACT SEYBERT 9714429 This Research Opportunity Award (ROA) funds research at
an Undergraduate Institution/Research at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution
(RUI/PUI) project entitled " Acoustic Emission in Air Conditioning and
Refrigeration Systems. The research is to be performed collaboratively at the
University of Kentucky and the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) for Air Conditioning and Refrigeration at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign. The project will study the 1.) the major sources and
characteristics of acoustic emissions in cooling systems, 2.) modeling and
analysis techniques for these emissions and 3.) control strategies and
sensor/actuator configurations for active noise control. The project is being
cost shared by Dr. R. Anderson, EpSCOR Program.
