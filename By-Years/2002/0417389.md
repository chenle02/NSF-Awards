This project will combine a quantitative analysis of confidential data obtained
from the EEOC on complaints filed with the agency from 1990 to 2002, a
quantitative analysis of a large random sample of discrimination filings in
federal courts from 1988 to 2003, interviews with discrimination litigators and
other informants about trends in the field;, and qualitative analyses of a
subset of federal case filings that will include in-depth interviews with
parties and lawyers and analyses of case file documents. This combination of
quantitative and qualitative analysis, undertaken by an interdisciplinary team
of lawyer-economists and lawyer-sociologists, will expand the basic
understanding of changes in employment discrimination litigation and address
theoretical issues in law and economics and the sociology of law. The research
will endeavor to predict the transition from an EEOC complaint to a federal
lawsuit, a significant innovation in empirical studies of the selection of
disputes for litigation. The collection of data over time will also permit an
investigation of the relative effects of significant changes in law, the
business cycle, and the presence of protected groups in the workplace on the
nature of lawsuits filed and their characteristic outcome. The research will
test whether changes in legal culture and in the incentives offered to
plaintiffs now matter more than the business cycle in explaining trends in
litigation. In-depth interviews with parties and lawyers will cast light on the
rights consciousness of contemporary discrimination plaintiffs and revisit
important questions about the circumstances under which perceived victims of
discrimination will turn to law, as well as how defendants regard and respond to
claims of discrimination. Finally, the research will examine the role of lawyers
in discrimination litigation, and consider how the strategies of lawyers have
shaped developments in the field. In addressing these questions the research
will yield a more thorough understanding of how discrimination litigation works,
what it means to the parties and professionals involved with it, and the factors
producing change in the system.
