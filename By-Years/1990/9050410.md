This award provides funds to The Reis Biological Station of St. Louis University
to acquire equipment for the development of a quantitative-based field course in
aquatic biology. The equipment to be purchased includes an aluminum jon boat,
water sampling equipment, plankton sampling equipment, dissolved oxygen meter,
portable oxygen meter, portable water analysis kit, current velocity meter,
stereozoom and compound microscopes, and a color video system for the dissecting
and compound microscopes. This equipment will be used to interrelate the
physical and chemical characteristic of various Ozark aquatic habitats with
their respective biological communities. In addition to the 75 aquatic ecology
students to be served over a five-year period, the equipment will also be used
by other classes utilizing the Reis Biological Station. Thus, the equipment will
impact on approximately 675 students over the next five years. The grantee is
matching this award with non-Federal sources.
