The present proposal is for the continuing and partial support of the U.S. STEP
Coordination Office (USSCO). This office was established late in 1990 and has as
its fundamental objective to assist the U.S. science community in meeting STEP
science objectives. The U.S. components of STEP include the facilities and
projects of NSF, NOAA, NASA, and USAF. These components consist of spacecraft,
ground-based, rocket, balloon, and theory and simulation programs capable, in
the collective sense, of studying the complete set of coupling mechanisms that
are responsible for the transfer of energy and mass from one region of the
solar-terrestrial system to another: GEM, CEDAR, ISTP/GGS, UARS, CRRES, ISY,
MAX91, GOES (and associated data available on SELVAX), and suborbital programs.
The USSCO interacts with these and other domestic programs and with those
responsible for accomplishing the detailed international science objectives of
STEP for the purposes of: coordinating joint compaigns for data acquisition and
data analysis which meet national and international science objectives;
collecting and disseminating STEP-related information; and, organizing
professional society meetings and special sessions. The activities of the USSCO
are significant in that they enhance and expedite the scientific process within
the STEP context by identifying and implementing opportunities for synergistic
endeavor.
