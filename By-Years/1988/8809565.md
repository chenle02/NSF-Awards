This Research Planning Grant under the Research Opportunities for Women
initiative is in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program. The funds provided will allow Dr. Maureen J. Kendrick of the University
of Alabama to plan a research project in which the active sites of molybdenum
containing enzymes would be modelled. Preliminary data will be obtained on the
synthesis and characterization of a series of molybdo- and tungsten-pterin
mononuclear complexes as synthetic analogs of molybdo-pterin sites in
molybdoenzymes. The planning activities will include an extensive literature
search and consultation with an experienced organic chemist in the area of
heterocyclic chemistry, as well as a study of the synthesis, solubility,
stability and other chemical properties of the modified pterin ligands.
