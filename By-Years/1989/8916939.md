This award provides one-half of the funds required for the purchase of six
receivers and site packages for use in Global Positioning System (GPS)
satellite-based geodesy. The instruments will become the property of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography (SIO) of the University of California, said
institution being committed to provide the remaining necessary funds for their
acquisition. The new GPS receivers will be deployed in a field campaign to
monitor crustal deformation in central and southern California. SIO is a member
of the University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO), and the use of the receivers will
be shared between SIO and UNAVCO according to the terms of a Memorandum of
Understanding signed by SIO, UNAVCO and NSF.
