9314225 Franceschi This award will provide travel support over the next three
years to enable Dr. Vincent Franceschi of Washington State University to make
yearly visits to conduct cooperative research with Dr. John W. Patrick at the
University of Newcastle in Australia. The research will focus on the mechanism
of sucrose unloading in developing seeds. To understand how unloading is
regulated, it is necessary to analyze each step at the cellular and subcellular
level, and is best accomplished through a histochemical approach. Specialized
cells called transfer cells appear to contain the biochemical mechanisms
necessary for controlling sucrose unloading. Antibody and cDNA probes will be
used to further characterize the transfer cells. This project will bring
together the physiological expertise of Dr. Patrick with the molecular probes
and techniques which have been developed by Dr. Franceschi. Since crop yield is
strongly affected by the rate and pattern of import into storage regions of a
plant, and unloading is central to import, this research could have significant
practical importance in agriculture.
