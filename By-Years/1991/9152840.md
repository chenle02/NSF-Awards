A laboratory based on "Networked Engineering Workstations" is being developed to
provide an environment which encourages students to focus on concepts and
material, equipment which actively assists in learning, and which eliminates
computational impediments in the laboratory. This environment provides an
opportunity to learn practical and theoretical control, instrumentation and data
collection/analysis by providing computer (Dell 386SX) based instruments
(IEEE-488 oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers and microprogrammer emulators). In
this environment students write to learn, integrate theory and practice at a
high level using software packages (Lotus spreadsheet, Matlab). They implement
complex designs in signal processing, control systems, electronics, linear
systems and instrumentation courses using the control system simulation and
design package (Tutsim).The equipment is used throughout the Electrical
Engineering curriculum, and throughout Bucknell in all courses offered in
control systems, instrumentation, and courses in digital design and introductory
engineering.
