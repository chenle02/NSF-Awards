9502221 Davisson This award renews NSF support of the Mouse Mutant Stocks
Center (MMSC) at The Jackson Laboratory, an internationally renowned center for
genetic studies of the laboratory mouse. The mouse is the primary experimental
system for study of a variety of aspects of mammalian genetics and development.
The MMSC has two missions: 1) to maintain and distribute strains of mutant mice
and information about the strains to the scientific community, and 2) discover
and characterize new spontaneous mutations in the mouse. Approximately 950
spontaneous mutations have been detected in the mouse; of these, 121 mutations
are represented by the stocks maintained by the MMSC. In addition, the large
breeding colonies of genetically well-characterized mice maintained at The
Jackson Laboratory are a particularly convenient and inexpensive source of new
spontaneous mutations. Each year, the NSF support for this collection benefits a
large number of academic, non-profit, government and industrial researchers who
request with known or newly detected mutations. ***
