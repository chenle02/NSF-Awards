The 10th ACM conference on Information-Centric Networking (ICN 2023) takes place
in Reykjavik, Iceland from October 8 to October 10, 2023. For more than a
decade, ACM ICN has been the primary venue for the community to publish their
research endeavors in Information-Centric Networking. This award provides
funding to help 8-10 US-based graduate students attend the ICN conference.
Participation in conferences such as ICN forms a central part of the graduate
school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to present their
ongoing research and receive early feedback and interact with senior researchers
from academia and industry, which exposes them to cutting edge research in the
field. This year, the ACM ICN conference will be held in the same location and
adjacent in time with the 31st IEEE International Conference on Network
Protocols (ICNP 2023) â€” October 10 to October 13 in Reykjavik, Iceland. This
concurrent arrangement provides a valuable opportunity for the exchange and
enrichment of ICN ideas and advancements within the larger networking community.
To foster collaboration, the conference organizers are planning special events
designed to attract attendees to both conferences. The support requested in this
proposal will enable students to attend the main conference and potentially the
ICNP 2023.

Participating students will have invaluable opportunities to receive
constructive feedback on their research projects, witness high-quality
presentations, and engage with senior researchers in the community. Student
participation is expected to have a positive impact on the quality of their
research, while also enabling them to gain insights into emerging research
advancements with potential implications for the broader fields of networking
and security. Moreover, this experience will facilitate the expansion of their
breadth of knowledge, ideas, and research skills.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
