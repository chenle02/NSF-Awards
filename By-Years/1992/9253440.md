Dartmouth College is implementing and testing certain strategies and activities
to increase the number of women science majors and encourage them to pursue
scientific careers. The target population is freshman women. Ninety internships
are being carried out by first-year women in the natural sciences, mathematics,
and engineering. This provides (1) an opportunity to work one-on-one with a
science faculty member who can serve as a present and future mentor and role
model; (2) "hands-on" laboratory work and first-hand experience with scientific
inquiry; (3) an important scientific experience complementary to introductory
science classes; (4) an experience which de-mystifies and de- mythologizes
science; and (5) stipends to ensure the full participation of economically
disadvantaged students.
