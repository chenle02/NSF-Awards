In order for robots to collaborate efficiently and effectively with humans, the
human perception of their movement must be considered in motion creation.
Because a human collaborator will interpret the movements of a robot (even
subconsciously), robot motion synthesis algorithms that do not consider the
human observer may create motions that are perceived incorrectly, interpreted
negatively (e.g. as being angry or threatening), or at least miss out on the
opportunity to use this subtle communication channel effectively. The key idea
of this project is to develop an understanding of human perception of movement
that can be applied to the development of robot trajectory planning and control
algorithms. The team will use human subjects experiments to understand and
evaluate the interpretation of movements and apply these findings in robotics
and motion synthesis. The research plan interleaves empirical studies of how
people interpret motions, algorithm development to create methods that generate
robot motions in a controllable manner, and contextualized deployments that
allow the PIs to evaluate the success of the methods. The success of the project
will provide a deeper understanding of how people interpret movements, new
algorithms for synthesizing robot movements, and demonstrations of the potential
applications of collaborative robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
Perceptually inspired robot motion synthesis algorithms will enable robots to
collaborate more effectively with people. It will enable more communicative
robots that can serve as teachers and guides; more approachable and acceptable
robots that can work in domestic situations such as elder care; more cooperative
robots that can work as assistants to workers; and easier to instruct robots
that can be trained by non-experts. This project will enhance the education and
outreach efforts of hte PIs by connecting empirical human studies to the
technical challenges of robot trajectory planning.
