9353978 Smardon The Great Lakes Research Consortium proposes to immerse 20
undergraduate faculty in a 3-week summer practicum that demonstrates
environmental problem-solving as an effective teaching strategy to stimulate
undergraduates' interest in environmental science. This model has proven to be
effective during a summer practicum for undergraduate environmental science
teachers of two and four year colleges who, as a result of the practicum,
successfully incorporated environmental problem solving curriculum into their
courses. Undergraduate faculty participants learn environmental analysis
techniques and prepare environmental impact statements for a hypothetical
development project in a contaminated harbor of Lake Ontario. As they are being
exposed to new innovative theoretical concepts and techniques developed by the
Great Lakes research community to understand and solve environmental problems,
participants will integrate environmental problem-solving into curricula at
their home institutions. Special topics, based on the Great Lakes experience,
will include the theories and applications of cascading trophic interactions and
particle-size spectra in community ecology; analytical methods for determining
toxic chemical concentrations in sediments and fishes; and the use of
microcomputers for mass balance and bioenergetics modeling of large lake
systems. Through preparation of environmental impact statements for a realistic
project, these techniques will be integrated into the overall environmental
analysis and problem-solving approach. Participants in the practicum will return
to their home institutions with expanded and updated professional skills and new
strategies, methods and techniques for improving undergraduate education and
addressing environmental problems in local communities. ***
