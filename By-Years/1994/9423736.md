ABSTRACT CTS -- 9423736 A small (10-15 person) workshop will be organized and
held on the accuracy and calibration of heat flux sensors for use in convective
and radiative transfer measurement. The workshop will be organized by Prof.
Robert J. Moffatt of Stanford University, and will bring together eminent
researchers in heat flux sensor development and use. The workshop will be
jointly sponsored and funded by NIST, which has an equal interest in the area.
