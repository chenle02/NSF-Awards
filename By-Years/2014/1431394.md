Many U.S. federal agencies and local law enforcement agencies rely on the
polygraph to determine the trustworthiness of employees and use by the
government has greatly increased over the last two decades. An ethnographic
study of those who administer polygraph tests, polygraph trainers, those who
must take the tests, scientists developing new lie detection technologies, and
the small community of anti-polygraph advocates will illuminate the policy
implications of the state's reliance on polygraphy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
findings will be made available in a book written for academic social
scientists, policy makers, national security professionals, and the laypersons.
This book will help people to understand how the polygraph operates in practice,
and what the scientific validity of these tests is.
