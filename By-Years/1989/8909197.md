Geometric computations, like all numerical procedures, are extremely prone to
roundoff error. However, virtually none of the numerical analysis literature
directly applies to geometric calculations and little of the geometry literature
directly addresses this problem. Even for line intersection, the most basic
geometric operation, there is no robust and efficient algorithm. Compounding the
difficulties, many geometric algorithms perform iterations of calculations
reusing previously computed data. As a result, most of the applications
performing geometric computations resort to ad-hoc methods to overcome the
numerical difficulties. This research is directed towards some of the main
issues in geometric computations and the methods that have been proposed to
handle roundoff errors. It builds upon work done previously by the principal
investigator in this area and expand the results to enable and implement robust
solutions to more complex problems of applied computational geometry and
computer graphics.
