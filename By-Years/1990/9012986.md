In this project, P.I.'s will deploy three inverted echo sounders (IES) at the
Hawaiian Ocean Time Series station north of Oahu, Hawaii. The objective is to
evaluate the feasibility of using IES's to monitor dynamic height at the deep-
water station, This added continuous component to the measurement of the
variability will allow resolution of smaller space and time scales otherwise
inaccessible to existing measurements.
