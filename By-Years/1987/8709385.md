The conference deals with basic collisional, radiative, and plasma processes
important to the understanding of ionized gases. Emphasis is given to the
underlying electronic, ionic, atomic, and molecular processes that occur in
electric discharges, arcs, and gas lasers and to the relevant aspects of atomic
and molecular structure, photon interactions, and plasma effects that occur in
discharges, arcs, and gas lasers. The conference is a meeting for researchers
working on processes important in discharges, arcs, and gas lasers, especially
physicists, chemists, and engineers. Academia, government, industry and national
laboratories are well represented at this meeting. The program consists
primarily of contributed papers together with workshops and invited papers on
topics worthy of special interest.
