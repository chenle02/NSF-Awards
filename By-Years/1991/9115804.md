A feasibility study will be conducted to determine whether UV excimer lasers
can be used to clean aluminum-coated mirror samples that have been contaminated
by typical contaminants found on astronomical mirrors. Specific tasks for this
program are listed below. A laser cleaning laboratory for cleaning the mirror
samples and measuring the effectiveness of the technique shall be set up.
Aluminum-coated mirror samples shall be artificially contaminated with
contaminants typically found around astronomical mirrors (e.g. sand dust from
Manuna Kea and Arizona) and UV laser cleaned. The cleaning parameters (e.g.
laser fluence, number of shots per site) shall be varied in order to determine
the optimum cleaning procedure. The mirror reflectivity shall be measured before
contamination, after contamination, and after laser cleaning. Aluminum-coated
mirror samples shall be distributed to selected astronomical observatories to be
exposed to the same contaminants that the primary mirror experiences. These
mirror samples shall be returned for laser cleaning tests. The reflectivity of
the mirror samples shall be measured before shipping to the observatories, after
receiving the contaminated mirror samples, and after laser cleaning.
