This Research Planning Grant will enable Dr. Stephanie Sen to initiate a
research program in the design of antibodies which have the ability to assist in
the hydrogenation of activated and inactivated olefins. The approach is to
generate monoclonal antibodies that work in conjunction with transition metal
catalysts to asssist in the hydrogenation of olefins. Preliminary research will
focus upon determining preparative methods. Subsequent work includes the study
of enantioselective reactions that these antibodies may induce in olefin
hydrogenation. %%% Research Planning Grants are awarded to women who have not
yet recieved federal funding for their research. Dr. Sen will be studying the
development of catalysts from biological sources. These catalysts would assist
in commercially important reactions and could represent a new class of non-
polluting catalysts.
