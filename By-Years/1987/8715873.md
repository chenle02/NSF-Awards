This award will provide partial support for the travel expenses of six American
scientists who will serve as faculty for the International College of Biophysics
in Italy during September, 1988. This international meeting is specifically
aimed at upgrading the field of biophysics in developing countries. The
principal investigator, Dr. Horacio Farach, is co-director for this
International College of Biophysics and the U.S. participants are all highly
regarded as are the other international faculty. It is anticipated that both the
faculty and students will derive substantial benefit from the focus of this
symposium on contemporary biophysics.
