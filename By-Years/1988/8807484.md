This project is concerned with rings of finite global dimension, particularly
classical orders over a commutative discrete valuation ring and related Artinian
rings of finite global dimension. The principal investigator will consider the
problem of obtaining an upper bound on the global dimension of Noetherian PI
rings which have finite global dimension. The structure of orders and Artin
algebras of finite global dimension will also be studied. This will be useful in
attacking Tarsy's conjecture. This project is in the general area of ring
theory. It is concerned with the global dimension of a class of rings. The
global dimension measures certain properties of a ring. This research will try
to determine if there is an upper bound on this measurement for a restricted
class of rings.
