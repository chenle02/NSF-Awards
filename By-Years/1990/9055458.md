This proposal will provide training over a 32-month period to improve the
instructional skills of 60 middle school science teachers. The major objectives
of the project is to improve the teaching effectiveness of middle school
teachers (4-9) in Educational Service Units Nebraska. This objective will be
fulfilled by means of: (1) three-week summer workshops and (2) evening sessions
conducted throughout the academic year. The basic purposes of the summer program
are to permit a cadre of teachers to improve their process skills, teaching
methodology, and critical thinking skills by involving them in a teaching
strategy known as the Inquiry Role Approach. This cadre of teachers will be
utilized as resource persons in their local service unit areas and to assist as
team leaders in workshops and seminars dealing with (a) life, earth, and
physical science content; (b) Inquiry Role Approach teaching methodology, and
(c) schoolyard science. The academic year meetings will encompass the
disciplines of life, earth and physical science. Each discipline will be
organized into a number of content topics designed for an evening session of
three hours. One-half hour prior to each evening session, a staff member will be
available for consultation on science content or science curricula. In summary,
this project is designed to improve the teaching effectiveness of middle school
science teachers by using the Inquiry Role Approach as the major instructional
strategy. The content of earth, life and physical science will be emphasized
through field trips, class discussions, lectures, and the individualization of
laboratory activities. No cost sharing is included in this proposal.
