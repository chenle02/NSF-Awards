9310582 Ashe When one learns to associate a tone with a reward, the cells in the
cerebral cortex of the brain that normally respond on hearing that tone become
more discriminating. That is, the cells become more likely to respond to the
rewarded tone, and less likely to respond to other tones that are not associated
with reward. The sharpness of tuning of their receptive field improves. This
type of receptive field tuning may be the cellular basis for many types of human
learning that are dependent on the cerebral cortex. In this renewal of an NSF
grant, Dr. Ashe will continue his investigations of the cellular mechanisms
responsible for this receptive field sharpening. A particular strength of his
approach is that he will use similar approaches both in vitro and in vivo. He
will use newly developed pharmacological agents and physiological techniques to
identify the complementary roles of three neurotransmitters in facilitating
adaptive neuronal plasticity. The results should provide basic data on how
learning occurs, and also help in the development of pharmacological treatments
for memory loss due to aging, degenerative disease or head trauma. ***
