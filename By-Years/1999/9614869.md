9614869 Harrison Under normal circumstances, heat and pressure increase with
depth in the earth's crust, however a number of cases of inverted metamorphic
gradients are well documented in zones of tectonic deformation. This study
involves the collection of data that will allow the testing of two competing
hypotheses of "up-side-down" metamorphic sequences. One hypothesis holds that
warmer rocks are thrust over cooler rocks which became heated from above, -
producing an inverted thermal metamorphic sequence. The second hypothesis
proposes that previously metamorphosed rocks, once cooled, are thrust over other
previously metamorphosed but lower grade rocks. This leads to an up-side down
gradient in the grade of ancient metamorphic conditions but does not reflect an
instantaneous up-side-down temperature gradient. Results will be important in
understanding the tectonic significance of many examples of inverse
metamorphism.
