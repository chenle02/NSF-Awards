NOTE: This CAREER award is a companion project to the CAREER award
CCR-96-24560, ``Practice-Oriented Provable Security'', University of California,
Davis. This project focuses on the areas of (1) provable security and
probabilistic proof checking with orientation towards developing practical, but
proven secure protocols and (2) probabilistic proof checking (PCP) with
application to the derivation of nonapproximability results for NP-hard
optimization problems. The problems examined cannot be solved by some kind of
``technology transfer'' from theory to practice; rather the theoretical
principles have to be used to develop new models and solve new problems.
Applications of the techniques of practice-oriented provable security are
applied to such problems as: session key distribution, use of block cyphers to
provably achieve basic cryptographic goals, and balancing between individual
privacy and law enforcement, via key escrow or other means. In the area of PCP,
the problems studied include determining tight results for the approximability
of Max Clique, and improved results for Max SNP problem. The Integrated
Educational Plan of this CAREER grant includes developing: (a) new undergraduate
and graduate courses in principles of sound protocol design, with joint
university/industrial training projects; and (b) an undergraduate algorithm
design course in which proof checking tehniques for determining good approximate
solutions are taught and applied to NP-hard optimization problems.***
