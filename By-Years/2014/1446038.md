Support for this proposal, "NUE: Teaching as a Learning Experience in
Nanotechnology", at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), under the direction
of Dr. Chitanya Ullal, will enable the institution to develop, pilot and
implement a new course in which ~550 undergraduate engineering students per year
at RPI will learn and use core concepts in cutting edge nanotechnology research
being conducted by faculty at the Rensselaer Nanotechnology Center (RNC) to
create, build and teach hands-on, household material based design challenges for
K-12 students and their parents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPI undergraduate
students will conduct family science courses for students from schools that
primarily serve communities underrepresented in engineering. By learning,
distilling and communicating concepts in nanotechnology research, undergraduates
will not only derive multiple educational benefits, but will also serve to
connect researchers with the broader population. Synergistic deliverables
include integration of the most effective design challenges into the curriculum
of a widely accessible online K-12 science education portal; introduction of new
curated demos into a core engineering course at RPI; and documentation of the
training,&lt;br/&gt;resources, curriculum development and best practices for
replication of the course at other universities.
