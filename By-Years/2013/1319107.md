Stochastic computing is an alternative to binary computing that is inherently
fault tolerant. A number is encoded probabilistically as the number of 1s in a
stream of N bits. Stochastic representation of numbers is highly redundant,
which translates to fault tolerance. In many applications where exactness of
computations is less important, stochastic computing may be a desired
alternative. Its drawbacks include longer latency and orders of magnitude
increase in storage requirements. Nevertheless, in deep submicron technology
where fault tolerance is highly desirable, the stochastic computing approach may
provide certain advantages. Very little is understood about the performance of
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms implemented using stochastic
computing. This project will attempt to understand how various DSP functions can
be implemented using stochastic computing. Efforts will be directed towards
understanding characteristics such as fault-tolerance, finite precision effects,
conversion of two's complement to stochastic numbers, etc. Applications in video
coding will be explored to demonstrate the utility of the stochastic computing
approach for digital signal processing applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
approach, if proven successful, may be useful in many applications that require
fault tolerance, but can tolerate some error. The impact of the research could
then be translated to new products and new markets in the semiconductor
industry. The proposed research will train graduate students through related
course projects. Graduate research students will transfer technology to
industries. Women and minorities will be recruited to participate in this
project. Results of the project will be disseminated through publications in
journals and conferences, and by talks by the PI in semiconductor industries.
