Indonesian Seas provide the best opportunity to recover high-resolution climate
archives from the western equatorial Pacific. The planning visit grant will
allow the PI and two students to travel to Indonesia in order to initiate new
research collaboration between USA and Indonesia to study the paleoceanography
and paleoclimatology of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. This proposed study builds
upon previous collaboration that has yielded important insights about possible
controls of climate variability in this region. During the visit we will meet
with scientists and government officials in order to develop this new
collaboration and to examine their research ships and equipment. The students
will have an opportunity to actively experience the discussion of establishing a
joint international study, will meet with potential collaborators and will
present their own work in the USA. This will be a unique opportunity for them to
learn what it takes to do science in remote unconventional
places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
