Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy has long been a central tool for
determining the structure and function of metalloenzyme active sites. This
project will continue to develop unique methods to perform CW/pulsed ENDOR and
ESEEM experiments at X (9 GHz) and Q (35 GHz) bands, and W band (95 GHz)
microwave frequencies. This constellation of approaches, combined with new
procedures developed for the analysis of frozen-solution ENDOR and ESEEM
spectra, provides a powerful, selective, and sensitive tool for the
characterization of metalloenzyme active sites and their interactions with
substrates/inhibitors/products, both in the resting state and in key
intermediates. This project will emphasize three important topics:&lt;br/&gt;(I)
Localization of substrate/inhibitor binding at the molybdenum-iron cofactor of
the nitrogenase MoFe protein and characterization of intermediate states formed
during substrate reduction;&lt;br/&gt;(II) The enzymic mechanism of three
members of "radical S-adenosylmethionine" superfamily, which all use [4Fe-4S]
clusters and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to generate catalytically essential
radicals.&lt;br/&gt;(III) Reactive intermediates and substrate/inhibitor
interactions with molybdenum and tungsten oxotransferases
(molybdopterins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will develop
sophisticated analytical procedures and algorithms for determining the complete
coordination geometry and bonding at a metal center. These capabilities
disseminated to the metallobiochemistry researchers via web, through formal
collaborations and by informal consultation. Besides these research
contributions, the project will provide research opportunities for a faculty
member from an undergraduate institution. In addition, the project will involve
training at the graduate and postdoctoral level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is funded jointly by Molecular Biochemistry and Molecular
Biophysics.&lt;br/&gt;
