This REU site award will support work of six undergraduate students
investigating problems in the areas of number theory and probability. Students
will be immersed in a graduate school type setting involving seminars,
individual research and presentation of results. Research topics include
cyclotomic function fields; rings of integers and prime factorization; unique
factorization domains; Fibonacci sequences; continued fraction; probability
bounds and linear programming. In algebraic function fields, the students'
projects will deal with analogues to classical results from algebraic number
fields. Of particular interest will be efforts to discover analogues of
fundamental principles regarding quadratic reciprocity. The properties of the
Fibonacci sequence modulo m has been the target of several recent investigations
and work will continue on extensions of periodicity relations which have been
established for certain special classes of moduli. Work in the area of
probability will focus on obtaining information on joint probabilities when only
partial information is available on the individual events. Exact solutions are
replaced by bounds on the probability. These questions lead naturally into
interesting questions of multi-parametric linear programming problems which
yield answers to questions of how one can obtain the above bounds in an
efficient manner. The project will use resources from the Lehigh Valley
Association of Independent Colleges including two faculty advisors. It is
expected that work completed under this award will be presented at the fourth
meeting of the Annual Moravian Mathematical Student Conference in 1990.
