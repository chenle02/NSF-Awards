In the ovary of the domestic hen, as in other females of reproductive age
including humans, there are many thousand immature eggs or oocytes. Only a
relatively small portion of these eggs will grow and mature. The hormonal
mechanism responsible for an orderly development of ovarian follicles containing
the oocyte is poorly understood. Evidence gathered in the past decade or so
indicates that under the influence of a hormone (LH), a certain type of
follicular cell(granulosa cell) produces a steroid hormone (progesterone) that
is essential for ovulation to occur. This grant proposal deals with the cellular
and molecular mechanism underlying this important step in female reproductive
physiology. Various experimental approaches will be used to study the
transduction of LH.generated signal across the cell membrane of granulosa cells
and the subsequent biochemical reactions that may be involved in this process.
Specifically, the way in which these cells handle calcium ions, believed to play
key functional roles in many cellular processes will be quantitated by up to
date technical procedures. Modern breeding, husbandry and nutrition have
maximized the productivity of egg.laying chickens. Any further improvement which
may reduce the number of non.laying days/year and thereby further increase
productivity is expected to come from new discoveries in reproductive biology of
this important meat and egg.producing domestic species. In addition, the
information generated by this project regarding basic physiological processes
may be applicable to other species, there by providing some new insights into
ovarian physiology in general.
