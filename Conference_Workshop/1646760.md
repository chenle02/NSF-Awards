This award provides funding for the West Coast Number Theory Conference (WCNT)
for three years, from 2016 through its 50th anniversary. Since its founding by
Emma and Dick Lehmer at University of California, Berkeley, WCNT has been held
each December on or near the West Coast of the United States. Nearly 50 years
later, WCNT continues to be a welcoming venue for young researchers and
established mathematicians alike to share their work in an egalitarian
environment. Number theory is an ancient discipline that is still flourishing as
an active and important branch of modern mathematics. Current applications of
number theory include high-speed computation and data encryption.

At WCNT each talk receives equal time and every participant receives equal
access to funding. The daily talks span many different areas within number
theory, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and collaboration across standard
borders. The conference includes formal problem sessions as well as informal
evening group work sessions. With permission of the presenter, open problems
from these sessions are collected and published on the conference website.
Graduate students, postdocs, junior researchers, women, and minorities are
especially encouraged to apply for funding. The conference website can be found
at http://westcoastnumbertheory.org.
