The goal of this project is to understand how preconditioning of the magnetotail
during periods of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) or high solar
wind velocity affects the inner magnetosphere. During northward IMF a cold dense
plasma sheet forms which when the IMF subsequently turns southward flows into
the inner magnetosphere. It appears as super-dense plasma at synchronous orbit
and then becomes accelerated and contributes to the ring current. While it is
generally accepted that this process occurs the parameters that control it, how
the energization takes place and the effects are not well understood. This study
will use the OpenGGCM global MHD simulation coupled with two ring current models
(the Rice Convection Model (RCM) and the Comprehensive Ring Current Model
(CRCM)). Model results will be analyzed to understand the process.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a graduate student.
