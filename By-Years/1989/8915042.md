This program will develop a generalized zonal method (GZM) for the analysis of
radiative heat transfer in multi-dimensional absorbing, emitting, and
anisotropically scattering media. The effect of non-diffuse of non-diffuse
reflecting surfaces will also be explored. The method to be used is a
generalization of the "conventional zonal method", CZM, which was developed in
fifties and has been the mainstay of practical calculations since then, with
apparently little modification. State-of-the-art parallel processing
computational capabilities will be exploited enabling the solution of the vastly
more complicated generalized equations. The main product of this research will
be a method of such accuracy that it will serve as a benchmark for other
approximations which have been in use, although not adequately validated. The PI
expects to generate some fundamental parameters based on a mean-beam-length
concept which be useful for scaling model experiments to full-scale prototypes.
The code developed will be critically compared with existing experimental data.
