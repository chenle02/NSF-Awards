The investigator will investigate the potential of a new method for constructing
finite element solvers of optimal speed. For a class of bounded monotone
elliptic systems, the method solves the finite element model in a discrete
quotient space, whose complexity depends mainly on the kernel of the discritized
finite element operator, and is linearly proportional to the number of unknowns
in the system. The investigator will demonstrate that the method has many
advantageous features, and seek for extending it to to more challenging problems
such as convection-dominated diffusion.

The proposed research resides at the heart of high performance scientific
computation, having repeatedly been identified as a critical mission by National
Sciences Foundation over the last several decades. In 2003, the U.S. Department
of Energy publicized a two-volume report titled "A Science-based Case for Large
Scale Simulation", prepared with direct input from more than 300 of the nation's
leading computational scientists, in which discovering efficient solver
algorithms for large scale simulation is recognized as important as building
supper computers. The investigator directly answer to the call with a strong
promise to advance that mission.
