This research planning grant addresses the complex relationships between
ethnicity and risk perceptions. Cross-cultural research on models of risk
perception is vital to the validity and generalizability of all research on risk
perception and decision making. Research activities will extend current
knowledge about the theoretical validity and reliability of the
conceptualization of risk modeled in the Simplified Conjoint Expected Risk
(SCER) model of Holtgrave and Weber across different ethnic and cultural groups.
The research will modify and pilot test the survey instrument used by Holtgrave
and Weber in a group of white individuals with known characteristics. The
results of this analysis will be used as evidence regarding the theoretical
validity of this conceptualization of risk perception for white individuals, and
provide a source for comparison with other ethnic and cultural groups. The
research will also identify theoretically valid and reliable measures of group
membership (for ethnicity, culture, and level of acculturation) to be used in
the subsequent cross-cultural research. The initial research site, Los
Angeles/Orange County, is optimal for cross-cultural research because there are
many different ethnic and cultural groups, e.g., African-Americans, Latinos
(Chicanos, recent immigrants from Mexico), Asians (Vietnamese, Cambodians,
Japanese, Chinese), living in this region.
