A primary concern of biologists is the discovery and documentation of earth's
biodiversity. Documentation and investigation of the evolutionary relationships
of organisms are the first steps towards understanding the origin and
distribution of that diversity and what forces were involved in its generation.
Lizards of the genus Anolis are model organisms for such studies in the
Caribbean. This project aims to: 1) understand the evolutionary relationships of
mainland (Central and South American) anoles and 2) investigate and explain the
origin and distribution of this mainland lizard group. To achieve these aims,
the project will collect specimens across a broad distributional range and
analyze morphological and molecular data to test hypotheses of the evolution and
distribution of these lizards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves
graduate and undergraduate students from varied disciplines. Biology students
will be trained in field and laboratory techniques, including publication and
presentation of results at international meetings. Students completing a minor
in Museum Studies (from diverse majors such as History, Art, and Anthropology)
will be trained in the everyday tasks of museum work from managing specimens to
developing exhibitions on the results of this project.
