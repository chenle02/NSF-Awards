Many meteorological phenomenon are controlled and/or influenced by the physics
of the convective boundary layer. During the Convection and
Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CaPE) held in Florida in 1991, a
collection of very advanced meteorological instrumentation was brought to bear
on a variety of meteorological problems including those of the boundary layer.
Using data from the CaPE, the Principal Investigator will conduct research with
the following five objectives: study of a waterspout with Doppler radar and
cloud photogrammetry; detailed analysis of the sea breeze phenomena with
emphasis on synoptic flow regime, along front variation and convective
initiation; evolution of horizontal convective rolls that develop within the
boundary layer with emphasis on along roll variation of enhanced cloud
development; analysis of convective initiation resulting from the collision of
two boundaries; analysis of air mass storms in order toe assess the generality
of a generalized thunderstorm conceptual model recently proposed by the
Principal Investigator.
