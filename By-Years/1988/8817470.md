This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant proposal. The
proposed research will attempt to pinpoint the reasons why the problem-solving
skills of black high school students remain below the national average for white
high school students and why the development of these skills among black
students are actually on the decline. This study is timely, much needed, and is
expected to contribute to the base of scientific knowledge. The planning grant
will provide funds to support the activities of a well-trained minority
scientist to plan and prepare a competitive proposal for submission to the MRI
research initiation component. During the planning period, the principal
investigator will conduct an exhaustive review of the literature and collaborate
with senior researchers to select a national database, an appropriate research
design and suitable data analytical techniques.
