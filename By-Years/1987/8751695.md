The project offers a month long summer institute for 30 well- prepared
elementary school teachers from Tennessee which will be followed during the
academic year with activities at the participants school districts. The focus is
on three main areas: geometry, problem-solving, and instructional computing.
These are interconnected in the project by involving problem-solving activities
in the study of the geometry topics as well as incorporating computer
investigations into the geometry and problem-solving activities. The graphic
capability of the computer language LOGO also serves as the vehicle to develop
an interplay between the geometry topics and the problem-solving situations. The
30 participants are selected by the school districts that have committed to the
project and the plan is to implement the project activities into the programs at
the participants' districts to continue the work of the project and extend the
knowledge and techniques developed to other teachers in the districts.
