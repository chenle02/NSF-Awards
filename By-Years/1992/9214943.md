Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the Kagome lattices will be studied for quantum
spins at large spin values and for classical spins at low temperature. Starting
from the spin-wave approximation with anharmonic terms, effective Hamiltonians
will be found expressing selection of (1) coplanar states, out of a continuum of
degenerate classical ground states, and, (2) a particular ordered state, out of
the discrete infinity of coplanar ground states. This ongoing work will be
extended to study dilution disorder, spin tunneling, and (in the Kagome case)
interlayer couplings. Certain discrete spin models in two dimensions can be
mapped to solid-on-solid models in higher dimensions. Monte Carlo will be used
to study the constrained Potts model, a new family of this type in higher
dimension. The degree of order in the ground state of the spin one-half
triangular antiferromagnet near the Ising limit will also be studied. %%% This
theoretical research will focus on properties of frustrated antiferromagnets.
The PI is a former Presidential Young Investigator. Frustrated antiferromagnets
are of interest for a variety of reasons. The new high temperature
superconductors are antiferromagnets in their normal state and this
antiferromagnetism is thought to possibly play a role in producing their unique
superconducting properties. The role played by the competition between disorder
and magnetism in determining the properties of magnetic materials is a basic one
which has eluded explanation. Finally, the statistical mechanics of novel
lattice systems is also of basic interest.
