The purpose of this Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program proposal
is to revitalize and renew physics and mathematics courses at College of the
Ozarks. The goal of the proposal is the active participation of their students
in learning physics and mathematics. The program is carrying out the following
objectives, in order of priority: 1) It is putting in the hands of the General
Physics students significant new computer-based tools to learn physics and do
physics, specifically, a symbolic algebra system (Mathematica) on a powerful
computer (Macintosh II Ci). These tools are engaging the students and are
requiring the students to actively participating the learning process. 2) The
program is maintaining and improving the numerical computational component of
the General Physics Course. 3) It is updating the microcomputer-based laboratory
(MBL) capability to utilize the Macintosh platform. 4) The project is using
Mathematica to begin a similar revitalization and renewal process of the
Calculus sequence and the upper-division Mathematics courses. 5) The astronomy
software--Voyager--is being introduced into the Physical Science and Astronomy
laboratories. 6) The project is creating a Scientific Computing Facility for all
of the natural sciences and mathematics at College of the Ozarks.
