The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on helping hospitals use data to
increase efficiency in operating room resource management. The outcome of this
work is a product that could deliver predictive management of surgical
instruments; It has the potential to possibly deliver significant direct-to-
margin savings to Operating Rooms (OR) at a time when hospitals are struggling
to remain financially solvent. This effort may enable hospitals to achieve a 50%
reduction in instruments, a 25% reduction in OR setup time, and a 33% reduction
in tray weight. It could also reduce instrument-related delays and frustration
in the ORs, making surgery safer and more efficient. The technology will
establish the commercial viability of a new data stream, enabling applications
in predictive OR scheduling, outcomes analysis, and surgical team education.

This project advances the field of healthcare analytics by capturing and
applying a data stream that describes how surgery is performed. Every surgical
instrument is specialized for a very specific task. This means each time an
instrument is used by a surgeon, there is information about their goals, the
state of the patient, and the phase of surgery. Under the proposed project, this
information is captured by tracking instrument usage. This technology may
facilitate a number of predictive tools that can be used to improve the
efficiency of the OR and even inform surgical techniques. At a certain level,
this application could enable quantification of how the best surgeons in the
world deliver care, revealing insights that may not be widely known.
