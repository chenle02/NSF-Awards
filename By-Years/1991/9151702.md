Modernization of X-ray equipment is allowing improvement of undergraduate
laboratory instruction in selected courses and in undergraduate research in the
department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at Northwestern State
University of Louisiana. Equipment acquired with grant funds includes a
microprocessor based control and data acquisition system with computer
interfacing. Students now are able to carry out experiments with greater ease
and accuracy, are able to make determinations which have been either impossible
or very time consuming, and are gaining experience in working with
instrumentation of the type encountered in industry or graduate school.NSF grant
funds are being matched with funds from non- Federal sources.
