9512873 Plohr This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project will develop
mathematical models and techniques to study the propagation and noninvasive
magnetic detection of electrochemical waves in cardiac tissue and also develop
the theory of fundamental solutions of three-phase flow in petroleum reservoirs.
Led by Bradley Plohr of SUNY Stony Brook and Dan Marchesin of Instituto de
Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil, a group of 6 to 10 U.S. scientists
and as many Brazilian scientists will collaborate on these problems. Several
graduate students in each country will also be involved in the endeavor. The
project is both international and interdisciplinary, bringing together
mathematicians, physicists, doctors, and engineers in two countries. Building on
established collaborations, new avenues of research including new investigators
will be opened. An established emphasis on development of graduate students will
also be continued. ***
