Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most important tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to modern NMR spectroscopy is essential to
chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at
the University of Rochester will use this award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program to help upgrade a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas
of chemical research that will be enhanced by the upgrade include the following:
1) Para hydrogen induced polarization and metal catalyzed reactions of silanes
2) Studies of C-H activation and insertion reactions 3) Electron transport in
proteins 4) Light induced electron transport processes 5) Chemical reactivity of
odd electron species.
