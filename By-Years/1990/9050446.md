This project automates the Advanced Network and Control Systems Analysis
Laboratory through the acquisition of computer controlled instrumentation. This
permits the automation of data collection, provides hardcopy records of results,
and permits data analysis on the host controller. The use of bus-controlled
instruments eliminates repetitive set-ups, improves data quality, reduces data
collection time and enhances analysis reporting. Students have additional time
to explore more facets of a given experiment while the quality and uniformity of
results is improved. The availability of the host controller with stored data
allows the students to perform data analysis beyond previous levels. The
equipment is also used for demonstrations in lower division courses, teaching
the techniques of bus-controlled instrumentation, and for applications in senior
projects. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
