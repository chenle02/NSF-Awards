9500223 Zhang Ceramics are hard, wear resistant, high strength materials, and
they can maintain these properties at elevated temperatures. This makes them
desirable for high performance applications, but ceramics are also brittle, and
lose their theoretical load carrying capacity with the presence of cracks. The
same properties that make ceramics desirable for high performance applications,
also make them very difficult to process, and low productivity ductile regime
grinding is the current method used to achieve precision geometry and surfaces.
This project will investigate damage control grinding of ceramics, an approach
that uses less costly machine tools, can be done at higher material removal
rates, with only a small penalty in functional performance of the ceramics. The
project goals are: (1) predicting critical grinding depth, crack size and
morphology, (2) verification of these predictions by both single grit and
grinding experiments, and (3) characterization of the damage control ground
surfaces. These results will lead to higher productivity in processing ceramic
parts by grinding. As a result, there will be wider use of ceramic components in
applications where precision, wear resistance, and high temperature performance
are important.
