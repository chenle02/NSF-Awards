9520457 HICKMAN This award will contribute support to the doctoral dissertation
research of a student at the University of California, Berkeley. The award will
provide minor funding for supplies and will enable the student to visit and
study major collections of fossil mollusk material in the United States as well
as the Natural History Museum in Basel, Switzerland where important
paleontological holdings are found. This is an important study because the
student will be attempting to assess sampling strategies and compare methods for
estimating biodiversity for extinct faunas of gastropods. Establishing
reliability of such methods is very important for addressing faunal change
through geological time and especially for investigating Neogene mass
extinctions in the western Atlantic. %%% This award will contribute to the
research training of a young paleontologist. More importantly, the work of this
particular student could be very important for other more senior researchers in
establishing methods for estimating biodiversity in fossil communities. ***
