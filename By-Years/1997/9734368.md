9734368 Saif This proposal is focused on experimentally studying one of the
commonly occurring failure modes in MEMS and micro electronics, namely debonding
between interfaces, often referred to as decohesion. The interface formed by
submicron films of a metal (aluminum) and an insulator (silicon dioxide) will be
studied. To carry out the experiments, micro instruments will be developed based
on MEMS devices. These instruments will initiate debonding in test specimens
designed for interfacial studies.They will also self calibrate, and will allow
measurements of Angstrom to nanometer scale displacements of the specimens. The
micro instrument and the test specimens will be simultaneously designed,
patterned and cofabricated. ***
