This project investigates a variety of problems in the design and analysis of
combinatorial algorithms, including the behavior of local search algorithms for
combinatorial optimization problems, approximation algorithms for NP-complete
problems, space-efficient data structures, persistent data structures,
applications of the Bellman-Ford shortest paths algorithm, and algorithms and
lower bounds for parameterized optimization problems. The main thrusts of this
research are finding new ways to store and search discrete combinatorial data
efficiently, and showing that known combinatorial search algorithms cannot
perform well in the worst case. The theme that unifies the problems under
consideration is that all have a graph-theoretic aspect and an algorithmic
aspect.
