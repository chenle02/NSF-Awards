The proposed research will define several ecological endpoints that reflect the
past and present status of Atlantic white cedar wetlands in the Pinelands.
Temporal and geographic trends in the extent, size, and quality of Atlantic
white cedar swamps and their spatial relationship to other landscape components
will be described, and the factors responsible for any observed changes will be
identified. A model for human interactions with Atlantic white cedar swamps that
incorporates both a Markovian succesional model and social and economic factors
will be developed within the context of a geographic information system. Using
this paradigm, several scenarios reflecting different institutional
policies(e.g., public lands management, regulation) and transition probabilities
will be developed, and the effect of each institutional scenario on the
ecological sustainability of Atlantic white cedar swamps will be assessed. The
results will have direct application to natural resource management and
environmental policy decision making in the region.
