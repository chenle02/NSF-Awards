The event "Conference and Summer School: Algebraic Statistics in the
Alleghenies" will be held at the Pennsylvania State University, University Park,
PA, from June 9 to 15, 2012 (URL: http://www.math.psu.edu/morton/aspsu2012/).
Algebraic statistics exploits algebraic geometry and related fields to solve
problems in statistics and its applications. Methods from algebraic statistics
have been successfully applied to address many problems including construction
of Markov bases, theoretical study of phylogenetic mixture models, ecological
inference, identifiability problems for graphical models, Bayesian integrals and
singular learning theory, social networks, and coalescent theory. In addition to
algebraic statistics' successes in solving statistical problems, its research
objectives have driven theoretical developments in algebra.

Traditionally, applied mathematics has focused on branches of mathematics
including differential equations and analysis. Instead, algebraic statistics
advocates algebraic geometry, a well-developed and ancient field of mathematics,
as a tool for solving problems in statistics and its applications. Many
statistical models have the structure of algebraic varieties. This observation
catalyzed rapid growth in this area over the past fifteen years. Over this time
it has become clear that algebraic structures are ubiquitous in statistics.
Hence advanced tools from algebra profitably address statistical questions. The
purpose of this grant is to support a seven day conference and summer school
Algebraic Statistics in the Alleghenies at the Pennsylvania State University,
June 9-15, 2012. More than 100 participants are anticipated, which would make
this the largest meeting yet on Algebraic Statistics that had been held in the
US or abroad.
