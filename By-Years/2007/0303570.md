The Chicago Botanic Garden, in collaboration with five major botanic gardens,
will plan a citizen science invasive species monitoring program that will engage
participants in active, meaningful data collection on populations of invasive
plants at a national scale. The planning team will identify effective program
approaches based upon front-end and formative evaluation and a professionally
facilitated planning workshop involving prominent scientists, botanic garden
professionals and informal science educators.
