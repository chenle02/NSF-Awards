This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to
Anael Verdugo is "Construction of a new mathematical model for the p53 protein
network." This research will be conducted at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University under the sponsorship of Dr. John Tyson, and the University of
Oxford under the sponsorship of Dr. Bela Novak.

The p53 protein is one of the main guardians that protect us against mutations
in our DNA. After years of research, biologists have uncovered some of the basic
properties of the p53 protein. However, there is still much work to be done,
especially in terms of understanding the p53 behavior from a mathematical
viewpoint. This research will address the connections between the mathematical
theory about regulation and the results of biological experiments. The outcome
will be a new mathematical model to capture and predict p53 protein behavior
that promises to better define experiments that remain to be conducted. The
training objectives for this research include learning techniques and theories
in the fields of systems biology, molecular genetics, biochemistry, and cell
biology. The newly acquired knowledge will enrich the scientific vision and
repertoire of cross-disciplinary technical skills for the Fellow's career. The
broader impacts include educational mentoring for undergraduates and graduate
students. In addition, the Fellow will keep promoting and pushing for the
advancement of underrepresented groups by participating in national minority
conferences and advising future minority scientists.
