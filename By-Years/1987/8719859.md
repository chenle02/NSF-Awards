This project is in the Office of Special Projects in the category of
instrumentation development. The recent develop- ment of scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) has excited widespread interest among the scientific community.
The atomic resolution imaging capabilities of this microscopy are having an
impact in many fields. This instrumentation provides atomic level spatial
resolution of surface electronic structure, forces, and other surface and
interfacial properties. Such a tool can be expected to have great impact in many
fields of science and to find use in many laboratories. Many STM instruments are
designed and fabricated by individual research groups and commercial products
based on these individual designs are beginning to appear. Major costs
associated with the STM result from development time rather than equipment cost.
The opportunity exists for scientists to curtail duplication of effort by
specifying the performance of STM instrumentation for general purpose research
use. The objectives of the workshop are to define specifications for a modular,
generic STM instrument and to stimulate commercial interest in such a generic
instrument. The prospect for multiple purchase of generic STM's will also be
explored.
