This grant supports the research of Dr. D. Chudnovsky and Dr. G. Chudnovsky as
principal investigators. They intend to study approximations to functions and
numbers with a view to revealing arithmetic properties of classical constants.
They intend to use Pade approximations in conjunction with isomonodromy
deformation equations. This is research in the field of number theory. Number
theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of
one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it
was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last
half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
