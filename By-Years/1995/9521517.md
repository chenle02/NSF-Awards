9521517 Sawyer Joint US-German MCS and wide-angle seismic experiment to study
the Galicia Interior Basin/Galicia Bank rifted continental margin and transform
boundary with Iberia Abyssal Plain margin segment to the south. S-reflector
under the Galicial outer Bank will be the focus. A dense instrumented MCS/OBS
wide angle seismic profile (56 OBS deployments) and 12 deep-penetrating MCS
profiles are planned. The sediment-starved Galicial Margin is well constrained
and has no post-rift volcanic or slat tectonics associated with it which makes
is a good place to study rifted margins. Existing ODP data will provide ground
truth.
