This research addresses the question of atoms interacting with light in a
radically nonperturbative, ultrahigh laser intensity range from 1017 W/cm2 to
1019 W/cm2. The science has direct bearing on a number of topics, including new
multi-electron phenomena, nonperturbative magnetic field-atom interactions,
relativistic continuum dynamics, the breakdown of the semiclassical WKB
approximation in strong field physics, and high-energy radiation from laser-atom
interactions. The atomic physics and laser technology in the proposal has a
direct impact on fourth generation XUV and X-ray radiation light sources, with
applications as wide-ranging as device lithography and single molecule x-ray
diffraction. The education component of the proposal is directed toward high-
school and college student perceptions of physics and addresses the new pedagogy
behind real-world, electronic teaching resources.
