The main goals of this funded project are to test ideas about the origin of
continental crust and the basic controls on the volcanic arc output of
subduction zones. The western Aleutians contain high Mg# andesites that are very
close in chemistry to the average continental crust. This award will support a
field program of dredging in the Aleutian arc which is a good natural laboratory
because it has never been rifted and shows a gradient of convergence angle from
east to west, with strongly oblique convergence in the west. Further, there is a
gradient in sediment "flux" along the arc, with the western Aleutians
representing a global low-sediment content endmember. The program is aimed at
obtaining more volcanic rock samples from the western Aleutian arc in five
distinct dredge areas. A 30-35 day multibeam, single channel seismic and
sampling cruise (35-40 dredges total) will be undertaken, with bathymetric and
SCS surveys prior to sampling. The budget includes costs for a minimal port-
cruise program of analyses and 40Ar/39Ar dating of igneous
rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
