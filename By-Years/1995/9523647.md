This project automatically detects discourse structure in digitally recorded
lectures and uses this structure to facilitate rapid browsing of the recording.
Discourse structure is the relationship between topics, including sub-topics and
embedded remarks. Boundaries of the segments representing the structure (but not
content) are conveyed by pauses, pitch range variation, and cue phrases.
Discourse structure is hierarchical, with multiple levels of major and minor
topics. Analysis of a corpus of lectures provides quantitative correlation
between acoustic features and discourse structure, and the basis of an automatic
segmentation algorithm. A unified approach merges hints from these multiple
acoustic cues to map hierarchical discourse structure to time offsets in the
recording. Derived discourse structure is used to browse the recording, at
various levels of detail and summarization. Presentation is highly interactive,
allowing the user to manipulate playback via a physical interface which is the
product of iterative design and evaluation. Hand gestures control the level of
detail, speed, an d random access during playback. More productive access to
audio recordings makes it possible to manage information from a wider variety of
sources and in more situations than conventional computer graphic displays.
