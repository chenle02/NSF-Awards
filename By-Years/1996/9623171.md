ABSTRACT Deviche &amp; Gulledge IBN 96-23171 Neurophysiological Control of
Avian Vocal Behavior In songbirds, singing is a learned behavior controlled by
specific brain regions collectively called the vocal control system. Because the
vocal control regions regulate a single behavior, studies on this subject offer
a unique opportunity for elucidating the neural bases of behavior. Steroidal
hormones play essential roles in this system s sexual differentiation and in
vocal behavior learning and expression. However, extensive research on steroid
effects has not satisfactorily explained characteristics of the vocal control
system at all stages of song development and expression. The investigators have
observed opioids and their receptors in vocal control regions. In other systems
opioids modulate neuron morphology and survival, sensory processing, and
learning and memory. In order to ascertain whether opioids regulate any of these
features of vocal control, it is necessary to determine if any correlation
exists between vocal control system opioid activity an d particular aspects of
singing behavior. The proposed work will use radioimmunoassays to measure opioid
concentrations in vocal control regions microdissected from dark-eyed junco
(Junco hyemalis) brains during four stages: song template storage, song
expression, song recognition, and post- breeding cessation of singing behavior.
Additionally, a parallel study that will directly asses the effects of chronic
opioid antagonist administration on singing behavior in adult male juncos will
be conducted. This project will help direct future research on the role(s) of
opioids in controlling behavior.
