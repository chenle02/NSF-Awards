During the last two decades more and more studies have demonstrated that the
population dynamics of copepods in coastal areas are dependent upon the
existence of benthic resting eggs. Understanding the numerical contribution of
eggs to naupliar recruitment is not sufficient, however, to accurately predict
population and community dynamics especially on evolutionary time scales. If
eggs accumulate over an extended period of time (greater than a reproductive
season) and form an egg bank, their hatching may slow the rate of evolutionary
change of the species. This is because egg banks represent the genetic history
of the population. The longer eggs survive the greater will be the genetic
memory contained in the egg bank. These field studies will determine if eggs can
survive at least three years in situ. The impact of anoxia and hydrogen sulfide
on resting egg viability will be assessed in laboratory experiments designed to
simulate field conditions.
