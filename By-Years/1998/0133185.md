The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Directorate for
Education and Human resources proposes to develop program evaluation models and
tools that will be used to collectively and individually assess the National
Science Foundation's (NSF) Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate
(AGEP) Program. Under the AGEP Program, NSF supports a portfolio of projects
that serve as effective models for addressing issues related to increasing the
number of minority students pursuing advanced degrees; obtaining doctoral
degrees; and entering the professoriate in science, mathematics, engineering,
and technology (SMET) disciplines.

Products will include the AGEP Evaluation Framework; evaluation models; and
evaluation tools and protocols. Dissemination of evaluation information and
materials will be done in print and web site format. In addition, AAAS will host
3 AGEP evaluation workshops to help Alliance members understand how to use the
AGEP Evaluation Framework, models, and tools.
