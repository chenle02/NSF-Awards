As part of this project the principal investigators will develop an ocean bottom
seismometer with a pressure sensor to be used to measure the deformation of the
sea bed due to passing trains of sea-surface waves. In order to increase the
coupling between the sea bed and the instrument, the PI's propose to design a
hydraulic system that will bury the seismometer housing in the sea bed. The
instrument will be deployed on the Oregon accretionary prism where it will be
used to determine the bold porosity and permeability of the prism. These
measurements are of great importance in modeling the deformation of the prism.
