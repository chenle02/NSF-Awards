Cross-modal transfer (CMT) occurs when a person (or animal) learns to perform a
task in response to cues in one sensory modality (e.g., audition) and then
learns an essentially similar task in response to cues of a different modality
(e.g., vision). The rate of learning the second task is faster than it would be
without having had the prior training experience. Dr. Delay is studying the
effects of post-injury, cross-modal transfer of learning on recovery of
behavioral function following brain damage. His early studies have already
shown, for example, that prior training to an auditory stimulus aids in the
recovery of ability to detect a change in light intensity following damage to
the visual areas of the cerebral cortex. This research is helping us understand
the more general conditions (e.g., cue characteristics) necessary for CMT to
enhance behavioral recovery after brain injury. These experiments also provide
insights into brain-behavior relationships which, ultimately, will contribute to
the foundation of clinical rehabilitation programs.
