This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Women and students from underrepresented groups are being
especially targeted for support. Building on a successful LSAMP program in the
state, student scholars are enrolled in engineering and are being recruited from
high schools as well as community colleges in the state. The project is
providing individualized monitoring, workshops, disciplinary and professional
seminars, tutoring, and research opportunities to scholars. There is significant
industry and institutional support for the program.
