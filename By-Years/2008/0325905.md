All speech-to-speech translation systems to-date have focused on domain-limited
tasks such as travel planning, scheduling, and hotel reservation. STR-DUST
focuses on the exploration of new algorithmic approaches that break through this
limitation to enable domain-unrestricted speech translation (as would be needed
for translating telephone conversations, lectures, meetings, broadcasts etc.)
These approaches build on learning approaches and multiple layers of reductions
and transformation to extract the desired content from an utterance in one
language and render it in another language. The project builds on progress in
statistical text translation, spoken language summarization as well as
conversational speech recognition and merges these critical components in a
jointly trainable framework to achieve unrestricted speech translation. All
components are developed under a statistical framework so as to jointly optimize
overall speech translation performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also
involves collaboration between research partners in Europe and the US. It will
carry out an aggressive, bold research plan while developing a strong
multinational educational program. The collaboration develops joint courses,
seminars and workshops to train young scientists in Machine Translation, Speech,
and Language Processing in an international and multilingual setting. In
addition, the prject has impact in its educational mission by training a new
generation of MT savvy, multilingual and internationally adept scientists.
