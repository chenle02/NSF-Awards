The National Youth Science Camp Foundation offers a three-week summer
enrichment program for 2 outstanding high school graduates from each state who
have interest in science careers. The goal of the program is to honor
outstanding academic achievement, foster leadership development and encourage
pursuit of science careers. Activities include lectures and seminars by noted
scientists and community leaders, site visits to government and industry science
facilities and a variety of recreational programs. This year lectures will be
videotaped for distribution to schools across the state. The State which
established the program in 1963 has provided the major funding to date. However
authorization of this year's budget has been delayed and the program will be
cancelled if alternative funding is not identified by the June 29 start date.
This program offers a unique opportunity for talented students and is similar in
purpose to the Graduate Fellowship Programs.
