This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement-Instrumentation Project will
lead to the development of an undergraduate laboratory to support instruction in
telecommunications and networks. The laboratory will reinforce concepts, provide
insight into both theoretical and practical issues, and develop the students
expertise in network design and performance evaluation. The laboratory will be
designed for flexibility and will support multiple environments to offer a
variety of learning experiences and to facilitate use in other courses. Key
components of the laboratory include network hosts, both shared and switched
Ethernet networks, wireless local area network equipment, network monitoring and
management tools, and hardware and software to serve as real-time audio and
video traffic sources. This integration of voice, video, and data matches
industry trends and engages students in the learning process. Laboratory
configuration guidelines and a modular laboratory manual will be developed and
made available via the World Wide Web.
