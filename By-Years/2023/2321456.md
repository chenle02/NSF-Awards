The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in developing a novel dental sealer
technology for root canal treatments for endodontists and general dentists. The
complex and inaccessible nature of the root canal system causes 65% of root
canal fillings to fail. Expandable dental sealers used during root canal
treatments provide an effective solution by filling the gaps in the canal space
by preventing leakage, enabling clinicians to perform the procedure with greater
ease and accuracy. This project’s commercial impact includes an addressable
market of 22.3 million root canal treatments annually. The proposed innovation
supports enhanced patient safety, reduced time at the dentists'/endodontists'
office and decreased costs for patients, reduced risk of infection and
retreatment, and advanced capabilities of clinicians through training.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will characterize
the expansion and other properties of the patented elastomeric polyurethane
sealer (EPS). The project will begin by generating a functionalized and
optimized formula of the EPS using additive ingredients. The team will perform
in vitro testing to evaluate the material’s physicochemical properties. Finally,
the study will establish the in vivo histocompatibility of EPS using animal
models and check its cytotoxicity, a key hurdle that must be overcome before
clinical evaluation and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) registration. These
studies will facilitate the development of an entirely new type of dental
sealer.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
