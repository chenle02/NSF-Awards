9360035 Daughton A novel magnetic field sensing device is proposed which uses
the magnetic stray field from a Neel wall in a soft (low coercivity) magnetic
thin film to bias a Giant Magnetoresistence Ratio (GMR) sensor layer, thereby
providing a high resistance change in the sensor layer with a low applied field.
Precise lithography (<0.5um) is required to etch the sensor layer to the proper
width and to locate the sensor properly with respect to a domain wall in the
soft layer. Techniques to control the position of the domain wall will be
explored. A demonstration device will demonstrate the feasibility of the concept
in Phase I, and it will show at least a 5% change in resistance for an applied
field of 2 Oe or less. This demonstration will also clearly show that 10% of
higher magnetoresistance is feasible with less than one Oe of applied field. ***
