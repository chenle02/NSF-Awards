A nonintrusive optical technique is to be developed for experimental
measurements in sediment-laden flows. Flow velocities, particulate velocities,
and sediment concentrations are to be determined. The instrumentation will be
used in a sediment flume to determine flow characteristics close to the fluid-
sediment bed interface. Increased resolution and refinement in the measurement
of turbulence and sediment characteristics for flow over movable sediment will
permit more realistic modeling and prediction of flow rates, erosion, and
sediment transport in rivers, channels, and canals.
