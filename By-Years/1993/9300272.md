The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Penn State provides
opportunities for Mechanical Engineering students to participate in research
related to real problems involved in manufacturing systems, control systems,
thermal systems and fluid mechanics. The research projects proposed assume
completion of the junior year in a standard mechanical engineering curriculum
and build upon the students' education in one or more of the following courses:
dynamics, kinematics, controls, fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Students
selected to participate in the program are offered the opportunity to visit the
campus prior to the start of the summer experience. During the visit, they meet
with the PIs and the research advisors. Matching of the students and advisors is
thus accomplished prior to the start of the research experience. The research
experience is on a one-on-one basis with the advisor; however, group
opportunities to exchange ideas between the REU participants and faculty are
organized throughout the summer. Formal presentation of the research takes place
during the final week.
