Advances in video imaging technology in the medical sciences have led to the
wide-spread use of computed tomography (CT) scanners, magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, ultrasound imaging, and chest radiography. However, similar broad-based
progress in video imaging technology for optical microscopy has not occurred,
partly because the high resolution color images of ordinary microscopes cannot
be easily duplicated by ordinary video means. The objective of this research is
to show the feasibility of an advanced-concept, three-color video microscope
suitable for both routine analysis and research applications. Features will
include real-time, three-color video images, instantaneous zoom, very low
illumination power, selective contrast enhancement, and highly linear
densitometry. Data resolution matches the diffraction limit of the optics over a
wide range of magnification. Operation in a confocal mode will also be possible.
The instrument would be valuable in many areas of medical and industrial
analysis that currently use optical microscopes--including hematology, cytology,
pathology, textiles, and microelectronics.
