This award supports a summer institute in research methods and project design
for cultural anthropology graduate students. Expert social science
methodologists will teach a set of 15 graduate students, chosen competitively
from doctoral programs throughout the United States, in an intensive three week
course. Course content will include: the relationship between theory and
research objectives, concepts, definitions, variables, measures and hypotheses;
the relationship between quantitative and qualitative approaches in the
ethnographic context; systematic data collection procedures; probability and
non-probability sampling; statistical distributions and elementary data
analysis. The emphasis will be on concepts of research design, data management
in both qualitative and quantitative contexts, and strategies of hypothesis
testing.

Anthropological research is inherently interdisciplinary and incorporates a wide
variety of research methods. This program, which supplements the training
students receive in their home departments, has trained over 204 students from
58 different institutions to date. This training increases the competence of
students to do significant dissertation research projects and to become more
proficient professional social scientists.
