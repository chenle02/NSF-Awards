This project aims to characterize the 11 desaturases of the cabbage looper moth.
Specifically, the DNA sequence of the gene for this enzyme will be determined
and compared with similar sequences isolated from desaturase genes in other moth
species. It is intended subsequently to extend this work to examine the 10
desaturases in primitive lepidoptera and then to move on to other genes that
encode other enzymes involved in pheromone biosynthesis. Sex pheromones are
chemical compounds that play a crucial role in insect reproduction. Major
components of these pheromones are synthesized in female sex pheromone glands.
In this research the principal investigators build on detailed knowledge of
pheromone biochemistry by addressing the structure and regulation of the genes
encoding these enzymes. The work employs new techniques of molecular biology and
should considerably broaden our present horizons about the pheromone
communication system so as to provide a basis for gene manipulation in
connection with novel insect control strategies.***//
