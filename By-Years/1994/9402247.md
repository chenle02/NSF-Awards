9402247 Navarro Delaware County Community College requests support from NSF for
connection of its campus network to JVNCnet. JVNCnet is the midlevel network
located in the state of New Jersey and it will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Delaware County Community College a
connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The college needs greater functionality and network
speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers
along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity
for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
