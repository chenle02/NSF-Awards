9411552 Chandrasekhar The award is for the purchase of a cylindrical grinding
machine and a high-speed grinding spindle which will be used to support research
on grinding processes. The equipment will be used for several research projects
including grinding of hardened steels for tribological performance, chemically
assisted grinding of ceramics, microelectromechanical sensors for torque and
contact pressure measurements, cylindrical grinding temperatures, grinding
wheel-work contact stiffness and high-performance grinding with CBN and diamond
wheels on high-speed spindles. The research will result in better understanding
of the contact mechanics and dynamics of precision, cylindrical grinding. Since
this process is widely used in the automotive industry and for manufacturing
precision components in a variety of industries, the results of the research are
potentially useful in a broad range of applications.
