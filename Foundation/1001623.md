In the project, Solecki will explore several problems whose solutions will
involve interactions of a number of areas of mathematics: logic, topology, and
combinatorics. Solecki has been investigating properties of the pseudo-arc,
which can be thought of as the generic curve, with emphasis on a certain
dynamical problem concerning the group of symmetries of this mathematical
object. The analysis done so far indicates that the solution to the problem lies
on the intersection of descriptive set theory and model theory (branches of
logic), Ramsey theory (a branch of combinatorics), and topological dynamics (a
branch of topology). To be more precise, by a work of Irwin and Solecki that
uses model theoretic ideas, the dynamical problem can be translated into a
purely Ramsey theoretic question concerning finite objects. A more recent work
of Solecki shows that structural Ramsey theoretic theorems of the appropriate
type do hold in certain situations. One of the aims of this project is to extend
these combinatorial results. The desired extension is in a very close agreement
with the expected internal developments of structural Ramsey theory. In another
part of the project, Solecki will apply methods coming from descriptive set
theory and topology to classifying mathematical structures that involve directed
orders and come from various areas of mathematics.

In the project, Solecki will apply techniques and notions developed in
mathematical logic and in combinatorics to problems in other areas of
mathematics. For example, he will investigate the symmetries of a space called
the pseudo-arc. These types of spaces were first introduced in mathematics in
the first quarter of the twentieth century as curious examples of complicated
curves. Today, we know that they appear naturally in many mathematical contexts,
for example, in fluid dynamics, in smooth dynamical systems living in Euclidean
spaces, among topological groups, in the study of continuous functions, etc.
Solecki intends to gain a better understanding of the pseudo-arc by using
methods from diverse subfields of mathematics (combinatorics, logic). Problems
that have arisen in these investigations have already lead to new theorems that
are of purely combinatorial and of purely topological interest. Such mutually
stimulating interactions between distinct areas of mathematics are expected to
continue. In a similar manner, other parts of the project feature interactions
of descriptive set theory, model theory, topological dynamics, and combinatorics
in the study of extreme amenability and in classification of mathematical
objects according to Tukey reductions.
