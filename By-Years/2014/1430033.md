Traditionally, there has been an isolation of responsibilities of physical layer
(PHY) and higher layers of the network stack leading to severe inefficiencies in
bandwidth-limited wireless networks. Remedying these inefficiencies requires
rethinking and redesigning wireless protocols such that higher layers and PHY
work in synergy. This project explores three schemes under the PHY-Informed
Networking (PHY-IN) framework. 1) Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Notification (CSMA/CN) mechanism detects and aborts collisions, breaking away
from the existing collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) based schemes such as 802.11. 2)
Constellation BAsed Rate (CBAR) adaptation scheme jumps to the best feasible
rate suitable for a varying channel. 3) Remap scheme permutes bit-to-subcarrier
assignment for a retransmission to improve the chances of its success. The PHY-
IN framework has the potential to impact the landscape of future wireless
networking protocols. Apart from mentoring both undergraduate and graduate
students into independent researchers, this project, involving an EPSCoR
university and a research lab, will also help broaden the participation and
industry collaboration.
