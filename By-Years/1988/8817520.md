This research is intended to elucidate the mechanism by which force is developed
by the interaction of myosin and actin molecules in muscle (and in a number of
other motile systems) and will focus on the dynamics of the changes taking place
in the crossbridges in striated muscle during contraction. It has long been
established that muscle contraction is brought about by a sliding filament
mechanism, in which partially overlapping arrays of actin and myosin filaments
are acted on by a relative sliding force which leads to shortening of the
muscle. It is generally believed that this force is generated by a cyclic
interaction of myosin crossbridges with sites on the actin filaments. However,
the structural details of the process have proved to be particularly difficult
to establish, partly because of the transient and unsynchronized nature of many
of the changes taking place, and partly because of the technical difficulty of
obtaining submicroscopic structural information about any rapidly changing
biological system. The development of rapid freezing techniques by Heuser and
others has now made it possible in principle to obtain electron microscope
images of these transient structural states and suitable variations of these
techniques will be developed to enable correlations to be made with evidence
derived from time-resolved x-ray diffraction studies. These approaches should
provide important new information about the structural behavior of the
crossbridges as they interact with actin and develop force. When combined with
new information from biochemical and physiological studies, the results of the
present work should materially advance our understanding of this very
fundamental biological mechanism.
