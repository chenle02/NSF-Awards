The focus of this project is to investigate the yields of secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) in an environmental chamber as a function of VOC/NOx levels and
oxidant exposure. SOA formed from the OH oxidation of organic precursors happens
mostly during the daytime. However, NO3 radicals are abundant at night. These
elevated NO3 levels can also coincide with elevated levels of VOCs/IVOCs due to
lower nighttime boundary layer heights, which may result in significant
nighttime SOA formation. The chamber results will be used to model the
underlying oxidation mechanisms and to relate them to atmospheric photochemical
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide new insight into the
formation of secondary organic particles in the atmosphere and the oxidative
aging of these particles. The results are important for understanding how
aerosols influence the cooling and heating of the atmosphere and alter climate.
