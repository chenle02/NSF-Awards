This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Cornell University to acquire a
Siemen's SMART X-ray diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector.This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) natural
products, (2) novel solid state compounds, (3) X-ray crystallographic studies of
purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogs, (4) application of X-ray
crystallographic to chemical ecology, (5) biologically-inspired advanced
materials, and (6) metal organic chemistry. The X-ray diffractometer is used to
make accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure
of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules.
