This award supports the continuing research of the Principal Investigator at the
interface of algebraic geometry in mathematics and string theory in theoretical
physics. Algebraic geometry is the investigation of algebraic solutions of
polynomial equations, the geometry of the graphs of these solutions, and the
theoretical structure describing their properties. It has numerous applications
in science and engineering, including geometric modeling, robotics, control
theory, coding theory, phylogenetics, as well as the application to string
theory being advanced in this project. String theory is a physical theory which
provides a framework for a unified field theory incorporating all of the forces
and particles found in nature. String theory has found wide application beyond
unified field theory, including condensed matter physics, black hole physics,
and the application to mathematics being advanced in this project. The Principal
Investigator will involve graduate students and postdocs in aspects of the
project, assisting their professional development and contributing to the
development of the scientific workforce.

In more technical terms, the project will concern itself with three interrelated
areas: BPS Geometry, Singularities, and String Theory. BPS states are certain
supersymmetric states which play a fundamental role in many supersymmetric
physical theories. Geometric techniques will be applied to advance the theory of
the associated BPS invariants and their refinements, including orientations on
the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau threefold, Fourier-
Mukai transforms as global symmetries of physical theories, a new theory of log
BPS invariants, and advancing the connection between Bridgeland stability in
mathematics and Pi-stability in physics. The geometric study of singularities is
incorporated into this project in at least two ways: canonical threefold
singularities can be used to engineer 5 dimensional superconformal field
theories, and certain codimension 2 singularities can be used to engineer gauge
theories analogous to the Hitchin system. Proposed research in string theory
proper includes a more careful analysis of the holomorphic anomaly equation with
particular attention to the Principal Investigator's earlier work on BPS
invariants of elliptic fibrations and Jacobi forms.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
