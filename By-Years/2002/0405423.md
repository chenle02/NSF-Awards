Proposal: DMS-0405423&lt;br/&gt;PI: Giovanni Leoni&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Singularly Perturbed and Multiscale
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central theme of
this proposal is the application of modern mathematics to materials science in
order to study the macroscopic behavior of materials at small length scale. The
PI proposes the following specific studies: &lt;br/&gt;Dislocations. Planned
here is a variational formulation of the equilibrium problem for a finite number
of dislocations in a plane domain, and the characterization of the energy
content of a body with isolated defects in terms of a regular function of the
defect configuration, the renormalized energy. &lt;br/&gt;Generalized Wulff
shapes of second-phase particles and voids in the presence of bulk elasticity.
The PI plans to study the influence on corner angles of the interaction between
elasticity, surface energy and the corner regularization.&lt;br/&gt;Elastic
solid-state phase transitions. Planned here is the study of a higher order
variational model for the fine scale structure of twinning of two-phase variants
of martensite in the presence of an austenite-twinning martensite
interface.&lt;br/&gt;Micromagnetics. In the study of the microstructure of
ferromagnetic materials simplified models, usually derived by neglecting or
simplifying various terms in the micromagnetic energy, have been proposed in
particular regimes. The PI plans to study the complete micromagnetic energy in
order to determine the length scale and the fine geometry of the refinement, as
well as domain branching, that is, the separation of scales of the domain widths
at the boundary and at the center of the body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defects in
crystals, microstructures, and phase transitions play a key role in determining
properties of materials. Thus, understanding their structure is necessary in
achieving desired material properties and optimized performance. While electron
microscopy and experimental activity have provided a great deal of detailed
information on structures, the integration of mathematical modeling, analysis
with experimental approaches promises to greatly increase our understanding of
phase transformations, ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and martensitic materials,
nanomaterials, thin films and self-assembled structures.&lt;br/&gt;
