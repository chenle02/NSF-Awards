Benjamin Widom at Cornell University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to pursue research on the theory of fluids,
phase transitions and interfaces. He will extend the understanding of
interfacial tensions in binary fluids, continue efforts in the area of
hydrophobicity, and investigate the interfaces of phase-separated solutions
consisting of two polymers and a solvent. His theoretical approach relies on
classical density-functional theory coupled with statistical mechanical and
thermodynamical analyses. Progress in this field is both timely and difficult
due to the complicated interactions between atomistically large solute molecules
and the solvent. Work in this area is important to the understanding of
biological processes and has proved to be useful in environmentally friendly
methods for oil recovery.

This project will determine the conditions needed for two disparate polymers to
mix together or separate into two liquids. Such an understanding is necessary
for developing strategies for environmentally friendly means for oil recovery.
Understanding the mechanisms and manifestations associated with the repulsion
between polymers and water (e.g., hydrophobicity) will yield key insights and
identify important questions in the emerging field of computational biology. In
particular, hydrophobic forces are primarily responsible for protein folding.
