Abstract 9531634 Burns In this REU Site program the students will work on
programs in electronic materials, energy conversion devices, growth techniques,
semiconductor device design and fabrication, photonic bandgap structures and
microwave devices. As part of their research training the students take a
4-credit hour laboratory-oriented course during the summer, which will teach
them about fabrication and characterization techniques in semiconductor
materials and devices. The students will be supervised by faculty in the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Microelectronics
Research Center.
