This award provides partial funding for a technical position in the College of
Oceanography at the Oregon State University. The funds will be used to support a
technician who will assist in the operation of the College's electron microprobe
instrument. The electron microprobe at Oregon State University is used
intensively by a large group of researchers in oceanography, earth sciences,
materials science and engineering whose research requires chemical microanalysis
capabilities for solid materials on the micron scale.
