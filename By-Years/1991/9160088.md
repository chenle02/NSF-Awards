Management and search of large databases is a computational bottleneck in many
domains. One attractive approach to eliminating it is to exploit recent advances
in parallel computer hardware and processing. However, the development of
software that permits this represents one of the major challenges facing
computer scientists. This project proposes to develop a generic approach to
parallel database management that should be especially suitable for large
databases of complex objects in which even single object comparisons may be
computationally costly. (Examples include databases of image data, in which
database search may require numerous comparisons of complicated images.) This
approach is based on the use of Linda, a commercial product of Scientific
Computing Associates, Inc. Linda systems provide convenient access to
parallelism from within familiar high-level languages such as C or Fortran. In
Phase I, a fast text retrieval system will be developed for asynchronous
multiprocessors. This will serve as proof of concept for more general software
to be investigated in Phase II work. Due to the use of Linda, the technology
developed will be not only efficient, but also portable across vastly different
parallel architectures including both explicitly parallel computers and local-
area networks of workstations functioning as parallel "hypercomputers".
