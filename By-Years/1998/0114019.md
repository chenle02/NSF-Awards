This project will work to enable the design, development, and testing of
standards for entries in gazetteers and explore the complexity levels of
gazetteers required for research in the humanities and history of computing.
Gazetteers are structured records about locations and their place names. Digital
libraries research is increasingly concerned with the ability to link place
names and map locations. Toponym-rich text and maps are lined effectively
through the use of gazetteers. Making robust gazetteer information to users and
contributors of digital libraries resources is key to achieving communicability
among diverse digital resources, as indirect referencing can be employed. These
resources can contribute to a variety of scholarly pursuits across a broad range
of subject areas.
