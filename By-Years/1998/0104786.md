Disturbance often enhances diversity by creating a refuge allowing the
persistence of fugitive native plants. Many exotic species are also successful
colonizers of disturbances and may compete with native taxa. Thus, the effects
of disturbance on native species in invaded communities are difficult to predict
without an understanding of the differential responses of natives and exotics to
disturbance. Within this context, the proposed research focuses on the effects
of three soil disturbances (mounds, trails, and slides) on native plant species.
Previous research indicates that fire facilitates rare native plants by removing
accumulated leaf litter and exotic plants. Similarly, soil disturbances are
hypothesized to facilitate natives, although exotic species may mitigate this
beneficial effect. The response of native plants to disturbance, the presence of
exotic species, and their interaction will be quantified through a series of
manipulative experiments. The proposed research will document how plant life
history traits and population dynamics interact with disturbance characteristics
to determine temporal patterns within invaded communities.
