The PI is developing a multi-sensor environment for precise, calibrated vision
experiments, controlling imaging optics and sensor parameters to facilitate
quick, accurate measurement of factors such as scene brightness, color, and
illlumination. This environment is used to develop and test a series of vision
sensors and recovery algorithms based on a variety of physical models. The
ultimate goal is an integrated vision system based on a single computational
framework for general visual perception, with enhanced capabilities due to the
incorporation of information about physical principles. The PI is also
developing a comprehensive curriculum for undergraduate and graduate education
in computer vision, incorporating an image library, research-based visual aids
for concept demonstration, and interactive software for hands-on experience in
processing real images.
