Clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the
Universe and provide excellent sensitivity for determining cosmological
parameters. In particular, cosmological simulations predict an approximately
universal form for cluster dark matter mass profiles. This project proposes to
do a modeling analysis of a sample of galaxy clusters. This analysis would
provide three-dimensional shapes and alignments of the gas and dark matter in
these clusters and thus allow for the physical properties of these clusters to
be more accurately estimated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a
three-dimensional triaxial X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and lensing analysis
of the 25 clusters in the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble
(CLASH) sample. The analysis will exploit the different line-of-sight
dependences of the X-ray and SZ signals to constrain the three-dimensional
morphologies of the clusters with the ultimate goal of testing predictions of
Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological models in the context of large-scale
structure formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educationally, the investigators will
make regular classroom visits with primarily low-income, local high school
students of diverse backgrounds to inform and inspire these students about
science. In addition, the investigators will sponsor multi-week summer research
programs with high school students and teachers.
