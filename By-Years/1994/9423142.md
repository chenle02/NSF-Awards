9423142 Schlein This grant supports research in particle physics that focuses on
study of B-meson decays seeking effects of, and explication of, CP violation in
electroweak interactions. Experiments are planned to take place, first at the
HERA accelerator complex in Germany and later at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland. Both are international effects that
involve physicists from many foreign as well as U.S. institutions. The
experiments will address one of the most important problems confronting physics.
