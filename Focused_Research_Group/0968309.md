This multidisciplinary project aims to develop new mathematical methods, at the
interface of the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, statistical
mechanics, graph theory, and statistics, for predictability and control of urban
crime. The project focuses on spatio-temporal crime patterns and includes (1)
new mathematical analysis and comparisons to crime data for discrete and
continuum models of crime hotspots; (2) models with spatially embedded social
networks, especially with regard to gang activity; and (3) exploration of new
methods of Geographic Profiling, incorporating detailed features of urban
terrain and more accurate modes of criminal movement into existing models.
Mathematical work on this project includes analysis of nonlinear PDE models,
analysis of statistical physics models, and further development of these models
to include spatial heterogeneity, different offender movement patterns, and
urban street gang networks. At the same time it provides both a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms behind pattern formation in urban crime and some
useful algorithms and software for local law enforcement agencies.

Mathematics of criminality is an emerging topic in applied mathematics with
interest on a global scale and direct relevance to U.S. homeland security. This
focused research group involves interactions between researchers whose primary
expertise lies within very different fields -- mathematics, physics,
anthropology, and criminology -- so that pattern formation of criminal activity
is dissected and understood from very different viewpoints and perspectives. The
project addresses algorithm development for analyzing real field data and agent-
based simulation tools for urban crime. The research will also develop new
models for urban crime and carry out mathematical analysis of these models. The
project involves training of students and postdoctoral scholars at all levels,
including a significant undergraduate component. Ph.D. students and postdoctoral
scholars will also obtain valuable mentoring experience necessary for
development of their research careers. The work includes direct interaction with
local law enforcement agencies and the Institute for Pure and Applied
Mathematics.
