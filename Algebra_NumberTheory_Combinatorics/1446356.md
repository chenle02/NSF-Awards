This award supports a workshop at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, held from October 31st to November 2nd, 2014. The talks cover a range of
topics spanning algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and topology. The goal of the
workshop is to give predominantly upcoming junior researchers an opportunity to
present their work and to interact with more senior researchers, thereby
encouraging new research collaborations. The grant also supports the attendance
of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at the workshop, and hence
will contribute to the the training of younger mathematicians in some of the
most active areas of mathematical research. Participation of students from
nearby universities is encouraged, to strengthen ties with regional peer
institutions, and diversity among the speakers and the participants is a
priority.

The general themes of the workshop are moduli spaces, derived geometry, and
geometric representation theory. Moduli spaces are spaces that parametrize
geometric objects of some kind, and are ubiquitous in algebraic geometry.
Representation theory is a powerful method of reducing problems in abstract
algebra to simpler problems in linear algebra. Similarly, derived geometry is a
way of reducing geometric problems to problems in homological algebra. There
have been significant recent advances in these areas. Moreover, new connections
between these different areas have been discovered. Derived categories and wall-
crossing formulas have revealed new ways of studying the geometry of moduli
spaces. Methods and ideas from derived geometry and geometric representation
theory are also starting to converge. The workshop brings together experts
working on these topics, and will serve to promote interaction and foster new
collaborations. More details can be found at the conference website
