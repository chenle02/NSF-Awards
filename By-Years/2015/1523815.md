The advent of the Internet gives rise to an exponential growth in data
collection, availability and complexity. With it increases our need for more
efficient data analysis algorithms. Over super-scale datasets, the only feasible
data analysis techniques are iterative linear-time first-order optimization
methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computational bottleneck in applying these
state-of-the-art iterative methods to machine learning and data analysis is
often the so-called "projection step". This project addresses the need to design
projection-free optimization algorithms that replace projections by more
efficient linear optimization steps. A key contribution of the project is the
continual dissemination and transfer of this technology. The open-source
software releases will continue to enable large-scale machine learning
applications in science and engineering. The broader impact goals of the
project, beyond theory and algorithms, include the development of a textbook on
efficient optimization techniques in machine learning, as well as the
development of a new curriculum focused on preparing students for the scientific
and engineering needs in this field.
