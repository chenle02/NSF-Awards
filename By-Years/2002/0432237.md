University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic and Geometric Examples in
Combinatorial Geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We
will study a collection of problems of similar flavor coming&lt;br/&gt;from
different parts of mathematics. The problems are all combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;in
nature and involve estimates on the overlap between various
geometric&lt;br/&gt;objects. We will attempt to produce examples in these
problems by&lt;br/&gt;both algebraic and probabilistic
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great deal of mathematical analysis
involves&lt;br/&gt;handling the infinite. Here however we engage in&lt;br/&gt;a
deep study of the finite. To be precise, we study the ways&lt;br/&gt;in which
finite collections of geometric objects like rectangles,&lt;br/&gt;patterns of
points in a grid, and vectors on a high dimensional&lt;br/&gt;sphere can be
arranged to achieve certain unusual effects.&lt;br/&gt;We will attempt to
discover new and better such arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;One way of doing this is by
using a known algebraic structure&lt;br/&gt;to suggest a construction. Another
possibility is to choose the example randomly&lt;br/&gt;within certain
constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
