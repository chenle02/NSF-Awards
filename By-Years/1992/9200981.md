The recent missions to comets Giacobini Zinner and Halley have resulted in a
deeper understanding of the major physical and chemical processes involved in
the solar wind interaction with a comet. The wealth of in-situ data necessitates
a new level of theoretical modeling. Dr. Flammer will study a number of
outstanding issues in cometary physics which emphasize both macroscopic and
microscopic processes. The research goals are to develop theoretical models to:
(1) Study how the cometary pickup ion distribution function modifies the global
solar wind flow characteristics near a comet over a wide range of heliocentric
distances; (2) Study both the macro and micro physics of the cometary ionopause
and inner shock; (3) Study the interaction of the solar wind with a comet at
large heliocentric distances; (4) Study the ion chemistry outside the cometary
ionopause; and (5) Study the interaction between dust and plasma in the cometary
environment. Dr. Flammer will use analytic theory, numerical techniques, and
plasma simulation codes. These investigations will make use of the existing
cometary data and provide insight for future cometary missions.
