This awards helps fund the development of a 200-year tree-ring chronology for
the Sudan Sahel of West Africa as a means to reconstruct rainfall variability
over the time period. This research will help produce a record of historical
drought from the Sahel since 1800 AD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the
research is that the change from wet conditions in the 1950's and 1960's to
drier conditions in the three decades following over the West African Sahel
represents a strong inter-decadal signal. It is unclear, however, whether
persistent multi-decadal climatic variability is a recurring feature or if
drought represents a new phenomenon in the climate dynamics of the region.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will, by reconstructing one aspect of West
African recent climate history, provide a longer perspective about contemporary
and historical climatic patterns and processes from a region in which climate
and society interact with deadly results. &lt;br/&gt;
