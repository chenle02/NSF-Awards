This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the
use of novel evolution-based data mining software to discover targets for the
development of human therapeutics for currently intractable diseases. Phase I
demonstrated that the evolution-based data-mining software was useful for
dramatically narrowing the search for proteins that make chimpanzees resistant
to the progression of AIDS after infection by HIV-1. In Phase II, the impact on
in-vitro HIV-1 infectivity of a human cell line transfected with the gene
encoding one of the adapted chimpanzee proteins will be assessed. Screening of
other chimpanzee homologs of genes differentially regulated in human cells upon
HIV-1 infection will continue to ensure that all potential AIDS resistance
proteins have been identified. The adapted chimpanzee genes/proteins will be
compared to those from humans in which HIV-1 infection has not progressed to
AIDS for at least 10 years to see if there are any commonalities.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this technology is in the battle
against AIDS disease. The identification of proteins that have undergone
adaptive evolution should lead to drugs to mediate the progression of HIV-1
infection. This same approach may have broader impact against several other
intractable diseases for which non-human primates are less susceptible than
humans. This includes hepatitis-C, sepsis, type-1 diabetes, and certain
cancers.&lt;br/&gt;
