Abstract DBI 9750012 Paulyn Cartwright This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "The Molecular Mechanisms of Sex
Determination in the Evolution of Flowering Plants." It addresses whether the
male sex determining mechanism involving the gene TASSELSEED 2 in maize operates
in other grass species. The research involves characterizing the developmental
morphology, the nature and timing of female organ abortion, and TASSELSEED2
expression in several grass species. This information, mapped onto a phylogeny,
will address whether or not the same mechanism is involved in the evolution of
re-occurring character and is an important first step in understanding the
molecular mechanisms underlying sex determination in flowering plants.
