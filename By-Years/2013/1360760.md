This award will support the establishment of the Critical Zone Observatories
National Office (CZO-NO). The CZO-NO will facilitate coordination of research
and educational programs of the network of Critical Zone observatories (CZO) and
provide a centralized entity, which will represent the network with the
scientific community and the public. On behalf of the CZO program, the CZO-NO
will coordinate activities like sharing of protocols, cross-science programs,
training institutes, and integration with other major research initiatives. To
facilitate communications with the scientific community and the public, the CZO-
NO will update and maintain a program website and implement an outreach and
education plan for the CZO program. The CZO-NO will work with the CZO community
to share CZO discoveries, data and research opportunities with the broad
community capable of using these data and information. The CZO-NO will provide a
venue where scientists, students, and the public can communicate concerning the
sustainable future of the Critical Zone.
