Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the
possibility that the "elementary particles" are the vibrational states of
extremely tiny strings, or perhaps of tiny membranes. Efforts will be made both
to develop this possibility further, and to explore its experimental
consequences. The speculation that the elementary particles may be understood in
terms of tiny strings has excited very considerable interest because of the
belief that the string picture may provide a consistent and unified theory of
all of the basic forces of nature.
