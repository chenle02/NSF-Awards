A large uncertainty exists concerning the quantitative ability of the oceans to
take up anthropogenic CO2. A more complete understanding of the relationship
between ocean and atmospheric chemistries would broaden the ability of science
to predict the magnitude and rate of global warming so that appropriate
countermeasures could be developed and implemented. An analytical instrument is
needed to make continuous measurements of the CO2 concentration above and below
the oceanic surfaces. For the large scale studies needed, the instrument will
have to function unattended, allowing placement on surface buoys or ships, and
be able to transmit data to a central data collection station. It will be
developed to withstand the extreme environmental conditions routinely
encountered at sea and utilize a new solid state sensor technology that has the
potential performance and cost features suitable for remote monitoring of the
CO2 levels in both shallow and deep ocean waters. The proposed system will
include the data acquisition and telemetry electronics for automated monitoring
at remote locations.
