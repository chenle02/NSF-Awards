This is a Faculty Early Career project, the research part of which deals with
titanium dioxide as a photooxidation catalyst for environmental remediation by
degradation. The project will study the organic intermediate buildup and decay
during titanium dioxide catalyzed photooxidation. Many groups have studied
titanium dioxide for the present purposes but the usual approach is to
investigate the initial step and to assume that subsequent intermediates are
rapidly mineralized. Use of titanium dioxide with dilute solutions of toxics (as
in the real world one must) will leave intermediates largely to decay
spontaneously and the biological consequences will only be known when the nature
and concentrations of the intermediates are known. The project will be one of
only a few, and the only led by a synthetic chemist, using this approach. The
educational work centers on making students more active participants in the
learning process. Dr. Jenks will develop undergraduate laboratory experiments
along the lines of this research. In this project the intermediates in one
possible future technology, catalyzed light-induced decomposition of organic
environmental contaminants, will be studied. The project will provide
information from which the possibility of introduction of biohazards will be
studied. The project will also emphasize student-centered learning and the
integration of this research into undergraduate laboratory teaching.
