An on-line PTH analyzer will enhance the capabilities of a newly acquired
protein/peptide sequencer. Rapid, accurate and micro- scale determination of the
specific amino acid sequence in proteins and peptides of importance has become
necessary for many types of biochemical, molecular and structural research.
Biomedical research has been dramatically changed by this technology and its
availability permits scientists to make rapid progress. Specific projects
include: intracellular protein degradation in mammalian cells; the structure of
the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase; characterization of ribonuclease inhibitor; the
mechanism of cellular protein compartmentalization; and the characterization of
phosphatidylinositol kinases.
