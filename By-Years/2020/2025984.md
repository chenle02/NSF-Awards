The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a reduction in the negative effects of
laparoscopies, procedures to enter the abdomen through a small incision. Over 15
million laparoscopies are performed worldwide each year, particularly
gynecologists, who represent roughly half the surgeons performing these
procedures in the U.S. The proposed procedure does not require surgeons to alter
their surgical techniques and requires minimal training. It uses equipment
already in the hospital. The benefits will include better surgical outcomes,
decreased patient post-op pain, and increased surgeon and patient satisfaction.
Furthermore, it can ultimately be used in other surgical interventions, such as
pannus retention, wound management, and liposuction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need
for a less invasive and more reliable method for lifting the abdominal wall
during laparoscopic surgery. Current lifting techniques include manually
grasping the abdominal wall and using invasive perforating towel clips. With
manual grasp it can be difficult for the surgeon to maintain grip and proper
elevation, especially with lean or obese patients. Alternatively, using
perforating towel clips is invasive because the towel clips perforate the
abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The
perforations can be a significant source of post-op discomfort and bruising for
the patient. This project focuses on developing a medical device that uses
suction to attach to and lift the abdominal wall more reliably than manual grasp
and less invasively than perforating towel clips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
