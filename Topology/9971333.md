Abstract: Professor Roberts proposes to study essential laminations in
3-manifolds. There are two main directions of investigation. The first involves
working at better understanding nonexistence of essential laminations, both
through understanding group actions on order trees (in collaboration with
Professor M. Stein) and, more directly, through the use of ``standard forms''.
The second involves searching for constructions which give new information about
exceptional surgeries on knots and links.

In this research, Professor Roberts investigates questions concerning the
structure of 3-manifolds, which are spaces formed by piecing together blocks of
3-dimensional space according to certain rules. Globally, the spaces obtained
are usually quite complex and model many interesting phenomena. Our spatial
universe, for example, is a 3-manifold which it is crucial to understand. The
study of 3-manifolds is also important in the study of the knotting and linking
of strings in 3-dimensional space, which in turn is important in the study of
the structure of DNA.
