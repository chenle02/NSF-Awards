The purpose of this research is to undertake a combined experimental,
computational and analytical study that will provide a fundamental
understanding, and quantify the nature of, damage and stress redistribution
ahead of the crack tip for creep brittle materials such as ceramics,
intermetallics and powder metallurgy alloys, including process zone effects and
transient loading conditions. It is also proposed to establish appropriate
local/global crack extension criteria for growing creep cracks in creep brittle
materials. Unique granular flow solutions for grain boundary sliding associated
with boundary diffusion and/or viscosity are expected to shed light on
appropriate process zone size scales and driving forces for void growth and
coalescence/ These results will be used to construct appropriate crack tip
damage models to be used with finite element analysis to better understand the
physics which will be evident from the experiments. These advances should have
important implications for improving failure predictions of components made of
creep brittle materials.
