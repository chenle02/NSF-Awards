This project will provide partial funding to the University of Michigan
Biological Station for construction of a modern research greenhouse to
facilitate research on plants, insects and the interactions between plants, and
insects. The current lack of a greenhouse at the Station seriously impedes the
ability of scientists to conduct experimental studies on plants and insects. The
greenhouse will permit experimental studies to be conducted in the subject areas
of plant genetics, plant ecology, forestry, insect behavior, insect ecology and
plant-insect interactions. The greenhouse will complement very well the
excellent opportunities for field studies and the modern research laboratory
facilities that already exist at the Biological Station.
