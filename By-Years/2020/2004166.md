The Connecticut Summer School in Number Theory (CTNT 2020) is a summer school in
number theory for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, to be
followed by a research conference, taking place at at the University of
Connecticut, Storrs campus, from June 8 through June 14, 2020. The summer school
will achieve several outcomes: expose undergraduate and beginning graduate
students to accessible topics that are fundamental to contemporary number
theory; provide an environment where students interested in number theory can
meet each other and network with students, postdocs, and faculty from
institutions where number theory is a strong research area; train women and
underrepresented minorities on topics of current importance in number theory;
allow advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students to attend a
research conference in number theory; videotape the lectures and post them
online at a dedicated website to reach as wide of an audience as possible
later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTNT 2020 will consist of a 4.5-day summer school
followed by a 2-day conference. The summer school will have six mini-courses on
topics important to contemporary number theory that are not available in a
typical college curriculum, such as local fields, infinite Galois theory, curves
over finite fields, and computational number theory. The courses will be
complemented with course projects, daily invited talks, evening problem
sessions, and discussion panels about aspects of graduate school (both for those
already in graduate school and those thinking of applying). The conference will
consist of several sessions with research talks in number theory, arithmetic
geometry, and related topics, and it will be an opportunity for young
researchers to present their work. The conference website is https://ctnt-

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
