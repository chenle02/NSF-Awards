The PIs will conduct research on how to analyze data developed in situations of
asymmetric information. The goal is to develop new ways to conduct structural
estimation of auction models and to extend these methods to the estimation of
contract models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first part of the project, they
will continue their previous work on econometric methods for the analysis of
auction data. In particular, they will develop ways to estimate parameters of
the bidder's utility function from data on bidding behavior. The new method will
be used to analyze data from US Forest Service Timber auctions. The second part
of the project will develop new econometric methods for the estimation of
incentive models of regulation. They will develop both fully parametric and
nonparametric estimators. These methods will be used to analyze data from public
regulatory commissions that regulate French public transit and California water
utilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, this research will identify and
estimate risk aversion in auctions and will also develop the econometrics of
regulation models, while minimizing prior parametric restrictions in each case.
The methods will improve the techniques used by industry analysts, regulators,
and other public policy makers to analyze data in these markets.
