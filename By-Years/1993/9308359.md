ABSTRACT -- CTS 9308359 Prescott Funding is requested from NSF to support the
initiation of a research program aimed at improving the understanding of
convective transport phenomena during solid-liquid phase change of binary metal
alloys. Since the transport of momentum, heat, and species strongly influence
the metallurgical structure, chemical homogeneity, formation of voids, and
entrapment of inclusions in solidified materials, improvements in phase change
processes depend on having a detailed understanding of the attendant transport
phenomena. Binary solid-liquid phase change processes are further complicated by
coupling between micro- and macro-scale phenomena which is to be examined in the
proposed project. A combined experimental and theoretical approach is proposed
to study transport phenomena in metal alloys. The experimental portion of the
study will utilize neutron radiography to perform post-experimental chemical
analyses of ingot sections, as well as to obtain real-time records of species
redistribution during phase change. The theoretical portion of the study will
involve numerical computations based on a continuum model to account for
stochastic behavior of the two phase (mushy) region and non-equilibrium effects,
such as undercooling and recalescence.
