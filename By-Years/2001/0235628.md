Snakes form a natural group of squamate reptiles, an evolutionary lineage that
also includes lizards and amphisbaenians. The evolutionary origin of snakes
within squamate reptiles is a longstanding, unresolved problem, mainly because
several lineages of lizards have independently evolved a snake-like body form
(extreme body elongation coupled with limb reduction or complete loss) and basic
skull structure. This creates difficult problems for the reconstruction of the
evolutionary history (phylogeny) of snakes due to independently evolved
(convergent) similarity. In contemporary reptile systematics, two main
hypotheses are at the heart of current debate on snake origins: a marine origin
of snakes from the extinct, aquatic mosasaurs or a burrowing/terrestrial origin
of snakes from fossorial or terrestrial lizards such as the burrowing dibamids
or amphisbaenians, or the terrestrial monitor lizards. This debate has recently
been fueled by the description of fossil (Upper Cretaceous) snakes that combine
a skull structure typical of evolutionarily advanced snakes with the presence of
well-developed hind limbs (a presumably primitive feature). &lt;br/&gt;For this
research, the problem of snake origins is broken down into the following
questions: What group of squamates is most closely related to snakes? What are
the relationships among the major groups of snakes? What do the answers to these
questions tell us about the ecology of snake origins (aquatic vs. terrestrial)
and about the morphological evolution of the snake body plan? Research
addressing these questions will focus on anatomical investigation of all
relevant fossil and living taxa, yielding results that will be combined with
relevant molecular data. All anatomical characters used to date in the debate
about snake origins will be re-evaluated, and new morphological data will be
generated through the initiation of anatomical projects focused on understudied
and/or controversial character systems. This will involve organ systems that
either are at the center of current discussion (such as the development of the
snake dentition), or that are essential for understanding the evolution of the
snake body plan (such as patterns of change in the axial musculature and
vertebral column that are correlated with the elongation of the body and the
reduction or loss of limbs). Student training in anatomical investigative
techniques and in methods of phylogeny reconstruction will form an integral part
of this research project. Mastering anatomical complexity and methods of
phylogenetic systematics, as well as the combination of anatomical and molecular
data, are prerequisite for a modern approach to the study of biodiversity in all
its aspects.&lt;br/&gt;
