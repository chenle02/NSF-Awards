This project brings together science and mathematics and education stakeholders
in the Northern San Francisco Bay Area, the Sonoma State University Schools of
Education and of Science and Technology, Beginning Teacher Support and
Assessment programs in the area, and several school districts, including Sonoma
Valley Unified School District, Roseland School District, Petaluma City Schools.
It capitalizes on the strengths, opportunities and existing connections between
the university and the K-12 schools and on existing supports for science and
mathematics teacher recruitment. It addresses the need for highly qualified
science and mathematics teachers by proactively recruiting and supporting
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors who are pre-
teacher candidates during their junior, senior and post-baccalaureate pre-
certification years and providing a career change opportunity for people with
STEM majors and in STEM careers who want to enter the teaching profession as
STEM teachers. The program is providing twelve Noyce scholarships of up to
$10,000 each during each of the program's five years. These scholarships can be
combined with benefits available under an existing program designed to offset
tuition costs for students preparing to become STEM teachers, the Science
Mathematics Teacher Recruitment and Retention Initiative.

The intellectual merit of the program is found in what is being learned about
the value of these approaches to increasing the supply of well qualified STEM
teachers to schools in these areas with particular attention to high needs
schools

The broader impact resides in the number of school districts that will benefit
from the graduates of the Noyce scholarship program.
