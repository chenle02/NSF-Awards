The growth of Government is the most dramatic, yet least understood, change in
the American economy in the last century. While most studies have focused on the
growth of the federal government, state governments also expanded rapidly and
often experimented with programs that were later introduced at the federal
level. The purpose of this research is to better understand the role of the
states in the growth of government by analyzing the adoption of workers'
compensation, America's first major social insurance program. The research will
combine both macro analysis of the timing of adoption of workers' compensation
with detailed and quantitative case studies of the passage of the laws in
several important states. The extent to which workers' compensation benefitted
or harmed various groups will be estimated, including workers of various skill
levels, unionized workers, employers of different sizes and different accident
experience, insurance companies, taxpayers, and state officials. Based on these
empirical estimates, how groups and individuals translated their expected
economic returns into political action will be analyzed. This research is
important because it will provide a better understanding of the interaction of
the economic and political systems in the development of the American economy.
