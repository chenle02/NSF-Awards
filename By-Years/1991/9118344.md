In late June 1992, the Field Museum of Natural History, the University of
Illinois at Chicago and the University of Chicago will host the Fifth North
American Paleontological Convention (NAPC.V) under the auspices of the
Association of North American Paleontological Societies (ANAPS). The primary
objectives of NAPC.V are to : i) encourage scientific and professional
interactions between different subdisciplines in paleontology; ii) provide
improved opportunities for the participation of students in major national and
international meeting; iii) stimulate integration of paleontological expertise
into research with biology and geology in the broad sense. NSF support will
attain these objectives by: i) partially covering the costs associated with the
participation of six plenary speakers from different subdisciplines in
paleontology in NAPC.V, as well as key paleontologists (especially junior
faculty, students and participants from overseas) who are contributing to
scheduled interdisciplinary symposia; and ii) subsidizing the participation of
students (particularly women and minorities) in NAPC.V.
