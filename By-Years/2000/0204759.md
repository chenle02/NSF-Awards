&lt;br/&gt;This is a study of the kinetics and mechanism of the gas-phase
reaction of hydroxyl (OH) radicals with two-and three-ring polycyclic automatic
aromatic hydrocarons (PAHs); this matter is of fundamental concern in both
combustion and atmospheric chemistry. Experimental data are collected over
extended temperature (300-1200oK) and pressure (50-750 torr) ranges. A pulsed
laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence (PLP/LIF) technique refined for the
study of semivolatile compounds is used for the kinetic and mechanistic
measurements. Experiments include measurements of the effects of pressure on
observed reaction rates and kinetic isotope effects. Experiments are
complemented with a theoretical study of addition and obstruction reactions
using ab initio quantum chemical methods. Transition-state theory (TST) is used
to obtain rate constraints and branching rations, and Rice-Ramperger-Kassel-
Marcus (RRKM) theory to estimate lifetimes of
intermediates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
