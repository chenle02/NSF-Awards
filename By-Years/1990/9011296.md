This is a post-event investigation project to learn engineering lessons from
the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989). The objective of this project is to
analyze and evaluate the effects of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 17 October
1989 on the electric power transmission systems in the earthquake- affected
areas. The studies are intended to develop additional information for defining
seismic fragility functions of major transmission equipment, which are necessary
and essential for a comprehensive reliability analysis of electric power supply
systems for metropolitan areas. The study will also evaluate the perfomance of
the main transmission systems, in terms of the probability of power disruption
at specified service areas caused by the earthquake. The results of the study
program will be prepared to constitute part of a comprehensive report on the
Loma Prieta earthquake. The project will contribute to the definition of the
seismic fragility functions of electric transmission equipment and devices and
to the development of theoretical models for such systems.
