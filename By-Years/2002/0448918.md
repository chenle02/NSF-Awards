Bin Chen of Louisiana State University and A&amp;M College is supported by a
CAREER award to develop the aggregation-volume-bias Monte Carlo (AVBMC) approach
for research on a wide range of rare chemical and biological events. The AVBMC
algortihm is being tailored to fit individual systems by adding histogram-
reweighting and other advanced techniques and by integrating AVBMC into an ab
initio framework. The new simulation methods are being applied to the problem of
protein crystallization in an effort to understand recent experimental studies
and are designed to improve protein crystallization
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CAREER project also involves an educational
component that brings information technology and cutting-edge research results
into the classroom in the form of movies which illustrate real world phenomena
at the molecular scale. These simulations are being used in courses for both
science majors and non-majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the Division of
Chemistry, with co-funding from the Molecular Biophysics program of the Division
of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
