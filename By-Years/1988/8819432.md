This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student in
Botswana, southern Africa. The project examines the historical consciousness of
being exiled of a people (the Herero), which is in contrast with their present
situation of adaptation to their host society. The methodology combines
intensive interviewing on oral life histories and a household survey with
participant observation of the current society. This project is important
because the history of the world can be seen as one of exile, displacement and
other significant population movements. Understanding how some people
rationalize their current situation and come to terms with their sense of exile
can help us understand general patterns of adaptation to population movement
across national borders, which can help ameliorate problems.
