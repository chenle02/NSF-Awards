This research has the purpose of obtaining new information on the dynamics of
high frequency phonons using powerful far infrared phonon generation techniques
coupled with sensitive and tunable optical detection methods. A second project
involves the study of optical dephasing and spectral diffusion using a variety
of techniques probing a wide range of time scales. Far infrared defect-induced
one-phonon absorption permits generation of a tunable monoenergetic phonon
distribution, which when combined with tunable detection employing vibronic
sideband phonon spectroscopy, will permit truly time-resolved phonon
spectroscopy. This spectroscopy will be used to study anharmonic phonon-phonon
interactions responsible for phonon breakup and phonon recombination. The
optical dephasing studies will utilize methods in both the time and frequency
domain. Of special interest are the effects of different time scales for the
determination of homogeneous line width. These results will be analyzed with
stochastic models for the dephasing due to electron spin-spin and electron-
nuclear spin interactions. Computer simulations will also be developed.
