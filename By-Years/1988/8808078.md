This grant will support research in collaboration with scientists at the
National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The research will address several
topics in experimental heavy- ion nuclear physics, including charge exchange,
two-nucleon transfer, and alpha-particle transfer reactions. The grant will make
it possible for undergraduate students and faculty at a primarily undergraduate
institution to take part in forefront research.
