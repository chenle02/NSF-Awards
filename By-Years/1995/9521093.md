9521093 Shanks The size of an adult population of a marine invertebrate is in
part the result of factors affecting the mortality of their planktonic larvae.
In this study the importance of natural predation to the survival of these
meroplankton will be assessed with in situ experiments that seek to test three
hypotheses: 1) larval mortality rate varies directly with the concentration of
planktonic predators, 2) "background" plankton significantly influences
predation rates, and 3) morphology and behavior of meroplankton contribute to
interspecific variation in predation rates. ***
