This research is to develop a model to describe the time course of regional
myocardial activity after a localized lesion of the heart muscle. The innovative
feature of the model is that it uses energy balance to consider myocardial
function, and it takes into account the time varying and highly nonlinear nature
of the system. The research should result in an improved engineering methodology
to describe myocardial ischemia, and it may also lead to new techniques for
controlling cardiovascular assist devices.
