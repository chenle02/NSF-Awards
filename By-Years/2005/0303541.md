EIA 0303541&lt;br/&gt;V. Arunachalam &lt;br/&gt; Carnegie-Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Projects: Workshop on Research Agenda
for Enabling Tools, Technologies and Policies for Sustainable
Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information and Communications Technology
(ICT), because of its reach and richness, offers very significant opportunities
for improving human development and economic growth in sustainable ways. While
some enabling tools and technologies are already available for such
opportunities, more will have to be developed through vigorous R&amp;D programs.
This grant supports a workshop with participation from professionals working in
diverse areas of human and social development, to identify and prioritize new
and imaginative R&amp;D efforts in ICT that would be needed to solve many
debilitating problems of deprivation affecting human society. As a part of the
workshop, a report will be generated incorporating the recommendations of the
participants and suggesting future options for ICT research for sustainable
development. &lt;br/&gt;
