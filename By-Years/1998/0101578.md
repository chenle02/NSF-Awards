CISE NGS: Middleware for Internet Workflow Management

Middleware is a software layer that allows applications to use the resources
provided by a grid. The middleware is expected to perform functions provided by
the operating system of a computer, e.g. resources management and process
management. In case of a tightly coupled system, resource and process management
is under the control of a scheduler, which manages and controls the allocation
of all system resources to process competing for them. The scheduler has
accurate information about the System State. The situation is quite different on
a grid where resources are managed by autonomous entities and the scale of the
system prevents any single entity from knowing accurately the state of the
entire system. This proposal is concerned with middleware for process or
workflow management.
