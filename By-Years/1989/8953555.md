Improved techniques to help students visualize more clearly the basic
principles and relationships in engineering should increase both the quality of
an engineering education and the quantity of engineering graduates. This project
is for the development and evaluation of tutorial support for selected
undergraduate courses. Interactive graphics workstations present time varying
images created to support communication of basic engineering concepts. The
support software helps to explain, demonstrate, and reinforce the time varying
and ultidimensional relationships that are needed for engineering analysis and
design. The grantee provides funds for this project that are about one-third of
the NSF award.
