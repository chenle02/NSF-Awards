The goal of the research program at the University of South
Carolina&lt;br/&gt;is to investigate the structure of protons and
neutrons&lt;br/&gt;(collectively known as nucleons), and other subatomic
particles. The&lt;br/&gt;properties of subatomic particles - such as their mass
or the manner&lt;br/&gt;in which they are produced - hold key information on the
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;forces of nature. Using powerful microscopes comprised of
beams of&lt;br/&gt;photons or electrons, our experiments are able to probe the
behavior&lt;br/&gt;of forces inside the atomic nucleus. These endeavors
are&lt;br/&gt;accomplished using particle detectors located in Hall-B at
the&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in
Newport&lt;br/&gt;News, Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of South
Carolina JLab group consists of three&lt;br/&gt;professors, two postdoctoral
scientists, five graduate students, and&lt;br/&gt;four undergraduate students.
We are devoted to education and&lt;br/&gt;therefore invest a significant portion
of our research time&lt;br/&gt;involving students and young research scientists
in our experiments&lt;br/&gt;to provide a component of their education that is
not available in&lt;br/&gt;the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;
