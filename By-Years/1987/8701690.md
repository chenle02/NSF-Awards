This project will focus on work in algebra especially in the areas related to
affine group schemes and descent theory. The principal investigator will study
genus theory and behavior in towers for groups of norm-type forms. The research
will also consider extending recent descent theory results to find the proper
way of defining a quadratic discriminant algebra for a ramified finite-rank
extension of an arbitrary commutative ring. This research covers a wide range of
topics in algebra. In particular, areas related to affine group schemes and
descent theory will be considered. The breadth of this project makes it
particularly attractive. The results will provide insight and understanding into
many areas of algebra.
