9615565 Zhou This project will investigate the possibility of modeling
biological phenomena such as hormone release, neuron firings, and
electrophysiological profiles, by viewing pertinent measurements as events with
random occurrence times. Such time series and their transformations are known as
point processes and filtered point processes, respectively, and their
application to biological signals will offer additional insight into their
mechanisms. In collaboration with a neuroscience research group at Emory
University, biologically meaningful models will be explored and state-of-the-art
statistical signal processing tools will be adopted to extract model parameters.
Directly interpretable models and advanced signal processing methodologies are
capable of explaining certain biological phenomena which may not be evident from
the raw data. A formal joint proposal (with collaborators from life science
fields) will be submitted at the end of the twelve-month planning period. The
present planning proposal will provide support for one graduate student and
release time for the PI both of which are instrumental for the success of a
junior faculty entering a new interdisciplinary field. ***
