Professor Johnson will study linear differential operators with bounded but
non-decaying coefficients (which might be almost periodic or paths of an ergodic
process). Using techniques from dynamical systems theory, he will study spectral
properties and generalized Floquet exponents for such operators. He will apply
his results in the following areas: bifurcation from invariant tori in non-
linear dynamical systems; spectral properties of the one-dimensional almost
periodic Schroedinger operator; linear optimal control theory; the topological
index theory of non- periodic ordinary and partial differential equations, and
its relation with cohomology theory of certain C* algebras; the Korteweg-deVries
equation with bounded initial data. Johnson's research in differential equations
is very broadly based and has implications for a variety of fields ranging from
pure mathematics to physics and engineering.
