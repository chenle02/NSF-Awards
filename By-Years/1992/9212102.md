Dr. Phillips will use behavioral techniques to examine the detection and use of
the earth's magnetic field by the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens).
Previous work has shown that the magnetic compass used by newts for shoreward
orientation is influenced by the wavelength of light. Measurements of the
wavelength-dependence of magnetic compass orientation will be extended into the
near-ultraviolet to better characterize the visual inputs that contribute to the
magnetic compass. In addition, the wavelength of light reaching the pineal organ
and eyes will be selectively altered to find out if the light- dependent
magnetic compass is located in one of these two photoreceptive organs. To
investigate the involvement of the magnetic field in homing and, more
specifically, in the "map" or geographic-position sense that is required for
homing, experiments will be carried out to examine the effects of varying the
wavelength of light and of manipulating specific components of the magnetic
field (i.e., the dip angle and total intensity) on homing orientation. This
research will contribute to a better understanding of the function of the pineal
and of the processing of sensory information by the brain of vertebrates. In
addition, the information gained from this research will help to characterize
the extent to which the visual system of amphibians has become specialized to
perform specific sensory functions (i.e., detection of the earth's magnetic
field). A more complete understanding of these specialized sensory functions
will make it possible to determine when the amphibian visual system can serve as
an appropriate model system for studying visual processes that occur in other
vertebrates, including humans. Finally, investigation of the strategies used by
amphibians to orient during long-distance movement will contribute to a better
understanding of how the brain of vertebrates processes spatial information.
