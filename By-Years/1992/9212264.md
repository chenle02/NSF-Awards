The focus of Professor Glymour's study is the application of formal methods
developed by statisticians, computer scientists, mathematical psychologists and
philosophers of science (including the PI and his former student, Dr. Kevin
Kelly) to aspects of cognitive psychology. Specifically, Professor Glymour is
investigating the contexts in which contemporary cognitive psychology may not
turn into a successful research program because the questions cognitive
psychologists seek to address are radically underdetermined by the kind of
evidence available to them. In undertaking this study of contemporary cognitive
psychology, Professor Glymour uses Sigmund Freud's scientific efforts until the
turn of the century as a kind of methodological model. He argues that Freud's
theoretical and methodological approaches in the 1890s are in important respects
those of many contemporary cognitive psychologists. He further suggests that
Freud's scientific enterprise did not turn into a successful research program
for the same reasons that he sees problems with contemporary cognitive science:
the questions are underdetermined by the evidence. Finally, he wants to argue
that it is just those points that contemporary cognitive psychology share with
Freud's theory, i.e. similar goals and methodological limitations, that lead to
this problem in contemporary science. The aim of this study is not to argue that
contemporary cognitive psychology ought not to be done or ought not to be
supported. The aim is to emphasize the importance of articulating alternatives
and giving frank consideration to how much or how little an experiment or an
entire research program can do to distinguish among these alternatives.
