DEB-9615887 SOUSA Herbivores may influence plant community composition and the
impact of herbivores may vary spatially. Despite considerable conceptual
interest, this hypothesis has been tested in few natural communities. The
investigators propose to examine the affect of insect herbivores on the
distribution of mangrove species along a tidal gradient. They will conduct
experiments to measure the impact of the herbivores on growth and survival of
plants in gaps versus under a closed canopy and in intertidal zones. This
experiment is specifically designed to detect spatial variation in the effect of
herbivory on plant competition and will complement existing mangrove competition
experiments at the same field site. Mangrove forests are being degraded and
destroyed at an alarming rate worldwide, resulting in the loss of highly
productive ecosystems that have numerous ecological, economic, and aesthetic
values. The results of this project will have considerable value in predicting
the consequences of different human-caused alterations of these endangered
wetlands and in guiding efforts to restore mangrove communities.
