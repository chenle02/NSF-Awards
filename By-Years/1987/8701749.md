Titanium hydride can be reacted with ammonia in the presence of various metal
catalysts to form titanium nitride. When the kinetics of this reaction were
analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis, the weight change versus time curves
showed a number of reproducible discontinuities which did not correspond to
expected kinetic behavior. Earlier Phase I research indicated that the
discontinuities were due to the effects of multiple catalysts. A preliminary
kinetic mechanism was proposed which will be more fully investigated in this
Phase II research. Various metal catalysts will be analyzed for their
effectiveness not only in promoting the nitriding reaction but also for
catalyzing the reaction of titanium hydride with methane. Contact angle
measurements for various nickel alloys on titanium nitride were evaluated in
Phase I. In Phase II, these measurements will be extended, and the nickel alloy-
titanium nitride interface will be investigated to determine the causes for
enhanced wetting. Cermets of nickel alloy and titanium nitride will be made by
cold pressing and sintering. The physical properties of the cermets will be
correlated with contact angle measurements, as well as other microstructural
features. Premium high speed steel and cemented carbide cutting tools are
currently coated with combinations of titanium nitride, titanium carbide, and
alumina. Titanium nitride is the most popular coating for the actual wear
surface. With feasibility established in Phase I, the opportunity exists in
Phase II to correlate wetting with physical properties and confirm the catalytic
mechanism for producing titanium nitride. A fundamental understanding and
improvement of the synthesis and wetting of titanium nitride by a nickel binder
is expected to lead to a cermet with significantly enhanced physical properties.
Such a cermet may replace tungsten carbide-cobalt tools in some applications,
reducing the dependence of the United States on imported cobalt.
