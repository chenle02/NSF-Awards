9311198 Sakaguchi This project will investigate the biological significance of
certain specific molecules during the development of the brain . This project
will test the hypothesis that the growing tips of nerve cell processes, or
growth cones, use receptors for extracellular matrix molecules and specific cell
adhesion molecules to navigate through the brain to their appropriate targets.
The role of these molecules will be characterized using function-blocking
reagents in the developing visual system. In addition, a combination of
biochemical , immunological and molecular techniques will be used to examine the
spatial and temporal distribution of these molecules during development. The
results of these studies will provide important new information on the cellular
and molecular basis of growth cone guidance and pathway selection. The longer
term goal is to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
regulate the formation of specific nerve connections during development. ***
