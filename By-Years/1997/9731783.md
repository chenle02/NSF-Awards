9731783 Potts, Joseph Cukor, Peter GTE Laboratories Inc. REU: Computer and
Telecommunications Research for Undergraduates This Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site project provides partial support for fifteen students
per year in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. Students
are selected from a nation-wide applicant pool and work with a member of the GTE
Laboratories technical staff on a project in the area of computer, information
and telecommunications networks. The student projects are aimed at solving real
life industrial problems and thus provide most program participants with a new
type of experience. Requirements include both oral and written reports.
University faculty members play an important role in the selection of
participants and in administration of the program. Strong efforts are made to
recruit women and minority students.
