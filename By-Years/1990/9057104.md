This Presidential Young Investigator award will support theoretical research at
the boundary of high-energy particle physics and cosmology. A solution to the
puzzle of what constitutes the "missing mass" in galactic halos may come from
the fundamental theories of particle physics. These theories also make
predictions as to the scale and amplitude of deviations from uniformity in the
Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. This outstanding young theoretician will
give her attention to these problems, in hope of contributing to their solution.
