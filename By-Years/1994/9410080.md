This research is on finding pipeline schedulers for the behavioral description
of an iterative or recursive algorithm or loops. This extends the scheduling
algorithm to more realistic resource models and to graphs with conditionals. The
goal is to expose the parallelism in an iterative or recursive algorithm to
provide information for optimization. Focus is on the innermost loops or
iterations, which are the most time-critical for applications. The approach is
to study the structure of cyclic data-flow graphs with edge delays in order to
optimize behavioral transformation, scheduling and partitioning.
