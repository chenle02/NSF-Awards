This award supports graduate student participation at four workshops presented
by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) during major US mathematics
meetings in 2016-2018. These meetings are the annual meeting of the Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2016 (held in Boston, MA) and 2017 (held
in Pittsburgh, PA), and the Joint Mathematics Meetings in 2017 (held in Atlanta,
GA) and 2018 (held in San Diego, CA). These Meetings Workshops will bring the
rising women stars and current mathematical leaders together with graduate
students and recent graduates from a variety of fields in pure and applied
mathematics. By creating a rich intellectual community centered on shared
research interests, the activities promise to generate new mentoring relations,
new research collaborations, and increased activity in the associated research
areas. Such relationships can lead to a lifetime of professional success.
Moreover, these events at highly visible national meetings benefit the entire
mathematical community by showcasing the excellent mathematical work done by
women.

Each Meetings Workshop has a research focus derived from a prior AWM Research
Collaboration Workshop, a week-long event where participants work together on
open research problems. At the Meetings Workshops, leaders in each research
field will introduce younger mathematicians to a deeper understanding of the
field and its connections with their own work. Graduate students will, in turn,
share their research during poster sessions and small group interactions. The
research topics that will be highlighted in the next four workshops include
Dynamical Systems with applications to Medical Problems; Number Theory;
Numerical Partial Differential Equations; and Noncommutative Algebra. These
topics span a broad spectrum of current mathematical problems, and will
correspondingly enhance the future careers of many young women mathematicians.

Mathematical Biology, and Computational Mathematics Programs within the NSF
Division of Mathematical Sciences.
