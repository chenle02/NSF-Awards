The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
is to develop control methodologies to enable the transformation of the
automotive propulsion system from a traditional mechanical system into a
flexible mechatronic system. The specific goal is to provide design tools to
ensure precise motion control of the mechatronic actuators that will replace the
mechanical components and eliminate the mechanical links in the automotive
propulsion system, and therefore achieve the necessary control means to maximize
the energy conversion and power transfer efficiency. To achieve the above
objective, studies of new design methods for time-varying internal model based
tracking control will be conducted and validated in various automotive
mechatronic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will offer
new systematic design methods for internal model based tracking control of
linear time-varying systems. In specific, it will provide the construction of a
robust time-varying internal model by means of a system immersion, and the
design of a robust stabilizer by leveraging the unique structure of the
interconnected plant and the internal model. Many real-world applications that
contain angle dependent signal dynamics such as wind turbine could benefit from
the proposed control methodology. Particularly this will enable the
transformation of the automotive propulsion system from a mechanical system to a
fully flexible mechatronic system where the air, fuel, and piston dynamics can
be controlled with full authority in real-time. These flexibilities will enable
a significant reduction of automotive fuel consumption and emissions and the
wide spread of alternative fuels. The project will also help to attract young
people especially women and minorities into the engineering field by leveraging
the broad interests in future automobiles among students. It will also promote
collaborations with industry and disseminate the research results to communities
at large.
