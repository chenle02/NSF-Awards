Proposal 0428078&lt;br/&gt;TITLE More Modular Reasoning for Aspect-Oriented
Programs&lt;br/&gt;Gary T. Leavens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
advance the theory and practice of aspect-oriented software development. Aspect-
oriented languages allow modularization of code for requirements that do not
align with a program's architecture, reducing scattering and tangling of code
for these cross-cutting requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem addressed
by this project is how to recover static, modular reasoning in aspect-oriented
programs. The technical approach is to create the design discipline, based on an
analogy to behavioral subtyping, and a small aspect-oriented programming
language to support it. By producing prototype tools and&lt;br/&gt;applying them
in case studies, the researchers will experimentally validate the utility of the
language and design discipline. A formal study of specification and verification
techniques will demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;soundness of static, modular reasoning in
the language and design discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discipline
developed through the project will benefit software engineers and programmers by
providing guidance for thinking about and applying aspect-oriented programming
techniques. The discipline may&lt;br/&gt;also improve software correctness and
maintainability. By showing how a language can support the discipline, the
project will contribute to the design of programming and specification
languages. Like the&lt;br/&gt;notion of behavioral subtyping, a disciplined
approach to thinking about aspect-oriented abstraction will help educators
convey the key ideas of the paradigm.&lt;br/&gt;
