This research is a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of
aerosol reactors for synthesis of high quality powders for ceramic applications.
The powders to be studied are silicon nitride and various metal oxides. Size
distributions of the powders produced will be measured as a function of gas
composition, temperature, residence time, and other relevant variables. Powders
will be characterized as to chemical composition and crystallinity by atomic
absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The suitability of the powders
for ceramic application will be evaluated in an ongoing study at another
institution. The reactor will be modeled accounting for particle nucleation,
particle growth by condensation and coagulation, and aggregate shape change by
sintering. Aerosol reactors offer exciting processes for producing powders of
unique properties for use in ceramic, optical, electrical, or catalytic
applications. This research should help in the design and optimization of such
reactors.
