This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separation science. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Olesik and her students will pursue fundamental
investigations of the physicochemical properties of conventional liquid
chromatography mobile phases that have been mixed with supercritical fluids,
particularly supercritical carbon dioxide, to provide new mobile phases with
enhanced fluidities and diffusivities. These new mobile phases will enable more
rapid analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and size
exclusion chromatography (SEC). %%% This research builds upon preliminary
results and new theoretical developments from Dr. Olesik's laboratory. In
addition to contributing to the fundamental basis of liquid chromatography,
these studies are relevant to other technologically important areas such as
solvent extraction and synthesis where enhanced fluidity reaction environments
can give rise to more efficient chemical processes.
