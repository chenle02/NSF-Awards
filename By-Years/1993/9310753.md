9310753 Huang We propose to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the
Uranian and Neptunian magnetospheres. The investigation includes the following
aspects: (1) The guiding center motion of charged particles and the plasma bulk
properties along a field line in the magnetospheres with large offset and tilted
dipole (OTD) magnetic field; (2) The formation and configuration of the
plasmaspheres at Uranus and Neptune; (3) The magnetospheric dynamics, especially
the current systems and their effects on the mass and energy transports and the
stability of the OTD magnetospheres; (4) The sources and transport processes of
the plasma in the Uranian and Neptunian magnetospheres, The proposed studies
will be developed on the basis of our previous work, the studies on the motion
of chareged particles in the magnetospheres with spin axis aligned magnetic
dipole field Huang et al., 1988 , the spatial variations of density and
temperature along a magnetic field line in an anisotropic rotating
magnetospheric plasma Huang and Birmingham, 1992 and the 3D description of
magnetosphere in a OTD frame Huang and Sittler, 1993 . They will also be guided
by observational data. The results of these studies would increase our
understanding of the Uranian and Neptunian magnetospheres as well of the
terrestrial magnetosphere. ***
