Proposal Number: ECS-9625532 Principal Investigator: Mansoor Sheik-Bahae CAREER:
Investigation of Femtosecond Dynamics and Optical Switching in Active
Semiconductors The principal goal of this research is to investigate the
feasibility of ultrafast all-optical switching in semiconductor laser amplifiers
waveguides Data transmission networks must adapt to ever increasing demand for
high transmission capacity. Although optical fibers provide a large usable
bandwidth (30 terabits/sec) a serious limitation on system bandwidth has been
imposed by the current electronics switching (less than 10 gigabits/sec). Active
semiconductors can be a key technology to break this bottleneck. Very large and
fast nonlinearities have been recently discovered in active semiconductor laser
diodes, which are based on fundamental processes inherently different form those
of the passive semiconductors used heretofore. This research will further
develop and exploit the nonlinear optical properties of active semiconductor
lasers within the context of development of a practical ultrafast switching
device. The following fundamental studies will be carried out: measurements of
gain and refractive nonlinearities in semiconductor laser amplifiers as function
of wavelength, current density and temperature, and design of an optical switch
in an active directional coupler geometry. Then, optical switches will be
fabricated by the Center for High Technology Materials at the University of New
Mexico and their performance tested. Successful completion will have direct
implications for faster exchange of data in fiber-optic communications networks
and for the national leadership of the U.S. in the important area of electro-
optic communications.
