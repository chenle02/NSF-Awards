At fertilization, sperm and egg membranes fuse to deliver the paternal genome
into the interior of the egg, and the egg begins development. The molecular
mechanisms by which the membranes fuse and the sperm activates the egg are not
well understood. This project will test the hypothesis that the portion of the
sperm membrane that first contacts the egg contains molecules that mediate
membrane fusion and egg activation. In starfish, this portion of the membrane
covers the acrosomal process (AP). The objectives of this project are to isolate
starfish APs, and to identify proteins that are unique to the AP membrane and
are therefore potential bearers of fusion or agonist activities. The membrane
proteins will be characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by
surface labeling. The ability of the isolated APs to activate and/or fuse with
denuded eggs, and to fuse with phospholipid vesicles will be tested. %%% This
work will serve as a foundation for efforts to identify and isolate the sperm
molecules that first act on the egg, and will increase our knowledge of the
general mechanisms of membrane fusion and signal transduction.
