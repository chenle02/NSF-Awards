The objective of this research is to investigate the concept of an intelligent
pallet. The idea is to provide intelligence to the media on which parts are
physically carried through the various manufacturing resources. The pallets will
be assumed to be enslaved in the system, each equipped with its own central
processing unit (CPU) and memory devices. In this scenario, the manufacturing
resources are merely agents which will service the commands from an Intelligent
Pallet to process, move, and/or assemble the part(s) it carries. This project
includes the analysis of technological barriers and economic feasibility.
Evaluation of the structure of the control system and its implementation
including issues such as the feasibility of a heterarchical control
architecture, problems associated with wireless communication, and information
flow will also be addresses at both theoretical and experimental levels.
Applicability and generalizability of the results of this effort is enhanced
through industrial collaboration and matching support from the Purdue
Engineering Research Center.
