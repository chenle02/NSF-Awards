The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) REU Site will provide a program for
undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2012. Eight students will be selected
to participate in a 9-week research program in cellular, molecular and genetic
approaches to biological problems. Undergraduates from partner institutions,
including the Univ. of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Barry Univ. (FL), Florida A&amp;M
Univ., Grinnell College (IA), Jackson State Univ. (MS), Medgar Evers College
(NY), Missouri State Univ., Prairie View A&amp;M Univ. (TX), College of St.
Elizabeth (NJ), Truman State Univ. (MO), and Xavier Univ. (LA), will be
recruited to the program. The program has been designed to stimulate interest in
graduate study. The research programs of faculty mentors use methodologies
ranging from recombinant DNA technology and molecular cytology, to sophisticated
population genetics. The research experience is the heart of the summer program.
Participants also develop communication skills through brown-bag lunches, lab
group meetings, and an end-of-program Summer Undergraduate Research Science
Symposium and poster session. Students are involved in activities such as
seminars, panel discussions on preparation for graduate school and career
options, and a science ethics workshop. Students are strongly encouraged to
present their research at regional and national scientific meetings. More
