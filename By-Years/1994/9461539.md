This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will endeavor to develop
and demonstrate the viability of a graphical database interface to facilitate
young children's exploration of the sciences. This will be accomplished through
the design and development of a database of North American animals and the
construction of a graphical interface that allows pre-readers and low skill
readers to conduct searches. The database will consist of multimedia content and
will reside on a CD ROM. The sophistication of the searching routines will allow
for the continued use of the product as the users' skills develop. Specific
objectives to be accomplished in the course of the Phase I research include:
identify and develop appropriate database content and category labels for use by
children in ages 5 to 10; identify and develop appropriate graphics to represent
database categories and actions; produce the audio file necessary for
communication with the students using the database (these will be used in the
`audio on` mode only); construct a software interface (using the components
listed above) and link it to the database; train teachers and students to use
the database; evaluate the graphical interface to determine usability, influence
on patterns of use, limitations, and attitudes of teachers and students toward
the product; and develop a document that summarizes the findings of the Phase I
research and provides direction for Phase II activities.
