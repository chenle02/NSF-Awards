Organelle motility, in some eucaryotic cells, is dependent on microtubules, a
complex network of proteins filaments found in the cytoplasm of the cell.
Synaptic vesicles are motile secretory vesicles that store neurotransmitters.
These vesicles are found in the axon, an extension of the nerve cell,
responsible for transmitting signals to other cells. Various types of vesicular
organelles exhibit different patterns of movement. This project will investigate
and characterize, with the use of video microscopy, the movement of synaptic
vesicles in the giant squid axon, and the motility of microtubule-dependent
organelles in adrenocortical tumor cells. The movement of synaptic vesicles is
considered a good model for other organelles that are influenced by hormones
such as ACTH. Thus, this study will further our understanding of the molecular
basis of organelle movement and the mechanisms by which the spatial and temporal
distribution of organelles are regulated by cells.
