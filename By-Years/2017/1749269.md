Psycholinguistic and linguistic theories have yielded testable hypotheses about
language mechanisms, but revealing how these mechanisms are implemented in the
biology of the brain remains a central challenge. This project will support a
workshop bringing together leading scientists of brain and language to advance
the understanding of the brain mechanisms of language from a cross-disciplinary
viewpoint, focusing on the novel use of electrical brain recording methods in
humans. Understanding language processes from their computational to their
neural bases is essential for advancing critical national goals in education, in
the medical treatment of language disorders and hearing loss, and in the
creation of analytic approaches that will boost U.S. competitiveness in science
and engineering, public and private sector research and development, and
national security.

The project will connect electrophysiological and computational approaches for
understanding human brain language processing. A first aim is to advance the
effectiveness of electrophysiological tools for investigating language
computations in the brain during comprehension. Language processes unfold
rapidly, on a time scale of fractions of a second, and electrical recordings of
brain activity are able to track this fast time course. A second aim is to
develop frameworks for creating novel applications and approaches, such as the
integration of machine learning methods with measures of brain electrical
activity to obtain highly selective views of brain processes supporting specific
aspects of language understanding. A third aim is to evaluate three main
functions in linguistic computation that are being shown to be amenable to study
using electrophysiological recordings, namely combinatorial processing,
bilingualism, and predictive processing during language comprehension and
production. The project will also provide training in leading-edge methods, thus
supporting national efforts to develop the work force, and enhance science
education and scientific rigor.
