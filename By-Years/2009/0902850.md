This work investigates the impacts of climate change on boreal forest expansion
and wildfire intensity/magnitude in high latitude North America. The PI will
quantify vascular plant-derived biomarkers and pyro-markers derived from the
incomplete combustion of plant biomass in Hudson Bay sediments from different
locations and ages expanding periods of contrasting climate. The concentrations
and ratios of these products will be used to develop vegetation and fire indices
and build historical records for different regions of central and eastern Canada
over the Holocene. Combined with analyses of modern samples, these data will be
used to quantitatively assess the latitudinal extent and rates of expansion of
boreal forest and wildfire during past periods of warm climate (e.g., Holocene
Thermal Maximum, Medieval Warm Period, last 100 years) and compare these
distributions to those during cold periods (e.g., Little Ice Age). The proposed
investigations will foster interdisciplinary interactions among climate
scientists, terrestrial and marine biogeochemists. The award supports a female
postdoctoral researcher, and will expand international collaborations among
Canadian and U.S. scientists and engage the public through outreach activities
in local communities.
