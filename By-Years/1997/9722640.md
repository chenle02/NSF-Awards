Measurements of the scattering of high energy electrons are proposed to provide
a better understanding of the structure of nucleons and of few-body nuclear
systems. At the SLAC accelerator, 50 GeV electrons are being used to understand
the spin structure of the nucleon. At the new TJNAF laboratory high energy
electrons will be used to measure the magnetic form factor of the neutron and to
measure the electric elastic structure function of the deuteron to high momentum
transfer to provide tests of various theories. Additional measurements of the
structure of helium nuclei are also proposed.
