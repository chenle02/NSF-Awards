9700186 This research will develop an understanding of the role of geomembrane
surface roughness on interface behavior. Through a comprehensive experimental
program using the recently developed and implemented Optical Profile Microscopy
technique to provide quantitative measures of geomembrane surface roughness, it
is expected to provide a more rational basis for selecting design parameters and
predicting the long-term behavior of composite systems with geomembrane
interfaces. A custom interface shear apparatus will be made for this research,
and testing will include measurements of the distribution of local void ratio in
the interface region using a recently developed resin impregnation - image
analysis procedure to provide insight into fabric and porosity evolution during
shearing. The experimental studies will be complemented with appropriate
analytical studies. The quantitative measures of geomembrane surface roughness
and local void ratio distribution in the interface region will permit the
interface strength behavior to be examined within the context of state. Within
this unifying frame understanding, it is expected that small changes in state as
shearing progresses can be related to the physical characteristics of the
geomembrane surface. Numerical simulations will be performed to study a range of
interface conditions and explore optimal roughness designs for mobilizing
interface shear. ***
