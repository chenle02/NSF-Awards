9321847 Elitzur Dr. Elitzur will continue theoretical research under the common
theme of application of radiative transfer techniques for spectral line analysis
and infrared emission in various astronomical environments. Those environments
include star forming regions, the envelopes of late-type stars, and external
galaxies.
