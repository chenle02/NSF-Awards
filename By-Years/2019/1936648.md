Optimization arises naturally in a variety of areas, such as managing wireless
spectrum utilization, efficiently distributing power in the electrical grid, or
solving machine learning problems. The scale of such applications has been
steadily growing, often forcing data to be processed in different physical
locations linked via a communication network. The ensuing computational task is
mediated by distributed optimization algorithms that carefully orchestrate a
combination of local computations and global synchronization with the other
computing nodes. These distributed algorithms are critical in ensuring the
safety, reliability, efficiency, and performance of large-scale systems. This
project aims to develop a systematic approach for analyzing and designing such
distributed algorithms.

This project will view distributed optimization algorithms as dynamical systems
with feedback; decisions made at a given time affect the state of the system at
future times, and therefore affect future decisions, and so on. The advantage of
this viewpoint is that it allows one to leverage tools and methodology from
control theory, which is a well established engineering discipline used in the
design of modern safety-critical systems such as aircraft, automobiles, and
industrial plants. Applying these sophisticated tools to distributed
optimization algorithms will allow us to move away from conventional incremental
design methods and has the potential to be highly transformative. It will lead
to better distributed algorithms, but also more principled and automated design
methods that can allow algorithms to be directly synthesized and specialized for
the task at hand.
