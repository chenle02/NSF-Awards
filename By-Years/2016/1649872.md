GenCyber Initiative, co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the
National Security Agency, started in 2014 to provide summer cybersecurity camp
experiences for students and teachers at the K-12 level. In 2016, there are 135
camps involving approximate 6000 students and 1200 teachers. To help assess and
achieve one of the goals of GenCyber, understanding correct and safe on-line
behavior, the proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool, the
Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire (CJQ), for assessing middle and higher
school students' understanding of cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CJQ is
based on the heuristics and biases theory by Daniel Kahneman and focuses on
cybersecurity judgment rather than on cybersecurity behavior or cybersecurity
awareness because ordinary people's daily behavior is significantly influenced
by their intuitive thinking and thus it is important to get into young cyber
users' minds and compare their intuitive and rational cybersecurity thinking.
The questionnaire employs the survey experiment approach that integrates the
strengths of both surveys and experiments to collect data effectively and
efficiently. In addition, to assess authentic cybersecurity judgment, it will
use a real-life scenarios and ask young cyber users to judge the risk
intuitively and rationally rather than asking participants to answer simple
multiple-choice questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will attempt to
verify and extend Daniel Kahneman's theory of heuristics and biases in the
cyberspace in general and in the cybersecurity domain in particular. It will use
the scenario-based survey experiment with the factorial design to develop,
validate, and test the measurement of cybersecurity judgment. The measurement
provides a tool to assess cybersecurity understanding of GenCyber student
campers. In addition, young cyber users can see both their specific
vulnerabilities for possible cyber-attacks and their potential strengths for
protecting cybersecurity.
