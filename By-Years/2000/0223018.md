In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a
global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This proposal
consists of various segments addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for
existing protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific research with
GLOBE data. This proposal will support the current set of GLOBE hydrology and
snow protocols, strengthen the metadata submission standards, and carry out
research in seasonal variation in pH and alkalinity due to snowmelt runoff,
climate variability, and land use change. Calibration and validation of remotely
sensed data on water transparency will also be pursued. This proposal will also
support the development of materials for education that will include hydrology
in the context of Earth Systems Science. Scientists, students, and the general
public will be able to better understand the role of water in ecosystems and
their role in the care of our natural resources.
