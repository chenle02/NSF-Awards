This research project will investigate the systems of social exchange in a
rural Tamil village in southern India. The PI will analyze the exchange system
from the inhabitant's viewpoint and discover how exchange works within the local
social context. Specifically, she will see how exchange is perceived and used by
individuals to either maintain or change social relationships, their own social
identities, and the institutions of the local community. This project, by using
new theoretical tools from pragmatic theory and ethnosociology, will enlarge our
understanding of ranked relationships in Hindu society. It will also contribute
to the current debate on systems of exchange in relation to issues of power and
rank.
