Multi-spacecraft and complementary ground-based observations will be analyzed
to understand magnetospheric substorm phenomena and storm-time ring current
ions. Comparisons will be made with theoretical results of plasma instabilities
developed for the substorm expansion phase. Data analysis will consist of (1)
determining the substorm growth phase features in the near-earth magnetotail,
(2) relating the spatial development of auroral phenomena to the dawn-dusk and
radial extension of substorm signatures in the magnetosphere, (3) comparing the
occurrences of energetic particle bursts in the tail with substorm
intensifications, and (4) assessing the nature of storm-time transport of ring
current ions in the magnetosphere. The cross- field current instabilities will
be studied further including consideration of equilibrium current arising from
density gradient or curvature drift, the effect of multi-ion composition, and
its extension from the neutral sheet to the higher latitude portion of the
plasma sheet. The resulting theoretical predictions will be compared with
findings obtained from the multi-spacecraft study.
