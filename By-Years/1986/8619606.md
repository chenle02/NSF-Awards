Two electrochemically reversible solid-state batteries using alkali-ion-
conducting solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are to be optimized. For lithium-
conducting SPE, a lithium intercalating rutile material (LixWO2) will be used
for the negative electrode and titanium disulfide for the positive electrode. In
using sodium-conducting SPE, homogeneous matrix electrodes based upon transition
metal doped "-alumina will be used for the respective positive and negative
elctrodes. Here transition metals will be incorporated into immobile aluminum
lattice sites within the "-alumina structure where changes in electrochemical
potential upon cell charge/discharge cycling will occur via redox
electrochemistry involving these doped immobile transition metal species.
Secondary cells possessing these configurations had respective open-circuit
potentials of 2.2 and 1.5V, demonstrated good electrochemical reversibility and
had theoretical energy dentsities of 175 and 178 Wh/kg. Once the solid-state
components are characterized and optimized, they will be incorporated into
hermetically sealed prototypes. The anticipated high reliability of these
secondary solid-state cells will make them good candidates for such varied
applications as utility load leveling, reversible storage devices for electronic
and electrochromic displays, in implanted biomedical applications, and
reversible power sources in specialized aerospace applications.
