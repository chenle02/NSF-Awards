In view of the continued increase in the older population and the rapid advances
in knowledge related to aging, it is critical that psychology faculty in 2-year
and 4-year colleges keep themselves abreast of current developments in the
specialized area of aging and include them in their curriculum. A two-week
institute in the psychology of aging for 25 instructors from Minnesota, North
Dakota and South Dakota is being conducted. The institute is focusing on current
research and theory on ten different topics related to aging. The program is
strengthening the participants' disciplinary expertise, enhancing their skills
in presenting up-to-date material in aging to their students, and is providing
them with opportunities to interact intensively with experts in the field and
with colleagues from other institutions. In order to promote participants'
utilization of what they learn in the institute, the project director will
maintain contact with them during the following year and will conduct site
visits to the colleges with large minority and female enrollments. In addition
all members of the institute faculty will be available throughout the year to
provide consultation to the participants. Follow-up assessments will be
conducted to determine the institute's impact on undergraduate education.
