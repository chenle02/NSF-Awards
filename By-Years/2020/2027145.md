Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, pandemic disease
that has rapidly spread to several hundred thousand people worldwide and caused
many deaths. To facilitate the surveillance and control of the spread of the
virus, Prof. Singamaneni of Washington University at St. Louis aims to develop a
rapid and low-cost diagnostic method that can detect infection in individuals
that are asymptomatic or exhibiting mild symptoms. The sensitive biosensing
method is designed to rapidly assess the immune response to the coronavirus
across a large population in a high-throughput manner and to enable
understanding of the epidemiology of the highly contagious disease. The novel
biosensor is suitable for point-of-care and resource-limited settings and can be
easily adapted to a broad range of public health threats. This research project
provides opportunities to graduate students to be trained in sensor design and
the study of sensor performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project
is to design and realize a dual-modal lateral flow assay for highly sensitive
and specific detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
using plasmon-enhanced fluorescence. Specifically, the dual-modal lateral flow
assay relies on plasmonic-fluor, an ultrabright fluorescent nanostructure, to
achieve high sensitivity and low detection limit. In addition to ultrabright
fluorescence signal, plasmonic-fluors exhibit large absorption and scattering
cross-section, making them attractive labels that can be directly visualized by
naked eye at high target concentrations. This dual-modal lateral flow assay
enables simultaneous detection of relatively high concentrations of the
antibodies as a simple colorimetric signal and low concentrations of the
antibodies through highly sensitive fluorescence
signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
