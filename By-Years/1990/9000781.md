Professor Robert D. Coombe and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Denver are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects range from atmospheric chemistry to low
temperature spectroscopy of inorganic species. Tours of government and
industrial research facilities in the Denver area will be arranged so that
students can become familiar with career opportunities for research scientists.
