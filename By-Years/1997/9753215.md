9753215 Dingus This grant will support the participation of Dr. Brenda Dingus in
the MILAGRO experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This large-scale
cosmic ray detector will study gamma rays in the energy range from 100 GeV to
100 TeV, in order to find the mechanisms that accelerate particles to these
energies. This grant is made under the NSF "Professional Opportunities for Women
in Research and Education" Program, and will significantly assist Dr. Dingus's
career by making it possible for her to take a significant role in this
experiment. Funds are supplied by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
activities. ***
