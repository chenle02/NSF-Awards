This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mass spectrometry. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Russell and his students will apply matrix assisted
laser desorption ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI/FTMS) to
the development of techniques to investigate the structure and reactivity of
large biomolecules. This research, which builds upon results obtained under the
aegis of NSF grant CHE-8821780, seeks to find a method for inducing sequence-
specific cleavage of polypeptide and polynucleotide ions. A primary focus of
Professor Russell's efforts centers around the use of excited state gas phase
metal ions as a means to cause these large biomolecules of interest to fragment
selectively. %%% The successful attainment of the goals of this research would
provide a facile method for the rapid determination of structures of complex
peptides and nucleic acids in the femtomole concentration regime. Such
analytical methods are of extreme importance to advances in biotechnology and
clinical chemistry.
