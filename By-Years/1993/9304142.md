The metamorphosed stratified and intrusive rocks of late Precambrian,
Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian age in New England records an extremely
complicated "Acadian" collisional history. Recent results of radiometric age
dating in the Bronson Hill anticlinorium and Merrimack synclinorium of central
Massachusetts has revealed two distinct age groups of "Acadian" (early and late
Devonian) metamorphism separated by a generally higher pressure zone of late
Pennsylvanian metamorphism. This project will follow these features i the region
to determine their spatial distribution and to obtain a more precise picture of
the temporal evolution of the New England appalachians, and to improve
understanding of its setting within the larger framework of the orogen.
