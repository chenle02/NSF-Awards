9322712 Schruben This research investigates the relationship between the
different mathematical and graphical schemes used in representing discrete event
simulation. The objective is to unify and simplify these mathematical
relationships for discrete event simulation. The ultimate goal of the research
is to develop explicit mathematical representation of the dynamics of a discrete
event system with some practical utility and theoretical foundations similar to
that provided by differential equations in continuous time simulation. The
outcome of this research will make it easier for users of simulation to move
between different models representations without loss of the key elements of a
model. The ability to move between different model representations is a
significant research contribution in simulation. The impact is ease of modeling,
flexibility in system usage as users can easily move across platforms, better
modeling and modeling tools, and improved analysis as the results from one model
representation are compared with those obtained under a different representation
with the objective of identifying any causes of discrepancies in results, if
any.
