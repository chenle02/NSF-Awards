This project consists of two parallel and complementary sets of research
studies. In the first, three groups of teachers, one of experienced physics
teachers, a second of novice secondary school science teachers, and a third of
middle school math and science teachers, will be engaged in collaborative action
research on their own practice. In the second, a group of university researchers
will be facilitating the teachers' research and investigating the ways in which
they go about doing action research, as they generate and share knowledge in
that process. The primary goals for the project are the improvement of practice
and the generation of knowledge of teaching, action research, and teacher
development. These will be accomplished by the establishment of the action
research network, the engagement of teachers in collaborative action research,
and the research done by the PI and staff on the teachers' research.
