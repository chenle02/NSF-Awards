9400180 Raj The goal of this research is the development of a new manufacturing
design concept for the synthesis of single crystal thin films of complex oxides
from metalorganic precursors. The concept embodies molecular control for layer-
by-layer growth, large area single crystal growth of thin films, low
environmental impact, and a table top design that is economical and flexible.
The concept employs pulsed injection of very small amounts of liquid precursors
directly into a low pressure reactor in order to achieve atom-layer by atom-
layer growth of single crystal films. The use of an ultrasonic nozzle to obtain
reproducible deposition per pulse is a special feature of the research. The
specific objective of the research is to develop viable models for the
processing parameters that can be used to tailor manufacturing systems, based on
the proposed concept, for specific applications. The process that will result
from this research will enable monolayer-level control for the growth rate of
the single crystal films used in microelectronic devices and, at the same time,
allow considerable flexibility, cost-effectiveness and manufacturing potential
for making films of various compositions of large area substrates.
