Populations adapt genetically to their environments, so populations of the same
species in different environments may be genetically distinct. Movement of
individuals between populations can challenge this adaptation by constantly
reintroducing poorly-adapted genes. This proposal will study adaptation in ducks
from low and high altitudes in the Andes Mountains, where highland populations
maintain distinctive hemoglobin variants despite some level of mixing with
lowland populations. Software will be developed to assess the strength of the
pressure to adapt, as well as to measure the rate at which movement of
individuals mixes the population gene pools. This will help clarify the amount
of mixing a population can sustain before losing its distinctive local
adaptations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The software tools created for this project
will be made freely available to biologists, and will be useful in applications
such as studying the evolution of pesticide resistance, conservation of locally-
adapted plant and animal populations, and evolution of drug resistance in
pathogens. The proposal includes funding for members of the software development
team to visit and interact with software users, insuring that the software will
be broadly useful.&lt;br/&gt;
