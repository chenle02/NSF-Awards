Green fluorescent protein is a member of a unique family of proteins currently
identified only in marine invertebrates (corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish).
Upon translation, the peptide backbone of these proteins spontaneously form a
compact, soluble structure that forces the autocatalysis of 3 inner amino acids
forming a visible light fluorescent chromophore. These are the only known
proteins that spontaneously produce a visible light fluorophore without the aid
of exogenous cellular factors. Scientists have attached the cDNA sequences
encoding these proteins to a number of proteins of interest in organisms ranging
from viruses to plants to mammals. Virtually all organisms studied are capable
of synthesizing these fluorescent proteins. Fluorescent proteins are now widely
used by biomedical scientists as tools to understand the localization and
function of an impressive array of proteins in a vast range of experimental
organisms. As the range of research utilizing these proteins grows, the
currently available collection of fluorescent proteins presents sever
limitations on the types of experiments possible. This research will seek to
identify novel fluorescent proteins from marine animals living in the Indo-
Pacific Ocean. Using a combination of underwater fluorescence imaging/spectral
analysis of reef animals and molecular cloning, this research will survey,
catalog and characterize fluorescence in the coral reef environment. In addition
to providing a large number of new fluorescent proteins with differing
biochemical and spectral properties for use in biomedical research, these
studies will help reveal the role of these proteins in the ecology of the
animals that produce them.
