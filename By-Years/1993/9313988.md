9313988 Cohen This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research on Theoretical Studies
of Nucleons and Nucleon Matter is between Drs. Thomas D. Cohen and Derek B.
Leinweber of the University of Maryland College Park and Drs. Wojciech
Broniowski and Marek Kutschera of the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Cracow.
The research will focus on a variety of topics in low-energy strong-interaction
physics, such as the structure of individual baryons and of nuclear matter. They
plan to approach the problem using such techniques as: chiral perturbation
theory, lattice gauge theory, large Nc analysis, heavy fermion dynamics, and
phenomenological models. They will stress the connection between various
theoretical approaches. They will use the insights of this work to make new
phenomenological predictions. This proposed research in theoretical physics
fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts
in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ###
