This award supports basic chemical, biochemical, and chemical ecological studies
of a group of nonprotein amino acids, namely L- canavanine and its metabolic
derivatives, that function in higher plant chemical defense against insects and
other destructive agents. These investigations will enhance our understanding of
the biochemical bases for higher plant nonprotein amino acid toxicity in insects
and provide valuable insight into why potentially protective allelochemicals
fail to elicit deleterious effects. Just as it is critically important to know
how toxic allelochemicals function to protect a plant, so too must we understand
insect capacity to deal with toxic natural products. An understanding of the
metabolic resources that an insect uses to avoid or detoxify pernicious plant
allelochemicals is of basic importance in any future use of these compounds in
insect control. No single investigation by itself can achieve this practical
aim. Nevertheless, it is critically important to select a model system about
which we have a basic and detailed understanding and to use it to consider this
question in a sound and thorough manner. This approach can provide data
essential to the eventual achievement of this pragmatic goal.
