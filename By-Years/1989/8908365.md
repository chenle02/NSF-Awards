The purpose of this research is to enable econometric and economic models to
better represent economic behavior and, thus, provide better answers to
questions confronting decision makers in the private and public sectors. The
project will involve the reformulation of problems in statistical inference and
optimization, inspired and made possible by recent advances in widely available
computational capacity. Research methods iterate between the problems that
define and motivate economic analysis and econometrics, computational
experiments, and the development of new analytical tools. In economic modeling,
the emphasis is on numerical mapping from decision rules to objective functions.
Much of this development is in the context of particular problems, including
seasonal adjustment, nonstructural representations of macroeconomic time series,
cointegration models, the solution of nonlinear or rational expectations models
that are generic and algorithmic, and can, therefore, be used systematically in
studying a wide range of problems. This and related research by others over the
next decade will enable economists to address policy problems much more
directly, with emphasis shifting from the constraints of analytical approaches
to a greatly enriched modeling of behavior.
