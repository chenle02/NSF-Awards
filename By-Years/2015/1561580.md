The Phaff Yeast Culture Collection at the University of California Davis is used
for basic research on yeast physiology, yeast ecology (especially yeast-insect
associations), comparative genomics, and taxonomy, including discovery of new
yeast species. Yeast collections are also used for applied research, including
study of food and beverage fermentation, food spoilage, biofuels exploration,
and the development of improved methods to identify yeasts that cause human
infections. This award will fund the transfer of two existing collections, the
Starmer collection from Syracuse University and the Ganter collection from
Tennessee State University. The Phaff Yeast Culture Collection is the fourth
largest public yeast collection in the world, with over 7000 strains. A total of
4000 yeast strains will be transferred to UC Davis, expanding the size of the
Phaff collection by 50 percent. In addition, the project staff participate in an
annual UC Davis Biodiversity Museum Day, which attracts visitors to the yeast
exhibits to learn about microbiology and societal benefits derived from yeasts
and culture collections.

In this project, the Starmer and Ganter collections will be shipped to UC Davis
where they will be cryopreserved, re-identified by ribosomal sequencing,
archived off-site, added to the Phaff collection database, and DNA sequences
will be deposited in GenBank. All three collections include numerous undescribed
species, and in some cases, the only known representatives of certain species.
Geographically and taxonomically diverse yeast collections like this are now
virtually impossible to re-collect. Once the transfer is complete, the combined
collection will be available to the global scientific community. By posting DNA
sequences of accessions in GenBank and expanding information available on the
Phaff collection online catalog (http://phaffcollection.ucdavis.edu), the
collection will be more visible and valuable for all users.
