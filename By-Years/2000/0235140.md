The major metabolic activities of plant seeds are directed toward the synthesis
of carbon (in the form of lipids and starch) and nitrogen (in the form of
storage proteins) reserves. Although appearing to be independent processes,
carbon and nitrogen metabolism are inter-related as evidenced by the near
parallel responses exhibited by defined genetic mutants and transgenic plants
altered in gene expression in one of these two processes. The mechanisms
responsible for this coordinated expression of carbon and nitrogen reserves are
not known. This grant application proposes a series of studies on one aspect of
nitrogen metabolism, i.e. the control of storage protein biosynthesis in
developing rice endosperm. Rice is an excellent system to study storage protein
biosynthesis as it synthesizes and accumulates both major classes of storage
proteins, prolamines and glutelins, the latter an 11S globulin. Moreover, rice
stores these proteins in different subcellular compartments. Prolamines are
deposited directly as protein intracisternal granules within the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) lumen, whereas glutelins are transported through the endomembrane
system to a protein storage vacuole. Previous studies from this laboratory have
demonstrated that the RNAs encoding these two classes of storage proteins are
not localized in a stochastic fashion on the ER. Instead, prolamine mRNAs are
highly enriched on the ER membranes that bind the prolamine protein bodies (PBs)
whereas glutelin mRNAs are predominant on the cisternal ER. The localization of
prolamine mRNAs to the prolamine PBs occurs by directed RNA transport from the
nucleus. To better understand this process, studies will be undertaken to
identify the nucleotide sequences that direct RNA transport and localization and
to identify and characterize proteins, which are responsible for the transport
and anchoring of prolamine and glutelin RNAs to the prolamine PBs and cisternal
ER, respectively. As RNA transport occurs by the formation and movement of
particles, efforts will be made to isolate these RNA transport particles and
determine what other RNA species may be co-transported. An integrated approach
will be taken to achieve these goals, and will incorporate the use of
biochemical, cellular, molecular and ultrastructural techniques. This study will
provide new information on how RNAs and, in turn, proteins are sorted in plant
cells and how the ER can differentiate into unique domains with specific
functions. Moreover, it will lead to new insights into the mechanisms that may
control utilization of carbon and nitrogen and their conversion into storage
reserves.
