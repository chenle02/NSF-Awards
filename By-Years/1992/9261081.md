It has been well-established that poor thermal management is a limiting factor
in the reliability and lifetime of electronic components in advanced electronic
systems, leading to the search for improved materials for electronic components
such as substrates or heat sinks. In this research, a novel reinforcing fiber,
diamond fiber, for enhancing thermal management in electronic components is
proposed. The fibers will be produced by depositing polycrystalline diamonds on
highly graphitic, sub-micron graphite fiber through a plasma enhanced chemical
vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. Successful development of diamond fibers
will provide an excellent addition to available materials for heat removal for
high density, high power electronic components, providing ultra high thermal
conductivity, tailorable CTE, and good mechanical properties. The proposed
research identifies an outstanding reinforcement to improve thermal performance
of current materials. Success of the research could lead to new composites with
much higher thermal conductivity and tailorable CTE for future electronic
devices. These composites can be used as substrates and heat sinks.
