The variability of the broad emission lines in the spectra of active galactic
nuclei reveals fundamental information about the structure and kinematics of the
line-emitting region and about the nature of the central source. The work to be
supported by this grant will provide, for the first time, detailed, model-
independent mappings of the structure of active galactic nuclei. The goal of
this program is to determine the structure and kinematics of the braod-line
emitting regions in active nuclei through repeated observations of a limited
number of sources. This is information about active galactic nuclei which cannot
be obtained in any other way. The Principal Investigator is regarded as one of
the leaders in this area of research.
