9353963 Klee The purpose of the proposed workshop is to enhance the background
and ability of faculty members teaching within the area of computing sciences at
a two-year college which serves Native Americans. This purpose is achieved
through a five-day workshop and follow-up activities involving twenty faculty
members. Participants are urged to apply in pairs, two from one institution or
one from each of two neighboring institutions. During the workshop, the
participants are brought up to date on the computing sciences topics and
methodologies that can be offered in associate-degree programs, as identified in
the recently-completed two-year college computing curricula recommendations of
the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). By engaging in small group
activities based on the report's contents, participants develop items such as
implementation strategies for specific content areas, educational materials,
ways of combining topics into courses, and project or laboratory exercises.
Through contact with industry representatives, participants are informed about
current employment opportunities and issues for graduates with an associate
degree in the computing sciences. Upon completion of the workshop activities,
each participant-pair is required to conduct a local follow-up mini-workshop to
disseminate materials and knowledge gained from the workshop. These follow-up
activities provide means for participants to interact with colleagues in the
same or neighboring institutions on a person-to-person basis. The results of the
project will be presented by the participants in journal articles and conference
presentations. ***
