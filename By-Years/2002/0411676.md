Prop #: 0411676&lt;br/&gt;PI: Bruce Corliss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the Research Vessel Cape
Hatteras operated by Duke University and dedicated to use in support of marine
research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for
ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. The Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Bruce Corliss is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to acquire
laboratory cabinets and immersion suits (through a group purchase - no funds to
Duke). ***&lt;br/&gt;
