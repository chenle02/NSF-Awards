This project is developing a new framework for investigating the dynamics
of&lt;br/&gt;information in complex, interconnected systems. The key technical
thrusts&lt;br/&gt;of the project are: (1) real-time information theory, (2)
robust control of&lt;br/&gt;networks, (3) packet-based control theory,and (4)
computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;of network systems. Each of these thrusts
explores aspects of information&lt;br/&gt;systems that must interact with the
real-world in a manner that requires&lt;br/&gt;careful control of the timing of
the computation and the evolution of the&lt;br/&gt;information state of the
system. While diverse in application, these&lt;br/&gt;thrusts represent a common
core of intellectual thrusts that integrate&lt;br/&gt;computer science, control,
and communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research
are being evaluated on two testbeds&lt;br/&gt;already at Caltech. The first is
the Multi-Vehicle Wireless Testbed, which&lt;br/&gt;provides a distributed
environment for control of 8-10 vehicles performing&lt;br/&gt;cooperative tasks
in a real-time environment. The second is the WAN in Lab,&lt;br/&gt;a wide area
network consisting of high speed servers, programmable
routers,&lt;br/&gt;electronic crossconnects, and long haul fibers with
associated optical&lt;br/&gt;amplifiers, dispersion compensation modules and
optical multiplexers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is also developing
elements of a curriculum that will provide&lt;br/&gt;training to students in
information systems that blends communications,&lt;br/&gt;computation, and
control. This includes integration our the research&lt;br/&gt;framework into a
recently created course at Caltech on the principles of&lt;br/&gt;feedback and
control, CDS 101, as well as development a second course, IST&lt;br/&gt;201,
aimed at bringing together faculty and students interested in
working&lt;br/&gt;on problems at the boundaries of these traditional
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
