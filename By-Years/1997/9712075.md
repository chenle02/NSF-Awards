Jameson/Abstract ATM-9712075 The objectives of this research are: 1. to
investigate how patchiness and clustering alters radar measurement statistics.
2. to investigate how patchiness and clustering alters our concept of drop size
distributions and radar Z-R relations and 3. to investigate how patchiness and
clustering alters aspects of scattering particularly with respect to multiple
scatter The primary approach will be numerical experiments and Monte Carlo
simulations although observations will be included as well, when available. The
objectives of these experiments are: (a) to develop further our understanding of
the effects of the variance of parameters generated by patchiness and clustering
on measurement statistics by considering correlated samples and by considering
different radar parameters such as polarization radar variables (b) to
investigate how the variability of drop size distributions within a radar beam
effects Z-R relations such as those used by the NEXRAD radars and (3) to explore
the effects of clustering on multiple scatter and backscattered microwaves as
functions of the variance of the number of drops per unit volume, the mean
separation distances, and drop sizes.
