Abstract Oberlin This is a project in Fourier analysis. It is concerned with
problems related to certain operators and to certain oscillatory integrals which
are naturally associated with those operators. The operators are given by
convolution with measures on curves in Euclidean spaces. In the simplest case
the oscillatory integrals are one-dimensional integrals with an exponential
integrand having polynomial phase function. These integrals arise naturally as
the Fourier transforms of the measures defining the convolution operators. The
questions of interest here have been fairly well understood in dimensions 2 and
3 since about 1985. The investigator has recently had some success with these
problems in 4 dimensions. The goal of this project is to continue that work by
extending the range and scope of the methods employed in dimension 4. Pure
mathematics is traditionally divided into the areas of analysis, algebra, and
topology. This is a project in analysis. Very roughly, the roots of analysis are
to be found in calculus. (The roots of algebra are found in high school algebra,
and those of topology are in geometry.) The objects of study in calculus are
functions, derivatives, and integrals. The derivative of a function is an
extremely important tool- when it exists. But not all functions have
derivatives. The existence of a function's derivative is tied up with the idea
of that function's smoothness. A smoothing operator is a device which transforms
a function into a closely related but smoother function. (Applications of
mathematics to the real world, e.g., problems in fluid mechanics like airplane
design, almost always make the tacit assumption that the functions involved
possess a certain degree of smoothness. When, as is often the case, the actual
function is not that smooth, it must first be passed through a smoothing
operator. Smoothing operators are also extremely useful in communications
theory, where they are associated with the processes of noise removal and image
enhan cement.) Most smoothing operators are of a type known as convolution
operators. The motivation for this project is the desire to understand better
certain of these convolution operators. The oscillatory integrals of the title
are just tools which aid in this understanding.
