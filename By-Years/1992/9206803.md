The focus of this research is to discover if endophytic and pathogenic fungi
isolated from the inner bark (phloem, cambium), leaves and roots of Taxus
brevifolia and other Taxus sp. have acquired the ability to produce interesting
natural products, such as taxol, which are thought to be unique to the tree. The
project could provide a source of important natural products that are in
critically short supply. %%% With this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
(SGER), the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gary A.,
Strobel of the Plant Pathology Department at Montana State University. The
fundamental hypothesis to be tested in this project is whether microbes (fungi)
living in close association with higher plants aquire the ability to produce
specific compounds that appear to be unique to the plant genus.
