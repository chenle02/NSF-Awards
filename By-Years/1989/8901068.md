This proposal is a request for funds to defray travel costs for a number of
investigators (faculty, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students) to attend
the 3rd International Workshop on Hydra and Hydractinia Development. The
workshop will be held July 5-9, 1989 in Gunzburg, West Germany. %%% This meeting
has proved a valuable venue for workers in this rather small field to exchange
ideas, results and newly developed methods. Several collaborations have arisen
as a result of previous meetings.
