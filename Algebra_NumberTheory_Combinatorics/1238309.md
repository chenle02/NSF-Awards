MIT PRIMES is a free, year-long research program for high school students. This
proposal requests funding for research projects on representations of symplectic
reflection algebras in positive characteristic, representations of continuous
Hecke algebras in positive characteristic, the structure of lower central series
of associative algebras defined by generators and relations, the structure of
ideals generated by terms of the lower central series defined by generators and
relations, thracklability of graphs, decay of crossing numbers, Ramsey
multiplicity, the visibility conjecture, the Richter-Thomassen conjecture, and
coinvariants of incompressible vector fields.

PRIMES students will work on their projects during the academic year, aided by
weekly meetings with their mentors (MIT Mathematics Department graduate
students) on the MIT campus. The projects will be presented at annual PRIMES
conferences, and final papers will be posted on the Program website and
disseminated through arXiv.org and academic journals. Participation in PRIMES
would help talented high school students discover the beauty of mathematical
research and would inspire them to choose careers in the mathematical sciences.
A special section of PRIMES, called PRIMES Circle, will be dedicated to serving
students from urban high schools. PRIMES Circle students would learn an advanced
mathematical topic in a challenging academic environment through directed
reading and problem-solving. This would serve as preparation for further
research and encouragement for pursuing degrees in the mathematical sciences.
