Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award, granted jointly by the Chemical
Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division and the Experimental Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), is supporting the research of Professor
William A. Maio of New Mexico State University. Professor Maio is developing
novel and efficient approaches to advance simple starting materials into more
complex and valuable products, specifically by exploring underdeveloped methods
to access functionalized enamides. Currently, few methods exist for the
selective generation of these synthetic targets that are also present in a
number of medicinally relevant compounds. Professor Maio is positioning this
work as the key to unlocking selective syntheses for several enamide-containing
macrolide natural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a means to integrate these
research objectives with a strong commitment to the training of future
scientists, Professor Maio is developing activities to incorporate teaching and
education into the research experience. These initiatives include the
development of a summer workshop in synthetic chemistry for undergraduate and
graduate students that focuses on advanced topics that build upon the
undergraduate experience. Students acquire skills to arrive at innovative
solutions to complex problems. Students learn how to safely handle new and known
chemical entities, to communicate their work, and develop integrity through
exposure to high standards and ethical guidelines.
