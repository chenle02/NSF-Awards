This action funds Hadiyah-Nicole Green of The University of Alabama at
Birmingham to conduct a research project, entitled "Gold nanoparticles and
biodegradable thin films and the immune system," during the summer of 2012 at
Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The host scientist is Terry W. J.
Steele.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in a new technique using
nanotechnology to improve photothermal targeting of cells. This technique hides
nanoparticles from the immune system by embedding them within biodegradable thin
films. This method provides a way to target delivery of gold nanorods to only
the desired cells and not to all cells. Current methods for using nanoparticles
have the undesirable result of uptake by the liver, spleen and kidney which
greatly limits the effectiveness of nanoparticles for use in a highly localized
and minimally invasive approach to treat cancer. Broader Impacts of an EAPSI
fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside
the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific
infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society,
culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for
international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers,
and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.
