This proposal requests funds to support the participation of a group of US
scientists in the North Eemian (NEEM) Deep Ice Core Project, a project designed
to acquire a new ice core in northern Greenland. NEEM is an international
effort, led by the glaciology group at the University of Copenhagen. More than a
dozen countries have expressed a desire to participate. The US is a main partner
in NEEM and is already providing about one-third of the logistics costs needed
to collect the ice core. US scientists will take the lead on gas and gas isotope
analyses and studies of the physics of gas incorporation into ice, they will
place the modern climate in the context of the past two millennia, and they will
help provide the basic temperature records in the ice needed to place all
analyses in a climate context. A particular focus of the project will be on high
temporal resolution to explore abrupt climate shifts. The most prominent
analyses will focus on gas concentrations, in particular carbon monoxide, and
stable isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen, argon, krypton, and carbon. A final
subproject will focus on the firnification processes in order to understand the
advection and diffusion of gases through the snow and ice and the development of
ice bubbles that preserve the atmospheric gases.
