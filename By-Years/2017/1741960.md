Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC) will pursue the "Engineering Scholarship
Project" to provide 36 undergraduate engineering students with scholarships and
supporting activities that promote academic success. The project includes a
collaboration with Eastern Washington University, which will recruit upper-class
engineering students to serve as peer mentors for first-year community college
students within the context of a year-long robotics design activity. Targeted
scholarships integrated with a program of structured mentoring and student
support activities aim to increase the number of students who persist and
complete an engineering transfer degree at SFCC, and successfully transfer to a
four-year institution. The project has the potential increase the diversity and
availability of qualified engineers to meet regional workforce needs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will generate new knowledge regarding
evidence-based approaches to improving outcomes in community college engineering
student persistence, completion, and transfer to baccalaureate-granting
institutions. The Engineering Scholarship Project will develop and apply methods
of systematic outreach to high schools to recruit academically motivated
students and encourage them to enter undergraduate engineering programs at SFCC.
Student cohorts will be supported for four years: they will complete their two-
year engineering degree at SFCC and transfer to a four-year institution, where
they will complete the additional requirements needed to earn a baccalaureate
engineering degree. Student success will be supported through curriculum
pathways, faculty advising, peer student mentors, and supportive co-curricular
activities. Evaluation results will be used to drive changes in practice and
institutional culture that improve SFCC's future success in recruiting student
in STEM, as well as support successful two-year degree completion and transfer.
