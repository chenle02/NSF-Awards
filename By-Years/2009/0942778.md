Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)

The project, a collaborative effort between Texas Southern University and
Prairie View A & M University -- two HBCUs, is revamping laboratories to provide
virtual and remote (V-R) access and preparing instructional material for this
type of laboratory. The project team is developing the framework and website for
the laboratory and web-based experiments for courses in digital signal
processing and in robotics. The web-based framework is scalable so that faculty
members can gradually add more VR-Lab courseware to benefit more courses and
more subjects. Developing this laboratory is setting the stage for
infrastructure sharing between different institutions. The evaluation effort,
which is being led by an outside evaluator, is using surveys and utilization
statistics to monitor progress toward the project outcomes. The project's
material and results are being disseminated through website postings, conference
presentations and journal papers. Broader impacts include the emphasis on
minority students, the dissemination of the instructional material, providing
laboratory experiences to remote and non traditional students, and K-12 outreach
through existing programs
