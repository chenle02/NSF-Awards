This grant provides support for the "CUNY workshop on differential cohomologies"
to be held at the CUNY Graduate Center, August 12-14 of 2014. The topics of this
workshop are at the forefront of 21st-century mathematics, playing an
increasingly important role in topology, geometry and the physicists' quantum
field theories. This workshop will provide a fruitful exchange between leading
researchers in several interrelated areas, will expose graduate students to
research at the crossroads of these topics, and will facilitate interaction
between these students and senior researchers. In this way, recent discoveries
can effectively be shared and communicated, and new questions and directions for
research will arise, thereby advancing knowledge in this area of mathematics the
related sciences. The workshop organizers encourage the participation of
students and researchers who are members of groups that are underrepresented in
mathematics.

The scope of this workshop will consist of differential cohomology theories,
including ordinary cohomology and differential K-theory, abelian gerbes,
algebraic K-theory, free loop spaces, and connections with topological field
theories. The organizers plan to host approximately forty participants,
including twenty or so local attendees, and the remaining twenty receiving
travel and accommodations support by this grant. The workshop goals are to bring
together researchers in these areas, from graduate students to senior
researchers, to present fundamental material as well as to exchange ideas on
recent progress and to lay out new directions for research.
