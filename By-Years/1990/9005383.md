Continental growth by the accretion of microcontinental terranes is an
important but poorly understood orogenic process. The Wrangellia-Alexander
superterrane is one of the best documented microcontinents in the western
Cordillera, yet little is known of its tectonic and depositional history
immediately prior to its Cretaceous accretion. This project is a detailed study
of the provenance and sedimentology of the Seymour Canal Formation of the
Gravina belt, and Jura-Cretaceous sequence of flysch and volcanic rocks
deposited on the inboard slope of the Wrangellia-Alexander microcontinent prior
to final closure, in order to constrain the nature of this collision. The
project will focus on little-metamorphosed portions of the Gravina belt, and
carry out petrographic studies of sandstones and conglomerate clasts, coupled
with mineral chemistry studies of plagioclase and clinopyroxene in sandstones
and igneous rocks to establish provenance and tectonic setting. It will
integrate turbidite lithofacies analysis and ichnofacies and paleo- current
studies in order to reconstruct basin history, and refine the temporal framework
of deposition by combining new microfossil biostratigraphy with radiometric
dating of volcanic and detrital biotite and hornblende grains using Argon 40/39
methods. These studies will help document sedimentologic and tectonic processes
operative in this microcontinent collision, and may serve as a pilot study for
other, more enigmatic Jura-Cretaceous flysch basins of the Cordilleran.
