9622654 Melloy This research will develop generic models which can accurately
predict human performance in selected classes of complex inspection tasks and
can serve as a basis for selection and training of human inspectors. The
research is composed of seven tasks: (1) development of a conceptual framework,
(2) development of mathematical models, (3) development of computer based
inspection training program, (4) model verification, (5) model validation in a
controlled setting, (6) validation with field data, and (7) development of
guidelines for inspection training. Once developed, these models will support
the design of training interventions, which will lead to enhanced inspector
performance and consequent improvements in inspection quality. Development and
field testing will be done in cooperation with CIBA Vision Corporation, a
manufacturer of contact lenses. Contact lenses are FDA-regulated Class 2 medical
devices and inspection is necessary to ensure compliance. This provides an
excellent testbed for evaluating both the accuracy and efficacy of the models
developed and the ensuing training program.
