The principal investigator will develop the new quantitative trace element
technique of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In
addition, he will apply this technique to three specific research problems. The
work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Joaquin Ruiz at the University of
Arizona. Knowledge gained will also benefit undergraduates when Dr. Hollocher
returns to Union College following the grant period.
