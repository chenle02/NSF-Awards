The purpose of the project is to develop a down-hole in-situ loading plate test
under various wet conditions, which will provide data that can be used to
anticipate settlement damage to structures resting on collapsible soils; and the
development of a simplified analysis technique which can be used efficiently by
practicing engineers. The workplan includes: 1) development of hardware; 2)
development of testing procedures; 3) development of procedures for
extrapolating the test data to the prototype; and 4) checking the system by
applying it to a medium-scale field test.
