This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
exploratory development of electrochemical machining (ECM) technology based on
the employment of dispersed microparticles in aqueous electrolytes. The
methodology utilizes suspended particles of C, WC, Ag, or zeolite Y
incorporating Ag, in aqueous solutions containing compatible supporting
electrolytes such as NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaClO3, NaBrO3, NaOH and NaNO3. These
electrolyte mixtures will be used in the ECM of selected refractory materials.
Materials to be studied during Phase I will include W, Ta, Mo, Nb, WC, Inconel
718 and Hastelloy C. Enhanced ECM performance will result because the suspended
particles will function as microelectrodes in the applied electric field, and
exhibit microscopic electrical-discharge phenomena. This will result in
perturbation of the local ionic and chemical environments in the presence of
microparticles which will enhance the ECM process. Thus, the presence of
suspended electronically conductive microparticles in the electrolyte is
anticipated to mitigate catastrophic sparking, Joule heating, cathode
polarization, and anode shape changes due to these effects. Additionally, it is
expected that resulting surface tolerances will be on the scale of
microparticles. The approach is not expected to require significant modification
of hardware used with current aqueous electrolyte based technologies.
