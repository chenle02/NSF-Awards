This four year project will provide 685 middle school and high school
mathematics teachers in four counties in South Carolina with seminars by
nationally known speakers, inservice workshops, and academic year short courses.
In addition, a three year series of intensive five week summer institutes will
be offered for 48 leader teachers. The seminar series and workshops are designed
to build support among the teachers and in the community for excellence in
mathematics and to enhance administrative awareness and support for the efforts.
The project is designed to determine effective strategies for developing teacher
understanding mathematics, teacher and student abilities to communicate
mathematics, and to involve students in the discovery of mathematics. Course
materials will be developed to aid in implementation of exemplary classroom
teaching practices.
