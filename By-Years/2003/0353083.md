Abstract: 0353083 This award provides funding for a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site program in marine sciences at Oregon State
University's Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) located in Newport, OR. The
program will be called "From Estuaries to the Deep Sea" and will support ten
students during a ten-week summer research program for three consecutive
summers. The program will include independent research projects by the students,
field trips, workshops and seminars. It will conclude with student poster
presentations and written reports. Funding primarily supports stipends, housing
and travel and some research expenses for the students. The HMSC staff organize
the application process, match mentors to each student, supervise student
research projects, coordinate educational activities and organize events for the
final presentations for the students.
