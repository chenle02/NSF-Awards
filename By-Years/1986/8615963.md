The proposed work combines task-level motion planning with nonlinear hybrid
position-force feedback control to linearize and decouple the complicated system
dynamics of a robot. The approach combines mathematical rigor and experimental
validation, and treats the problem from a system point of view. The task level
planning obviates the need for joint-space task decomposition. The results
should be generalizable to a broad array of control problems in manufacturing.
