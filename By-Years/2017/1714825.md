The fastest-spinning neutron stars observable by astronomers have rotation
periods of milliseconds and are known as millisecond pulsars.  These stars, of
which about 250 are known in the Milky Way Galaxy, are important laboratories
for modern astrophysics in fields ranging from general relativity to the study
of supernovae.  Most have acquired their brisk spins by accretion of matter from
a binary companion, a process known as "pulsar recycling." However, most of
these systems have permanently stopped accreting and have low-mass white dwarf
stellar companions, making it impossible to study the pulsar recycling process.
 A research team at Michigan State University has developed a method to use the
NSF-supported SOAR telescope to discover new pulsars that are still actively
accreting, which will allow them to uncover how millisecond pulsars are formed
and find new insights into the nature of neutron stars.   The team will do this
by observing variable stars near gamma-ray sources newly discovered by NASA's
Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, and measuring their detailed physical
properties.  The team will mentor undergraduate students in astronomy research,
with an emphasis on recruiting members of groups underrepresented in science,
and also link public observing at the campus observatory to university football
games.

When spun up as millisecond pulsars in binary systems, neutron stars offer
stringent tests of general relativity, and the most massive neutron stars can
give clues to the details of supernovae explosions and constrain the equation of
state of cold nuclear matter at densities exceeding those of atomic nuclei. The
planned work will lead to the discovery of unique neutron star binaries, clarify
the existence of new classes of neutron star binaries, inform models for
millisecond pulsar evolution, and trace the mass distribution of neutron stars.
 These binaries will be further characterized with multi-wavelength radio,
X-ray, and gamma-ray data.
