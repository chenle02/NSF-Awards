This proposal primarily funds a large workshop involving all KDI PIs (2 years, 3
areas). The workshop will permit exchange of results among the KDI awardees and
also permit an understanding of what has been accomplished by the awards in this
program. Of particular importance is an effort to understand the effects of the
interdisciplinary focus of KDI and what that has meant in terms of final
research results. The meeting will be held in New Orleans in the late spring of
2002. Statistics, new research results, and information about the KDI program
will be gathered as part of the workshop.
