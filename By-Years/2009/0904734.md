This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an advanced
3-D hybrid simulation code (fluid electrons + kinetic ions) that included the
coupling of the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. The hybrid magnetosphere model
will be coupled an ionospheric model developed at the Naval Research Laboratory.
The existing code (H3D) will be enhanced for petascale application with advanced
techniques such as multi-zone asynchronous time-stepping and particle splitting.
The resulting code, called H3DM ("M" for multi-zone) will be validated by
comparing model results with observational data from a variety of NASA
missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of a 3-D global,
hybrid simulation of the magnetosphere with realistic coupling to the ionosphere
has the potential to be transformative in our abilities to model and predict how
the solar wind couples to Earth's magnetosphere and
ionosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has societal benefits because of
its relevance to space weather and space technology. The project has educational
benefits and includes both undergraduates an graduate students in the research.
