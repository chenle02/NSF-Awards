9504818 Murty This is a renewal of a project in which experimental and
analytical procedures were developed for characterizing crystallographic
textures and orientation distribution functions in hcp metals. These techniques
are now applied to a study of biaxial creep behavior in hcp metals (titanium,
titanium-aluminum vanadium alloys, zirconium, and zirconium-niobium alloys) that
have varied textures, microstructures and operating slip systems. In addition
transitional creep mechanisms from power-law to viscous creep and related
effects of texture on these transitions are explored. Deformation is
characterized by microstructural studies using scanning transmission electron
microscopy and optical metallography slip trace analysis. Emphasis is on the
effects of grain-shape anisotropy and texture on anisotropic biaxial creep and
transitions occurring under biaxial loading. %%% This research addresses creep
deformation mechanisms in metal alloys used at elevated temperatures. Improved
understanding of these mechanisms allows improvements in design and component
lifetimes. ***
