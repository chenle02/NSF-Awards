Working with Dr. Robert Nussbaum of the Dept. of Human Genomes Center at the
University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Lindee is developing a research plan to
understand modern eugenics. This plan includes a study of modern eugenics, 1950
to the present, which includes exploring the implications of the human genome
project for future "directed human evolution." She is trying to determine how
concerns about human evolution have shaped the development of genetics. By the
end of the postdoctoral year, significant progress should have been made on a
scholarly study of the problem. As part of the training under Dr. Nussbaum, Dr.
Lindee is working with research geneticists in an intense laboratory
apprenticeship. She is also working with the Center staff in preparing for site
visits, and will attend all administrative and scientific meetings of the
Center. With the training and the research which she is undertaking under this
fellowship, Dr. Lindee hopes to reshape the way historians, philosophers, and
social scientists think about eugenics in America. Provocative recent work on
German eugenics suggests some inadequacies of current American scholarship on
this topic. This work hopefully will open the field to more productive analysis.
