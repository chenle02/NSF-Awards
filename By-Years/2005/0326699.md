This is a project to develop a new tool for use in measuring in-situ
temperatures as part of piston coring operations during scientific ocean
drilling (an .APC tool.). Two earlier generations of APC tools have had a long
and productive history during the Deep Sea Drilling Project and the Ocean
Drilling Program, but new tools are needed for the Integrated Ocean Drilling
Program (IODP). The new tools will take advantage of recent advances in
electronics and computing capabilities and will improve on the quality of
acquired data and in interpretations based on these measurements. Previous
generations of APC tools have included a sensor and logger package installed
within the piston core cutting shoe; the new development will also include
design and creation of a new top sub that will permit deployment of two
instruments during a single tool lowering, allowing determination of a thermal
gradient.
