9403908 Vignale This theoretical grant involves the development of a current-
density functional theory for many-electron systems in magnetic fields and its
application to artificial microstructures in strong magnetic fields. Specific
systems to be studied include: (i) quasi-two-dimensional quantum dots; (ii)
quasi-three-dimensional wide parabolic quantum wells; (iii) quantum wires and
rings. %%% Conventional density functional theory which has been so successful
in describing the electronic structure of many physical systems is unable to
account for the presence of strong magnetic fields in a self-consistent manner.
This work will develop a current-density functional theory which incorporates
the magnetic field from the beginning. This will enable many strongly correlated
many-electron systems to be modeled accurately. Initial applications will be to
mesoscopic systems such as quantum dots, wires nd rings which occur in
microelectronics. ***
