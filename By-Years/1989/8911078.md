Animals, in general, do not behave in the same way toward all the members of
their species. Sex, age, and reproductive status are all examples of well-known
factors that might change how members of the same species interact. Less well
known, and more recently discovered, is the fact that genetic relationship can
also affect interactions. In this collaborative research project, Dr. Michael D.
Breed, of the University of Colorado, and Dr. Robert E. Page, Jr., of the
University of California at Davis, will conduct experiments to determine how
genetic relationship affects social interactions among honey bees. Drs. Breed
and Page will try to identify the chemicals used by bees to recognize genetic
relationship. They also will investigate exactly how this information is used in
social interactions. This research is important because the details of how
genetic relationship affects social interaction are not well understood in any
species. Thus, the findings may help to generate new, broadly generalizable,
understanding of how animals behave. This work on honey bees may also help in
improving management techniques for the economically important apiculture
industry.
