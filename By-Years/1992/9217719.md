This project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will develop new
methods for the synthesis of novel supra- molecular systems. In particular,
well-ordered and chemically robust surface multilayer films based on
structurally charact- erized lamellar inorganic compounds will be synthesized.
Layered metal phosphates and phosphonates will be synthesized from precursors
capable of Watson-Crick base pairing and other multipoint cooperative hydrogen
bonding interactions. Multilayer thin films based on Hoffmann clathrate
structures will also be prepared and the structure, host-guest chemistry,
electrochemistry, and optical properties of the films will be investigated. %%%
This project involves the development of new techniques for growing complex,
multilayer structures (films) based on lamellar inorganic compounds. These
techniques are inteneded to add to an emerging "nanofabrication" technology
which depends upon wet-chemical methods rather than ultrahigh vacuum deposition.
This may ultimately lead to the successful preparation of molecular-scale
electronic, optical, and other type devices.
