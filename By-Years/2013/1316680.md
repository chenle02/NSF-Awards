The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program supports the
work of Professor Eugene Pinkhassik of the University of Memphis focusing on
regulating the transport of small molecules through gated nanopores and creating
nanocapsules capable of rapid uptake and release of small molecules. The
transport will be regulated by controlling chemical environment of nanopores and
by reversible binding of plugs or lids. New nanometer-thin materials with gated
transport will be used to fabricate functional devices suitable for applications
in existing fields such as delivery of drugs or imaging agents and for enabling
new technologies.

New materials with programmable properties will be useful in biomedical,
biotechnology, and environmental applications. Devices capable of rapid catch
and release of bioactive molecules are likely to make diagnosis and targeted
therapy more efficient. This interdisciplinary project integrates research and
training with outreach activities aimed at underrepresented groups in science
and engineering.
