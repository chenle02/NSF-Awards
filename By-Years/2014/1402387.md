This project investigates the development of a natural antioxidant to be used as
a food preservative. Natural antioxidants currently available on the market are
usually obtained from plant sources, via extraction or a similar procedure. For
instance, natural tocopherols (vitamin E) are refined from vegetable oils such
as soybean oil. Other common natural antioxidants used in food industry such as
rosemary oil extract are also isolated from plant sources. Extraction and
purification procedures for these processes are time consuming and expensive,
leading to high price of natural antioxidants. Much less attention has been paid
thus far to natural antioxidants extracted from animal tissues. Animal or
poultry blood could be of special interest as a potential source of natural
antioxidants because of its low cost and broad availability. In addition,
erythrocytes present in blood are equipped with an extremely efficient
antioxidant "machinery" to protect the cell from continuous exposure to high
levels of oxygen. Availability of potent antioxidant activity in erythrocytes
prompted us to look into feasibility of commercially viable isolation of
antioxidants from these cells. This project has the potential to further advance
methods of extraction and characterization of antioxidants from animal/poultry
blood and provide better insight on their safety and susceptibility to bacterial
contamination. This could also advance knowledge about performance and stability
of antioxidants extracted in partially purified form, in a mixture with other
blood components.

Application of antioxidants increases the shelf life of food products and helps
to maintain their healthiness, taste and nutritional value, whether it is used
for preservation of animal or human food. The antioxidant developed through this
project is a "green" product and responsive to society's demand for naturally
derived products and will provide a cost-efficient way to address this demand.
Even more broadly, this antioxidant can be used in any products where lipid
oxidation has a negative effect on the product quality (e.g., as a preservative
human food, and as antioxidant in varnishes, latexes, oil paints, etc.), which
can provide markets for this product and further stimulate economic development.
