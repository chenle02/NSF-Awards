One of the most beautiful results in the theory of complex analysis is the
Riemann mapping theorem, which states that any simply connected open region in
the plane is biholomorphic to the complex plane or to the open ball. In passing
from analysis of one complex variable to several complex variables the situation
becomes much more involved. In fact, a uniformization theorem like the Riemann
mapping theorem is not possible. Riemann surfaces (surfaces with a complex
structure) can be given a natural Kaehler structure, while higher dimensional
complex manifolds need not be Kaehler. It is natural then, in some sense, to
study uniformization theorems for Kaehler manifolds. The object of this
conference will be to review work in this area, to discuss some recent results
(as yet unpublished), and to lay the ground work for more activity in the
future. Professor Y. T. Siu of Harvard University will be the principal lecturer
and will give a series of ten talks.
