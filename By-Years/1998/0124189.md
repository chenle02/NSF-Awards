The objective of the US-European Workshop on Bridges is to the
recent&lt;br/&gt;advancements in bridge engineering, focusing on new materials
and technology, monitoring&lt;br/&gt;and diagnostics involving integrated sensor
systems, new methods of analysis, design,&lt;br/&gt;evaluation, repair and
rehabilitation of bridges used in Europe, and identify the
most&lt;br/&gt;suitable topics for joint research projects. The major areas to
be covered include: (1)&lt;br/&gt;advanced materials (high-strength/high-
performance concrete and steel, composites,&lt;br/&gt;fiber-reinforced concrete,
smart materials), (2) development of load and resistance models&lt;br/&gt;for
steel and reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete structures, (3)
diagnostic&lt;br/&gt;procedures (tests, performance monitors, nondestructive
techniques, signal processing,&lt;br/&gt;integrated sensor systems, acoustic and
optical techniques), (4) materials and techniques&lt;br/&gt;for repair and
rehabilitation of concrete structures (reinforced and prestressed
concrete,&lt;br/&gt;steel, new composite materials). Accordingly the Workshop
attempts to state of&lt;br/&gt;the art summary of main topics as viewed on one
hand in the U.S. and, on the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;in Europe, identify the
research needs, in particular topics for cooperative projects;
and&lt;br/&gt;derive some recommendations that reflect the needs in manpower,
technology transfer and&lt;br/&gt;education for the near future. The Workshop
involves researchers and consultants. The&lt;br/&gt;local organizers also
organize special meetings, a conference, and field trips to
the&lt;br/&gt;construction sites. The results will be presented in the final
report.&lt;br/&gt;
