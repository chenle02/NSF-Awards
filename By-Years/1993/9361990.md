9361990 Weiman Efficient sensory perception and processing are crucial to mobile
robot navigation. As sensor technology advances, conventional processing methods
become a bottleneck, crippling real time operation. Transitions Research
Corporation has recently develop a low-cost LIDAR system capable of generating
10,000 samples per second, challenging conventional sensor data processing
rates. This research project will efficiently and robustly compress sensory
range-bearing data by applying the log-Hough transform to recognize walls and
characterize them parametrically. Walls are the dominant navigation reference
features in built environments. The log-Hough transform converts a long chain of
sensor hits on a wall to a single data point representing line parameters. This
succinct data can be used for localization against a priori maps without
overloading communications channels to the navigator. In Phase I, LIDAR data
will be gathered and analyzed with respect to range and bearing resolution;
software will implement the log-Hough transform for these data. In Phase II, the
method will be implemented in a real time prototype navigation system running on
TRC's HelpMate mobile robot. In Phase III, the method will be incorporated into
a commercial product for mobile robots navigation and obstacle avoidance.
