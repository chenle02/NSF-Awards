This award provides continued support for the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Advanced Vehicle Electronics (CAVE) at Auburn University.
The objective of the center is to perform research on new technologies for the
packaging and manufacturing of harsh environment electronics, with special
emphasis on the reliability and cost requirements of the vehicle industry. The
research thrusts of the Center in the harsh environments area include robust
packaging and interconnection technologies, modeling methodologies, damage
mechanics, material behavior and failure mechanisms, design procedures,
accelerated testing methodologies, field-life correlations, and manufacturing
processes. The Center puts its research in the hands of practitioners through
technology transfer mechanisms including software tools, and design guidelines.
