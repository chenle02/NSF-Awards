This project will entail theoretical studies of several aspects of quantum
fluctuations of spacetime and related issues. A key problem in any quantum
theory of gravity is understanding these fluctuations and their physical
effects. One will be the effects of quantum energy density fluctuation in the
early universe, especially in the context of inflationary cosmology. Previous
studies by the PI and his collaborators indicate that these effects may be
larger than one would have naively guessed, and possibly large enough to cause
observable effects today. A related topic is the study of the probability
distribution for quantum energy density fluctuations. A better understanding of
this distribution, especially the part which describes rare but large
fluctuations, can have applications to several questions in quantum theory and
cosmology. Other aspects of the project will include a search for secular
effects from quantum gravity fluctuations, that is, effects which can accumulate
over the history of the universe. If such effects exist and can be detected, it
would lead to significant insights. The project will also involve a search for
laboratory experiments to detect such effects as negative energy and lightcone
fluctuations in analog systems.

This project is expected to have a broader impact through possible benefits to
other fields of science, to education, and to technology. The insights and
techniques of this work may be useful outside of the specific subfields of
physics being investigated. The project is expected to further education through
the involvement of graduate students and of faculty at primarily teaching
institutions. It should also produce examples which can be used to explain some
of the concepts of quantum theory and relativity to students on a variety of
educational levels. The results of some of the investigations in this project
may be useful in other fields of physics, such as atomic physics and condensed
matter physics, and might eventually have technological applications.
