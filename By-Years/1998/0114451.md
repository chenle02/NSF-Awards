This award provides a travel grant to assure that approximately nine U.S.
historians of all levels who have appropriate interest in and knowledge of the
History of Telecommunications will have an opportunity to attend a conference on
the history of telecommunications to be held at Memorial University of
Newfoundland in St. John's 25 -27 July 2001. The conference is organized by The
IEEE History Committee and the IEEE History Center at Rutgers University. The
grantees will be chosen by the Program Committee on the basis of merit from
among those eligible participants registering for the workshop. As
telecommunications become ever more important economically, politically, and
socially, it is important to understand better their historical development. The
conference will bring together both engineers and historians for two and a half
days of paper presentations and discussions, shared breakfasts and lunches, and
optional evening activities and excursions.
