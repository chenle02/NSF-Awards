Pennsylvania State University will establish a Center for Undergraduate
Research Opportunities (CURO) to provide research experiences for minority
engineering students during their undergraduate years. The Center will be a
component of the existing Minority Engineering Program (MEP) in the College of
Engineering. CURO will begin operations with 20 minority engineering or science
students selected as research scholars. These students will be appointed to work
with faculty and staff in research units (laboratories or centers) within the
College of Engineering, or participating interdisciplinary research units within
the University. The appointments will be for a period of two academic semesters,
or for the summer session. Twenty-five research units with the University have
agreed to participate in this project initially. The students will be required
to take a course in "Research Methodology" to get training in the conduct of
research. The research faculty and staff will be provided with an orientation
course on cultural diversity to improve their skills for interacting closely
with students of diverse backgrounds. At the end of the appointment period each
student will be required to make a "Report of Research Activity." Over a five
year period the Center proposes to support a total of 120 minority engineering
and science students as undergraduate research scholars. After this period, the
Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities for Minority Engineering
Students will become an integral part of the participating research units with
the University and the Minority Engineering Program.
