The COVID-19 pandemic has affected urban and rural populations quite
differently. Because of the high degree of community transmission, large,
densely populated urban centers have experienced the vast majority of casualties
in the early phases of the pandemic, but rural hospitals have also been affected
as the pandemic spreads across the country. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID)
grant will support the collection of time-sensitive data to document
preparedness levels at rural hospitals over the course of the pandemic. Through
a collaboration with the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), this
project will collect and archive data from four trauma regions (two rural, two
urban) to identify unique challenges and opportunities faced by rural hospitals.
COVID-19 is expected to eventually reach rural communities before an effective
vaccine is available and the project has the potential to provide decision
support to public health administrators to better manage critical resources
during a pandemic or other mass casualty event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working
with the Center for Health Statistics of the Texas DSHS, this project will
collect longitudinal data regarding COVID-19 testing, case reports, staffed
hospital and ICU beds, deidentified admission and discharge data, and outpatient
procedures for hospitals in four regions of the state of Texas. The project will
also collect valuable subjective data by interviewing hospital decision-makers
about their operational decisions. By collecting these data from regions
supporting both rural and urban healthcare systems, the project will provide
useful information on differences in urban and rural healthcare system response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
