The Department of Meteorology is purchasing equipment for advanced
undergraduates to study the methods used in making mesoscale forecasts and short
term severe weather forecasts and warnings. The equipment is providing students
with hands-on experience in manipulating and enhancing real-time high-
resolution observational data to required to forecast mesoscale weather events.
Undergraduate are also using the new facilities for independent research studies
in mesoscale meteorology.
