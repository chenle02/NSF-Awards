The goal of this project is enable the creation of secure compute clouds
(Superclouds) without requiring ownership of the underlying infrastructure. This
will allow organizations and individuals to migrate to a cloud computing
environment while retaining control over placement and scheduling. Superclouds
make cloud computing and storage a commodity by freeing users from single
providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal aims to
create a Supercloud by utilizing nested virtualization, in which a virtual
machine, as well as the network and storage it relies on, can be migrated
between multiple underlying and heterogeneous cloud infrastructures without its
user being aware of the provider's hardware, hypervisor, or networks and without
any standardization of protocols between cloud providers. The project has three
components: 1) Optimize and generalize support of a Supercloud via nested
virtualization; 2) Develop a Supercloud manager; 3) Enhance the Supercloud with
network and storage abstractions that allow applications to run across multiple
clouds.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Superclouds address many of the shortcomings of
current cloud offerings. Users will no longer be tied to a particular provider;
they can move their resources between providers and can even build applications
that span multiple providers for increased performance and robustness. An open-
source Supercloud will also allow students to experiment with their own cloud
management algorithms, or instrument the Supercloud for study. Indeed, the
proposal includes plans to incorporate this into a summer workshop that the
proposers have been running in cooperation with a historically black university
(Howard) and also into Cornell's cloud course offerings.
