This project studies the design of robust bio-inspired Wireless Sensor Networks
(B-WSN) by leveraging optimal results from nature?s computation. Functional
robustness of living organisms is often attributed to the optimized structures
of their gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which oversee the proper behavior of
cells through interactions among different genes. GRNs can adapt to dynamic
changes (i.e., perturbations) in the environment, and are resilient to the
removal/malfunction of nodes in the network. This project will identify the
features intrinsic to GRN based robustness and fault-tolerance and apply them to
bio-inspired wireless sensor networks. In particular, teh project will devise
suitable mapping between GRNs and WSNs to form the basis of our B-WSN testbed to
assess network level robustness of biological systems. The B-WSN will be
designed to act as an in silico testbed, where each node can be monitored and
GRN-based routing topologies can be modi&amp;#64257;ed so that it is possible to
demonstrate how speci&amp;#64257;c topological aspects contribute to the
robustness of complex systems.
