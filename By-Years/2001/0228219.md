The objectives of this SGER project are to analyze the Imaging Doppler
Interferometry (IDI) data from the Utah State University Bear Lake dynasonde to
produce weekly mean prevailing and tidal wind profiles over the 70 - 100 km
altitude range and to extend the Arecibo Initiative on the Dynamics of the
Atmosphere case study approach to the Bear Lake data set to validate the
viability of the application of IDI to the measurement of atmospheric turbulence
parameters, a technique subject to considerable criticism within the aeronomy
community. Particular attention will be given to the optimization of a gravity
wave contamination algorithm to be applied to the turbulence data and comparison
with simultaneous satellite data.
