Archaeologists have constructed a broad overview of the culture history of the
Labrador Inuit using archaeological and ethnohistorical data, and have
identified environmental, historical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors
that might have affected cultural developments during the past 600 years. Of
particular interest has been the evolution of distinctive 18th century
communities characterized by large centrally located settlements with communal
houses, long-distance trade networks, explicit displays of wealth and strong
leadership. Different hypotheses have been posed to explain this development
including climate change, population growth, and socioeconomic changes growing
out of contact with Europeans. This three-year excavation project is designed to
test these hypotheses using settlement materials. The results will contribute to
our knowledge of climate change and human adaptation in the Arctic and relate to
global change issues.
