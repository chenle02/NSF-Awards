This grant will fund a special year in Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems to
be held at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during the calendar
year 1991. Research activity during the Special Year will concentrate on
problems in countable state Markov shifts, unusual ergodic theorems, and notions
of orbit equivalence. Three workshops are planned to bring together experts in
each of these areas for a short period of intense activity. Interesting
applications and related problems in smooth dynamics and ergodic theory will
also be discussed. The Department of Mathematics is funding three visiting
positions and this grant will fund partial expenses for a series of short term
visitors and workshop participants.
