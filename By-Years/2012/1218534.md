This project, developing new techniques for enabling planners to automatically
learn from experience, offers fast, high-quality solutions to very large motion
planning problems that arise in robotics, CAD/CAM, animation of virtual
characters, and surgical planning. These problems are challenging because they
require searching high-dimensional state spaces with complex geometric
constraints, nonlinear dynamics, often with contact and impact, and long time
horizons. Prior approaches have sought to solve these problems efficiently by
embedding a great deal of domain knowledge into planning, but have relied
heavily on human expertise to develop and exploit this knowledge. This process
is tedious, error-prone, and does not scale well to harder problems that do not
possess an obvious structure. This project will investigate automated strategies
for planning systems to automatically discover common solution structures from
past experience and to reuse this knowledge in new problems, with the ultimate
goal of demonstrating a system that automatically optimizes planning strategies
for a novel domain with minimal training and hand
tuning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The ability to solve large
planning problems efficiently has myriad benefits to many fields of knowledge.
But on a human level, this grant will provide the opportunity to recruit an
undergraduate or Master's student intern from a minority-serving institution
each summer, in cooperation with the Alliance for the Advancement of African-
American Researchers in Computing (A4RC). Broader dissemination of the work will
be achieved by distributing a research and educational software library for
task-and-motion planning (PyTAMP), and integrating software with the open-source
ROS and OMPL libraries. Research will be integrated with education in robotics
and AI courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, as well as in K-12
robotics outreach.
