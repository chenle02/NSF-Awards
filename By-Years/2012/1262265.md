In the field of molecular biology, there is an urgent need for tools that can
help elucidate the structural basis for macromolecular binding. This project
will develop computational methods for automated discovery of structural and
physical-chemical elements contributing to the affinity and specificity of
macromolecular binding. Graph models for the representation of protein
structures and graph kernel-based machine-learning methods will add to the
analysis and prediction of binding sites. The proposed graph models will provide
a succinct data structure to encode a range of structural and physical
properties germane to molecular interactions. Particularly, the models will
reflect the flexibility of protein structures. The proposed innovative graph-
kernel-based approach will investigate the modular organization of binding sites
and discover characteristic patterns associated with the modules. The methods
and procedures produced in this work will assist researchers in pinpointing the
location of the binding sites and elucidating the binding
mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive interdisciplinary educational and
outreach plans will target undergraduates, graduates, and researchers from
industry. Interdisciplinary bioinformatics courses will bring together students
from life sciences and computer science and spearhead the curriculum development
for the bioinformatics program at North Dakota State University (NDSU).
