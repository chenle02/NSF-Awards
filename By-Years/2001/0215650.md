This award provides partial support for a topical conference entitled
"Opportunities in Biology for Physicists", to be held in Boston on September
27-29, 2002. The conference will be aimed predominantly at graduate students and
postdocs in physics who are considering applying the methods of physics to
biological topics. Physicists and biologists who are leaders in their fields
will be asked to give broad overviews of selected areas at the interface between
physics and biology. In addition, there will be talks on the "how to" of moving
into the interface between the disciplines. Support is provided jointly by the
Physics Division and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS
Directorate.
