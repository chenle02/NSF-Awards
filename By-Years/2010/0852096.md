This award will continue the National Solar Observatory (NSO) Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) / Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)
program with the funding of six students and four teachers per summer. The NSO
offers a unique educational opportunity by providing direct access to world-
class research facilities and scientific staff in solar physics research. The
NSO provides the solar physics community with a suite of world-class telescopes
that enable studies of the solar interior, photosphere, chromosphere and corona.
With direct use of these facilities, or by using data previously taken with NSO
telescopes, students will be mentored in projects ranging from studies of the
Alfv√©n waves in the solar corona to measurements of the plasma flows in the
solar interior below coronal mass ejections. NSO REU students enjoy exposure to
the intense research environment at the Sacramento Peak telescope facilities,
and to the university environment of the Tucson location; at both sites, the REU
students mix with graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in addition to
their scientific mentors. The REU students' independence is fostered by
requiring research talks at the end of the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSO
REU/RET Site has a goal of serving a diverse group of students, including those
from research universities and those from smaller schools that normally would
not have access to forefront research projects. The NSO program has served an
audience with a gender and ethnic diversity comparable to that of the general
physics and astronomy undergraduate population, and continues to work to
increase REU and RET participant ethnic diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF
Division of Astronomical Sciences under the NSF REU program.
