Our ability to restore tropical ecosystems and to construct sustainable, useful
analogs of tropical forests depends on our ability to grow communities of plants
that are ecologically compatible. This research will evaluate mixtures of
species likely to use space and soil resources in complementary ways, enabling
them to take good advantage of the high potential productivity of the humid
tropics while protecting the soil. Plants of three life forms (those that are
self.supporting and have broad, horizontally displayed leaves; those that are
self . J H.supporting, with narrow, erect or arching leaves; and vines) and
three life spans (several months to many decades) will be grown in combinations
of one, two, or three species at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.
The performance of the gardens will be evaluated by measuring growth, light
capture, water use, and nutrient retention. The efficiency with which simple and
complex communities use resources is likely to improve dramatically during the
first two years of growth, and longer.lived plants are likely to excel as
community age increases. Because invasions by unwanted species are so important
to the maintenance of native biodiversity, each artificial community will be
tested for resistance to invasion by native and exotic plants.
