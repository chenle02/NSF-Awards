The energy gap in superfluid 3He-B is to be measured over a wide range of
pressure and at low T/Tc. Ultrasound will be used to measure the pair-breaking
edge, 2 (P,T), in the T-- O limit, for the first systematic test of the
quasiclassical weak-coupling + WCP theory of Serene and Raianer. In addition,
the proposed work will provide a stringent self-consistency check on the WCP
model and the heat-capacity and phase-diagram results of Greywall. Performing
the experiments in the microkelvin temperature regime will make the results less
sensitive to problems in theomometry compaired with work at higher temperatures
where very high accuracy is required. Furthermore, the very-low-temperature work
will permit a study of the possible defects in the theoretical picture, as
suggested by experiments at high temperature and high pressure. Finally, the
reearch requires the development of broadband acoustic techniques and their
extension to miocrokelvin temperatures. This research examaines the role of
quantum mechanics in determining the fundamental properties of matter through
high- frequency acoustic probing of liquid 3He at temperatures less than lnK
above absolute zero.
