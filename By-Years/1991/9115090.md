The determination of the abundances of stars from their high resolution spectra
forms the most fundamental observational basis for understanding how stars
evolve through their life cycles. The Principal Investigator (PI) will continue
his previous NSF- supported work to determine to what extent interior nuclear
reactions are responsible for the creation of heavy elements, which subsequently
alter the chemical composition of interstellar gas via stellar mass loss and
influence the evolution of future generations of stars. The PI's new work will
focus both on the chemical composition of stars in our own Galaxy and in those
of the Magellanic Clouds in the Southern hemisphere. In addition to
concentrating on the production of certain heavy elements (Ge, Rb, and Mo), the
PI will concentrate on 13C, the light-metals abundances in massive stars, Li
abundance in solar-type stars, and the apparent chemical anomalies in chemically
peculiar A stars known as "lambda Bootis" stars. In addition to clarifying the
role of networks of heavy-element nuclear reactions in stellar cores, this
research is expected to help our understanding of the possible roles of
convective mixing and radiative diffusion in the envelopes of many stars on the
"main sequence."
