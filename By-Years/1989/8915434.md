This award will support a workshop jointly organized by Professor Lee A.
Willson of Iowa State University and Professor Roberto Stalio of the University
of Trieste. The workshop will be the second in a series on dynamical phenomena
in stars and circumste- llar environments. The first one was held in Trieste on
pulsation and mass loss; this one will be on angular momemtum and mass loss and
is being held in Ames, Iowa. The objective of this series of workshops is to
explore and stimulate research in fundamental problems of stellar astrophysics.
Fundamental unsolved problems of stellar astrophysics include the effects of
angular momentum on stellar structure and evolution, the nature and efficiency
of the processes by which angular momentum is redistributed within and lost from
stars, and the role that stellar rotation plays in enhancing or driving stellar
mass loss. A workshop on the topic of angular momentum and mass loss is timely
because: (1) computational codes incorporating stellar rotation into stellar
models are beginning to be developed; (2) there has not been a meeting recently
concerning this topic as it applies to the more massive, rapidly rotating stars;
(3) the importance of rotation as a factor in mass loss and in affecting
pulsation, which in turn affects mass loss, is just beginning to be appreciated;
and (4) observational techniques making use of rapid rotation to study pulsation
properties of early type stars are also being developed. The topic is
particularly appropriate for support under the U.S.- Italy Program since much of
the important activity in this area is being carried out in these two countries.
