&lt;br/&gt;The proposal uniquely plans to connect IIT to Argonne National
Laboratory and then vBNS and Abilene, as part of an I-wire initiative. This
network will enhance fluid dynamics research by making instrumentation in the
IIT Fluid Dynamics Center available to other researchers via the national
network; biological simulation research which are too large to run on the local
IIT computer cluster; and research on improved methods of data-transfer among
computational grids.&lt;br/&gt;
