The research proposed by Dr. Horn will comprise experiments designed to further
our understanding of why there are so few species of herbivorous fishes in
temperate and high latitudes of the ocean as compared to much larger numbers in
tropical waters. The experiments will focus on the 1) role of seaweed toughness
in dietary choice of temperate-zone herbivorous fish, 2) growth of these fish on
diets of varying protein content and 3) the effect of temperature on food
processing efficiencies and metabolic requirements of these cold-water
herbivores. These experiments will test hypotheses that form the essential
elements of a model of temperate-zone fish herbivory. This model predicts that
1) only relatively inactive fish can meet their energy demands at low
environmental temperatures on an all-seaweed diet and therefore that 2) a
seaweed diet is energetically feasible for more active fish only during the
warmer periods of the year. The fishes to be studied are two abundant inshore
California species--a sluggish year-round herbivore (Cebidichthys violaceus)
from the rocky intertidal zone and an active, seasonal herbivore (Sebastes
mystinus) from the adjacent kelp bed community.
