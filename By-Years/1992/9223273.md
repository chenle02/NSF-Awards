The long term goal of the proposed research is to understand the interactions
which regulate a synergistic virus infection. Experiments focus on synergistic
interactions between potato virus X (PVX) and any of several related viruses
from the potyvirus group of plant viruses. The PVX/potyvirus synergisms are
characterized by a large increase in the level of PVX in co-infected cells as
compared to cells infected with PVX only, but no corresponding increase or
decrease in the level of the potyvirus. Our recent work indicates that the
regulation of PVX RNA replication is altered in the synergistic co-infections.
The main focus of this proposal is to delineate the potyviral sequences which
regulate various aspects of the PVX/potyviral synergism using stable
transformation experiments in whole plants and in synchronously infected
protoplasts. A further aim is to clarify the role of long distance viral
movement in localization of the acute synergistic response. %%% Recent studies
have shown similarities in diverse plant and animal viruses based on genome
organization, mechanisms of gene expression, and sequence homology of virally
encoded, nonstructural proteins. These results suggest that elucidation of
molecular mechanisms for virus interactions obtained in one system may well
apply to a diverse group of other virus systems.
