Bioprinting technologies are critical enablers for fundamental research and
applications in a variety of biomedical and biological domains. This grant will
facilitate the acquisition of a high-resolution bioprinting system equipped with
one-of-its-kind laser induced forward transfer (LIFT), micro-valve drop-on-
demand, and micro-extrusion printing capabilities along with an imaging system
driven by machine learning algorithms for in-line quality assessment of printed
structures. LIFT, which enables precise, pressure-free deposition of individual
cells and microparticles, in conjunction with the other two printing modalities,
will catalyze fundamental and applied research in domains including additive
manufacturing, tissue engineering, animal and plant cell biology, functional
materials engineering, and bioelectronics. Hundreds of college and K-12
students, postdocs, and professional workforce at NC State University and
partner universities and industry will be exposed to this system, the first of
its kind in the state of North Carolina, through various research, education,
and outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multimodal system, which
enables micrometric precision and cellular and microparticle-level control
during printing (resolution &lt; 100 Âµm), will support various interdisciplinary
research projects leveraging a broad range of organic and inorganic materials at
multiple length scales. Examples of research activities enabled include: 1) LIFT
process physics and process-structure characterization for musculoskeletal
tissue engineering; 2) development of more reliable organoids (e.g. skin, gut,
lung) for tissue engineering, oncology, and drug screening applications; 3)
investigation of regulatory mechanisms that modulate cell-to-cell communication
across different plant stem cells toward designing plants with desired traits;
4) designing functional soft material composites with specific compositions and
micro-architectures to achieve unique photonic, mechanical, and biological
properties; and 5) investigating bio-recognition pattern designs, specific
binding chemistries, and surface interactions toward developing miniaturized,
multiplexed biosensors and bioelectronics. The system will contribute to the
development of therapeutic and diagnostic tissue engineered products; robust
plants and agro-products; biomedical devices, sensors, and electronics; and
functional soft materials among other applications of national and global
importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
