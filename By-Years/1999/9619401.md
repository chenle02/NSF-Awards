9619401 Dawson ABSTRACT The ten week Clemson Electrical and Computer Engineering
Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program will be composed of ten
undergraduate researchers and over ten faculty mentors involved in individual
research projects and professional development activities. Research projects are
available in the following areas of research: Computational Electromagnetics,
Digital Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, Mechatronics, Electronics,
Power Systems, and Computer Architecture. The professional development
activities will consist of seminars/workshops on technical writing, oral
communication, graduate education, academic careers, industrial careers, and
professional ethics. Each student will be required to present a mid-program oral
presentation on the progress of their research. At the end of the summer, the
student will participate in a poster session, prepare a written report and an
extended abstract, and present an oral presentation on their research. Faculty-
student interactions will be enhanced through a number of activities including
five informal lunches highlighting presentations on research and graduate
studies in electrical and computer engineering. ***
