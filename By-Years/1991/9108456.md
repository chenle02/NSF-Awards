The goal of this project is to ascertain the influence of vacuum ultraviolet
radiation (1200A) on the epitaxial crystallization of gallium arsenide (GaAs). A
definitive study is planned to quantitatively assess the epitaxial growth rate
and the crystalline quality of GaAs films synthesized under conditions such that
the flux of ultraviolet radiation is varied over four orders of magnitude while
other growth parameters are held essentially constant. The results of this study
could have a significant impact on fundamental understanding of vapor phase
epitaxy, and may provide a means for lowering the temperature requirements of
epitaxial crystallization of technologically important electronic and photonic
materials without compromising the exceedingly high crystal quality needed for
advanced electronic and photonic devices.
