The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) is a next-generation “extremely large
telescope” that is to be built in Chile, with first observations of the southern
skies anticipated in the mid-to-late 2030s. With this award, the National
Science Foundation will support development of key technologies needed to ensure
the telescope obtains the sharpest images possible. At the heart of the GMT are
seven 8.4-meter diameter mirrors. These must be aligned with seven smaller
mirrors, each 1-meter in diameter, mounted at the top of the telescope. This
precise alignment, or “phasing”, requires very careful design and testing of a
range of cutting-edge technologies. The award will support this crucial
development work. The award will also support a workforce development program
and research into an informal education program. GMT will plan a summer program
of activities, based on the University of Texas at Austin’s existing Texas
Astronomy Undergraduate Research Experience for Under-represented Students
(TAURUS) Program, that will target underrepresented communities. Working with
the San Francisco Exploratorium, GMT will also explore new ways of developing
exhibits that are better suited to a diverse audience, ideas that could be used
in a future travelling GMT exhibition.

The project will focus on three specific technical risk-reduction activities.
The primary mirror (M1) active optics system will be tested by installing one of
the recently completed M1 segments in a Primary Mirror Test Cell, to demonstrate
active optics control of the mirror surface wavefront error using the optical
metrology tower at the University of Arizona’s Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab. The
project will also build an Adaptive Secondary Mirror Phasing Testbed (ASM PTB)
and will use this to demonstrate ASM segment position sensing and control. The
PTB will include a metrology frame of reference for the ASM first article and
will confirm position sensor performance. Finally, the team will also develop a
Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics Wavefront Sensor (LTWS) prototype to address
potential design risk features identified during the preliminary design phase,
prototyping a single channel Shack-Hartmann Sensor, and testing the dynamic
performance of the sensor motion stages and cable wrap design concepts.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
