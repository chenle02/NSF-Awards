9400214 Magid This award supports a U.S.-Belgium workshop on future directions
in affine differential geometry to take place in Leuven and Brussels, Belgium,
July 10-12, 1994. The organizers are Martin Magid of Wellesley College and
Leopold Verstraelen of Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium. Specialists from
Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Russia will participate. The purpose of the
workshop is to review new directions in affine differential geometry and
identify future research collaborations. The Europeans have done most of the
recent work in this field. Through this workshop, this small group of U.S.
researchers will expand their contacts and coordinate their efforts with the
European group. Affine differential geometry is the study of invariants of
submanifolds under the group of affine motions. The subject has been studied for
a long time; however, there has been resurgence of interest in recent years.
Recent discoveries now link affine differential geometry to fundamental problems
in computer vision and image processing. The proposed workshop examines these
new directions and is expected to stimulate new areas for research. ***
