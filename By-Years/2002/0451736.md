Which business will succeed? Which team will win? Am I better or worse than
others? Comparative judgments like these inform some of the most important
decisions people make, including decisions to start a company, apply for a job,
or enter a competition. This research project investigates the causes behind
systematic errors in these judgments: People tend to rate themselves better than
average on simple tasks (even though the task is simple for everyone).
Conversely, on difficult tasks people rate themselves below average. The goals
of the research are (1) understanding the way people make comparative decisions
and (2) teaching people to make better decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will advance our understanding of comparative judgment by testing two
theories about exactly how people form comparative judgments: regression and
conflation. The regression explanation can account for better-than-average and
worse-than-average effects using only the fact that people have better
information about themselves than they do about others. The conflation
explanation posits that people conflate relative with absolute evaluation; when
asked to compare A with B, A's absolute standing unduly influences the
comparative judgment. The proposed studies would test key predictions of each of
these two theories, as well as differentiate regression and conflation from
other viable alternative explanations for these biases in comparative judgment.
