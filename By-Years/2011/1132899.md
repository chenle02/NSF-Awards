Abstract Proposal: OISE-1132899 &lt;br/&gt;PI/Institution: Triantafyllou,
Michael S., Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed U.S.-Brazil Ocean Engineering workshop (in Rio de Janeiro, August
16-18, 2011) will bring together US and Brazil experts to catalyze new
collaborative areas between the two countries that will complement current ocean
engineering effort s and strengthen the benefits for ocean related research in
the US. The US delegation is led by Dr. Michael Triantafyllou (Massachusetts
Institute of Technology) and it has representation from the Naval Postgraduate
School, the U. of Michigan, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Texas A&amp;M
University, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Florida Atlantic University.
The Brazilian counterparts, led by Dr. Murilo Augusto Vaz (Federal University of
Rio de Janeiro), are from the Universidade de Sao Paulo, Pontificia Universidade
Catolica de Rio de Janeiro, Universidade Estatal de Campinas, Instituto de
Pesquisas Tecnologicas, Centro de Pesquisas e Desenvolvimento Leopoldo Am√©rico
Miguez de Mello, and Petrobras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brazil has made
significant investments in R&amp;D for off-shore oil and gas drilling and thus
developed considerable expertise in ocean resource extraction. Brazil has also
invested heavily in new facilities, research institutes, and university programs
in ocean engineering making it a world leader in deep water oil and gas
reservoirs exploration. Brazil's investment coincides with similar efforts at US
universities increasing ocean research and related education activities thus
making this workshop a very timely and productive endeavor.
