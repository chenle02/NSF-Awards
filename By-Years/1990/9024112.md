This proposal is to investigate the narrow bandgap semiconducting silicide
CrSi2. The goals of the work are to characterize electrically metal/CrSi2
contacts and CrSi2/Si heterojunctions, to demonstrate and measure the infrared
photoconductive response of CrSi2 thin films, and to determine the potential of
CrSi2 films on Si as an infrared detector technology. The proposed research is
an experimentally-based investigation of CrSi2 grown as epitaxial thin films on
silicon wafer substrates. Growths will be performed with a versatile "Silicon
MBE"-type growth system. Device structures will be fabricated for
characterization of the infrared photoresponse. These measurements will include
the spectral dependence of photoconductivity of the films, and the photoresponse
of a Schottky barrier infrared detector made within the CrSi2 film. Strong
emphasis will be placed on controlling the films microstructure, and
understanding its influence on the observed photoelectronic properties. We
intend to demonstrate the growth and properties of an epitaxial semiconducting
silicide on a single-crystal substrate. We will characterize two new intrinsic
semiconducting infrared detectors which may be monolithically integrated on a
silicon microelectronic chip.
