The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is that it provides unique secure, tamper resistant
record keeping and logging services that leverage blockchain technology for a
wide range of IoT applications. The solution will provide significant benefits
in terms of performance, cost (e.g., total ownership cost), cyber attack
resilience, security and privacy assurance for both IoT device owners,
operators, and industries utilizing IoT technology such as transportation, smart
city, logistics, supply chain management, manufacture, energy, critical
infrastructures.

This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a scalable auditing, record
keeping, and logging system for internal/external operations and data
interactions of IoT devices, which are fundamental components to support other
critical properties and operations of IoT enabled infrastructures. The record
keeping and logging system solves several critical challenges in distributed IoT
environment: transaction ordering and data distribution. In addition, the
logging and transactional system can be the centric component for producer-
consumer style applications.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
