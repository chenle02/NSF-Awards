The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) is an annual conference that is
hosted on a rotating basis by Rice University, Texas A&M University, and the
University of Texas at Austin. TAGS 2015 will take place on April 10 - 12, at
Texas A&M University, in College Station, TX. TAGS provides an opportunity for
local researchers to meet and interact, as well as to learn the latest advances
in Algebraic Geometry, interpreted in its broadest sense. There will be a
Special Lecture aimed at graduate students. In addition, young researchers
(graduate students and postdoctoral associates) will have the opportunity to
present their work in a Poster Session. More information about this meeting is
available at: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~laura/TAGS2015/

Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations
in (usually) many variables. Such questions are of central importance to
mathematics and its applications such as coding theory, cryptography, and the
study of various natural phenomena. This grant will fund a conference in this
area, where investigators from Texas and the neighboring states may learn the
newest developments in this field from distinguished invited speakers. This
conference is also an important opportunity for local researchers, especially
graduate students and postdocs, to meet and interact, gaining exposure for their
work and potentially establishing new collaborations.
