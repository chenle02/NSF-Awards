Funds will be provided to investigate sedimentation processes in the mixed
siliciclastic carbonate slope and basin environment in the Gulf of Papua as a
part of the integrated source-to-sink experiment at the Fly River-Gulf of Papua
focus site of MARGINS. Through the use of detailed acoustic surveys and seabed
and water column sampling the proposers will estimate sediment fluxes and
transport pathways from the shelf edge and carbonate reef margins to the
ultimate sinks of the Ashmore and Pandora troughs over the last interglacial
cycle. The work will lead to an understanding of the history of sediment
accumulation on the continental slope and the deep ocean for the mixed system as
well as sediment fluxes and transport mechanisms by identifying timing and
geometry of deposition in the Gulf. The ultimate objective is to develop a model
for mixed carbonate-siliciclastic deposition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
