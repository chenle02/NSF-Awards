This research in the laboratory of Professor Rachel Austin at Bates College is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
under a Research Planning Grant. The photochemistry of metalloporphyrins in
large-pore alumino silicates (MCM-41) will be studied to provide background for
the potential development of photoactivated catalysts that will insert oxygen
into hydrocarbons. MCM-41 will be characterized by SEM and X-ray diffraction as
a means of ascertaining the quality of the material. SEM and NMR studies will
determine whether metalloporphyrins are embedded in the MCM-41 channels or
located on the surface. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a
heterogeneous catalyst that will insert an O-atom into unreactive hydrocarbon
bonds. The advantage of the MCM-41 will be to immobilize the reactive
metalloporphyrin.
