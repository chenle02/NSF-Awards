This is a support to co-sponsor the workshop "the Eighth Workshop on Decadal
Climate Variability: Decadal Predictability and Prediction: Are We Ready?" which
was held in St. Michaels, Maryland from 19 to 21 October 2009. The goal of this
workshop is to provide decadal climate variability researchers a regular and
frequent forum to discuss their latest research results with their colleagues.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop provides support of travel and other
expenses for several graduate students and post-docs.
