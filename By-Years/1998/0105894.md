ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for small grants for
exploratory research (SGER) to apply a new expertise and approach to
"established" research in early impact cratering events.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically,
the PI and his collaborator, Dr. Gunter Lugmair, plan to develop a routine field
and laboratory procedure for using the Cr isotope method in investigating early
impact cratering. The Cr isotope systematics of impact ejecta has been shown to
be one of the most effective tools not only for verifying the occurrence of
impact events but also for identifying the class of meteorites that impacted
during these events. All samples studied for Cr isotope systematics so far,
however, were carefully selected, containing a significant proportion of an
extraterrestrial component (ETC) in the impact ejecta. In contrast, most of the
suspected impact sites on Earth are characterized by a low ETC content. This is
reflected particularly by low Ir and Cr concentrations. When Cr concentration is
low, the isotopic composition of the terrestrial background Cr masks that of the
cosmic Cr. This severely hampers the use of the Cr isotope method. To avoid
these difficulties much effort is needed to develop physico-chemical procedures
for concentrating meteoritic Cr in the samples and to continue improving the
mass-spectrometric technique for the Cr isotope analysis. In addition, a
thorough selection of the samples based on their geological settings and
measurements of concentrations of other siderophile elements is crucial. For
this study, Cr isotope systematics of the ejecta materials from two suspect
impact sites in South Africa and Western Australia will be analyzed. Samples
from these sites have variable ETC concentrations; these have never been
analyzed for Cr isotope systematics before. A successful completion of the
proposed investigation will be a great leap forward in our ability to
unequivocally identify impact sites, constrain the nature of the
extraterrestrial impactor in each site, and better understand the geological and
environmental consequences of cratering on the Earth's surface. &lt;br/&gt;
