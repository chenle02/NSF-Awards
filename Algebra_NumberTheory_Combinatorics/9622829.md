This award provides funds for a project to study affine and double affine Hecke
algebras. The latter algebras (recently introduced by the principal
investigator) lead to a new approach to various problems in representation
theory, special functions, harmonic analysis, conformal field theory,
combinatorics, topology, and number theory. The main objectives are (1) the
theory of differential and difference operators acting on polynomials, theta
functions and various generalizations, (2) representations of double affine
Hecke algebras at roots of unity, connections with the monodromy of the double
affine KZ equations and elliptic braid groups, (3) the action of the modular
group on the Macdonal polynomials, (4) relations to quantum groups of elliptic
type, Kac-Moody algebras, matrix models, and W-algebras, and (5) applications to
harmonic analysis. This research is in the general area of Combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research. This research also deals with orthogonal
polynomials, which are useful in designing optical transmission lines.
