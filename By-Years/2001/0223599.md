Process Formulisms for Defining Government Processes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much
of the daily operation of government may be thought of as the faithful and
precise execution of prescribed processes (law, rules, regulation). This small
grant will explore the potential for the application of a special purpose
computer language (LittleJIL) to aid in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of
government processes, such as the issuing of licenses. This preliminary grant
will begin the building of a partnership between the PI and the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts in investigating the potential of this novel idea.
