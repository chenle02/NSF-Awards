The project is aimed at establishing a synergistic link between Information
Technology Research (ITR) and research in an emerging area of materials
engineering. The research activities include the development of the multi-level
theory of diffusion-induced deformation phenomena in particulate materials, such
as sintering and electromigration. All constitutive relationships will be
obtained through numerical experiments in a virtual test environment, using an
innovative parallel computing procedure for linking different material structure
levels. This will allow the reduction of a cumbersome and expensive experimental
analysis and will clarify the sensitivity of material properties to different
structure parameters at various length scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
efforts include a basis of an on-line process (powder consolidation) control for
a wide range of particulate component designs, which are used in industries
involved in the electronic circuits production for wireless applications,
information technology devices, MEMS fabrication, sensors, etc. The project
incorporates a plan for the advancement of the Materials Engineering Curriculum
of San Diego State University, including the development of the Master of
Engineering Program as well as the Joint Doctoral Program with University of
California, San Diego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
