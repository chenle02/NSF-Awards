This project develops the mechanical engineering and technology materials
science and failure analysis laboratories. These laboratories are intended to
improve the understanding of the fundamentals of materials science and to
promote the applications of materials so as to minimize failure and maximize
performance. Graduates of this program will meet industries' need for engineers
who can design and produce high quality goods more efficiently. New courses are
being developed and laboratories integrated into these as well as existing
areas. The acquired equipment permits the inclusion of materials specifications,
fatigue and fracture analysis. The addition of the Materials Testing System
permits a major upgrade of the current curriculum. The acquisition of this
state-of-the-art instrument allows students to become familiar with all
essential tech- niques needed to design and analyze ways to prevent failures in
machine parts. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution. //
