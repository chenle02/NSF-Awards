University of Rhode Island proposes to support technical services on R/V
Endeavor, a 184? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The proposal
requests support for basic services. They will provide one shipboard technician
on each cruise of R/V Endeavor to support seagoing research projects and to
maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of
shared-use research instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. &lt;br/&gt;
