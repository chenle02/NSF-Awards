The proposed research is a combined theoretical and experimental investigation
of the structural and rheological properties of colloidal dispersions. The
effective medium properties are incorporated in a statistical theory to evaluate
pair of particle interactions. The calculation of the structure and rheological
properties for a variety of systems is proposed. The theory will be tested via
light scattering measurements, for mixtures of hard spheres, sticky spheres and
spheres bearing grafted polymer layers. The statistical mechanics approach can
be regarded as an alternative or complement to molecular dynamics or Stokesian
simulations, covering dilute and medium concentrated dispersions. The suggested
theory should be valuable for the fundamental information generated, as well as
the insight gained for guiding and correlating experiments for colloidal
dispersions of interest in automotive and architectural coatings, ceramic
particles processed as dispersions, cosmetics, and printing inks.
