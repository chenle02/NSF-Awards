9701568 Moehle The PEER Center is a consortium of nine core institutions,
closely linked and regularly interacting through electronic networks. The focus
of PEER is to develop urban earthquake risk reduction technologies within a
performance-based earthquake engineering framework. The research program
contains five basic thrust areas: (1) policy, planning and economics; (2)
seismic hazards; (3) performance assessment; (4) systems reliability; and (5)
innovative technologies. PEER serves as a problem-focused, integrative center
that bridges disciplinary gaps and barriers. In addition, project applications
provide research focal points, a business and industrial partnership program
should attract funding, and urban demonstration projects will test the
applicability of research results. Education and partnership programs are used
to educate students and attract qualified under-represented minorities to
earthquake engineering, and include innovations such as the Engineering
Undergraduate Scholars Course, the K-12 Public Education Program and a WWW page.
The PEER Center is one of three EERCs networked with an overarching governing
board to provide synergism in creating new knowledge and technology, educating
the next generation of earthquake engineers and scientists, and providing
outreach to industry, government, pre-college schools and potential user groups.
