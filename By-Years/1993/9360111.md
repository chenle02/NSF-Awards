9360111 Chapman The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of
effectively removing halocarbons from wastes by subjecting them to
radiofrequency glow discharges which produce radical and ion intermediates.
These intermediates, upon recombination are expected to produce polymers that
may be less well-defined than commercial polymers but which possess properties
that make them more acceptable for some applications than the polymers of
current commercial importance. This is a Phase I award based on a proposal
submitted in response to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Program Solicitation. Results of this project are expected to provide the basis
for determining the technical feasibility of this process to produce results
equivalent to those achieved by alternative oxidative and thermal processes now
used to destroy halogenated chemical compounds in wastes.
