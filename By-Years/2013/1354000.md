This RAPID proposal seeks funding to produce a next-generation integrated deep-
sea in situ geochemical sensing package, with leveraged support from Marine
Science and Technology Foundation (MSTF) contributing to sensor development, an
improved sensor wand micromanipulator, and overall instrumentation integration
with smaller ROVs, and with NSF support contributing to purchasing upgraded ISEA
electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration of this specific NSF-supported
instrumentation upgrade with Glazer?s project with the Marine Science &amp;
Technology Foundation provide for a synergistic, highly leveraged partnership
between academic (UH), federal (NSF), private foundation (MSTF), and small
business (AIS, Inc.) entities for addressing complex biogeochemical processes
occurring in the deep-sea. The project is expected to result in a series of
publications and presentations to be disseminated in appropriate peer-reviewed
scientific journals and international meetings.
