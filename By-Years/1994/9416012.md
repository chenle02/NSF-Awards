9416012 Goldman PROJECT ABSTRACT The proposed research will investigate the
importance of uncoupling photosynthetic carbon incorporation and nitrate uptake
under low light conditions. Low light conditions are common at the base of the
euphotic zone where episodic inputs of nutrients through mixing events might
trigger the rapid growth of large diatoms. In addition, studies will be
performed on the role that diffusion may play in the limitation of nitrate
uptake and hence diatom growth. Those same experiments will also investigate the
possibility that diatom growth might become limited by free CO2 as the pH rises
and the total inorganic carbon pool shrinks. These studies will be performed in
a series of controlled laboratory experiments involving isolates of large
diatoms form the Sargasso Sea that are currently in culture in the Principal
Investigator's laboratory. The results will provide a basis for assessing
important aspects of the physiology of large phytoplankton species, their role
in new production, and the potential impact of molecular diffusion in
structuring the autotrophic portion of marine food chains.
