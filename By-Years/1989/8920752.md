This research will develop and apply a new approach to modeling the variability
of economic and financial time series. The suggestion is to combine the models
of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity developed in the early 1980s
with time series models involving (Markov) switching processes. Combining these
approaches offers promise of capturing more realistically the time series
properties of dramatic economic events such as the stock market crash, financial
panics or major changes in monetary or fiscal policy. Being able to characterize
these events in a coherent time-series framework may prove to be critical in
understanding the behavior of financial markets.
