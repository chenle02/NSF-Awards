Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an extra-nuclear, maternally inherited set of
genes assumed to be selectively neutral; that is, their distribution within
populations is subject only to chance events, and not to differences in
evolutionary fitness conferred by these genes. The goal of this project is to
detect effects, if any, of mitochondrial genes on an organism's morphology or
nuclear genetic makeup. This is a first step towards understanding how
mitochondrial and nuclear gene interactions may affect development, and , thus,
how mtDNA genotypes may be subject to evolution by natural selection.
Populations of wild trout, known to be hybrids between evolutionarily divergent
groups, will be studied. Randomly mating hybrid swarms formed from such distinct
taxa are rare in nature. They will permit statistical tests for association
between mtDNA genotype and nuclear genotype, sex, and morphology (number of
vertebrae, fluctuating asymmetry, etc.). Demonstration that mtDNA is subject to
natural selection would have important implications for the widespread use of
mtDNA as a marker for studies of genetic variation and population structure.
Also, wild populations of trout are an important natural resource, the integrity
of which is seriously threatened by hybridization with introduced species. This
study will add to our understanding of the dynamics of interspecies
hybridization in salmonid fishes.
