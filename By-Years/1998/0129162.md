&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop on Linking Ecological Biology and
Geoscience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic environmental science increasingly depends
on collaborations among biologists&lt;br/&gt;and geoscientists. We propose to
bring together 35 leading scientists to explore how to&lt;br/&gt;promote
interdisciplinary research across the interface of ecological biology
and&lt;br/&gt;geological science. During a two-day meeting at the annual
Ecological Society of&lt;br/&gt;America (ESA) meetings, we will address
questions about intellectual opportunities,&lt;br/&gt;needs for unified
synthetic models, and how best to support and fund such
research&lt;br/&gt;interactions. A central goal is to engage the broader
community of scientists within the&lt;br/&gt;ESA, in a manner similar to what is
taking place in the American Geophysical Union&lt;br/&gt;(AGU). The final
product of this workshop will be a "white paper" report that
addresses&lt;br/&gt;the prospects and challenges for disciplinary convergence
between ecosystem biology&lt;br/&gt;and the geosciences. We will also submit
summaries of the meeting to the ESA bulletin,&lt;br/&gt;EOS, the Geological
Society of America (GSA), and appropriate journals such as Nature&lt;br/&gt;and
Science.&lt;br/&gt;
