The objective of this research is the development of single wall carbon nanotube
photo-mechanical actuators for the development of nanotube based sensors and
actuators. Single wall carbon nanotubes have been recently demonstrated as a new
class of actuator materials that require only small voltages for actuation.
While much work has gone into the area of nanotube based electrical actuators,
the field of optically driven nanotube actuators is at best nascent. The
approach of this research is the fabrication and combination of nanotubes with
material systems such as electro-active polymers to transduce the light energy
that is incident on the nanotube sheet to actuate the polymer and develop
wavelength selective photo-actuators. Finally.

Intellectual merit: The impact of this research is in the area of sensors and
actuators. Currently piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials used for
actuators require electronics that have to generate hundreds of volts for
actuation. The photonic actuators are light- weight and can actuate remotely
that can be utilized in interplanetary space missions. Further, the development
of nanotube based micro-opto-mechanical systems can be utilized for label free
genetic analysis of biomarkers in cells that can be used for monitoring
autoimmune diseases with high ultra-high sensitivity

Broader impact: The success of this proposal will demonstrate the applications
of this technology for micro-opto-mechanical systems for label free genetic
analysis in cells. The research brings in opportunities for undergraduate and
graduate student training in nanotechnology. Industrial partnerships through
this research can potentially be used for commercialization of this technology
and can bring greater benefit to the society and economy.
