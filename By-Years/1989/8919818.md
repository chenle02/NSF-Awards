The problem of adaptive optimization of stochastic dynamical systems is
considered with respect to the regret (or learning loss) criterion. The regret
criterion accounts for the loss in performance incurred in a stochastic adaptive
optimization problem because of the implicit on-line learning task involved when
the system model is not completely known. In particular, the construction of
asymptotically efficient adaptive control schemes (i.e., schemes that minimize
the rate at which regret accumulates with time), and/or adaptive schemes that
come arbitrarily close to the minimum rate is sought. The intention is to
capture, through the proposed problems, important issues in the conflict between
learning and control, to investigate these issues, and to obtain new insights
and techniques in designing asymptotically efficient adaptive control schemes.
The results of the investigation could have important implications on many areas
of science and technology. They could lead to the design of better codes for
communication systems with unknown channels; better control algorithms for
communication and queueing networks with incomplete information about customer
arrival rates, mean service time, or system configuration; better experimental
treatments in clinical trials, and better adaptive control schemes for
econometric models.
