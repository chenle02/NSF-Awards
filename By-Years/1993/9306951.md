9306951 Andrei This project will investigate the finite frequency conductivity
of high-Tc superconductors. The finite frequency response could provide
important clues to the understanding of the mechanism of superconductivity in
these materials. It is also essential in various applications such as the
construction of low loss transmission lines or resonant cavities, where the
performance is limited by the finite frequency dissipation in the
superconductor. The project will focus on developing a radio frequency
spectroscopic technique to measure the conductivity in the superconducting state
in the frequency range O.4-4 GHz. At the lower frequencies, the experiments will
access an as yet unexplored region of the rf conductivity of these materials.
%%% This proposal investigates the resistance of high-Tc materials for currents
in the radio frequency range (overlapping FM broadcasts and airplane radar
frequencies). The behavior of the resistance at these frequencies has not been
measured, and will provide fundamental information about the high-Tc materials.
It is also essential in various applications such as the construction of low
loss transmission lines or resonant cavities, where the performance is limited
by the finite frequency dissipation in the superconductor. ***
