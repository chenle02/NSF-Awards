1565318 &lt;br/&gt;Keasling, Jay D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the
workshop is to convene experts in synthetic biology and related fields to
identify broad principles and methods to translate fundamental discoveries from
synthetic biology into useful bio manufacturing platforms. It is anticipated
that the workshop will generate new ideas towards the next steps of leveraging
the potential of synthetic biology for new
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will survey a broad array of
topics, including protein folding, metabolic pathways, cellular and tissue
engineering, and evolutionary forces, to identify new research and educational
directions that can capitalize on advances in synthetic biology and lead to
innovative manufacturing methods and products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
is co-sponsored by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of
CBET, the Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities, the
Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Division of
Chemistry and by the Physics of Living Systems Program of the Division of
Physics.
