The grant will support student travel to the International Symposium on Code
Generation and Optimization (CGO 2012). CGO is a top conference in the area of
advanced compilation techniques, such as feedback-directed optimizations and
attuning. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and
workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include
building the next generation of researchers in this research area.
