Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: Infrastructure for Multi-Agent Decision-
Making Research &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0453923&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stuart M.
Shieber&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Harvard University
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project: This project will support the
development and distribution of community resource software supporting research
and education in multi-agent decision-making. The PI's will expand a research
for use in research studies, modeling, and strategy development on multi-agent
tasks. The testbed is based on a parameterized family of games called Colored
Trails (CT) in which agents as individuals or teams make decisions about
resource allocation. The community resource software will provide more realistic
decision making settings than previously available systems, will facilitate
analysis of decision making strategies of individuals, teams, and computer
agents or combinations of these and enable development and testing of decision-
making strategies. Broader impacts include facilitating research in multi-agents
systems and machine learning, supporting new groups in research and education in
these areas, development of research and education materials, support for REU
students, and participation in diversity efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
