Turbulent Mixing, Internal Waves, and Intrusions: Effects on Resource Supply and
Primary Productivity in Lakes

Turbulent eddies circulate phytoplankton through a gradient of light and supply
nutrients from deep in a lake to the well-lit portions where phytoplankton grow.
Hence, the frequency and duration of turbulent events play an important role in
governing the growth rates of phytoplankton. Turbulence varies as a function of
differences in the initial rates of heating after iceoff, wind forcing, and
proximity to boundaries. Because the study looks in depth at seasonal heat
budgets, stream inflows, intrusions, internal waves, and temporal-spatial
variability of turbulence, with concomitant biological measurements and
experiments, results will provide a unique perspective on the role of physical
processes in governing primary productivity and will allow better predictions of
within lake changes due to global warming and human activities in lake basins.
