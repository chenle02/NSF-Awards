This research is designed to investigate the dynamics of change at the
molecular level. It uses the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase in the genus Colias
(the sulphur butterfly) as an experimental model. The major focus of this
research involves a comparison of PGI DNA sequences within and between species
of Colias and related genera. Sequence changes will then be interpreted in
relation to three dimensional structural information on PGI, the phylogenetic
relationships of the butterflies involved, and previous studies on Colias PGI.
In addition, this information will be used to address relationships within the
Coliadinae, which includes Colias. One of the potential real benefits of the
proposed research is that a more accurate picture of selective forces on PGI
associated with the structure and function of this protein will be obtained.
