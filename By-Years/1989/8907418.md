It is proposed to continue research on transport theory in heavy ion
collisions. Two body collisions are treated via a relaxation time method. This
will be compared with other methods, both in simple and fully 3D geometries. The
effects of pion production will be investigated, and some estimates made of the
nuclear equation of state at moderately high densities.
