A Symposium on "The Chemistry of Metal Ions in Biological and Biomimetic
Systems" will be held on December 17, 1989 at the International Congress of
Pacific Basin Societies. This conference will bring together investigators
concerned with (1) Metalloenzymes: active site structures and properties; (2)
Biomimetic metal complexes: models for structural and catalytic properties; (3)
Metal-biomolecule interactions; and (4) Molecular targets of metals in
biological systems. It is expected that a synergistic interaction between the
conferees will result.
