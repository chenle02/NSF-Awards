9423858 Mayo The goal of this REU Site program is to expose students to the
field of metals science/materials engineering at an early stage in their
undergraduate careers, preferably at the freshman and sophomore levels. Sixteen
students will participate during an eleven week summer intern program in
research projects the theme of which is "materials processing for optimized
projects". Because processing projects are invariably hands-on and produce
quick, visible connections between cause and effect, such projects are ideal for
stimulating undergraduate interest. Furthermore, the materials processing field
is an easy one in which to integrate students of varying ability levels. %%% It
is expected that students participating in state-of-the-art processing research
and technology projects will be very effective agents in transferring this
technology to industry, since most students will take industrial positions upon
graduation and carry this knowledge with them.
