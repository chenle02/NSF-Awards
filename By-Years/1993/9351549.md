The goal of this project is to establish a state-of-the-art undergraduate
laboratory for rapid electronic prototype development and test. The laboratory
will support courses in electronic design, packaging, reliability,
troubleshooting and instrumentation. Students will also have open access to the
facilities to work on individual projects and to try new ideas. Laboratory
equipment will include twelve electronic fabrication and test benches for
student use, two (GPIB and VIX) computer driven automatic test systems with TEK
"Lab Windows" and Fluke "2240 GPIB Test Team" software, four PC 486 computers
with CAE/CAD design, analysis, and packaging software, two high tech solder
stations, and a state-of-the-art surface mount technology fabrication station
with a micro TV camera. The project pulls our entire electronics program
together into a complete hands-on experience for the students. The laboratory
presents to production oriented students everything needed to completely design,
develop, build, package, qualify, and troubleshoot an electronic project,
allowing students to experience the complete product development cycle.
