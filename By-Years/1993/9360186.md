9360186 Flusberg Recently declassified military research has validated the
applicability of artificial guide stars to atmospheric compensation for
astronomical observations. Of the two alternative guide-star techniques that
have been demonstrated, the more promising is the laser-induced generation of an
artificial star in the sodium layer located at an altitude of 95 km. The
required laser power depends strongly on the observation wavelength of the
telescope. It ranges from about 2 watts in the infrared (2000 nm) to 300 watts
in the visible (500 nm). For a large, visible-light telescope, a pulsed laser
beam with approximately one joule of energy, repetitively pulsed at several
hundred hertz and tuned to the 589-nm sodium-D line is needed to generate a
suitable guide star. To make this source acceptable to the astronomical
community, such a laser should be inexpensive, compact and reliable. A
flashlamp-pumped dye-laser system will be developed for this application. Recent
advances in flashlamp-pumped dye-laser design have greatly increased the
achievable efficiency and beam quality, while recently developed all-solid-state
magnetic-compression-pulser technology that has demonstrated a lifetime of 7 x
1010 shots in similar applications can be used to make pulsed dye laser much
more compact and reliable. These advances and recently developed dye-laser
modeling codes will be used to design a guide- star laser source. ***
