With the increasing demand of ubiquitous sensing and cyber-physical interaction,
wireless sensor networks have emerged as one of the key technologies for many
long-term applications such as such as habitat monitoring, microclimate study,
structural integrity analysis, precise agriculture, traffic engineering and
assisted living. Compared with competing high-end technologies, sensor networks
are acclaimed as low-cost, low-profile, and easy to deploy. These attractive
advantages, however, imply that resources available to individual nodes are
severely limited. Among them, energy constraint is by far the most critical
hurdle hindering the practical deployment of this emerging technology. A central
challenge addressed by this project is to sustain the operation of wireless
sensor networks for years in energy-dynamic environments. The driven idea of
this project is energy-synchronized computing ?a holistic approach to
synchronize sensor network activities with dynamic energy supply from the
environments. The expected deliveries of this project are (i) the design and
implementation of sustainable sensor nodes, (ii) the architecture principles,
theoretical insights, design methodologies, and protocols for sustainable
networking technology, (iii) the running prototype systems for long-term
sustainable applications, and (iv) the educational test-beds, outreach
activities for K-12 students and minority groups, and curriculum designs for
undergraduate and graduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
