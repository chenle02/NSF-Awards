This is a proposal to develop the DNA sequencing technology using the atomic
force microscope (AFM). AFM can image surfaces at submolecular resolution by
scanning a sharp tip over the surface, and under favorable conditions, and has
resolved individual nucleotides of DNA. In this project, feasibility studies
will be carried out to determine if, in fact, reliable methods could be
developed for AFM to actually sequence DNA molecules. If successful, the new
method could allow DNA sequencing at least 100 times faster than the currently
available technology.
