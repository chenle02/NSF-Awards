9634048 Briars The Pittsburgh Reform in Mathematics (PRIME) project is part of a
broad systemic initiative in Pittsburgh designed to implement standards-based
instruction in all content areas. In this four-year project, PRIME will support
teachers in the classroom implementation of standards-based mathematics
instruction and assessment in grades K-12 through the use of exemplary
instructional materials (e.g., Everyday Mathematics in grades K-3, Connected
Mathematics in grades 6-8, and materials from other grades to be determined from
a defined menu). PRIME will also help teachers attain a broad knowledge base in
both the mathematics content and successful mathematics pedagogy needed in order
to understand and implement the new materials successfully. As a Local Systemic
Change through Teacher Enhancement project (and one of the initial projects
funded at the middle/high school levels under the guidelines for Local Systemic
Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12), PRIME will
provide all 924 Pittsburgh Public Schools teachers of mathematics with a range
of activities that include multi-day summer workshops, prime-time, release-day
professional development workshops, and individualized, in-class support
provided by demonstration teachers and/or mathematics lead teachers within each
school. By equipping all Pittsburgh mathematics teachers with the knowledge,
skills, and support necessary for effectively using exemplary materials and
assessments, PRIME will ensure that all students experience a coherent
mathematics program that will yield high achievement at all levels. All teachers
of grades 6-12 receive 234 hours of professional development, and teachers of
grades K-5 receive 102-132 hours. Cost-sharing in the project is approximately $
6 million, primarily from the Pittsburgh Public Schools.
