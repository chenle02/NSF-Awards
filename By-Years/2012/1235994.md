An unusually large isotopic step-function change within the current 2011-2012
snowpack offers the means to test a new methodology for quantifying sublimation
processes in snowmelt. The team will measure oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in
snow profiles over time at 2 cm resolution using a laser spectroscopic
instrument (LGR liquid water isotope analyzer). This evolution of the step
function with time will enable them to calculate isotopically distinct
sublimation losses by fitting the isotopic profiles to the diffusion-advection
equation. These data are crucial for understanding snowpack mass balance and
thus the timing and magnitude of the delivery of snowmelt to riverflow. This
project builds on the heavily instrumented and monitored current capability at
the Dry Creek Experimental watershed, Idaho.
