The contractor for this project will conduct the Joint NSF/NIH Survey of Public
Understanding of Science. The 1992 survey continues a series of surveys started
in 1979, and will expand the survey program significantly. In addition to
conducting the traditional NSF-sponsored survey of approximately 2,000 adults,
the contractor will develop a new questionnaire focussing on biomedical
sciences, and will conduct this new, second questionnaire with 3,000 adults,
including 1,000 blacks and 1,000 Hispanics. The contractor will conduct field
tests, a non- response bias study, and be responsible for a long-range planning
study. The contractor will also prepare various analytical reports for NSF and
NIH. The data from this project will be used in Science &amp; Engineering
Indicators-1993, a congressionally-mandated report. This survey project is
closely coordinated with similar surveys in Japan and the nations of the
European Community, all of which will share the results of their surveys.
