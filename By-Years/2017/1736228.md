This award supports participation in the Conference on Enumerative Geometry,
Mirror Symmetry, and Physics held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, from July 17-21, 2017. The topics of the conference
lie at the core of twenty-first century research at the boundary between
mathematics and physics. Research at this boundary has led to exciting new
insights and rapid progress in mathematics, while at the same time providing new
tools and rigorous arguments to physics. The conference provides a needed venue
for dissemination of the most important recent results and a context for the
exchange of ideas and the growth and development of new approaches and new
projects.

The conference will bring together leading experts from algebraic and
differential geometry, string theory and supersymmetric field theories, and
their connections to topology and representation theory, to explore physical
contexts and mathematical problems in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry, and
related physics (including modularity phenomena, topological recursion, F-theory
and nonperturbative phenomena). The conference will focus on these developments
and future prospects in these areas. Additional information is available at the
