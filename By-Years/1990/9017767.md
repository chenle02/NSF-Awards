This research is a collaborative effort to develop simultaneous body-wave and
surface-wave inversion methods for the earthquake source. The goal is to attain
unified descriptions of earthquake rupture processes using the entire spectrum
of seismic and geodetic measurements. Currently, even the most sophisticated
analyses of different wave types (e.g., body waves and surface waves) often
yield inconsistent fault parameters. This inconsistency should be resolved by
joint inversion. The work will merge three different body-wave inversion
methods, each appropriate for a certain class of earthquake rupture, with high-
resolution, fundamental-mode surface-wave spectral- inversion techniques. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
