0216531&lt;br/&gt;John&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville (TAMUK)
seeks NSF support for the acquisition of a gas chromotograph/mass spectrometer
(GC/MS). The proposed GC/MS will include peripherals to enhance and supplement
the research abilities of the department. Research interests in the following
areas would benefit immediately:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrocarbon
characterization in the ambient urban atmosphere and the evaluation of voc/n0x
ratios in Corpus Christi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characterization of sorption and
interphase mass-transfer of complex mixtures and their constituents for use in
risk and remedial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research project to
evaluate potential fruit and nut organic compound bio-accumulation near
contaminated groundwater sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control of ozone precursors
using an enhanced oxidation - biofiltration technology
.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative biofilter designs for chlorinated compound and
dioxin precursor air emission control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrogates for
dioxins furans monitoring from combustion emissions.&lt;br/&gt;
