Professor Mary Wirth of the University of Delaware is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to utilize the combined techniques of
single molecule spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe
adsorption processes and kinetics of materials central to separation technology.
In particular, studies focus on the adsorption of peptides as a prerequisite for
studying protein adsorption. The probe dye molecule DiI is used to
spectroscopically report on the physical and chemical nature of adsorption sites
on silica gel. AFM is used to measure nanoscale roughness and to relate possible
connections between roughness and chemical adsorption. The work addresses why
topography promotes active silanols. It also addresses whether smoothing can
reduce active silanols sufficiently to impact peptide and protein separations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern liquid chromatography is approximately a two
billion dollar per year worldwide industry, and is crucial to pharmaceutical,
biotechnology and many other industries. Developing efficient and reliable
techniques for peptide and protein separation is of basic interest for
proteomics, and in this sense, for further developments in diagnosis and
treatment of disease. There remain unresolved issues, with one of the most
problematic being the undesirable loss of resolution due to residual silanols on
the silica phases used to separate compounds in mixtures. This work attempts to
explain the fundamental issues about the residual silanols, eventually enabling
improved separations.&lt;br/&gt;
