I intend over the next three years to understand how hybrid objects, made partly
of configurations spaces and partly of bary-center spaces and/or of a collection
of unstable manifolds of critical points arise in Yamabe-type problems as well
as in contact form geometry. I also would like to make out of the homology which
I have defined for contact forms (on a space of dual Legendrian curves) a
practical tool.

Singular solutions arise in a natural way in several fields of Science (Physics:
Ginsburg - Landau, liquid crystals, biology, chemistry etc). Smooth solutions
are variational solutions which also arise in a natural way, in the same fields,
but through a different process (extremization of kinetic plus potential energy
in Physics...) I intend to understand at least partly what are the bridges
connecting these two processes.
