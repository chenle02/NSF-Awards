Funds are provided for WPI to purchase a computer controlled servohydralic
materials testing system with a 1600 C capability furnace. The facility will be
used by faculty in several departments. The initial use will be to assist
research in the mechanical behavior of advanced structural materials such as
ceramics, fiber reinforced cementitious composites and metal matrix composites.
