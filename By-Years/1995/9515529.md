The focus of this research project is to study the role of electron spin in
electron transfer at electrode surfaces. Professor Klebanoff, who is doing the
research under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) sponsored by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is working to determine if electron
spin effects can be measured. A uniformly magnetized nickel single-crystal
electrode serves as a spin polarized source and acceptor of electrons. The
reduction of a paramagnetic transition metal complex ion in acidic solution
proceeds with an oscillatory magnetization of the electrode. Using lock-in
amplifier technology, the reduction current is examined for an alternating
current component at the frequency of the magnetization. An understanding of the
mechanisms by which electrons are transferred between species in solution and
electrically conducting solids is of both fundamental and technological
importance. In this project, Professor Klebanoff is investigating the role of
electron spin as a possible new probe for the study of electrolytic processes.
Such a new probe might impact on the practical development of batteries and fuel
cells as energy sources.
