This collaborative study between Columbia University and the Southampton
Oceanography Centre will investigate the dynamics of warm water intrusions under
antarctic floating ice shelves. The study will focus on the Amundsen Sea and
Pine Island Glacier, and will document how this water gains access to the
continental shelf, transports heat into the ice shelf cavities via deep,
glacially-scoured troughs, and rises beneath the ice to drive basal melting. The
resulting seawater-meltwater mixtures upwell near the ice fronts, contributing
to the formation of atypical coastal polynyas with strong geochemical
signatures. Multidecadal freshening downstream is consistent with thinning ice
shelves, which may be triggering changes inland, increasing the flow of grounded
ice into the sea. This work will be carried out in combination with parallel
modeling, remote sensing and data based projects, in an effort to narrow
uncertainties about the response of West Antarctic Ice Sheet to climate change.
Using state-of-the-art facilities and instruments, this work will enhance
knowledge of water mass production and modification, and the understanding of
interactions between the ocean circulation, sea floor and ice shelves. The data
and findings will be reported to publicly accessible archives and submitted for
publication in the scientific literature. The information obtained should prove
invaluable for the development and validation of general circulation models,
needed to predict the future role of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in sea level
change.
