In this collaborative project the Principal Investigators (PIs) will investigate
mathematical models for topological phases of matter and their application to
the nascent field of quantum information. Examples of topological phases of
matter include Fractional Quantum Hall liquids and topological insulators:
materials subjected to extreme physical conditions (e.g. near zero Kelvin, under
large magnetic forces) which appear to exhibit topological behavior. The main
objectives of the project are to better understand the taxonomy of these exotic
states of matter through mathematical models, address physically and
computationally motivated mathematical problems, and apply topological and
algebraic methods to study them. For example, the issue of quantum computational
power (universality) may be analyzed by finding the images of the braid groups
under representations associated to a particular model. Moreover, the extant
hypothesized models for topological states of matter do not capture all of the
subtleties (such as fermionic topological order) so the PIs will develop new
models.

The classical states of matter of solid, liquid and gas have more refined
classifications: for example, solid crystals may be differentiated by their
symmetries. Newly discovered topological materials have yet to be fully
understood, but potentially can be used to build (quantum) computational devices
out-performing standard micro-chip based computers. The most commonly
encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum circuit model, requires
challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the hardware to be of practical
value due to local interactions of the system with the surrounding environment.
The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically
more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. The PIs will
mathematically study these exotic states of matter focusing on their application
to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit to society.
