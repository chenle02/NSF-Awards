The long-term objectives of this proposal are to detail the molecular mechanisms
regulating transcription and replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and
its defective interfering particles (DI). This prototype negative-strand
rhabdovirus is readily grown in large quantities and is an excellent model
system for numerous other disease-causing viruses as well as basic mechanisms of
cellular gene expression. Only three virion- associated proteins (L polymerase,
NS transcription factor, and nucleocapsid N protein) are sufficient to carry out
a complex genome transcription process in vitro. NS is regulated by
phosphorylation and contains an acidic activating domain which probably
functions like that found in many eukaryotic cellular transcription factors. We
plan to purify the virion-associated protein kinase(s) responsible for
activating VSV transcription. Specific NS protein domain II substrates will be
prepared to monitor this purification. The physical and biochemical properties
of this purified kinase will be examined to shed light on the question of
whether this activity is encoded by the virus or host genome. Basic studies of
viral genetics such as this one not only provide an understanding of how viruses
grows and develop but also provide information about generalized genetic
functions in animal cells.
