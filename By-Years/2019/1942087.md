This project investigates using social media that combine live video streaming
with text chat and content repositories as a medium for educational games in
mathematics and other fields. Commercial platforms for game streaming such as
Twitch engage users in tens of billions of minutes of engagement per month.
Visitors don't just watch; many visit the site in order to learn art techniques
and coding as well as how to play new games. However, Twitch is not currently
designed as a learning platform. This provides a novel opportunity for designing
and distributing educational games. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
create a new toolkit for creating educational game interfaces on Twitch. The
toolkit will be used to design interactive learning interfaces for educational
games and study which techniques are effective. A human-centered design process
will pursue making the toolkit useful to Twitch users, game designers, and other
researchers. The research team will work with teachers to addressing their needs
for using this novel form of educational gaming in the
classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
