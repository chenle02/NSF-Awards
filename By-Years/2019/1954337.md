Networks and graphs are ubiquitous mathematical models to describe real world
systems (social networks, transportation networks, biological systems, and so
on). A network comprises a certain number of objects (referred to as nodes)
connected by links of various importance (weights). Analyzing the data of a
specific large network is notoriously challenging, but for many reasonable
models of large random networks one has efficient algorithms to solve such
problems, at least for most of the network likely instances. This project aims
at developing our fundamental understanding of such probabilistic models and
thereby deriving certain classes of efficient algorithms for them. The project
provides research training opportunities for graduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on various models of sparse random
graphs, the simplest being the Erdos-Renyi (independent edges) random graph,
with slowly growing, or bounded, average degree. Many statistical inference
tasks can be addressed by suitably defined combinatorial optimization problems
whose solutions can be recovered from the ground states of suitable Gibbs
measures on the underlying graph. This project aims at studying various
asymptotic properties of large random graphs as well as natural stochastic
evolutions on them, thus gaining understanding of the underlying rich structure
of the Gibbs measures for which they are invariant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
