3-D object recognition presents a complex problem involving massive data
handling capability, extraction of important features, insensitivity to noise,
sensitivity to motion, all of which ideally should be done simultaneous with the
action (in real time). The present effort proposed to utilize distributed
associative memories, an area of neuroengineering, to provide such 3-D
recognition. The (DAM'S) appear well suited for this position.
