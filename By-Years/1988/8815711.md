This project is for the study of the temporal and spatial characteristics of
naturally occurring electromagnetic emissions in the extremely low frequency
(ELF) band of 3-120 Hz. The emphasis is on the waves which are resonances in the
earth- ionosphere cavity, popularly known as Schumann resonances. These
resonances are primarily excited by lightning. A global network is planned to
make observations in the U.S., China, Australia and Brazil. The observations of
ELF waves at various locations on the earth are needed to continuously monitor
lightning activity. The study will also provide databases to infer electrical
conductivity in the D-region of the atmosphere. In order to make comparative
study reliable, all stations of the global network will use the same equipment.
The instrument uses innovative technology to create "smart" systems for real-
time data acquisition. This is one of the very few projects that has global
aspects in middle atmospheric research.
