Lines and planes in a 3-dimensional space are examples of "linear subspaces", a
fundamental notion in mathematics. Matroids are discrete analogs of linear
subspaces, and they play an increasingly important role in modern mathematics.
The PI and Nathan Bowler recently put forth a new point of view in which
matroids and linear subspaces are both special cases of a more general class of
objects, thus making the analogy between matroids and linear subspaces into
something much more precise. Moreover, the PI and Oliver Lorscheid have
demonstrated that this more general viewpoint has interesting applications to
algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. This project concerns further
development, extensions, and applications of the Baker-Bowler theory. The
broader impacts of the proposed work will include supervising postdocs, graduate
students, undergraduates, and high school students on research projects, and
disseminating mathematics through high-quality written exposition and the
organization of conferences and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail,
the PI and his collaborators will prove new results about matroid
representations, including new results concerning representations of 3-connected
matroids and quaternary orientable matroids. They will also extend various
aspects of the Baker-Bowler theory to orthogonal matroids (also known as even
delta-matroids or Coxeter matroids of type D). Finally, they will develop the
rudiments of intersection theory for systems of multivariate polynomials over
pastures, extending the PI's work with Lorscheid in the univariate
case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
