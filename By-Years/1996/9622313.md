9622313 Federici The Departments of Physics and Electrical Engineering at New
Jersey Institute of Technology will purchase an Argon Ion laser, water chiller,
second harmonic generator, and an autocorrelator and long wavelength mirror set
for a Ti:Sapphire laser which will be dedicated to support research in
engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
in particular: * Far-infrared pump/probe spectroscopy of wide bandgap
semiconductors. * Photoinduced superconductivity and defects in YBCO. * Surface
roughness measurement for ultra-thin silicon wafer direct bonding. * Time-
resolved studies of lifetime and nonlinearity of nano-size semiconductor
clusters. * Education/Course development for Undergraduate and Graduate
Students. ***
