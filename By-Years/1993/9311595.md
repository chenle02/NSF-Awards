will continue his research in the isomorphic theory of Banach spaces, mostly
`local' and `finite dimensional'. This will include a study of some problems in
the "local" operator theory. Additionally, some "spin-off" applications of the
developed techniques to questions in probability, convexity theory and
scientific computations will be investigated. Typical research topics include:
entropy numbers of linear operators, existence of nontrivial linear operators on
general Banach spaces, norms of random matrices, `operator' versions of some
classical results, and some questions on the border of probability,
combinatorics and convexity. *** Command ===> F1=Help F3=Exit F7=Backward
