PI: Kenig DMS-9500725 Kenig will continue his research on the development of
various aspects of harmonic analysis and theory application to partial
differential equations. The main emphasis will be on the study of boundary value
problems under minimal smoothness conditions, boundary unique continuation and
the "big-bang" property of control theory, regularity of two-phase free boundary
problems, and the well-posedness of nonlinear equations and systems arising in
wave propagation. The necessary harmonic analysis methods for the study of these
problems will be investigated concurrently. Partial differential equations form
a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of
mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide
qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may include
answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition,
analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on
the accuracy of these approximations.
