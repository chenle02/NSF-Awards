The proposed research concentrates mainly on problems in Ramsey theory and on
extremal graph and hypergraph theory. Both of these areas belong to the
mainstream of contemporary discrete mathematics and are often motivated by
applications in other areas, such as theoretical computer science. In tackling
these problems, a variety of combinatorial methods will be used, such as
probabilistic methods and applications of regularity techniques. The PI also
plans to develop new techniques leading to the construction of graphs with
certain special properties. The Ramsey type problems suggested in the proposal
include the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of hypergraph Ramsey
numbers, of induced Ramsey numbers, of size-Ramsey numbers, as well of the
Erdos-Rogers function. The PI also intends to study some problems in structural
Ramsey theory. The extremal problems that the PI intends to investigate include
Ramsey-Tur√°n problems and the study of Hamilton cycles and matchings in
hypergraphs, as well as extremal problems regarding random subsets of integers.

This research will serve as a basis for the mentoring activities of the PI.
Concepts and questions of combinatorial character appear naturally in other
branches of mathematics and, more broadly speaking, in computer science and in
the physical, biological, and social sciences, making combinatorial mathematics
of interest not only within mathematics itself, but within the sciences as a
whole.
