RR Lyrae variables are a group of pulsating stars that occur in old regions of
the Galaxy, such as in globular clusters and the general galactic halo. Because
these variable stars are all known to have nearly the same luminosity, they were
first used as "standard candles" by Harlow Shapley earlier this century to
determine the distance from the Sun to the Galaxy's center. Moreover, since many
of these stars are thought to have been formed during the early stages of the
Galaxy's collapse soon after the Big Bang, their age is important in determining
the age of the Universe. Recent work has shown that the luminosities of RR Lyrae
stars have a residual dependence after all on their metal content and age.
Additionally, there is an important standing controversy over whether globular
clusters were all formed soon after the Big Bang or over an extended period of
time. To resolve these issues requires a careful determination of the incidence
of these stars among various globular clusters, the distribution of their
periods, and the dependence of their luminosiites on their surface temperatures.
Past efforts to improve our knowledge of the properties of RR Lyrae stars have
been hampered by their faintness and their crowding together in dense star
conglomerates in the sky. The Principle Investigator proposes to monitor the
luminosity variations of a large number of RR Lyrae stars in metal-poor and
metal-rich globular clusters to separate out the residual dependences of these
physical characteristics. The Investigator will use a modern Charge Coupled
Device on a small telescope to perform this work. Such devices are sensitive
even to small variations in light output. Additionally, because many star images
may be focussed independently on the detector surface, one may use non-variable
stars on the same image to subtract out changes in sensitivity caused by
instabilities in the instrument and the Earth's atmosphere.
