9355581 Kuerbis The Colorado College-Integrated Science Teacher Enhancement
Program (CC-ISTEP) is a comprehensive teacher enhancement effort that also
supports a new graduate degree for teachers. The objectives of CC-ISTEP include:
Bring together Colorado College faculty and local educators to design theme-
based institutes. Establish a network of faculty and regional educators to
support the improvement of science teaching and learning in k-8 settings.
Improve the teacher-participants' understanding of science and use teacher
development principles to ensure long-term changes in pedagogical skills. Use
CC-ISTEP as a model for teacher development at other colleges. Over four years,
Colorado College faculty and local educators plan and implement theme-based, six
week summer institutes. Participants are Colorado (or adjacent) K-8 teachers.
Follow-up academic year seminars support the implementation efforts of the
teachers. Dissemination conferences, open to ten national teams are held in the
third and fourth summers.
