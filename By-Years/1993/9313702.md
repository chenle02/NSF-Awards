9313702 Collins Concentrations of point defects in highly-ordered intermetallic
compounds are detected with atomic-scale resolution using perturbed angular
correlations (PAC), a gamma-ray spectroscopy capable of differentiating clearly
between defects. An objective is to identify equilibrium and deformation-induced
defects in a variety of compounds. Equilibrium (thermal) defect formation
enthalpies and defect concentrations are determined from measured site fractions
of probe-defect complexes using a methodology developed during previous studies.
Deformation-induced defects are compared to thermal defects and the
concentrations estimated from site fractions of probe atoms using PAC and
Mossbauer techniques. A second objective is to examine the microstructural
evolution of materials subjected to high energy mechanical milling. Defects in
volume sites and probe sites at grain boundaries and surfaces are monitored. The
effect of the defects on destabilizing equilibrium phases is assessed. %%% The
material defects under study here affect phase stability and diffusion in
advanced materials used in a variety of applications. ***
