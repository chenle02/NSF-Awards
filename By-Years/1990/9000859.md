This project will establish at California Institute of Technology a site to
provide research experiences for 10 undergraduate students during the summer of
1990. Some of these students will come from institutions other than Cal Tech and
these will be paired with undergraduates from Cal Tech. Student selection is
competitive based on proposals submitted by students addressed to the many areas
of faculty competence in computing and information science at Cal Tech. These
areas include error correcting codes, high level languages, computer vision, and
telephone communication systems. All students will be required to submit bi-
weekly and final written reports on their research, and will be encouraged to
prepare papers for publication.
