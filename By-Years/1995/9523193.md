9523193 Stanton This research is to improve infrared (IR) lasers to make them
more reliable for field application and provide adequate wavelength coverage. A
compact, diode pumped wavelength modulatable mid-IR solid state laser will be
developed, targeted toward development of rugged instruments for ultrasensitive
detection of trace chemical species. This fiber laser will operate in the 2.7
micron region for trace species detection using wavelength modulation absorption
spectroscopy. The resulting IR laser will be applicable to a wide range of
industrial processes. These processes include process and stack gas monitoring,
plasma process control, gas impurity monitoring, and real-time monitoring of
tailpipe emissions.
