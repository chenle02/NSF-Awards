9514187 Riddiford Ecdysteroids cause insect molting and metamorphosis, and
juvenile hormone is present during larval life to allow growth and molting and
to prevent metamorphosis. Interference with the action of these hormones is one
way to control insect pests. Dr. Riddiford has found that there is a dynamic and
complex pattern of changing ecdysteroid receptor isoforms and its partner USP
during a molt and at metamorphosis in the epidermis of the tobacco hornworm,
Manduca sexta. She now plans to study both the hormonal and the spatiotemporal
regulation of these receptors and the initial transcription factors that they
induce at the cellular level using primarily immunocytochemical and in situ
hybridization analysis of tissue exposed to these hormones both in vivo and in
vitro. These studies will provide deeper insight into how the ecdysteroids
initiate and coordinate the cellular responses that lead to the formation of a
new cuticle during a molt and during the switch in cell fate that is essential
for metamorphosis. By studying the influence of juvenile hormone on these
cellular dynamics, she will shed new light on its mode of action in the
prevention of the switch of cell fates. ***
