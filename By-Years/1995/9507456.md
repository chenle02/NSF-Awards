9507456 Kormanik Sharks provide models, not only for studying the metabolic
handling of waste nitrogen, but also the means by which nitrogen is provided for
developing embryos. Uterine tissue will examined for potential carrier enzymes
associated with the transfer of ammonia. Acid secretion associated with
detoxification of this ammonia will be examined. Ammonia nitrogen incorporation
into the embryo will also be measured. Undergraduates will be engaged and
trained in all steps of the investigation. Information gained will be useful to
those studying evolution of nitrogen metabolism, modelling nitrogen waste
processing in fish and other animals as well as of practical use to those
involved in the study of ammonia toxicity in mariculture of fish and other
aquatic organisms. ***
