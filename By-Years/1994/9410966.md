9410966 Hairston In this proposal the PI's will address the role of dormant
propagules in long-term population and community dynamics of two Daphnia species
in Oneida Lake, New York. Although both species have persisted in the system for
at least 30 years, their water-column densities are negatively correlated. One
species is typically abundance while the other remains in low numbers. This
transient dominance lasts for months or years, and has been attributed to a
combination of competition and predation. This recurring pattern raises two
questions: (1) how is each species able to persist over the long-term, and (2)
if there is competition, why are both species present in the system? Both
species produce diapausing eggs which remain viable in the lake sediments for a
potentially long time period. By using theoretical models first proposed by
Chesson and Warner (1981), the investigators will examine the hypothesis that
the reproductive potential stored in these dormant eggs not only allows each
species to persist in this system, but also enables long-term coexistence of two
potentially competing species. To do this, the investigators will first consider
the egg bank dynamics of each species independently. They will then test the
hypothesis that the negative correlation between these two species is the result
of competition.. Lastly, they will examine the role of the dormant eggs on the
long-term interactions of the two species. %%% This dissertation research
project will provide the first detailed investigation of an alternative
mechanism for the coexistence of competing species in aquatic systems. Most
studies focus on competition or predation, but the storage of propagules is a
much neglected phenomenon which may be an important key to understanding factors
that maintain biodiversity in aquatic and terrestrial systems.
