The Calculus Institute is introducing college mathematics teachers to computer
algebra systems and to new methods of teaching calculus using computer algebra
systems. This cooperative venture by two-year and four-year institutions, the
American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), and the
Kentucky Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (KYMATYC) is focusing on
calculus reform efforts in Kentucky. Laboratory manuals of participants'
calculus materials and a position paper on transferability will be presented to
AMATYC and KYMATYC for dissemination.
