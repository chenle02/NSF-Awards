This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science
Foundation's Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program. It will
provide one-half the funds required to purchase a computer workstation for the
Department of Geology, Geography, and Environmental Studies at Calvin College,
Michigan. Calvin College is committed to providing the remaining half. The
computer workstation will be employed mainly in faculty- student research
projects in global deformation and gravity anomalies caused by changing ice
(glaciers) and water (oceans) loading on the Earth's surface. Other uses will
include student projects involving geographic information systems software.
