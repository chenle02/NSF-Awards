This project studies five different schemes of defensive design of concrete
dams: 1) a keyed joint built into the upper part of a gravity dam which would be
sealed at the upstream face to prevent water intrusion, 2) an altered cross-
sectional profile for improved seismic resistance, 3) a light- weight crest
portion with considerably reduced mass, 4) vertical post-tensioning of the neck
region with steel tendons, and 5) hydrodynamic isolation. To varying degrees,
these schemes are applicable to the design of new dams and to the retrofit of
existing ones. They will be investigated by special computer program previously
developed for linear and nonlinear finite element analysis of concrete gravity
dam-water foundation systems. Such defensive schemes can be implemented in the
design of new dams and in the retrofit of existing ones.
