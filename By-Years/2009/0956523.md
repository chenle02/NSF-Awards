"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this EAGER project is
to create a framework for collection of life cycle inventory data for fiber
reinforced polymer composite infrastructure materials. While the methods
required to carry out a life cycle assessment are well defined, the underlying
datasets needed to support the assessment are sparsely populated. Within the ISO
14040 series standard for life cycle assessment these datasets are termed a life
cycle inventory (LCI). Without a robust life cycle inventory, the result of more
comprehensive life cycle assessment based on this data remains uncertain at
best. Therefore, the proposed research serves as an important foundation for
future research on the larger sustainability assessment and design of FRP
infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FRP materials are increasingly being used
in infrastructure with little knowledge of their full sustainability footprint.
As part of outreach efforts within this project, all life cycle inventory
results will be made available to the United States National Life Cycle
Inventory Database administered by the United States Department of Energy
National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
