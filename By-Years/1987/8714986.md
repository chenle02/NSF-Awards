Participation by U.S. Researchers in this international program is important to
future U.S. research and U.S./European Technical relationships. The triennial
Power Systems Computation Conference has been held since 1963 with the objective
of providing a forum for exchange of ideas and experiences world-wide in the
field of computer- aided analysis and control of power systems. It is equally
attended by both universities and industrial researchers.
