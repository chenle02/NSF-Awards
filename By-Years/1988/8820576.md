As a central research facility, the Electron Microscopy Laboratory of the
University of Maine is a resource for a wide variety of projects in the
biological as well as physical and chemical sciences. Research projects making
use of this facility call for a new transmission microscope equipped with a
eucentric goniometer stage; this proposal requests funding for such a
microscope. Twenty-two investigators have been identified to represent a range
of applications to which this microscope will be applied; five fo these
investigators, with NSF-supported projects are identified as major users.
Projects specified in this proposal call, for example, for ultrastructural
stereological analysis to clarify the roles of mitochondria in hyperoxic and
hypoxic conditions and in acclimation to life at low temperatures, to
characterize diurnal changes in photoreceptors, and to quantify effects of acid-
rain stress in plant and animal tissues. Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry
will be used in some projects to identify extracellular matrix components of
lower invertebrates, to localize enzymes in plant/fungal associations, and to
characterize enzymes of wood degradation. In systematic biology, phylogenetic
analysis of ultrastructural characters will be used to elucidate evolutionary
relationships in diatoms, higher plants, and lower invertebrates. Applications
in molecular biology and virology include characterization of extrachromosomal
DNA in a protist and characterization of genetic material and structure of a
mycovirus.//
