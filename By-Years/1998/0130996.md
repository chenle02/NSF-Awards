William Jorgensen of Yale University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical studies of organic
chemistry in solution. Chemical systems are modeled at the atomic level using
molecular quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and Monte
Carlo statistical mechanics. The project includes the following efforts: (1)
developing revised potential functions for organic molecules that are consistent
with Jorgensen's improved computational model for liquid water, with testing
that emphasizes Monte Carlo simulations for the proper use of pure organic
liquids and free energies of hydration, (2) developing improved semiempirical
quantum mechanics methods to enable routine computational study of organic and
enzymatic reactions in solution, (3) incorporating semiempirical configuration
interaction into the quantum mechanics framework, with initial applications to
solvolysis reactions and Bergman cyclization, and (4) initiating basic studies
of intramolecular interactions with organofluorine compounds to complement
current interest in perfluoroalkanes as solvents and in fluorophobic effects.
Outcomes are expected to enable an enhanced understanding of organic reactions,
molecular properties, and intramolecular interactions that are central to
chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will reveal
useful information on molecular processes in solution, and the ways in which
molecules are affected by their solvent environment. The theoretical studies
closely parallel and complement experimental research on optimization of organic
reactions and on the development of catalysts, selective receptors for organic
molecules including drugs and metabolites, materials with novel properties, and
molecular devices. &lt;br/&gt;
