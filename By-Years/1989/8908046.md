This research equipment grant is for the purchase of fluorescence lifetime and
transient fluorescence equipment to be used primarily by the two co-PIs
Torkelson and Lewis as well as other researchers at Northwestern. Torkelson's
research is the application of fluorescence and phosphorescence techniques in
the study of basic issues elated to polymer science and engineering: diffusion-
limited interaction in polymer solutions, phase separation in polymer blends and
in block copolymer systems in solution and the bulk state, the distribution of
local free volume and its sensitivity to physical aging in polymer glasses, and
polymer-polymer interpenetration, interdiffusion, and correlations in
homopolymer and block copolymer systems. The focus of Lewis' research is the
investigation of reactions which occur via electronically executed complexes
which are used to establish the role of exciplexes and radical ion pairs in
reactions of fundamental importance to organic photochemistry such as
cycloaddition and proton transfer. Near term uses planned for the
instrumentation include: the study of diffusion-limited interactions in polymer
solutions which may lead to a better understanding of the gel effect in free
radical polymerization; investigation of phase separation phenomena and
compatibilization in block copolymers solutions, blend with homopolymers, and in
the bulk state; intermolecular correlations in homopolymers, block copolymers
and polymer blends; obtaining local free volume distribution in amorphous
polymer systems; determination of the mode of diffusion in polymer welding
phenomena (interdiffusion across a polymer-polymer interface); characterization
of the basic photophysics of polymer systems; excimer and exciplex kinetics
studies; and investigations of excited state of Lewis acid complexes.
