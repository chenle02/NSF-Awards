This research is to provide theoretical and advanced computational methods for
the interactive graphical display and exploration of likelihood surfaces or
posterior density surfaces. In both the likelihood and Bayesian methods of
statistical inference, the regions which represent reasonable parameter values
in a statistical model for a data set are bounded by contours of a function of
parameters. This research aims to develop and enhance a method of displaying
two-dimensional projections of such contours using information from the profile
of the objective function. The goal is produce a tool for examining likelihood
surfaces and posterior density surfaces that replaces the reliance on possibly
inaccurate numerical summaries as is done now. This research is in the
developing discipline of graphical statistics. Others are trying to extend the
applicability of Bayesian statistics by improving numerical integration
capabilities. This proposal takes a different approach which proposes to bypass
the numerical difficulties by developing graphical solutions instead.
