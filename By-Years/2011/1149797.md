This project will develop web-based knowledge-building environments for the
collaborative creation of information landscapes: interactive visualizations
that support the sensemaking individuals engage in online, and capture their
efforts for the benefit of others who come after them. To guide and motivate the
design of these environments, the research builds on theories of sensemaking,
which describe the nested and parallel loops through which individuals seek out,
analyze, and understand information, grounded in a rich history from
organizational behavior, social and cognitive psychology, and human-computer
interaction. It will extend theories of individual sensemaking to the situation
in which an individual's processing of information for themselves is consumed by
others, whose processing in turns improves the sensemaking of those coming after
them - what can be called the "distributed sensemaking cycle."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examining distributed sensemaking in a way that is both
rigorous and environmentally valid is a challenging prospect, so this project
will take a multi-stage approach involving laboratory studies to characterize
the distributed sensemaking process and iteratively develop interfaces; "virtual
lab" experiments harnessing crowdsourcing to evaluate these processes and
interfaces at a larger scale while bootstrapping the system's value; and
controlled field trials to test theories and interfaces in environmentally valid
settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to capture the benefits and costs to
both the producer and the consumer, the research will employ an experimental
framework that elicits both of their perspectives. The general approach involves
the producer using an interface for a sensemaking task and the consumer doing
the same task but starting with the results of the producer's work. This
approach will iteratively develop interfaces that help individuals forage for
information, integrate the results of their foraging into information
landscapes, and convey the judgments, decisions, and work they engaged in during
the process to others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will
advance scientific understanding across a variety of domains, including
sensemaking, collaboration, schema induction, and interface design. The research
has the potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge work, the training and
practice of scientists, and the effectiveness of education. The tools developed
in this research will be incorporated and evaluated in educational practice, and
will become the center of a community linked to several existing knowledge
bases.
