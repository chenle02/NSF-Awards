9452827 Kernell The Old Dominion University seeks to initiate a four-week,
residential, Young Scholars program in applied physics and engineering for 22
students entering grades 9 and 10. The project provides students the opportunity
to become acquainted with the subject content of applied physics and explore a
variety of careers in several areas of physical science and engineering that
involve substantial applications to physics. Experiences include classroom
instruction, hands-on laboratory activities, field trips, and small group
research projects mentored by university members. The project provides
supportive relationships to participants, offers information on career
opportunities and academic requirements, and helps participants build a
foundation for success in applied physics, engineering, and related fields.
