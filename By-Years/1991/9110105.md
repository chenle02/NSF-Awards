Research Planning Grants are one-time awards designed to help increase the
number of new women investigators participating in NSF researchprograms, and to
facilitate preliminary studies and other activities related to the development
of competitive NSF research proposals. The project investigates the issues of
call routing for integrated broadband networks in a multilayer control
framework. The Principal Investigator is developing models to predict the
network performance, algorithms and software to achieve optimal performance. The
study involves the following issues: -How much bandwidth is required to satisfy
a certain grade of service for the purposes of call admission and routing? -How
should the probability of blocking be quantified as a function of the current
state and traffic statistics? -For a given set of paths, how the calls should be
routed dynamically according to the degree of congestion of these paths.
-Stability of such dynamic routing methods. Markov decision theory is used in
finding optimum routing policies.
