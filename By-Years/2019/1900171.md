2020 Vision for Dynamics will be held in the Mathematical Research and
Conference Center Bedlewo of the Institute of Mathematics at the Academy of
Sciences of Poland from August 11 to 16, 2019. The conference will focus on
topics related to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic dynamical systems and
smooth ergodic theory that have seen much progress, but where significant
problems vital to the field remain open. Based on forward-looking presentations
of recent developments, the conference will set a broad and concrete agenda for
further research on several fronts and bring together senior, mid-career and
young practitioners for discussions of open problems in these research areas.
