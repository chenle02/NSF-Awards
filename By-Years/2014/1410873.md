Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium swim through a
fluid by rotating their helical flagella. Understanding the swimming mechanism
of bacteria with flagella is a challenging subject that involves interactions
between the biological, engineering, mathematical, and physical sciences.
Although many scientists have studied bacterial swimming, experimental and
theoretical studies have both shown that it is difficult to understand the
dynamic behavior of the flagellum because of its complex geometry during
locomotion, and many open questions remain. This project will develop and
validate improved mathematical models for such bacterial motility.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: (1) develop detailed mathematical
models accompanied by the numerical schemes to understand bacterial motility by
means of flagella; (2) analyze the complicated hydrodynamic interactions among
multiple flagella arising from the cell body in fluids; (3) validate the models
by comparing the results to experimental data; and (4) use these models to make
predictions that will be verified by further experimentation. This project also
heavily involves the development of an adaptive version of the generalized
immersed boundary method which will find numerous applications in biological
fluid dynamics such as supercoiling DNA dynamics. The new numerical algorithm
will be freely distributed on-line within IBAMR software. The results obtained
from this research on free swimming bacteria may provide new information about
the spread of infections and biofilm formation, and may help to design
nanomachines that are self-propelled by flagella.
