Dr. Thomas Cundari of the University of Memphis is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on computational
chemistry of transition metal compounds and reactions. The nature and extent of
pi-bonding in transition metal complexes of group 13 elements (principally boron
and gallium) will be investigated by computational methods. Nonlinear optical
properties of the dimer of osmium tetroxide will be computed for a number of
configurations of the oxygen atoms of that species, and those studies will be
extended to several types of condensed phases. Activation of C-H bonds in
heterosubstituted alkanes, through interactions with bimetallic complexes, and
in beta-X elimination will be studied computationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research program involves development of new computional methods to predict
properties of inorganic materials, and also application of previously developed
methods to systems of current experimental and technological importance. Details
of bonding in metal-boron compounds are important in catalytic processes,
nonlinear optical properties of condensed phases are of great present and future
significance for electronic applications, and activation of C-H bonds is one of
the main problem areas in synthetic and mechanistic chemistry, with many
connections to important industrial and ecological processes.
