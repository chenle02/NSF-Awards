With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science
Foundation, Dr. Karen Strier will continue her long-term study of the endangered
woolly spider monkey of southeastern Brazil. What makes this species unusual is
the apparent lack of competition among adult members of the same sex, and Dr.
Strier wishes to determine the reasons for this. Since 1982, systematic data has
been collected on demography and life history variables and on the distribution
and availability of food resources. Attention has also been focused on how
communication is employed to mediate social relationships. Dr. Strier recently
added a comparative aspect to this research and began observation of a second
population in a different forest which differs in size, floral, and faunal
composition. With NSF support she will continue this research. This work is
important for several reasons. It will increase the knowledge of an endangered
primate species and directly assist in its conservation. It will also provide
comparative data to further our understanding of primate behavioral adaptations.
It will also assist in the professional development of an extremely promising
young scientist.
