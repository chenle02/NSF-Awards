This project has two overall aims. The first is to provide high school teachers
and students with a better grasp of the nature of science and technology, the
institutions that support them and their place in society, culture, and history.
The second is recruitment; the arousal in students of an interest in science and
engineering as studies and careers worth pursuing. The project is timely. It is
intended to combat the unsatisfactory levels of high school performance in
social science, humanities, and mathematics revealed by a number of well-
publicized national reports and studies. It is also intended to address the
equally disturbing problem of student disenchantment with science, the causes of
which originate in the way in which science is taught in sciences courses and in
the way it is portrayed in the non-science curriculum, and particularly history.
The project is developing "units" of study that are self- contained and keyed to
the regular school curriculum and can be introduced as appropriate. Curricular
units will include student readings, teacher manuals, and audio-visual aids, and
will be constructed separately for science and history. Equal attention will be
given to physics and biology, and to U. S. and world history. A special feature
of the project is the formation of historian-scientist pairs of teachers, so
that each teacher can count on the help of an interested and informed partner.//
