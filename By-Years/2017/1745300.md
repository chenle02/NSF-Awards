The ultimate goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
project is to develop a crossdomain multiscale network and interdependent
critical infrastructure (ICI) generator that captures many features of real
networks and incorporates an arbitrarily large or small degree of stochasticity.
Starting from samples of known or hypothesized networks, the generator will
synthesize ensembles of networks and ICIs that will preserve, on average, a
diverse set of topological and physical design properties at multiple scales of
its structure. These properties will include several measures of centrality,
assortativity, path lengths, clustering, flows, required physical capacities,
and modularity. This approach introduces an unbiased variability across the
ensemble in many of these properties at multiple scales which creates a desired
realism of the synthesized system. The models will include human factor
components incorporated in both topological and physical designs. A toolbox of
algorithms and heuristics for generating synthetic networks of infrastructures
and ICIs will be developed, and generated benchmarks will be disseminated.

Outcomes of this work will facilitate such tasks as simulation, policy testing
and decision making for ICIs enabled by fundamental advancement in network
generation algorithms. The toolbox will be designed using a modular approach
that will allow it to evolve and to be applied in other domains. The
interdisciplinary team of investigators comprising expertise in computer
science, behavioral science, civil engineering, and network science and public
health will ideally support the goal of realistic synthetic data generation.
Perspectives and methodological approaches from network analysis, big data
systems, machine learning, water networks, and organizational sciences will be
brought to bear to develop a toolkit of methods that include a combination of
network analytics, optimization, and statistical analysis techniques. The
resulting products will include developed algorithms and generated synthetic
datasets disseminated for a broad scientific community.
