0233316&lt;br/&gt;Tyson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-France
collaboration in materials research involves researchers and students at the New
Jersey Institute of Technology and the Ecole National Superieure de Physique in
Grenoble, France. Trevor A. Tyson in the US and Catherine Dubourdieu in France
lead the joint research effort on studies of structural and transport properties
in ultra-thin films. The investigators will explore the effect of high magnetic
fields and high pressure on transport and local structure. The principal
investigator and a graduate student will travel to Grenoble to study French
techniques for growing thins films. During their visit to New Jersey, the French
group will carry out high-pressure measurements (using an optical system) and
high field local structure measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. NSF will
cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate
student. CNRS will support visits by French researchers and graduate students to
the United States. The research will advance understanding of the structural,
electronic and magnetic properties of manganite materials. &lt;br/&gt;
