9705759 Van Schmus The configuration and location of major plates throughout
supercontinent cycles is a long-term goal in which precambrian research plays a
large part. However, there are incomplete data for many Precambrian Cratons, and
studies of potentially correlative orogenic belts, igneous and sedimentary
provinces and structures in these cratons is needed to test reconstructions and
to develop models Amazonia in South America is a key craton for late
mesoproterozoic time, which may involve possible connections with the Laurentia-
Baltica supercontinent, and the subsequent array of continental fragments after
breakup. This work will involve geochronologic, geochemical and field
investigations of several areas in cooperation with Brazilian geologists.
Results are expected to facilitate analysis of supercontinent cycles and
increase knowledge of the role played by the Amazon craton in the Laurentia-
Baltica supercontinent.
