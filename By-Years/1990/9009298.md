An understanding of how tracking in middle and secondary schools affects student
learning is critical for informed decision-making about tracking practices. This
study will show how tracking affects students who differ by gender, race, and
prior achievement. Thus, it will reveal a source of potential inequities in our
educational system. The research will also demonstrate how variation between
schools in tracking structures and placement policies is a major, though largely
ignored, source of school differences in students learning. The conceptual model
will be tested on longitudinal data from two cohorts of about 2,100 students
each, in several public, parochial, and private middle and secondary schools.
Seventh through tenth grade data have already been collected on these students.
The investigator will collect information on their last two years in high school
in this study. She will conduct descriptive and inferential analyses to reveal
the mechanisms that relate middle school tracking to opportunities for learning
in high school.
