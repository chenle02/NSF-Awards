Abstract EEC-9614159 Reid This award provides funding for two years for a two-
year phaseout award to Oklahoma State University's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Web Handling. The goals of the Center are to: 1)
to advance the science base in the technologies of web handling through
fundamental and generic research; 2) to assist in the transfer knowledge and
information to the sponsoring organizations; 3) to assist in the transfer of
knowledge and information to targeted Oklahoma manufacturing firms; and 4) to
establish and maintain strong cooperative relationships with industry and other
universities. The Center currently has nineteen corporate sponsors each
contributing $25,000 each year for sponsorship. Over the ten year development
the sponsors have played a key role in the evaluation of projects, the
identification of new projects, and the advisement of the principal
investigators. Inputs are sought on a continuing basis from the IAB members on
potential new projects. A research needs assessment is conducted once each year.
Inputs from industry participants often form the basis of new project proposal s
at subsequent meetings, as well as changes in the scope of continuing projects.
