Accurate Doppler Accelerometry of Stars. Dr. McMillan will continue measuring
changes in the radial velocities of solar-type stars to search for gravitational
perturbations by planets. The data now span 5 years, a time scale comparable to
some planetary orbital periods. Over 2300 observations of 16 stars similar to
the Sun have been accumulated. These observations show that the instrument is
stable enough to reveal the kinematic effects of Jupiter-size planets. The
velocities of some of the target stars appear to be changing slowly. As the
length of the data series increases, new observations with unaltered
instrumentation become more and more valuable because they increase the
sensitivity and frequency resolution in the series' periodograms. Longer term
observations are necessary to see whether the apparent variations in velocity
are periodic.
