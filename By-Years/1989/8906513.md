The emergence of a class of computational hardware with both graphics and near
supercomputer capability, available to the chemist at a relatively modest price,
is a recent phenomenon. Such instrumentation allows chemists to effectively
carry out projects that involve both large scale computations and algorithm
development as well as projects in which interactive graphics are essential. The
Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin will use this award
from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help acquire, maintain and operate
a graphics workstation minisupercomputer for theoretical chemistry. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) Electronic structure theory 2) Electron localization and energy
transport in disordered media 3) Quantum simulation of the hydrated electron and
other systems 4) Structure and dynamics of liquid water at solid interfaces 5)
Modeling of covalent amorphous materials 6) Quantum reactive scattering 7)
Controlled laser chemistry 8) Intramolecular dynamics and spectroscopy.
