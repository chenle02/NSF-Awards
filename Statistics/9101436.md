The first of two distinct parts of this research is the development of
statistical models and of procedures for statistical inference for data in the
form of rankings or even partial rankings. These models should allow examination
of the same kinds of relationships frequently modeled for numerical data; and
this research based on orthogonal contrasts may lead to a general framework for
the analysis of ranking data. The second part of the research develops further
Item Response Theory, appropriate to many standardized multiple item tests used
to measure ability and performance. In particular, this research will provide a
rigorous mathematical framework for focussing on a multidimensional Item
Response Theory, on bias detection procedures, and on more fundamental issues in
probabilistic models for response.
