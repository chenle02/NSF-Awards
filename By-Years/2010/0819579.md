This project by PI James Mountain Chief Sanderville and CoPI Monica Riedel is to
develop an experimental science educational video game based on traditional
knowledge and language among the Alutiiq people of Alaska. The project is the
brain child the PI who wanted to offer American Indian and Alaska Native
children an alternative to majority culture based video games, many of them with
violent content. A prototype of the video game will be developed, tested and
evaluated through the collaboration of the PI, the Alaska Native Harbor Seal
Commission, Alutiiq communities, and the University of Wisconsin. The game
content will be based on traditional knowledge, language, and basic science
concepts surrounding the issue of climate change.
