Support in the amount of $7,500 for U. S. participation in the Seventh
International Academic Network Workshop at Jerusalem, Israel is provided to a
group of scientists who have worked with the NSFNET program since its inception
3 years ago. The discussion of building an international network is of high
interest to the NSFNET program and it is important that the program be well
represented at the Workshop. The Academic Network Workshop will bring together
key individuals from countries around the world who are involved in designing,
implementing, or funding networking facilities on a national or international
scale for the academic community. It provides a forum for information exchange
concerning national and international networking projects. Attendees represent
over 30 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and
South America. The Academic Network Workshop will take place immediatiely before
the 9th International Conference on Computer Communication which will be held in
Tel Aviv, Israel, from October 30 to November 4. The U. S. attendees at the
Networking Workshop will also be afforded the opportunity to take part in the
International Conference as well.
