Rubin 9602568 This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Bradley Rubin at the Institute of
Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Rubin will work with
Dr. Masaru Matsuoka, Director of the Cosmic Radiation Laboratory at RIKEN, on a
research project entitled "Observations of Cosmic X-Ray Sources". The proposed
research will investigate the emission of electromagnetic energy occurring in
selected x-ray binary systems with specific emphasis on the analysis of data
recorded by orbiting high energy observatories. Soft x-ray transients are a
class of x-ray binaries containing a neutron star for which outbursts of strong
x-ray emission are occasionally observed. Modeling the high energy spectra in
both the quiescent and outburst states is critical to an understanding of the
physical structure and outburst mechanisms of these systems. The analysis will
discriminate between accretion and shock powered models of the quiescent
emission and thermal and non-thermal models of the outburst emission. Research
will also focus on another class of x- ray binaries, x-ray pulsars, which emit
periodic signals due to the rotation of an accretion powered neutron star.
Emission line observations of these systems will be used to obtain information
about the density and ionization structure of the surrounding environment. The
result of this research in its entirety will be an improved understanding of the
nature of these enigmatic objects. ***
