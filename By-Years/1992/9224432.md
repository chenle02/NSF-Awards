In this project, Prof. P. Houston of Cornell University will continue a series
of investigations on the photodissociation dynamics of free radicals and state-
selected molecules in the gaseous state. Previous work on the HCO system has
shown the possibility of investigating the photodissociation process with a high
degree of product state specificity and the work to be performed in this project
is based on this success to extend these studies to other systems. Specifically,
the photodissociation of the radicals HCO, NCO, methylene, methoxy, and others,
will be investigated. These small radicals are particularly suitable for study
since they are also amenable to theoretical treatment. Examples of
investigations in the photodissociation dynamics of state-selected molecules are
ozone, glyoxal, and other molecules, using the directly observable influence of
the initial state excitation on the product distribution.%%% This research
probes the fundamental chemistry of the photodissociation phenomenon by
investigating a carefully chosen set of free radicals and molecules. The
increased understanding of photodissociation dynamics which will come from these
studies will have bearing on our knowledge of combustion processes and
atmospheric chemistry.***
