Technical. An International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) will be
held during the week of August 3-8, 2008 at the University of British Columbia,
Vancouver, Canada. The scope of the conference is broad, covering the entire
spectrum of MBE. The focus is on the material aspects of MBE growth, processing
and characterization, but the conference also includes relevant physics and
device properties of resulting films and structures. The conference organizers
have scheduled three plenary talks, fourteen invited talks, and ~250 contributed
papers on the latest results on MBE-related research to provide a stimulating
and wide-ranging intellectual environment. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical. The
conference provides an excellent forum for interaction between university,
government and industrial scientists working on these and related topics. The
travel and conference fee support requested is targeted to improve the inclusion
of members of under-represented groups in fields related to electronic
materials. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions,
it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research
institutions, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;
