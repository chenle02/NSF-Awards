This award is for support of the Institute for Theoretical Atomic and Molecular
Physics (ITAMP) at the Harvard/Smithsonian. The ITAMP is the focal point for
group activities in theoretical atomic and molecular physics in the US. The
funds support a long-and -short term visitor program, postdoctorals, graduate
students and topical workshops on various subjects of interest to the atomic and
molecular physics community. ITAMP activities have been instrumental in the
revitalization of atomic and molecular theory in this country.
