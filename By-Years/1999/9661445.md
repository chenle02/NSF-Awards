*** 96-61445 Wasson This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will investigate an innovative new high-speed machining method that will
more than double the speed capability to 100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm)
and double the cutting power to 100 kilowatts (kW). Machine tool spindles are
key components in high-speed systems for machining aluminum, titanium, steel,
and other metals. State of the art spindles used to mill aluminum may achieve
speeds of 50,000 rpm and cutting powers of 50 kW. The new method is expected to
increase substantially the removal rates of aluminum, titanium, steel, and other
metals. Commercial applications for this technology include the production of
commercial aircraft and automotive components. The new spindle technology could
be directly integrated into commercial high-speed machining centers. ***
