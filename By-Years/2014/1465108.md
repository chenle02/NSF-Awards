With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A)
Program and the Computation and Data Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE)
Program are funding Professor Victor Batista of Yale University to conduct
computational studies of the ways that molecules change shape when they absorb
light -- a class of chemical reaction that is the basis of the most simple
optical detector. These studies will help to inform studies that attempt to
understand (among other things) the ways that light-matter interactions can be
tuned to make better light-detecting materials. Post-doctoral, graduate and
undergraduate students working on this project will receive rigorous training in
computational chemistry. The research involves collaboration with
experimentalists in the US and in Europe. As part of his educational activities,
Prof. Batista will work with young scientists through a number of programs to
encourage young people from historically underrepresented groups to engage with
STEM subject material. Prof. Batista continues his work with 'Wikidchem', an
online resource for dissemination of research findings, software and pedagogical
material. Educational activities also include participation in the Science
Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof.
Victor Batista will carry out studies with his research group to investigate a
number of prototypical molecular systems undergoing isomerization. The specific
aims include: (1) the characterization of photoinduced reactions in photochromic
compounds and in photoreceptors; (2) the determination of photoisomerization
efficiencies and time scales; (3) the characterization of the ways in which
solvation and hydrogen bonding influences these processes. The young researchers
working on this project will receive solid technical training, including
collaboration with the experimental groups of Prof. Elsa Yan at Yale University
and Prof. Erik Nibbering at the Max Born Institut Germany).
