9601771 Elsenbaumer University of Texas Arlington This award from the Academic
Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Chemistry and Biochemistry
Department at the University of Texas at Arlington to acquire an NMR
spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) stereochemically pure and robust metallodendrimers
(2) chemistry of fluorinated poly(pyrazolyl)borate ligands (3) studies of
phosphorus compounds (4) conformational isomerism in heterocyclic sulfonium
ylides (5) electrically conductive polymers, and (6) development of highly
conductive polyaniline. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology
