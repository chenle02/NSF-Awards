An erasable laser videodisc recorder is being utilized to put still images and
full motion video with soundtracks on videodiscs. The high quality visuals that
are being developed provide a powerful dimension of speed and realism to
mathematics instruction, transforming classrooms from information-poor to
information-rich environments. The first discs produced provide easy-to-use
reference and training materials to support computer laboratory activities and
provide support material for the courses for prospective elementary school
teachers. The equipment will also be used to improve the training of secondary
school teaching candidates and for inservice work for teachers in area schools.
