CBET-0829455&lt;br/&gt;Van Sciver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is
provided for a workshop focused on visualizing thermofluid dynamics at low
temperatures, which will be held in Texas on November 20 - 21, 2008, as a
satellite meeting for the 2008 APS Fluid Dynamics Conference. The purpose of
this meeting is to bring together an international group of researchers,
especially from Japan and Europe, to exchange research findings in this
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the intellectual merit of the
conference, there currently exists a lack of fundamental understanding of
thermofluid processes in liquid and superfluid helium, such as the role of
turbulent transport. Flow visualization may enable improved comprehension of
such transport processes. This workshop will bring together this focused
research community in one venue to discuss their research results and to enhance
the potential for international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of the conference include NSF support for a number of junior and female
researchers. Since the workshop will be held in conjunction with the APS Fluid
Dynamics meeting, it will be relatively easy for interested researchers to
attend. A major goal of this workshop is to produce increased international
collaboration opportunities among US, Japanese, and European
researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Thermal
Transport Processes (TTP) Program, and by the Fluid Dynamics Program, of the
Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.
