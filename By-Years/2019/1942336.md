In many domains, knowledge may be efficiently expressed in terms of
relationships between various entities and quantifiers expressing whether those
relationship holds for some or all of those entities. This project will develop
algorithms with theoretical guarantees of efficiency and correctness for solving
combined learning and reasoning tasks using such expressions. The guarantees
will aid our understanding of when the algorithms are safe to use and ensure
that they can be used successfully as part of a larger system. Furthermore,
students will be trained in research as part of this project. Finally, this
project includes the development of a new core undergraduate algorithms course
that draws on recent education research to strengthen students' grasp of
algorithms and promote participation in computer science among underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concretely, the expressions used in this project
are formulas of first-order logic, and so the project seeks algorithms for
reasoning over a collection of first-order formulas that are learned from data
consisting of partial truth valuations of the expressions. Formulating such
expressions to capture a domain with adequate fidelity for question-answering or
planning applications (for example) is a daunting task. Combining the tasks of
learning and reasoning has, for other kinds of representations, enabled the
design of correct and efficient algorithms for the combined task where the
individual tasks were believed to be intractable to solve correctly, as they are
here. As part of this work, the researchers will also seek improved algorithms
for reasoning with such representations. The project furthermore includes the
development of applications of such integrated learning and reasoning in
planning problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
