This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor
Ching-Li Chai of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Chai has proposed to work
on two projects: the first is to investigate level structures over extraordinary
primes, and the second is to construct rigid homogeneous spaces. Both of these
projects are related to the arithmetic of automorphic forms and Shimura
varieties. This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a
subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In
its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be
defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number
theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility of one
whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in
fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter
century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic
algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is
having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.
