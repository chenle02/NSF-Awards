During the past decade a number of model systems have been studied in attempts
to understand the cellular correlates of sexual dimorphisms in the behavior of
vertebrates. Much of this work has focused on neurons and muscles controlling
the production of social communication signals that play a major role in
reproductive behavior during breeding seasons. The principal advantages in
studying sexual dimorphisms in all of these systems is that the communication
signal--a song, a call, or an electric organ discharge--is stereotyped in
appearance, easily quantifiable and controlled by a discrete set of muscles and
central neurons. Dr. Andrew Bass is interested in structure- function studies of
physiologically identified cells which are sexually dimorphic. This research
project concerns studies of a motor system controlling the production of sound
communication signals in fishes. The system chosen is the swimbladder or sonic
motor system of marine teleosts. The acoustic signal is produced by a single set
of muscles which are controlled by a central motor nucleus that may be
comparable to the hypoglossal motor nucleus of tetrapods. Dr. Bass has
discovered a dramatic sex difference in the gross and ultrastructural features
of the muscles controlling sound production in one group of marine teleosts, the
midshipmen, Porichthys notatus. There is also a behavioral sex difference in
that only males are known to be sonic. Although a major goal of this research
project is characterization of structure-function organization in the sonic
motor system of male midshipmen, the same studies will be carried out with
females to elucidate sexual dimorphisms in the system. Such studies will lead to
more well delineated experiments for understanding the cellular mechanisms
underlying the development of sexual dimorphisms in the brain behavior of
vertebrates.
