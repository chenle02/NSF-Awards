Classical general relativity is built in large part upon the extension of
Riemannian Geometry to Lorentzian Geometry (more generally, semi-Riemannian
Geometry). In fact, time independent questions are basically Riemannian in
nature. For examples the classification of black holes is based on time
independent solutions of the field equations; the (first) proof of the positive
mass theorem is also based on Riemannian Geometry. At present researchers are
interested in issues involved in the rigorous extension and generalization of
the principal geometric and physical structures associated with the spaces of
classical and relativistic physics (e.g. of Riemannian geometry) to Finsler
spaces. One of the problems of basing Relativity on Riemannian Geometry is the
difficulty with "casualty". This is due to the fact that geodesics in Riemannian
Geometry are reversible. If a space-time admits a CTC (closed time-like curve)
then one could travel back in time and all kinds of (murderous) paradoxes could
occur. In contrast, there exist Finsler metrics for which the geodesics are
irreversible hence, provides a more natural setting for dealing with "casualty"
in Relativity.

There are many issues, more technical in nature, involving Finsler Geometry that
are useful in Relativity. Among these are: (a) spaces whose metric functions are
symmetric polynomials depending on four variables of the third order (known as
Chernov spaces in Finsler Geometry), (b) spaces whose metric functions are
symmetric polynomials depending on four variables of the fourth order (known as
Berwald-Moore spaces in Finsler Geometry), (c) multi-linear symmetric forms as
Finsler extension of scalar product, (d) connection between Finsler spaces and
hypercomplex numbers, (e) possibility of extending, in the Finsler setting, the
Lorentzian splitting theorem, originally conjectured by S. T. Yau as the natural
extension of the Riemannian splitting theorem of Cheeger and Gromov.
