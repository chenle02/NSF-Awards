This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will research technical
and commercial feasibility of heterogenized homogeneous (supported) palladium
N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts. Homogeneous palladium-catalyzed
reactions are powerful methods for carbon-carbon and carbon-hetero atom bond
formations, such as Heck and Suzuki reactions. However, their commercial
adoption in fine chemical manufacture has been burdened by the inefficiencies
associated with homogeneous catalysts, primarily recovery and recycling, which
could be eliminated by the development of supported catalysts.

Successful research and development would result in commercial products that
would simplify post-reaction processing, reduced waste streams and reduction in
costs via recycling.
