This grant is for the acquisition of a scanning probe microscope (SPM)
possessing both good temperature control and a sealed sample cell for the study
of liquid samples. The instrument will be used to provide the first SPM study of
surface behavior of liquids near either a wetting transition or a bulk critical
point. These measurements will complement ongoing optical studies of these
phenomena and provide a new perspective on these topics. Some subjects to be
studied include droplet shapes, line tensions, and surface interaction
potentials. Droplets on both homogeneous silane-coated and
hydrophilic/hydrophobic silane-patterned silicon substrates will be studied to
ascertain the interactions between the line tension and the surface potential.
Other factors considered include the influence of molecular-scale surface
roughness and heterogeneity on the contact angle and line tension. The study
will significantly enhance understanding of the wettability of
surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface phenomena, such as adsorption and
wetting, play extremely important roles in many physical, chemical and
biological processes. Important information about the processes of adsorption
and wetting, and how they are influenced by surface interactions and by
processes occurring simultaneously in the bulk, can be deduced by studying these
phenomena near either a surface or bulk transition point, such as a wetting
transition or a bulk critical point. The SPM should have significant impact on
the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students by enabling
them to conduct both optical and SPM measurements of the same or similar
phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
