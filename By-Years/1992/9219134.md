This project is designed to investigate the petrogenesis of anorthosite-
jotunite-mangerite rocks from the Grenville Province of Canada. Suites of rocks
from the St. Urbain, Labrieville, and Morin regions will be investigated through
integrated field, petrological, and geochemical studies. The results should
elucidate the nature of parental magmas and differentiation mechanisms of massif
anorthosites and associated mangerites and the significance and origin of
associated mafic, oxide-rich lithologies (jotunites) and Fe- Ti oxide ore
deposits.
