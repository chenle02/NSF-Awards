Writing error-free computer software is notoriously difficult. Yet, software
errors (bugs) can have catastrophic consequences, ranging from loss of user data
and security vulnerabilities to loss of property and even loss of life. Thus,
designing tools that help software developers identify and fix bugs is of
critical importance. The goal of this project is to contribute to the
development of these kinds of tools. In particular, a key challenge faced by all
such tools is the need for specifications that describe the properties of
software libraries shared among many applications. Often, without these
specifications, the library code cannot be analyzed, substantially diminishing
the usefulness of bug-finding tools. This project's novelty lies in the
development of algorithms that use machine learning to automatically infer these
kinds of specifications. The project outcomes will substantially improve the
usefulness of bug-finding tools, thereby reducing the number of bugs in
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this project, the researchers design
novel and general algorithms for inferring specifications for blackbox code
(i.e., code that can be executed but not instrumented or analyzed). Focusing on
the blackbox setting ensures that the algorithms will work in a broad range of
settings, ranging from native code to code only available over a network
connection. These algorithms infer specifications by executing the code on
carefully chosen inputs, observing the corresponding output, and then
generalizing the observed behaviors to specifications. Furthermore, to improve
performance, these algorithms use reinforcement-learning to automatically learn
domain-specific search strategies, eliminating the need for end users to
manually design heuristic search strategies for their problem
domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
