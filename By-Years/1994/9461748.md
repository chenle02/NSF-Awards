This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a unique way
to produce adherent, improved thermal shock resistance coatings on SiC-SiC
composites. Silicon carbide is being evaluated for industrial heat exchanger
applications. High temperature use of SiC ceramics in corrosion environments is
limited to about 1200ÝC in heat exchanger applications. Several attempts were
made to apply a protective alumina external layer over the SiC substrate.
Thermal mismatch between alunina and SiC made it impossible to obtain adherent
alumina coatings on SiC substrate. Providing strong-adherent whiskers are
growing-off the substrate, the subsequent deposition of alumina coatings will
result in a formation of adherent, increased toughness, and thermal shock
resistant alumina coating. Thermomechanical properties of the SiC-reinforced
alumina coating will be dependent on the whiskers as well as alumina coating
properties. Tailoring of whiskers properties and coating microstructure will be
performed in order to obtain adherent alumina coatings on SiC substrates,
capable of surviving thermal cycling up to 1400ÝC.
