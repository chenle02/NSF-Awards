This project will create comprehensive plans to reformulate, streamline, and
develop a new computer engineering curriculum focused on embedded systems. In
consultation with industry, the team will assess the needs that form the basis
of this curriculum development effort, and the process that will be used to
provide form and substance to it. Project goals include the development of a
comprehensive roadmap that comprises course offerings, topical content, and
technology and software acquisitions, and a time-bound plan for phasing in the
new curriculum. The automotive context of the proposed embedded systems focus
insures broad applicability of the program developed. The automobile provides a
severe environment for electronics as well as a test bed for many of the latest
applications of embedded technology. Therefore, while the industry focus is
specific, the implications of this work go far beyond a local context. It is
expected that an engineer with a specialized education in embedded computer
engineering would be well suited to meet the emerging needs of an important
branch of modern engineering practice.
