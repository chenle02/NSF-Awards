NeXTLab, a computer laboratory in the department of Marine, Earth and
Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State University (NCSU), is designed to
facilitate the teaching of fundamental scientific principles to undergraduate
students. NeXTLab (consisting of a network of 12 NeXT User workstations and 2
NeXTLab Servers) will utilize the latest generation of workstation technology,
one that combines remarkable computer power, affordability, and a user-friendly
interface. Applications in which NeXTLab's technology excels include:i)
Animation (high-resolution postscript display) to show the time evolution of
weather systems ozone depletion, pollution dispersion, beach erosion, etc; ii)
Digital signal processing (dedicated chip) to teach turbulent time series
analysis, and atmospheric remote sensing, etc; iii) Mass storage (660 MB hard
disk, 256 MB read/write optical disk) a prerequisite for animation and signal
processing, as well as for applications that rely on large data bases (eg.,
global warming, ozone depletion, numerical model output). NeXTLab's innovative
programming environment allows software developers to create a graphical user-
friendly interface for educational applications (generally the most time-
consuming part) without any programming| Educational applications will be made
available nationally and publicized through journal articles to promote the
innovative use of computer workstations in teaching science in undergraduate
classrooms and laboratory settings. Support from UNIDATA ( a national NSF funded
program to distribute "real time" meteorological data sets) and a new building
facility at NCSU makes this an opportune time to proceed with development of
NeXTLab.
