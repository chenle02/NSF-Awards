Silverman A strong research program in the areas of computing architectures for
advanced speech recognition, algorithms, and experimentation is currently in
place in the Laboratory for Engineering Man/machine Systems (LEMS) at Brown.
This research focuses on a reconfigurable, general-purpose, computing structure,
and speech recognition/training algorithms, to advance the state-of-the-art in
both areas through their interaction. One feature of these efforts is the
evaluation of the effects of changes to the early stages of a speech recognizer.
This computationally intensive task will utilize the projected Armstrong III
reconfigurable hardware system to accelerate the current training algorithm. A
second feature is the incorporation of improvements to the current computational
and recognition performance of a talker- independent, connected alphadigit
recognizer, database, training, and tools, all developed at Brown. These include
microphone-array data acquisition, new signal-processing algorithms, non-
parametric modeling, better durational modeling, and new VQ/feature-space
methods.
