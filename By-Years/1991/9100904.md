The Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins University will provide shipboard
technical services associated with the research vessel RIDGLEY WARFIELD, a
110-foot ship that is owned by the NSF and operated by the University. A
significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in recent years has been
and is normally in support of NSF- sponsored research programs. The Shipboard
Technician Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore
component. The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific personnel in
the use of shared shipboard equipment; maintenance, repair, and calibration of
scientific instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck operations; and
providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific parties. On
shore activities include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared use
seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field
work on the vessel. Shipboard technicians funded by this award have broad
responsibilities for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the
successful completion of research projects at sea. The level of activity and
amount of support are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,
and its scientific outfit and capability.
