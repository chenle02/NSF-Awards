9403612 Wight The main objective of this project is to develop a design strategy
for the use of ductile steel bracing fro the seismic upgrading of slab-column
frame structures that are located in moderate and high seismic zones. To develop
the design approach, the experimental data obtained from the tests on a large
scale two-story by two-bay reinforced concrete slab-column framed and from the
test or slab-column connection assemblies and columns jacketed with steel angles
and plates will be analyzed and synthesized. The design strategy will utilize
the strength and stiffness contributions from the unbraced portions of the
existing slab-column structure. The results will be presented in a form that can
be understood and used by practicing engineers. ***
