The goal of this project is for the National Research Council (NRC) to organize
a public workshop to engage the atmospheric sciences community and others as
appropriate to provide feedback on the draft by asking participants to share
their views in the context of the following questions: Are the goals and
objectives clear and appropriate? Are there any content areas missing from the
draft that should be present if Division on Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences
(AGS) is to achieve its overall vision and mission? Are there adequate
mechanisms for coordinating and integrating issues that involve multiple
disciplines and multiple divisions within National Science Foundation? The
workshop will take place on March 31-April 1, 2014 at the National Academy of
Sciences, Washington DC. It will also include a brief, forward-looking session
where participants will discuss research frontiers. AGS might consider pursuing
in light of the goals and objectives that have been identified as well as those
that have been acknowledged as missing. The committee will write a letter report
reviewing the AGS draft goals and objectives by addressing the questions above
from its own standpoint.
