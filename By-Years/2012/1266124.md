The new center site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) for Broadband Wireless Technologies and Applications at the University
of Notre Dame will complement the existing center?s activities through a focus
on emerging wireless technology, economics, and regulatory policy challenges.
The site intends to develop a cohesive and integrative approach to broadband
research challenges in areas including cellular data collection, analytics,
&amp; visualization; heterogeneous network modeling, analysis, and design;
electromagnetic radiation exposure; spectrum sharing; vehicular communications;
inter-machine wireless; crowd-sourced approaches and advanced
circuitry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center site addresses an area of critical
economic and has the potential to support development of broadband wireless as a
platform for innovation as addressed in the White House PCAST Report. The center
site at Notre Dame has the potential to link an even greater diversity of member
companies across the broadband industry sector with university a broader base of
discovery in this area. The site will provide early exposure to the concerns of
and approaches employed in industry in students? education and career
development. Underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students will be
recruited to the program through existing mechanisms at the site such as the REU
program in Experimental Research on Wireless Networking (ERWiN), in which more
than 40% of the participants were from underrepresented groups over the last
five years.&lt;br/&gt;
