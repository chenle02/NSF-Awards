Abstract

Award: DMS 1309340, Principal Investigator: Anton Petrunin

The principal investigator proposes to continue the study of Alexandrov geometry
and its applications, which include isometric group actions and Riemannian
geometry. The research is divided into the following main parts: (1) Finding new
examples of CAT[0] spaces, related to isometric actions on Euclidean space, (2)
Collapsing and convergence of Riemannian manifolds, and (3) Pure Alexandrov
geometry.

Alexandrov geometry studies metric spaces from an axiomatic point of view, which
is similar to the approach given in Euclid's Elements. This theory has
applications in many branches of modern geometry. In addition to to the pure
research, the principal investigator proposes to continue his work with co-
authors on a book which is intended to be a comprehensive text and reference in
this area of geometry; he also has two other smaller projects oriented to
geometric education.
