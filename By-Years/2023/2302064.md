The study of rational number solutions of polynomial equations has a rich
history. The case of elliptic curves, essentially cubic equations in two
variables, continues to be fascinating. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
(BSD) connects the arithmetic of an elliptic curve to the associated Hasse-Weil
L-function. Iwasawa theory seeks to shed light on the mysterious arithmetic
incarnation of L-values. The PI aims to study cases of the BSD conjecture and
variants, primarily based on Iwasawa theory. The PI also aims to train graduate
students, and introduce undergraduates to research.

The last decade has witnessed a key progress towards the BSD conjecture for
elliptic curves of rank zero or one, as initiated by Skinner and Zhang. An aim
of this project is to establish some of the key missing cases. For instance, the
PI seeks the p-converse and p-part of the BSD formula for primes p of non-
ordinary reduction. The project aims to develop two-variable Euler systems over
an imaginary quadratic field for an elliptic curve as well as anticyclotomic
Iwasawa theory at non-split primes.
