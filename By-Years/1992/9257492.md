This NYI award will fund research aimed at understanding the basic optical,
thermal, and physical mechanisms involved in infrared- laser tissue ablation.
Special emphasis will be given to dynamic measurements under laser irradiation.
Measurements of the dynamic characteristics also will be conducted for visible
and ultraviolet light. This research will stimulate the development of new
laser-based systems for the medical field. The NYI Award also will help the
investigator improve the teaching of biomedical instrumentation design courses
and continue the development of a specialty course in laser-tissue interactions.
