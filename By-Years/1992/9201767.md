This project outlined a comprehensive investigation analyzing and relating the
microscopic characteristics of AlN, AlN:H, Si3N4, and Si3N4:H thinfilms with
their macroscopic properties. Molecular structure of the films will be
determined by complementary vibrational techniques, FTIR, and Raman
spectroscopy. STM, SFM, SEM, EDX, and XRD are used to characterize the films'
microsctructures. Special emphasis will be placed on determining the role of
hydrogen in these films. The motivation for this work is to improve the
understanding of how microscopic details ( molecular structure and
microsctructure) control the chemical and mechanical properties of thin films.
%%%% This study investigates the role of hydrogen incorporation on the
properties of the thin films. AlN and Si3N4 films are used for this study.
Molecular structure of the film will be determined, and it will be used to
correlated with the microscopic and macroscopic properties of the film. This
study will provide useful information for the fundamental undrstanding of how
microscopic details, such as molecular structure and microsctructure, control
the chemical and mechanical properties of thin films.
