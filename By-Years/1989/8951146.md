Vassar College will purchase a computer-controlled cryogenically cooled CCD
imaging system which will be mounted on the existing Fecker 15-inch Cassegrain
reflector. With this configuration students will be able to observe
approximately 20th magnitude stars with a five minute exposure. To take
advantage of faculty expertise, work will concentrate on the structure of
galaxies. Specific student projects will examine local spiral structure in the
Milky Way through star counts in the direction of molecular clouds and accurate
color- magnitude diagrams of galactic clusters. The structure of other galaxies
will utilize near-infrared imaging to determine the distribution of late-type
stars with respect to the prominent blue structure. In carrying out these
projects, students will learn the important modern techniques of data
acquisition and reduction, acquire a realistic understanding of astronomical
measurements, and be better prepared to enter graduate programs. Those students
who do not become professional astronomers will benefit from their first-hand
participation in a serious effort at scientific discovery. The University will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
