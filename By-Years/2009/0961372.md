Funds are provided to reconstruct the &#948;26Mg of seawater by measuring it the
&#948;26Mg of pelagic carbonates across the Cenozoic. PI's preliminary results
show similar patterns in &#948;26Mg at sites in both the Pacific and Atlantic
Ocean sites. However, some of the observed changes in &#948;26Mg are too fast
and too large to be compatible with the current understanding of the geochemical
magnesium cycle. To refine understanding of magnesium isotope variability in
pelagic carbonates the PI will also make magnesium isotope measurements on
individual species of planktonic foraminifera and other size fractions of the
bulk carbonate sediment as well as in pore fluids. These measurements will
provide important new constraints on the potential effects of diagenesis. The PI
will also pursue alternative approaches to reconstructing the &#948;26Mg of
seawater using fluid inclusions in evaporite minerals. The work will help
elucidate the processes that control the major element chemistry of seawater,
and therefore the global carbon cycle and climate, on geologic timescales.

The research has the potential to make a broad impact on our understanding of
the chemistry of the ocean, particularly with respect to the geochemical cycles
of magnesium, calcium, and carbon. In addition, the proposed activities may help
elucidate a better understanding of the causes of climate change over the
Cenozoic by better constraining factors that affect the carbon cycle over this
timescale. The research will support the training of a graduate student who will
be exposed to a range of approaches including mass spectrometry and numerical
modeling.
