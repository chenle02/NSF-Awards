9729256 Thier A book titled, "From Sputnik to Standards-The Process of Science
Education Development" is being prepared by the Science Education for Public
Understanding Program at the Lawrence Hall of Science. The focus is on the
processes and techniques of successful materials-centered instructional
development and effective dissemination and implementation. The book is suitable
for professional development seminars for instructional materials developers and
associated professionals as well as school, university, and private sector
groups and governmental and private agencies that provide financial support for
materials development. Highly successful instructional materials development
projects can be found in settings as diverse as small colleges, independent
research and development organizations, professional societies, and school
systems and are led by scientists, engineers, and others with widely different
educational backgrounds. The investigation looks at examples of all such efforts
and isolates the important characteristics of successful projects.
