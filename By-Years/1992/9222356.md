This award provides funding to New Jersey Institute of Technology's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Hazardous Substance
Management, for a project titled "Creation of an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Centers' Center Director's Handbook." Currently the only document
available to I/UCRC directors which provides operational guidance is a 10-year
old, 27 page document that only addresses three aspects of center operations.
The Committee of Visitors, which recently reviewed the I/UCRC program,
recommended that this document be revised. The new handbook, to be produced
under this award, will codify and document the collective managerial knowledge
acquired by I/UCRC participants and translate this knowledge into operational
"art and science" so that it can be communicated more efficiently and
effectively to Center directors. The authors, Dr. George Walters and Dr. Dennis
Gray, propose to research, develop and produce such a Handbook for I/UCRC Center
Directors which incorporates the experience and wisdom possessed by a variety of
individuals such as NSF staff, Center Directors, and Evaluators associated with
the I/UCRC program throughout the history of the program. The Handbook will
contain the following elements: 1) introduction; 2) recommended policies,
procedures, and/or practices for an I/UCRC; and 3) appendices. The Program
Director recommends that New Jersey Institute of Technology be awarded $68,000,
for 18 months, to undertake and complete the I/UCRC Center Directors Handbook.
