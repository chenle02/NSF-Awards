This award supports the annual summer CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics
of Atmospheric Regions) workshop as well as planning activities by the award
recipient and the CEDAR Steering Committee. The CEDAR Workshop and associated
community services, such as maintenance of a participant database, wiki web
pages, and community emails, will be managed by the UCAR Visiting Scientist
Program (VSP). The workshop brings together the upper atmospheric research
community to share information among students, researchers, and government
agencies. The workshop promotes undergraduate and graduate exposure and
participation in related sciences. The community web pages and email support
also serve to tie the community together. CEDAR is a broad-based, community-
initiated, upper atmospheric research program. The goal is to understand the
behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the
thermosphere and ionosphere into the exosphere in terms of coupling, energetics,
chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales.
