w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705443 Smith : This is a renewal project directed
to the study of the dynamics and transport of spin systems in diluted magnetic
semiconductors. The main goals of this research are: (1) To measure the spin
transport of exciton magnetic polarons using spatially- and temporally-resolved
photoluminescence spectroscopy. (2) Use time-resolved near-field optical
microscopy to measure local fluctuations and clusters of Mn-impurities within
the ZnMnSe alloy. (3) Measure the dynamics of spin-polarized exciton populations
and the effect of phonons, magnetic ion exchange, electron-hole exchange and
band mixing on the thermalization times. This research will probe directly the
physics of spin interactions using all-optical techniques which are particularly
suitable for use in semiconductors. The information gained on spin dynamics in
these systems will have application to other spin systems as well, particularly
in metallic systems. %%% This is a renewal project targeted towards
understanding the fundamental physics of magnetic interactions in novel
semiconductors which have been doped with magnetic impurities. Study of these
interactions has direct applicability to the technologically important area of
magnetic technologies such as magnetic memories (eg. Hard disks), super-
sensitive magnetic detectors, and magneto-optical modulators. These novel
magnetic semiconductors can be probed with ultrafast optical methods using
femtosecond lasers. This allows one to probe the dynamics of these magnetic
interactions on a time scale which is impossible to do in the metallic systems.
Such information is crucial to the improvement of existing and the development
of new magnetic technologies. ***
