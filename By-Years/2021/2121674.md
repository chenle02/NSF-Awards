The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) is a new green, non-toxic and bioderived
technology for water treatment using membrane filters. The new membranes will be
used to provide safe tap water to local communities. Membrane filtration
technologies have been used in water treatment for decades because membranes are
easy to fabricate, simple to use, have high selectivity for impurity removal,
and do not require the regeneration. The fabrication of membranes using
renewable solvents derived from biomass that does not compete with food
applications, satisfies both consumer and legislative demands with regard to
sustainability. The technology has potential commercial application in water
filtration for industrial and household applications. Apart from the impact in
these large and growing markets, this innovation may enable new directions at
the nexus of food-energy-water systems and eco-
manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will establish a green
and non-toxic process of fabricating polymeric ultrafiltration membranes using
two environmentally friendly and bioderived co-solvents embedded with silver
nanoparticles in an innovative one-step process. Research objectives include:
(1) preparing solutions comprised of polymer, solvent and silver nanoparticles
in a single solution; (2) scaling up the membranes using roll to roll enabled
process, (3) determining the purity of the wastewater produced during membrane
fabrication especially with regard to the occurrence of any leaching of silver
nanoparticles, and (4) operating the prototype membranes in continuous/long-term
operation to determine efficiency in the removal of per- and polyfluorinated
chemicals (PFAS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
