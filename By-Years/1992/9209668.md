Copper oxide superconductors with transition temperature (Tc) as high as 125K
have been much studied during the past few years but the origin of the high Tc
and that of the unusual normal state are still unknown. We propose to prepare
copper oxide scs with lower Tc and to measure their physical properties.
Measurements will be made on high-quality crystals with a systematic variation
of doping (carriers). The objective is to elucidate the mechanism for
superconductivity and the nature of the anomalous normal state in all copper
oxide superconductors.
