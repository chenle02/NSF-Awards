&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: ITR: Virtual Kinetic Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
Number: CTS-0112306&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Thanh
Truong&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University Of Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
creation of an on-line Virtual Kinetic Laboratory (VKLab), an integrated web-
based problem-solving environment with visualization and experimental data
verification for research and education in reaction kinetics, is proposed. The
specific objectives for the proposed period are 1) to design the VKLab server
page and infrastructure; 2) to develop a chemical information management system
for storage and retrieval of structural and thermodynamic properties of
molecular species, and kinetic properties of chemical reactions; 3) to develop
tools for calculating thermodynamic properties of individual molecules and
reactions by using the user-supplied potential energy surface or group-
additivity approach; 3) to develop ab initio dynamics tools for calculating both
temperature and pressure dependent rate constants of elementary reactions; 4) to
develop an automatic mechanism generation of complex reactions; 5) to interface
VKLab with existing tools for mechanism sensitivity analysis and reduction.
Successful development of VKLab will provide an environment in which researchers
and students in science or engineering can perform research or learn
computational methods in chemical thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, access
information, and computational resources regardless of physical and geographic
location, age, physical limitation, and personal schedule.
