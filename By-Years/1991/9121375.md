ABSTRACT The research described in this project is concerned with on-line
language comprehension processing during reading. In the proposal, a number of
studies are outlined in which eye movement data are collected as subjects read
sentences and text. The goal for the next period of research is to continue the
empirical and theoretical work on sentence parsing, syntactic ambiguity, and
lexical ambiguity that has been done in our laboratory over the past twelve
years of this project. The experiments deal with (1) the role of focus structure
in sentence and discourse processing, (2) the role of events in sentence and
discourse structure, and (3) the effects of discourse structure on lexical
processing. The theoretical implications of the work for a theory of reading and
on-line language processing will be developed. The research should be useful in
furhter understanding the reading process and help to reveal the relationship
between skilled and poor reading.
