Biofilms are assemblages of microorganisms and their associated extracellular
matrix. In natural settings bacteria are associated with other cells in biofilms
that coat biological and abiological surfaces. Some biofilms cause economic and
health problems in industrial and medical settings. Cells in biofilms assemble
striking three-dimensional structures through the use of cell signaling
processes. An often-ignored aspect of biofilms is the use of shared space, the
extracellular matrix, to channel metabolites and signals from cell to cell that
synchronize the behavior of the population. Myxococcus xanthus mutants that are
unable to secrete the matrix are impaired in biofilm formation, motility,
chemotaxis, and fruiting body development. This grant is one of the very first
attempts to examine the genetics and biochemistry of the matrix of any
bacterium, and it does so by focussing on a newly discovered cell communication
pathway that coordinates M. xanthus cell motility in response to the lipid
signal phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The research will examine the essential
structural features of the PE signal through mass spectrometry and synthetic
chemistry. The extracellular matrix proteome will be purified and identified by
mass spectrometry using the newly completed M. xanthus genome sequence. Gene
disruption will be used to identify essential matrix proteins and elucidate the
mechanism by which the extracellular matrix initiates signal perception and
transduces this information to the Dif chemosensory system. Finally the
methylated chemotaxis receptor DifA will be subjected to site-directed and
random mutagenesis to identify regions involved in PE chemotaxis.
