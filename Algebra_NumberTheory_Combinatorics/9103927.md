Professor Barefoot will study 4 and 5 connected Halin graphs as well as
amalgams that generalize Halin graphs. In particular, he intends to study their
Hamiltonian properties. Graph Theory goes back perhaps two hundred years, but
only in the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile, and
flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a network of lines ("edges")
joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of graphs becomes a natural way
of describing interrelationships among separated objects. Graph Theory figures
most prominently as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer
Science.
