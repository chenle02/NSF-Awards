The proposal is to support the attendance of junior faculty, post-docs and
graduate students at a workshop on partial differential equations and several
complex variables, Serra Brazil, August 3-7, 2009. The workshop will be cofunded
by the Office of International Science and Engineering. They will support the
student component.

The workshop activities will center on two mini-courses delivered by two
distinguished senior researchers, but there will be an additional lectures
daily. The courses will prepare younger researchers to work on topics of current
interest in several complex variables and partial differential equations. There
will be an international mix of students and junior and senior researchers and
this will foster new international collaborations.
