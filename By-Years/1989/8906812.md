The 16th International Conference on the Physics of Electronic and Atomic
Collisions will be held in New York July 26 . August 1, 1989. Topics range from
the physics of supernovae and the theory of geometric phases to the implications
of new and emerging technologies, such as cold atomic beams, trapped atoms and
ions, clusters, femtosecond laser techniques, and X.ray lasers, as well as the
more traditional collisions areas, including electron.atom, electron.ion and
ion.atom collisions and multiphoton processes.
