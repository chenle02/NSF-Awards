A Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) has been awarded to Dr. Joerg Graf
of the University of Connecticut to characterize the microbial community of
Hirudo medicinalis, the medicinal leech. Cultivation studies have often vastly
underestimated the diversity of microorganisms in nature. Previous attempts to
cultivate microbes have provided contrasting views on the diversity of bacteria
in the leech gut. In this study, Dr. Graf proposes to characterize the microbial
community of the medicinal leech in a culture-independent approach. The 16S rRNA
genes will be cloned and sequenced to identify the members of the microbial
community in different regions of the digestive tract. The sequence information
will be used to develop terminal restriction fragment analysis (T-RFLP) that
allows the rapid monitoring of the microbial population in animals from
different geographic regions and at different times after
feeding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microorganisms that reside in the digestive
tract of animals perform critical functions for the well being of the host.
These functions include the digestion of the ingested food, supply of essential
nutrients and vitamins, metabolism of carcinogens, and interference with the
colonization of the digestive tract by pathogens. This research is likely to
result in the discovery of new microbial taxa. The potential complexity of this
community hinders our understanding of the population dynamics inside the
digestive tract. Monitoring the microbial population over time after feeding
will provide important information about the population dynamics and microbial
interactions of the symbiotic community in the digestive tract.&lt;br/&gt;
