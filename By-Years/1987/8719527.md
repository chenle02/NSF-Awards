This proposal requests funds for the purchase of growth chambers to be used in
four diverse botanical investigations that are designed to address: the
ecological importance and physiological consequences of phototoxic
phytochemicals in plants that grow under high light conditions, the development
and evolution of heterostylous breeding systems in plants, the physiological and
developmental ecology of extreme shade tropical rainforest plants, and the
involvement of extrafloral nectar production as a biotic plant defense and
studies of plant reproductive biology. Support is recommended since acquisition
of the growth chambers will greatly enchane the research capability and
productivity of the four investigators.
