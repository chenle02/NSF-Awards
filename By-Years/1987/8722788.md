This award will aid in the establishment of a massive hierarchical storage
facility, (1) to investigate approaches to the design of systems software for
such an environment, and (2) to use the environment in a number of application
areas, including: i) The construction of large knowledge bases and their
application in machine learning and natural language processing; ii) The
manipulation of complex objects such as designs, large programs, and multimedia
documents; iii) The processing of geometric and pictorial information such as
images, surfaces and mathematical functions of several variables; iv) The
integrated storage of scientific program libraries, mathematical tables and
procedures for the transformation and manipulation of symbolic information. The
development of the system will require innovations in distributed operating
systems, computer architecture, performance analysis, database system design and
algorithm design. The availability of the system will enhance the research at
Berkeley in artificial intelligence, text processing, programming systems,
graphics, computer vision and scientific computation.
