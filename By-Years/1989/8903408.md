This award provides for 54% of the acquisition costs for a Brillouin
spectrometry system to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth and
Space Sciences at the State University of New York (SUNY) in Stony Brook. The
SUNY system is committed to providing the remaining necessary funding. Brillouin
scattering is one of the most important tools available for obtaining elastic
constants of microcrystals of the high-pressure mineral phases considered to
exist at depth in the Earth's mantle. These, in turn, can be related and
compared to the elastic wave velocities calculated from earthquake measurements
which are significant "finger prints" for deducing the nature of the mantle. The
Stony Brook laboratory has pioneered the use of Brillouin spectroscopy for
defining the elastic properties and seismic velocities of mantle materials, and
the new Brillouin spectrometer system will allow a new generation of these
critical measurements to be made at elevated temperatures and pressures
approaching mantle conditions.
