9602163 Braam This award supports the participation of 13 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.- Japan Binational Workshop entitled "Plant Signal Transduction" to be held
in Tsukuba, Japan on May 13 and 14, 1996. Following the workshop, the U.S.
participants will travel to other institutes and universities to meet with
Japanese scientists with whom they share research interests. The co-organizers
are Professor Janet Braam from Rice University, Houston, Texas, USA and
Professor Kazuo Shinozaki from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research,
Tsukuba Life Science Center, Japan. The specific aims of the workshop are to:
(1) summarize the current state of knowledge of the processes of signal
transduction in plants; (2) identify key questions that remain to be answered;
and (3) propose new approaches to address these issues. The long-term goals are
to create joint research programs between a cross section of leading Japanese
and American scientists that will advance the understanding of how plants sense
and respond to environmental stimuli, and which will fulfill the objectives of
the U.S./Japan Program through the exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
by international collaboration. ***
