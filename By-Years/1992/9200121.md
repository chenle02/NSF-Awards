An experimental study is proposed to explore the dynamics of shear thickening
and microstructural changes in suspensions of uniform particle. The effects on
the onset and magnitude of shear thickening of the continuous phase viscosity,
particle size, particle density and volumn fraction will be explored. Both
repulsive and attractive interaction potentials will be studied using model
suspensions where the pair potential can be characterized from low volume
fraction studies. Microstructures will be studied with small angle neutron
scattering (SANS) and optical scattering techniques. Evidence of shear rate or
stress induced structural phase transitions and the existence of metastable
viscosities will be sought. The kinetics of such transitions and their effects
on rheological behavior will be investigated. The structural changes occurring
in suspensions with increasing shear rate and resulting increases in viscosity
(shear thickening) are important in a wide range of technologies involving
processing of dense suspensions.
