The objectives of this research are to determine what factors limit or regulate
populations of migratory birds that breed in north temperate forests and winter
in the Neotropics. the basic questions concerns whether these factors operate
more importantly in summer breeding areas at temperate latitudes, in neotropical
winter quarters, or during both seasons. Through demographic and experimental
studies, hypotheses will be tested to determine (1) if limitation occurs in both
summer and winter, (2) if habit occupancy is determined by social dominance
(depotism) or other preemptive behavior, (3) if individuals vary in fitness
among habitats, that is, the demographic consequences of despotic habitat
selection, and (4) what ecological variables affect habitat quality and
therefore fitness. Emphasis will be on differential fitness among habitats i
both summer and winter, including second-growth forests, agricultural lands, and
other human-modified habitats. The results will advance our understanding of the
population dynamics and community relations of these migrant bird species, as
well as the factors affecting their population abundances. Such information will
also contribute to the development of sound and effective conservation policies.
