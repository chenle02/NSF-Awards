This is an award to support research on a concept for improving the rate at
which petroleum hydrocarbons with a high-carbon content, can be removed from
soil that has been contaminated by leakage from underground storage tanks. The
investigator plans on evaluating anionic surfactants that have an enhanced
affinity for the target hydrocarbons because of their chemical structure, and
comparing their performance in this respect with cationic and nonionic
surfactants. The investigator plans to includes the evaluation of surfactants
with the use of micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration, a surfactant-based separation
process for treatment of the wash water after it has been circulated through the
contaminated soil. This process in combination with the appropriate anionic
surfactant has the potential of providing for recovery of the surfactant for
reuse in the soil-decontamination process. This proposal was submitted in
response to Program Announcement NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards. Results
are expected to improve the engineering design of chemical remediation systems
that are used to remove petroleum hydrocarbons from soil that has been
contaminated by leakage of petroleum hydrocarbons from storage tanks.
