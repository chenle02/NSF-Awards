Under the direction of Dr. Michael Coe, Mr. Kevin Johnston will conduct
archeological research at the site of Itzan to collect data as part of his
doctoral dissertation research. Itzan, located in the Department of Peten,
Guatemala, dates from the Late Classic Maya period (AD 550 to 900) and documents
this complex society at the height of its development. Because of a road which
was recently cut across the site, Mr. Johnston has located a series of cultural
occurrences which appear in the cut profiles along the sides of the roads.
Because these small or "hidden sites" appear not to be associated with
architecture, they are invisible from the surface and have been found only by
the greatest of luck. Mr. Johnston will produce a large scale map of the area,
which includes many buildings which are visible from surface remains, to
determine the relative position of the hidden structures. Several of these sites
will then be excavated and the materials recovered compared from those from
larger sites. By these means, it should be possible to determine what functions
these hidden sites served. This research is important for several reasons.
First, archaeologists have long suspected that such small "hidden" sites might
exist. However, rarely has it been possible to locate them. Since researchers
use the distribution of known archaeological remains and the patterns observed
among them to derive population estimates and reconstruct how prehistoric Mayan
society functioned, the results may be seriously in error if an entire class of
remains has been missed. Mr. Johnston's work raises this possibility, and it is,
therefore, important to understand what these hidden sites are and the role they
served in the broader cultural picture. Secondly, Mr. Johnston is an extremely
competent young scientist and this research will significantly add to his
training.
