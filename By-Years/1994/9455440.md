Recent reports on the state of science education have identified a need for more
process-oriented, multidisciplinary science courses; these reports also call for
science courses that are integrated within a coherent general education program.
This project will develop a two semester laboratory-based introductory science
course taught collaboratively by twelve faculty members from six science
disciplines. Called The Natural World, this course will be modular in nature and
centered around multidisciplinary topics of current relevance. The Natural World
will emphasize the basic foundations of natural science, science as a way of
knowing, the uses of science, historical influences on the development of
science, and the interrelationships between science and culture. A unique aspect
of the Natural World will be its integration within a new core curriculum of 38
hours that integrates the various academic disciplines within a set of
comprehensive and cohesive interdisciplinary courses. The Natural World will be
linked to two humanities courses students will be taking concurrently. Ten
modules of interdisciplinary topics will be developed for use in introductory
science courses, each to include an instructors guide, a student guide,
suggestions for student and teacher readings, writing assignments and laboratory
exercises that involve collaborative and discovery-based learning.
