The tectonic evolution of orogenic systems developing at convergent margins
involves steady state and episodic processes. Steady state processes, such as
subduction or arc magmatism have received considerable study, however, it is
becoming apparent that many orogenic belts have a history involving relatively
short, discrete periods of deformation superimposed on the steady state
processes. This project examines the effect of a collision of an active
spreading center with a convergent margin. The Chile margin triple junction in
southern Chile is the best modern example available for study because of its
relatively well known, simple kinematic evolution. The work involves study of a
3-4 Ma ophiolite exposed on land 15km from the trench, silicic plutons near the
ophiolite and associated hot springs, and faults and uplifted recent deposits.
Results are expected to document a variety of features related to the subduction
of an active ridge that may be used in the interpretation of ancient systems.
