This research explores a new approach to forming glassy metals, solid state
amorphization reactions. The program takes three concurrent paths: the
measurement of the thermodynamic properties of supersaturated solid solutions;
the formation of amorphous structure through solid state reactions; and light-
ion irradiation to enhance formation of amorphous structure by changing the free
energy balance between competing phases. An effort is made to separate the
thermodynamic effects from the kinetic effects in these solid state reactions.
Enthalpies of the phases are measured by differential scanning calorimetry and
degree of internal strain and structure characterized by X-ray and transmission
electron microscopy.
