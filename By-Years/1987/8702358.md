The foundation upon which mathematical analysis rests is the real number
system, which in turn depends upon the concept of completeness and limits. Both
in theory and practice, estimation and approximation of real numbers is a
fundamental concept, crucial to all forms of scientific and engineering
endeavor. There are a few famous inequalities -- those that bear the names
Cauchy, Schwarz, Minkowski, and Holder, for example -- that were discovered long
ago, and which are basic to the general theory of inequalities. It is a rare and
important event when a new inequality is discovered, for such an occurence
surely foreshadows important and previously unsuspected or unobtainable
applications. Professor Bennett has the enviable distinction of having recently
discovered some new fundamental inequalities. They have led to solution of a
number of outstanding problems in the theory of majorization. Moreover, this
work has allowed Professor Bennett to conjecture still more powerful extensions
of his inequalities, which in turn would open new research directions in very
basic subjects such as function theory, operator theory, eigenvalue
distribution, orthogonal series, and matrix theory. Professor Bennett will
continue this unique and important research program.
