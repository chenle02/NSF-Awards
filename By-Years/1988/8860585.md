Recent advances in liquid crystal technology have made it possible to construct
tunable birefringent filters operating over the range 3500-20000 Angstrom. The
center wavelength of these filters can be selected electronically, in a few
milliseconds, with no moving parts. These filters can have passbands as narrow
as 50 Angstroms and should be relatively inexpensive to produce.
