ABSTRACT DIGIACOMO EEC-9714572 Advanced Communications is an industry that is
growing substantially in the U.S and the world. Antennas play an important role
in wireless communications. The Villanova University Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Communications is initializing its
second five year continuing award. Six companies have full memberships totaling
$300,000 and another six have associate memberships totaling $70,000. The
Center's research agenda will focus on Phased Arrays and Digital Antenna, Phase
Arrays and Digital Antenna Beamforming, Satellite Communications, Cellular
Telephone Antennas, Low Profile Antennas, Cellular Base-Station Antennas, Signal
Classification, and Cellular Buried Components. A woman undergraduate is being
funded to augment the Center's research agenda to develop an easily-used
analysis method to determine reliability and life cycle for composite
functionally Grade Materials for electronic modules.
