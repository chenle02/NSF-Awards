This work investigates a broad spectrum of problems dealing with logic in
computer science that span finite model theory, database theory, complexity
theory, and optimization theory. The question of whether or not certain
important algorithmic problems are expressible in various logical query
languages, such as Datalog and extensions of Datalog with negation, are
examined. Further, the relationship between first- order logic, fixpoint logic,
and polynomial-time computability on arbitrary classes of finite structures are
explored. In the area of logical definability and asymptotic probabilities, 0-1
laws are investigated for certain powerful extensions of fixpoint logic and an
attempt is made to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of
0-1 laws under variable probability measures. In a different line of
investigation, the descriptive complexity of optimization problems continues to
be developed. An attempt is made to determine if there is an effective syntax
for the approximable NP optimization problems and to seek structural
explanations for the diverse behavior of polynomial-time optimization problems
with respect to parallel approximation.
