In this research the principal investigator with collaborators will study
theories of the formation and function of a class of brain structures called
brain maps found in the cortex of higher animals. Brain maps are common in the
brains of higher animals and are involved in various computational tasks such as
processing sensory information, and generating motor commands, and are probably
also used in the performance of high-level functions related to memory and
language. The investigator's study will focus on brain maps in primary visual
areas, with emphasis on the retinotopic map, and on the orientation and ocular
dominance column substructure of this map. Specifically the investigator will
investigate the relations between the local map structure, intra-cortical
connectivity schemes, and the response properties of single cells. The
comparative aspects of this study will be performed on a massively parallel
computer. This is a timely and important topic, the research is
multidisciplinary in approach, and the state of the field makes this research
appropriate for the Small Grants for Exploratory Research program.
