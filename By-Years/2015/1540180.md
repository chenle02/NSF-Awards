Gyroscope is currently used in a wide range of applications including defense,
aerospace, consumer electronics, and industrial. It is a multi-billion dollar
market with a very high growth rate. Current Micro Electromechanical Systems
(MEMS) gyroscopes at the needed size, price point, and accuracy are not
available to be used in many of the new applications the market seeks, such as
in the navigation unit for guiding Unmanned Air Vehicles, automobiles, and
humans in the regions where GPS signals are not receivable, for instance, inside
buildings and tunnels. These applications require accuracy that is ~100 times
higher than that of current available MEMS gyroscopes. This project aims to
commercialize ultra-high-precision Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS)
gyroscopes, called the birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG). The proposed work
will enhance the understanding of dominant energy loss mechanisms and ways to
further improve the performance of these resonators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
team has demonstrated the proof of concept BRG, and was tested at the lab under
non-ideal temperature conditions. The device demonstrated accuracy and has been
found to be sufficient for some industrial and military applications (e.g.
stabilization of platforms for antenna, robots, or helicopters). By
participating in the I-Corps program, the team will contact market participants
that use gyroscopes to understand their needs, both met and unmet, regarding
unit size, power, cost, and technical performance requirements. The team will
work to learn the potential market size for its technology, and conduct an
analysis of competitors already in the space to see how they are supplying the
marketplace in a way that meet current customer needs. If successfully
developed, the BRG technology could be adopted in a wide range of new
applications. This will benefit the society by creating new jobs for developing
both hardware and software for utilizing ultra high performance MEMS gyroscopes.
