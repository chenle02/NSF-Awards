NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0204455&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Emphasis Year:
Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Their
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0204455
Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports participants
in a workshop, held in Fall 2002, and an international conference, held in
Spring 2003, at Northwestern University. The meetings, part of an emphasis year
on nonlinear partial differential equations and applications, will bring
together a diverse group of applied mathematicians and analysts who are able to
explore connections between their fields. Discussion will be devoted to the
development of new connections between nonlinear partial differential equations
and such diverse areas as fluid dynamics, kinetic theory, free boundary
problems, phase transition phenomena, biophysics, and modeling and computation,
as well as nonlinear analysis, approximation theory, geometric measure theory,
and harmonic analysis. The interdisciplinary meetings will provide excellent
opportunities for communication and collaboration between senior and junior
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
