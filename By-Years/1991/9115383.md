Dr. Harlyn Halvorson is the Director of the Marine Biological Laboratory in
Woods Hole, Massachusetts. MBL has been an important international center for
marine research since its founding in 1888. The Lab continues to be an active
locus of diverse research by resident and visiting scientists. Dr. Halvorson
plans to improve the research capabilities of the Lab by acquiring lab
instruments (two centrifuges and an on-line gas chromatograph combustion system
for the Lab's mass spectrometer) and a monitoring station for meteorological and
hydrological data, and by extending the existing computer network to several
buildings. These proposed improvements will expand the range of research
conducted at the Lab, and will provide visiting scientists with much greater
access to computing facilities on the MBL campus and at their home institutions.
The addition of the gas chromatograph to the mass spectrometer will
significantly reduce the sample volume needed for precise measurements of
isotopic ratios, thereby increasing the range of environments that can be
sampled and analyzed. These items will allow the Marine Biological Lab to
continue its outstanding service to the research community.
