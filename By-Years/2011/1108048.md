This project is aimed at the analysis of hyperbolic systems of conservation
laws. The focus is on: (1) vanishing viscosity limits to the multi-dimensional
Euler equations of gas dynamics; and (2) new representation formulas for
solutions of conservation laws. The first project aims at the characterization
of limits of families of the vanishing viscosity, radial solutions to the
multidimensional Euler equations with large, discontinuous data. The methods of
compensated compactness will be adopted for systems of equations that do not
possess invariant regions, using only the balance of total energy. In the second
project the Principal Investigator will establish a new kinetic formulation for
hyperbolic conservation laws. In this approach solutions of conservation laws
are represented by probability measures on the phase space which, in turn, are
represented as divergences of vector fields obtained as values of a contraction
semigroup on suitable Hilbert spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws are fundamental equations in physics. They model
diverse phenomena in dynamics of gases, elasticity, and electromagnetism.
Because of their importance in applications these equations have been
extensively studied. However, there is no complete theory that allows one
solving the equations for generic data and describing properties of the
solutions. The project introduces several innovative analytical tools to
approach these issues and creates a theoretical basis for solving a large
variety of equations of this type. The research will potentially have impact on
the areas of computational and applied mathematics where the hyperbolic systems
are involved. Results of this research will be disseminated through
presentations at national and international conferences, seminars and
publications in scientific journals. Graduate student projects will be
integrated into this research.
