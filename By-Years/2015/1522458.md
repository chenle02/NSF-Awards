This project exploits an early concept of a flexible, low-cost, and drone-
carried broadband long-distance communication infrastructure and investigates
its capability for immediate smart-city application in emergency response. This
effort is to support the Smart Emergency Response System (SERS) cluster to
participate in the Global City Teams Challenge. This project will have an
immediate impact in firefighting and other smart-city emergency response
applications by quickly deploying a broadband communication infrastructure, thus
improving the efficiency of first responders and saving lives. This
communication infrastructure expands the capability of individual drones and
enables broad new multi-drone applications for smart cities and has the
potential to create new businesses and job markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
interdisciplinary project addresses the following technology issues: 1)
development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) technology that enables robust long-
range drone-to-drone communication infrastructure; 2) practical drone system
design and performance evaluation for WiFi provision; and 3) a systematic
investigation of its capability to address smart-city emergency response needs,
through both analysis and participation in fire-fighting exercises, as a case
study. The project team includes an academic institution, technology companies
and government planners, each of whom provides complementary expertise and
perspectives that are crucial to the success of the project. The project also
provides exciting interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and the
community to learn CPS technologies and the Global City Teams Challenge efforts.
