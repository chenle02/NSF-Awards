This product of this project is a reference grammar of Ndjuka, a creole
language of Suriname. It involves nine months of fieldwork with native speakers
during which time their spontaneous language use will be observed and informants
will also be asked to produce sentences and to make grammaticality judgements
about sentences presented to them. A period for writing the grammar will follow
the fieldwork. Ndjuka is a "radical creole," one whose structure differs
markedly from the languages that contributed much of its basic vocabulary. For
this reason it is potentially a major source of evidence for what the innate
human language facility is like. The reference grammar of Ndjuka will facilitate
the testing of linguistic hypotheses not only about Ndjuka and its neighbors but
about languages in general and about the process of creolization.
