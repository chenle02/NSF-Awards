The proposed work focuses on development of modular adaptable software for
vision-based human-computer interaction. The key idea is to use local visual
interaction cues on a video stream - mono or stereo, 2D or 3D - shared between
the user and computer. The use of such cues has a number of advantages, such as
limiting the processing to only those parts of the image where interaction takes
place, allowing image processing to be dynamically driven by the interaction,
and an easily parameterized modular basis for software development. Questions of
how visual interaction cues can be flexibly defined and robustly detected based
on local informaiton will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
