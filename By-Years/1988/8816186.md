This grant funded by the Organic Dynamics Program in Chemistry provides support
for the research of Prof. William Doering at Harvard University. The broad
objective of the research is the formulation of mechanistic generalizations by
deduction from experiment in the area of thermally induced reactions. His
research will complement that of many theoretical and applied quantum chemists
as well as kineticists. Specifically, his work on energy flow within molecules
will address the question whether intramolecular energy randomization is
competitive with the rate of a chemical reaction and whether the concept of
mode-specific reaction is capable of being reduced to practice. Two projects
will test for the previously unrecognized structural factors in the
thermochemistry of polyenes and cyclobutanes. Such studies may have some
implications to the anticarcinogenicity of beta-carotene. Finally, a new
hypothesis on the role of solvation on rates of thermal cis-trans isomerism of
polyenes will be tested and, if validated, will mark a significant advance in
understanding medium effects.
