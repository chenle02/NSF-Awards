EAR-0447154&lt;br/&gt;Samson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds for
a major upgrade of a JEOL 6300 Scanning Electron Microscope that was donated to
the Department of Earth Sciences at Syracuse University by Chevron-Texaco. The
instrument is equipped with an energy-dispersive detector (EDS) and three wave-
length dispersive detectors (WDS) containing a total of six crystals. The
upgrade will include (1) complete modern automation of the WDS system and
associated data reduction and analysis, which will make the instrument
essentially an electron microprobe and allow us to do a wide range of in situ
microbeam X-ray analysis; (2) a new Digital Imaging System that will include
direct beam control for fast back-scattered electron (BSE) and secondary
electron (SE) imaging at 400 x 400 resolution and allow X-ray dot mapping with
up to 16 channels, allowing us to make detailed, high-resolution X-ray maps of
the elemental compositions of metamorphic minerals, such as garnet, or element
zoning as indicators of different age domains in minerals such as monazite; (3)
a new EDS System for X-Ray spectral identification of the elemental compositions
of minerals that are imaged; and (4) cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, that has
become virtually routine in modern U-Pb geochronology laboratories in showing
the internal complexities of zircon, such as zoning, core-overgrowth
relationships, resorption, and a variety of other internal features. The
requested upgrade will provide the Department of Earth Sciences with a truly
modern analytical facility which will be made available to our students, those
of other departments on our campus, and those of smaller institutions in Central
New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
