This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of applying advanced nonlinear fringe tracking algorithms to enable
astronomers to track dimmer stars. Ground based stellar optical interferometers
are limited in the amount of sky coverage achievable by the lack of stars bright
enough to serve as guide stars. This problem cannot be solved by Adaptive Optics
(AO) means alone. The fringe tracking subsystem has been identified as the
performance limiting subsystem for optical interferometric arrays. State-of-the-
art data processing algorithms utilized for fringe tracking functions use linear
correlation filters and make limited use of atmospheric turbulence information.
This situation presents an opportunity for advanced fringe tracking algorithms
that make use of all the available statistical information and can naturally
handle the measurement nonlinearities. The proposed algorithms have the
additional advantage of being complementary to AO systems. The goal of the Phase
I effort is to establish the possibility of coherent tracking with reduced
signal-to-noise requirements through the use of advanced algorithms, and thus to
enable the observation of dimmer (by about one bolometric magnitude) target
stars. The resulting software product would be invaluable for current and
planned interferometric arrays world-wide, both military and scientific. This
technology would also be of use to optics manufacturing houses with a need for
interferometric metrology testing of precision surfaces for large optical
components.
