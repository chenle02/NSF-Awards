Due to the large amount of data and numerical calculations necessary for both
prognostic and diagnostic studies of the atmosphere, meteorologist have always
been at the forefront in the use of computer technology. Recently, microcomputer
workstations have proven to be especially valuable tools for analysis and
display of meteorological data and results from numerical models. For example,
it has been demonstrated that use of an interactive workstation can decrease the
time needed for editing of Doppler radar data by at least a factor of four. The
Principal Investigators will purchase and install a microcomputer for purposes
such as analysis and editing of Doppler and multiparameter radar data; analysis
of data from an advanced hydrometeor imaging probe; analysis and interpretation
of numerical model output. Software for most of these functions has already been
developed at other locations and can easily be ported to the new machine. These
activities will be used to directly support ongoing NSF sponsored research.
Additionally, the workstation will be used for a variety of educational
endeavors.//
