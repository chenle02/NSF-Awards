9317263 Knott This award provides one-half the funding required to construct a
system for chemical extraction of oxygen from silicate rocks and minerals. The
extraction line will be constructed and operated by the Principal Investigator
in the Department of Geological Sciences at the California State University-
Fullerton. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed
for the project. Oxygen extraction must be performed prior to determining the
ratio of oxygen isotopes in the samples, a task to be performed in the stable
isotope laboratory of neighboring California Institute of Technology. Analysis
of the oxygen isotopic signature is a critical step in the research projects of
the Principal Investigator on the origin of igneous rocks. The inclusion of
undergraduate students in research projects using this extraction line will
enhance the undergraduate experience at Cal State- Fullerton. ***
