9632665 Draayer LaSER, Louisiana's EPSCoR Committee, will build a compressed
audio/video (A/V) communication network to enhance the state's research
competitiveness. The proposed network will interconnect eight institutions of
higher education and the Board of Regents. Specifically, LaSER will establish
A/V centers at institutions which provide leadership for its EPSCoR research
clusters and centers. The A/V centers will allow researchers to overcome the
geographical separation that acts as a fundamental barrier to inter-
institutional research collaborations by giving EPSCoR researchers tools for
participating in inter-institutional sharing/strategy sessions; and (2) serve as
a prototype for an expanded next-generation, statewide research network.
