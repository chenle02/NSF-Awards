9707652 Brown This is a promising new investigator in the field of biomaterials
and tissue engineering. She has great potential to become a fine scientist.
Funding of this proposal is expected to advance the PI's career and meet the
goals of this program. The proposed research investigates novel polymers that
swell and collapse in response to electrical stimuli. These materials may be
useful for modulated drug delivery. The PI has already constructed a prototype
of the electrorelease chamber used in these studies and has an appropriate
background to conduct the proposed studies. In addition to potential drug
delivery applications, the proposed technology may be useful for in vitro
evaluation of cellular responses to various substances. As technical notes, LDH
is a crude measure of cytotoxicity and biocompatibility, as it detects rupture
of cell membranes. Changes in insulin production, cell metabolism, etc. will be
observed long before membrane rupture. Inclusion of a diagram of the
electrorelease chamber would have been helpful, in that the photograph provided
was not very clear. ***
