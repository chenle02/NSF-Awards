This project supports a conference on Experimental Interdisciplinary, and
Computational Windows on the Core Concepts of the Origin of Life to be held
November 9-13, 2015 at Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington DC. The
relatively small size of the meeting (approximately 100 participants) combined
with the proposed 30 scientific talks and poster sessions should ensure that the
core aim of the meeting to bring together representatives from diverse
scientific disciplines to exchange ideas and approaches to the origins of life
should be met. An effort has been made to broaden participation to young
scientists including females and minorities. A public lecture by one speaker
will be offered as part of the Carnegie public lecture series.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference delegates will discuss narratives focused
around five integrative themes that explore the concrete and abstract dimensions
of origins, the connections to planetary context and biological evolution and
ecology, the roles of modeling and computation, and the relation of biological
theory to fundamental principles governing order in physics, chemistry,
mathematics, and engineering.
