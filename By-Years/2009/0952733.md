Evolving software is no simple task: somehow, amongst innumerable bug reports,
feature requests, and project plans, software teams must decide which of issues
deserve the team's limited time and resources. To make these decisions, most
teams engage in bug triage, comparing subjective estimates of the frequency and
severity of issues.

This research seeks to replace these subjective estimates with large-scale data
on software use. To achieve this, the research explores a tools that detect
software issues through peoples' normal use of help tools. The use of these
tools will capture a wide range of software issues in a consistent, structured
form, enabling several forms of aggregation and analysis. Unlike voluntary
feedback, these tools will be part of users' normal work, increasing the
representativeness of frequency and severity estimates, while also capturing new
kinds of issues such as non-fatal errors and a wide range of usability problems.
Evaluation includes deployment to real software development teams and controlled
experiments of the efficacy of the resulting tools. The broader impacts of the
work are ultimately to enable software teams to evolve software in a way that
best meets the needs of its users.
