Southeast Asia harbors the greatest diversity of higher primates (monkeys and
apes) in the old world. Despite this diversity, and a long history of its study,
there is little agreement on the number of species and genera that exist and how
they are related to one another. The need to establish a basic consensus on
these issues is extremely important to the study of our own evolution and vital
to the conservation management of these unique Asian primates. The primary goals
of this project are to: (1) use a comprehensive set of molecular data to
reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among Asia's macaque monkeys, leaf
monkeys, and gibbon apes; (2) reconstruct the evolutionary histories of these
three groups of higher primates by simultaneously considering their respective
evolutionary relationships, their current geographical distributions, and what
we know of the geological processes, climate and ecology of the regions in which
this great diversification took place at the time it was occurring; and (3)
define the appropriate taxonomic units and geographical regions for the
conservation of the species that each group contains. The successful completion
of this project will add significantly to our understanding of mammalian
evolution and to the conservation of primate biodiversity.
