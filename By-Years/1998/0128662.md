This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on
development of unique ceramic/polyimide nanocomposite materials. It will
demonstrate the ability to formulate a polyimide (or other polymer material)
with a designed coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) through the covalent
incorporation of ceramic nanophase materials. The key tasks involve (1) sol-gel
synthesis of ceramic nanospheres possessing a negative CTE (2) covalently
bonding them into the backbone of the polyimide through the use of bi-functional
linker molecules and (3) evaluation of various doping levels of the ceramic
nanospheres to determine optimum impact on the CTE of the composite material. In
terms of commercial uses, polyimides have wide application as films in the
electronics, aerospace, and manufacturing industries where they are used for
flexible circuitry, insulation materials, speaker cones, automotive switches,
disk drives, and in many other applications. A common problem in the design of
these systems using polyimides is the inherently high CTE of these materials and
to a certain extent poor thermal dimensional stability. The proposed effort
seeks to provide an approach to resolve these issues.
