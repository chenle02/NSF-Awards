With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Ned Porter, of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University, is studying
the mechanism of peroxidation reactions of organic compounds and the chemistry
of organic peroxides. New methods for the analysis of peroxides (silver
coordination ion spray mass spectrometry coupled to HPLC), coupled with parallel
computational analyses, have led to the investigation of dioxiranes,
energetically accessible from peroxy acids and their conjugate bases. A new
class of compounds, pyri(mi)dinols, will be prepared and studied for their
antioxidant properties. New azo compounds that serve as radical initiators will
permit the evaluation of these compounds as antioxidants in human low density
liposomes. Theory and experiment will together be used to target the development
of compounds which will convert a lipid soluble peroxyl radical into a water
soluble superoxide radical, thereby acting as agents for the "export" of a free
radical chain from an organic lipophilic aggregate into
water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many organic compounds react with molecular oxygen
to give peroxide products, a process that has both commercial importance and
relevance to human health. Professor Ned Porter, of the Department of Chemistry
at Vanderbilt University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program for his study of the mechanism of the chemistry of this
process, called autoxidation or peroxidation, and the chemistry of peroxide
compounds. His studies also address the inhibition of autoxidation and the study
of new antioxidants. Through a combination of calculational and experimental
studies, Professor Porter is developing new compounds of potential activity as
antioxidants and as agents for the transferral of oxidant activity from the cell
membrane, where it causes cellular damage, to water, where the activity may be
discharged without causing damage.
