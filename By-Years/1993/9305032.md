Funding is requested to conduct synthetic fluid inclusion studies of geochemical
processes applicable to ore-forming environments. Synthetic fluid inclusions
will be used to determine PVTX properties of fluids in the H2O-NaCl-KCl system
to 10 kbars and 1000oC. The product of this study will be a computer program and
graphics describing the PVTX properties of H2O-NaCl-KCl that can be used to
interpret micro thermometric data obtained from natural inclusions. A second
study will investigate the implications of hydrogen gain/loss by natural fluid
inclusions. Synthetic fluid inclusions will be made at known fO2 conditions and
then re- equilibrated at known but variable fO2 conditions in order to quantify
the rate of hydrogen fucacity change as a function of temperature, fugacity
gradient and depth below the mineral surface. This information will then be used
to plan experiments to determine the effect of hydrogen gain/loss on (1)
speciation of inclusion fluids and possible post-trapping changes, (2) the
Hydrogen (D/H) isotopic composition of inclusion waters and (3) the solubility
of various daughter minerals that are commonly observed in natural fluid
inclusions. These data may then be used to estimate post-entrapment histories
(uplift paths) experienced by natural fluid inclusions.
