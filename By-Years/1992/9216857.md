An investigation of catalysis of homogeneous photochemical reactions and
mechanisms of nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution reactions will be
conducted. By the determination of Bronsted Catalysis Law plots, evidence for
electron hole transfer catalysis involving hydroxide ion will be obtained. In
addition, the structural requirements which govern instances where base
catalysis competes with quenching will be defined. The identity of intermediate
structures involved in intramolecular photodisplacement of hydrogen on an
aromatic ring will be determined, and for the first time the "element effect" on
nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution will be elucidated. %%% This grant from
the Organic Dynamics Program will suport research on photoinduced nucleophilic
aromatic substitution in the laboratoty of Professor G. G. Wubbels at Washington
College. The focus of the research will be to explore the nature of Bronsted
Catalysis plots and thereby provide definitive evidence for electron hole
catalysis involving hydroxide ion. Elucidation of the structural parameters
which govern such processes will lead to the development of more efficient
methods for generating substituted aromatic compounds.
