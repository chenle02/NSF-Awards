The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that
will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what
we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning
CAP projects build capacity for research and development in the field of
cyberlearning by improving technical infrastructure, human capital, and in other
ways. The International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies provides a
forum for interchange of ideas around designing technological support for
learning and training. This project supports an Early Career Symposium at the
conference which allows early career scholars to receive mentoring from
established cyberlearning researchers from both computer science and learning
research.

This project supports travel for advanced graduate students and new faculty from
U.S. universities to attend the Early Career Symposium at the ICALT 2016
conference in Austin, Texas. Sessions during the Symposium are designed to help
collaborators imagine forward-looking and viable technology-oriented research
agendas, identify the types of collaborators who complement their strengths, and
identify the funding agencies and programs that might support their work. An
important goal of the Symposium is to add to the community of researchers
interested in ways that technology can transform teaching and learning.
