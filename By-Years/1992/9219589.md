9219589 Wong Fluid exerts significant mechanical and chemical effects on
virtually all crustal processes. Recent observations suggest that elevated pore
pressures may exist in a range of crustal environments, including mature fault
zones and accretionary complexes. Quantitative modeling of the generation and
maintenance of overpressure in most of these problems requires a fundamental
understanding of the relation among permeability, porosity and stress. This is
an experimental program to determine permeability and porosity reduction in
porous aggregates under triaxial compression conditions. Microstructural
observations, acoustic emission measurements, micromechanical and percolation
modeling will be integrated in the study so as to gain a fundamental physical
understanding of mechanical compaction, permeability reduction, cataclastic flow
and hydraulic transport in the crust. ***
