Albers 9514802 Odors are one of the most common forms of social communication
among individuals of many species. These odors are effective mechanisms to
communicate information regarding dominance status and mate choice. Recent
studies have revealed that the peptide neurotransmitter, vasopressin, in the
medial preoptic-anterior hypothalamic region of the brain is involved in odor-
induced communication. Dr. Albers research is characterizing the brain circuitry
involved in gonadal hormone-dependent odorant communication and is elucidating
the role of glutamate as an additional neurochemical substrate underlying this
behavior. These investigations are providing new information about the basic
principles regulating neural and hormonal interactions to govern complex
mammalian behaviors. In addition, information regarding the mechanisms of mate
choice and reproductive success in the laboratory or the wild will be gained
from these studies.
