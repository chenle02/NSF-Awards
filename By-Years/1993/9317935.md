9317935 Callahan The ocean technologies have significant economic and scientific
impact on our nation. A planning grant to the University of Rhode Island
(EEC-9222523) has helped generate sufficient industrial support to meet the
criteria required to form an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Ocean Technologies. The Center's research agenda will focus on environmental
monitoring systems, equipment testing and acoustics and ocean mapping. The
Principal Investigator and colleagues are internationally recognized scientists
who have the resources and capability to run this Center. This Center has been
coordinated with Norman Caplan, Program Manager, Ocean Engineering Systems,
Division of Biological and Critical Systems at NSF. Additional funding is
provided by the U.S. Department of Navy to augment ongoing research and to
obtain a membership in the Center. The Program Manager recommends the University
of Rhode Island be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing
award. An additional $25,000 is recommended for one year with funds provided by
the U.S. Department of Navy. Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program
Manager and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers
Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria
requirements, including the following: 1) the extent to which the
university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the
support base is developing and 3) the extent to which a robust research program
is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend
support for the next period of this continuing award.
