The velocity fields of extended optical emission line regions can be mapped with
a facility that now exists in Hawaii. An imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer is
available for use in conjunction with CCD detectors. A sophisticated data
reduction and analysis system has been implemented to handle the substantial
data- processing requirements. The emphasis of the current program has been on
mapping the extended regions with anomalous velocities around active nuclei in
nearby galaxies. The high photometric quality of the detectors, the special
capabilities provided by the high-finesse, large free-spectral-range etalon, and
the possibilities for high spatial resolution at Mauna Kea are all advantages
that have been exploited to obtain information of exceptional quality on regions
about active nuclei. The amelioration of certain marginal aspect of the optical-
mechanical system of the existing, to span the optical and near- infrared
spectrum, and a more powerful data reduction capability will be implemented the
development of the extension of the capability.
