In systems wherein information is represented and processed digitally, the level
of overall system performance that can be achieved is often limited by the speed
and dynamic range of the interfaces between analog and digital representations
of that information. Since digitally encoded signals can be processed with
virtually arbitrary precision, continued progress in the scaling of integrated
circuit technology is accomplished by corresponding demand to improve the
precision and speed of so-called data conversion interfaces. This pressure is,
in turn, accompanied by two constraining factors: the desire to embed data
conversion interfaces within large digital signal processing circuits and
explosive growth in the demand for portable electronic systems. The integration
of data conversion circuits in VLSI technologies imposes severe constraints on
the dynamic range available to implement those circuits, while the concern for
battery life in portable systems often dictates substantial reductions in power
dissipation in comparison to traditional applications. The principal objective
of this research is to discover circuit design techniques for digitizing signals
with bandwidths of several MHz using standard digital CMOS technologies. The
research focuses on the use of oversampling methods to encode MHz-bandwidth
radio signals centered at IF frequencies in the range of a few tens of MHz and
on methods of increasing the resolution of Nyquist-rate converters for
digitizing baseband signals with bandwidths on the order of 10 MHz. A
complementary theme of the research is operation from a low supply voltage with
minimum power dissipation.
