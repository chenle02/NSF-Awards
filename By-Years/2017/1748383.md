This award supports the conduct of an National Science Foundation Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) Program Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will
be held in Charlotte, North Carolina, March 26-27, 2018. It is expected that
there will be about 250 attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day
format including a training session on good proposal writing practices, talks by
previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review
session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on
project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also
have an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and
in mock panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare young
faculty for careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good
proposal writing and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER
proposals. The results of the workshop include training for young faculty,
better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on women and minority
faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees, and ultimately better
research resulting from better written proposals.
