This project os an exploratory study designed to obtain data on the performance
on problem solving oriented tasks by four groups of ethnolinguistic students:
nonelingual English Speakers, bilingual English-Spanish speakers, bilingual
English Haiian Creole Speakers and Afro American Black English speakers. The
research will observe, describe, and compare students linguistic performance,
use of cognitive strategies, and demonstration of science knowledge. This will
lead to further research and development, all of which will advance knowledge in
anthropology and cognition, and relate this advancement to the improvement of
science instruction for limited English proficient students.
