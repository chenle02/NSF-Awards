This proposal presents a novel idea to integrate conventional finite element
methods with neural networks to achieve a fast, time- saving, and highly
accurate computational scheme for dynamic analysis of complex structures. A one-
year proof-of-concept study will be conducted. By presenting a network with
different complicated structures, a computational system will be developed which
combines a finite element program and a neural net that can handle structures
with a stiffness matrix up to 500 x 500 under static or dynamic loading. The
above model, if proven successful, has a potential to revolutionize many
concepts in structural/earthquake engineering. Different neural net modules -
each of which is trained to perform certain tasks such as analysis, design, code
provisions, etc. - may be developed, and these modules will be more reliable
than and can out perform human engineers.
