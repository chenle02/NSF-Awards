Abstract for DMS - 0104331

This project involves analytic aspects of the theory of pseudo-holomorphic
curves. The aim is to develop effective methods for computing Gromov-Witten
invariants of symplectic manifolds and enumerative invariants of algebraic
manifolds. This work builds on the P.I.'s recent work with E. Ionel on the
`sympletic sum formula' for GW invariants. The first project involves extending
the sum formula to the `modified GW invariants' recently defined by the P.I.'s
student Junho Lee. This would make the formula applicable to K\"ahler surfaces
with $p_g>0$ where there are important conjectures that are not currently
approachable by GW methods. The second project is a symplectic approach to
understanding physicists' predictions about the generating functions which count
curves in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The goal is to prove the predicted formulas by
adapting some analytic methods C. Taubes developed to relate the Seiberg-Witten
and Gromov invariants. The last two projects also relate to the sympletic sum
formula. One seeks formulas expressing the relative Gromov-Witten invariants of
a pair $(X,V)$ in terms of the usual GW invariants and the descendant classes of
$X$ and $V$. The other proposes extending the sum formula to a more general type
of symplectic sum which occurs in algebraic geometry when one considers
projective linear systems.

One of the most basic problems in mathematics is to determine the solutions of
a system of polynomial equations, and an important first step toward that goal
is to determine the NUMBER of solutions. There is an explicit formula for the
number of simultaneous solutions of a set of n polynomials in n variables. One
can then ask for the number of solutions for n polynomials in n-1 variables. In
this case there is a free parameter, so the locus of solutions will be a union
of curves. How many? This question has been systematically studied for 100
years, but only a few special cases were solved. Then, around 1990, it was
realized that these problems can be translated into symplectic geometry, and
then tackeled using the powerful machinery of mathematical gauge theory. (Gauge
theory, originally part of physics, has been the focus of many very fruitful
interactions between mathematicians and physicists over the past twenty years;
it includes Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten theory, and String theory). This
`Gromov-Witten invariant' approach led quickly to formulas answering some of the
original enumerative problems, and there are clear indications that there are
more to be discovered. This project is aimed toward further developing the
symplectic gauge theory in order to produce additional general formulas and to
meld these formulas into a coherent theory.
