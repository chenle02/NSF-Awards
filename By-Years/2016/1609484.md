Many recent problems in control, communication, computation, and machine
learning can be posed in the framework of network optimization. Despite the
great number of algorithms that have been proposed to address modern large-scale
problems there remains a crucial challenge of building computationally
efficient, accurate, scalable, distributed procedures. A key issue is that of
understanding locality. Locality is a structural property of optimization
instances that captures the property that information need not propagate across
the entire network but only across local portions of it. As a consequence
decisions made at a node can be made based only on local information thus
reducing both communication requirements and computational complexity. This
research involves identifying when locality occurs, designing algorithms that
take advantage of locality, and applying these algorithms to variety of
applications. The project also provides an opportunity for training graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers in the disciplines of optimization,
networking, and control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically sensitivity results
concern the objective function evaluated at the optimal solution not the optimal
solution itself. Herein sensitivity is characterized by the change in the
optimal solution at a given node given a change in a network parameter at
another node. Locality holds when the sensitivity decays with the distance
between the two nodes. The main objectives of this research project are: (1)
Theoretical Analysis: developing a general theory to characterize the local
sensitivity of optimal solutions in a variety of network optimization problems
and developing analytic tools to quantify the rate at which sensitivity decays
with distance; (2) Algorithm Development: developing computationally efficient
local message-passing algorithms to solve a variety of network optimization
problems; and (3) Applications: applying these algorithms to problems in network
optimization, distributed computation, and cooperative control.
