The utilization of ion implantation to do in-site doping of GaAs/A1GaAs
heterojunction structures in an MBE system is studied. This research will
provide a basis for developments in a broad range of III-V material electronic
devices for use in optoelectronics, high speed IC's, microwave circuit
components, and monolithic structures.
