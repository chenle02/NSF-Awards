This international planning grant will support travel to Brazil by Dr. Andrew
Elmore, Dr. Joel Burken, Dr. Julie Gallaway, and Dr. James Martin from the
University of Missouri-Rolla to work with a team of Brazilians from the
Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) including Jose
Araruna, and Roberto Carvalho. The goal of this planning visit is the
development of multidisciplinary research and education program related to
sustainable water supplies for rural households in Amazonia Brazil. The
immediate outcome will be the development of proposals to fund the international
water research associated with developing a strategy for implementing point of
use (POU) drinking water treatment systems at the individual household and
community levels in Brazilian Amazonia.
