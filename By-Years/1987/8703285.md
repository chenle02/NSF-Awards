Laser vaporization studies have demonstrated the stability of a family of even-
numbered carbon clusters ranging in size from about 38 to 150 atoms. It has been
suggested that C60, the most prominent member of this family, has a hollow
structure similar in shape and structure to a soccerball. MNDO calculations have
confirmed the vibrational stability of this structure and have shown it to be
energetically stable relative to silmilarly sized graphite chips and other
competing structures. Additional MNDO calculations have indicated stability for
spheroidal C40, C50, and C70 clusters. This project involves a systematic search
for stable spheroidal structures for the remaining even-numbered carbon
clusters. The MNDO caculations will be preceded by graph theoretical analysis to
see which ring combinations are topologically possible, and by Huckel
calculations to see which are likely to have closed shell electronic structures.
Hollow carbon clusters of the type described above may play a role in the
formation of soot and the transportation of other molecules in interstellar
space, and may lead to novel lubricants. A fundamental understanding of these
structures is needed and is addressed by this project. Moreover, the project
will also benefit the infrastructure of U.S. science by providing exposure of
talented undergraduates to advanced computing techniques and equipment.
