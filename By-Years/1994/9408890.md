IBN-9408890 Robert Handa A basic response of animals to stress in their
environment is the rapid activation of the stress-responsive neuroendocrine
systems. One such response is the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis. Sex differences exist in the response of the HPA axis to
stress with males responding less robustly than females. In both sexes, one
consequence of HPA activation is an inhibition of reproductive function. These
investigators have hypothesized that in males the reproductive hormone,
testosterone, inhibits the HPA axis to suppress the deleterious effects that
secretory products of the HPA axis have on reproduction. One mechanism by which
testosterone inhibits HPA activity is by binding to androgen receptors in the
brain. This research supported by this award will characterize the effects of
androgen on stress-inducible indicators of cell activity in the brain, determine
the sites within the brain where androgen acts to influence HPA activity, and to
determine if androgen can act by modulating glucocorticoid receptor function.
The results of these studies will define the mechanisms whereby androgen can act
to inhibit neuroendocrine responses to stress and help us understand the effects
of stress on reproductive function in both males and females.
