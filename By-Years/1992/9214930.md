This award is for the development of a Computer Productivity Initiative (CPI)
that is designed to improve computer science education by developing a formal
laboratory experience spanning the four year undergraduate program. CPI will
allow the students to address a specific industrial problem from the
specifications phase through to the implementation phase. Old Dominion
University will be producing curriculum support modules, and other educational
material which will be made available to educational institutions. Old Dominion
University will be using a Computer Productivity Initiative to modify its
Computer Science curriculum to provide its students with the knowledge to
increase their productivity in software development. Over the four year time
period of undergraduate study, computer science students will address a specific
unstructured problem in the context of a business application. Existing courses
and laboratories at Old Dominion University will be modified and new ones
developed. The results of the curriculum and materials development will be made
available to other educational institutions, and results of the educational
experience will be disseminated in technical and educational journals, and at
presentations at professional meetings.
