The Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) will have archived over a
terabyte of heterogeneous image data by the end of this year. Other LTER sites
are similarly amassing large, complicated data sets. Ecologists want to
transform this raw data into useful information to provide new insight into long
- term ecological phenomena. Unfortunately, the procedures, software tools, and
user friendly interfaces necessary to facilitate access to these data sets over
high-speed networks are currently lacking. This precludes analysis on
supercomputers at national centers and subsequent visualization by ecologists
located at remote sites. The specific objective of the research will be to
develop software that not only enables but encourages LTER ecologists to more
fully utilize multi-resolution, multi-spectral, time- varying, multi-dimensional
data from Sevilleta. The solutions developed will be driven by the particular
needs of the Sevilleta ecologists and will be applicable to other LTER sites.
This does not preclude the design of more generic components, with a broader
scope of application. The goal of the collaboration among the Khoros Project at
the University of New Mexico, the Sevilleta LTER site, and San Diego
Supercomputer Center is implementation of a prototype system whereby researchers
can access, analyze, and visualize Sevilleta data from remote locations.
