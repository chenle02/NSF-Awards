The main topic of this research is optimization and control of discrete event
stochastic systems. On the optimization side, the focus is on developing
stochastic approximation and stochastic optimization methods. Since the major
difficulty in optimizing a discrete event system often has to do with its
combinatorial nature, tools in combinatorial optimization (e.g. matroid and
polymatroid theories) will be incorporated into the stochastic optimization of
such systems. On the control side, the focus will be on the intensity control of
point processes (which drive the dynamics of a queuing network, for instance).
Stochastic non-linear filtering problems will also be addressed in the setting
of point process driven systems. Applications of the theory and methodologies
developed from this research will be in two areas: multi- media communication
networks and computer integrated manufacturing systems. This is a Presidential
Young Investigator Award to carry out research into optimization and control of
discrete event stochastic systems. These systems models arise in analyzing and
designing many important engineering precesses such as multi-media communication
networks and computer integrated manufacturing plants. It is expected that the
results of this research will yield better understanding of these models and
better means of controlling such systems.
