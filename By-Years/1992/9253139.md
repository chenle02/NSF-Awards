This award will provide partial support for the 24th International Chemistry
Olympiad (IChO) to be held in the United States, July 11-22, 1992. The IChO
originated in 1968 with participants from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary;
the United States first sent a team in 1984. This is the first time the Olympiad
has been hosted by the United States. The competition brings together the
world's top high school-age chemistry students. Students take a five-hour
theoretical examination and a five-hour laboratory practical examination.
Between test days, and while the exams are being graded, students have the
opportunity to tour the host country and interact with their peers from other
nations. Delegations consisting of four students and two adult mentors from each
of 35 countries have been invited to participate in the 12-day event which will
be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Other supporters of the
project are the American Chemical Society and the U.S. chemical industry.
