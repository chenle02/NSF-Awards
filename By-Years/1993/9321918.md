ABSTRACT -- CTS-9321918 Bejan The proposed research focuses on the determination
of the optimal on/off sequence for defrosting refrigerators, in an effort to
minimize the power requirement. The results will include the optimal time
intervals of continuous operation and defrosting, and the optimal way to divide
a fixed amount of heat exchanger area between the evaporator and the condenser.
It is also proposed to optimize the ice making process by optimally selecting
the on/off sequence of operation, i.e., the time intervals for freezing and ice
removal. Two manufacturing methods will be optimized, ice on tube and ice in
tube. The work will be performed analytically, numerically, and experimentally.
