Aschbacher and S. Smith recently completed the classification of the finite
simple quasithin groups. This work fills a significant gap in the classification
of the finite simple groups. Aschbacher and Smith are editing their manuscript
to make it ready for publication. Aschbacher is continuing his project to
produce a unified, accessible, and complete treatment of the existence,
uniqueness, and structure of the sporadic groups. He is writing up his work on
recognition theorems for small groups with one class of involutions. He is
working with R. Guralnick and K. Magaard on lower bounds on the genus of
coverings with a classical monodromy group. He is investigating the p-radical
subgroups of the sporadic groups.

Groups are algebraic objects of crucial importance in mathematics; for example
they are the basis for the study of symmetry. Finite groups can be decomposed
into building blocks know as ``simple groups"; the classification theorem lists
the simple groups explicitly. Together with descriptions of the structure and
representations of the simple groups, the classification theorem forms the
foundation for the modern theory of finite groups. Several years ago it was
discovered that an important case in the classification had not been completely
treated. Aschbacher and his collaborator S. Smith have now dealt with this case
and are readying their manuscript for publication, in order to place the
classification theorem on solid ground. The completion of this work, together
with efforts to answer certain questions about the structure and representations
of the simple groups, make up the project.
