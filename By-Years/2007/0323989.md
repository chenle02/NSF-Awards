The project is providing scholarships to academically qualified but financially
disadvantaged students in aeronautically oriented engineering technology majors
with emphasis on supporting students from underrepresented groups. Scholarships
are being provided to students in both two- and four-year technology degree
programs. The project involves active faculty-student mentoring and an
internship program with local industries to improve student retention and
graduation. Students attend a seminar series especially designed for the
scholarship recipients. All scholarship awardees also participate in a
culminating research project under the direction of their mentor. The results of
each project are presented to a panel of faculty members. As they approach
graduation, students are provided with employment placement assistance, a
service that is considered lifelong.
