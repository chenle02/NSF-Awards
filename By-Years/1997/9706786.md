9706786 Kress The proposed project is designed to explore and calibrate the
thermochemistry of sulfide liquids in the system O-S-Fe-Ni-Cu. Equilibrium
experiments will be performed at one atmosphere pressure to calibrate a
thermodynamic mixing model for liquids in the system. The investigators then
propose to explore the compositional and thermal dependence of molar volume
using the double-bob Archimedean method. Liquid compressibilities will be
determined in a variety of sulfide liquids using the technique of ultrasonic
interferometry. The resultant model for the sulfide liquid phase will be
combined with data from the literature to calibrate a self-consistent model,
which will then be incorporated into the melts crystallization code. The
ultimate goal is to derive a model which describes the major element chemistry
and saturation conditions for sulfide liquids in the full diversity of igneous
environments.
