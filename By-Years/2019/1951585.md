This project examines international investments in the retail sector and its
impact on urbanization. It will provide insight into how and why global retail
capital is transforming cities of the early 21st century, and will develop
effective strategies to build more sustainable, safe, and secure urban
environments. The project will bridge research in economic and development
geography with other fields such as real estate economics by engaging minority
scholars currently underrepresented in STEM disciplines in collaborative
training, mentorship, research, and dissemination. It will promote partnerships
between colleges and universities and industry and promote sustainable urban
economic growth that improves socio-economic well-being. It will also have a
positive broader impact on retailers and financial investment entities to
improve economic competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the
following research objectives: 1) to understand the location and interaction of
global retail investment, 2) to understand the transformations in global retail
investment and, 3) to understand and promote sustainable urban environments.
These objectives will be met using a mix methods approach that involves the
integration of archival data with participatory mapping techniques. The findings
will be presented in national conferences, journal publications, and an online
research website and mapping archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
