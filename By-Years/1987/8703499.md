Use of NMR Imaging for Research in Plant Physiology: The usefulness of nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established in medical diagnosis and
research. It should be equally useful in studying plant physiology especially
where it is desireable to monitor non-destructively the changes in water content
of living tissue over time. Improvements in resolution and definition now make
it possible to obtain good images at the microscopic as well as the macroscopic
level. Subjects to be investigated include: water movement from soil to roots;
efflux of water from roots to dry soil; effects of root shrinkage on water
absorption; radial movement of water in roots; water movements to leaves and
xylem changes in water during drying and rehydration. The proposal has the
potential of answering definitively many questions that have been only half
answered for several decades. The application of MRI has many potential
applications in crop science and in agricultural research. The knowledge
acquired, thereby, could easily lead to the development and screening of novel
hybrids.
