Tools for gathering soil moisture data (such as in situ soil sensors and
satellites) have differing capabilities. In situ soil moisture data has fine-
grained spatial and high temporal resolution, but is only available in limited
areas; satellite data is available globally, but is more coarse in resolution.
Existing software tools for studying the dynamic characteristics of soil
moisture data are limited in their ability to model soil moisture at multiple
spatial and temporal scales, and these limitations hamper scientistsâ€™ ability to
address urgent practical problems such as wildfire management and food and water
security. Accurate gathering and effective modeling of soil moisture data are
essential to address pressing environmental challenges. This interdisciplinary
project designs, builds, and shares a data-driven software ecosystem for soil
moisture applications. This software ecosystem models and predicts soil moisture
at scales suitable to support studies in forestry, precision agriculture, and
earth surface hydrology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project connects multi-
disciplinary advances across the scientific community (such as generating
datasets at scale and supporting cloud-based cyberinfrastructures) to develop a
data-driven software ecosystem for analyzing, visualizing, and extracting
knowledge from the growing data collections (from fine-grained, in situ soil
sensor information to coarse-grained, global satellite measurements) and
releasing this knowledge to applications in environmental sciences.
Specifically, this project (a) develops scalable methodologies to integrate and
analyze soil moisture data at multiple spatial and temporal scales; (b)
implements a data-driven software ecosystem to access complex information and
provide basic and applied knowledge to inform researchers and stakeholders
interested in soil moisture dynamics (scientists, educators, government
agencies, policy makers); and (c) builds cyberinfrastructures to support
discovery on cloud platforms, lowering resource barriers to improve
accessibility and interoperability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the
Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Hydrologic
Sciences Program, the Division of Earth Sciences, and the Division of
Integrative and Collaborative Education and Research within the NSF Directorate
for Geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
