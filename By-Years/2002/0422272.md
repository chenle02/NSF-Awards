Minneapolis Community and Technical College is awarding annually 28 scholarships
to financially needy, academically talented students who are pursing a course of
study in computer science, information technology, engineering, or mathematics.
The scholarship program is enabling students, who otherwise could not, to attend
college full-time. With a college enrollment of the traditionally
underrepresented minority groups reaching 46%, a significant number of whom are
Native Americans, the program is successfully bringing members of these groups
into STEM careers. A goal of the project is that 85% of the CSEMS scholars earn
an Associate's degree within two years. A variety of student support services
are being provided including academic and career planning, experiential learning
opportunities, counseling, financial aid advice and student life programs. Local
business and industry are providing summer internships for the students.
