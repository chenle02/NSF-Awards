This award supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist from
Southern Methodist University. The project is to study two Mayan Indian peasant
communities in Yucatan, Mexico to assess the impact of men's out-migration for
periods of wage labor on women's status in the communities. Using ethnographic
methods of participant observation and intensive interviews as well as a random
census of households in two villages, one with extensive male laborer out-
migration and the other with insignificant migration, the student will assess
the status of women and of households. This research is important because the
migratory movement of rural people in response to wage labor opportunities is a
major phenomenon in the developing world. this project will advance our
understanding of the effects of such migration on the households left behind,
and how the temporary increase in women's daily responsibilities to administer
their households in their husbands' absence translates (or does not translate)
into relatively significant changes in their social and economic status.
Women's' status has been shown to be a major factor affecting the welfare of
children, so increases in our understanding of the causes of women's status has
direct implications for households and families.
