Steroid hormones exert dynamic control over a wide variety of biological
functions in mammals. An important goal is to gain an understanding of the
mechanisms by which steroids, (e.g. estrogens, androgens, progestins) interact
with the nervous system to alter physiological and behavioral functions. It is
known that steroids can affect behavior by altering chemical communication
between brain cells. Indeed Dr. Dohanich reports that estrogen influences the
chemical signals produced by acetylcholine, a major muscarinic cholinergic
neurotransmitter. He has shown that estrogen activates specific behaviors in
females, in part, through the modulation of acetylcholine neurotransmission. Dr.
Dohanich plans to extend his initial findings by determining the effects of
cholinergic manipulations on a variety of steroid hormone regulated behaviors.
In addition, he will investigate the role that various muscarinic receptors
subtypes play in the regulation of these behaviors. Finally, Dr. Dohanich will
determine the changes in cellular receptors for acetylcholine following hormonal
manipulations that alter these specific behaviors. The results of this work will
enhance our understanding of the role of neurotransmission in the regulation of
mammalian behavior. This is important since the interplay between
neurotransmitters and steroid hormones is a fundamental mechanisms that
influences many functions in the central nervous system of mammals including
humans. Consequently, this research has important implications for understanding
the biological processes that underline steroid- dependent events ranging from
reproduction to human mood states.
