This project studies the theory and application of the singular Eigenfunction
technique for linear neutron transport in media with continuously varying
spatial properties. A unifying principle for a given spatial dependence is
sought. A periodic medium is studied to determine its practical importance in
the theory of homogenization of reactor cells. Efforts are extended to improve
the collocation-numerical-solution method for use in reactor analysis. New tasks
vary from improvements to standard approximate methods in diffusion theory to
detailed, highly accurate solutions of transport problems. The problem areas are
formulated to give significant engineering applications.
