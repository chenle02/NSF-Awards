Electronic interactions in metals can produce a rich variety of interesting
phenomena including superconductivity, magnetic order, heavy fermion behavior,
non-Fermi liquid behavior, Kondo effect, and valence fluctuations, many of which
are not well understood. Valuable information needed for developing an
understanding of the microscopic interactions that produce these phenomena can
be obtained from measurements of the properties of materials that exhibit these
phenomena at low temperatures. This award provides support for a dilution
refrigerator (DR) which will be used for measurements of low temperature
properties of strongly correlated electron systems. The DR system will provide a
base temperature of less than 10 milliKelvins with a cooling power of 250
microwatts at 100 milliKelvins, and a large amount of experimental access.
Several accessories will be added to the basic system, including resistance
thermometry for measuring the temperature of the sample mounted below the mixing
chamber, and a 9 tesla superconducting magnet system for measurement in high
magnetic fields. Studies in the milliKelvin range are especially important for
some materials with very low energy scales including heavy fermion
superconductors, low ordering temperature magnets, heavy fermion and Kondo
compounds, and those exhibiting time-dependent phenomena associated with quantum
tunneling. Very often, investigations to ever lower temperatures yield
unexpected behavior, revealing new lower energy scales associated with the many-
body ground state. These studies are of fundamental scientific interest and are
also of importance in the development of useful materials for industrial
applications.
