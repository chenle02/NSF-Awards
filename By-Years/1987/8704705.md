Polyploidy, the multiplication of all the chromosomes of an organism, and
therefore all the genes, occurs in many plant groups. Moreover, plant species
often contain substantial polyploid variation, so that neighboring individuals
may have widely different numbers of chromosomes. The function of this variation
(polymorphism) is unclear. Using an innovative application of biotechnology,
flow cytometry, this research tests one of the major explanations of polyploid
polymorphism: that multiple polyploids adapt plant populations to variation in
physical and biological stress. Focusing on the dominant and economically
important prairie grass, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), two crucial
experiments manipulate the physical (water availability) and biological
(grazing) stresses on plants of two ploidy levels in the well-defined
environments of common garden and greenhouse. Complementing the controlled
experimental results, a well-designed investigation surveys the distribution of
the different polyploid levels in native grasslands along an east-west transect.
Thus, experimental response to important naturally occurring stresses will be
related to new information on how native populations vary in chromosome number.
This project takes advantage of recent improvements in biotechnology to address
questions in population biology that have previously been technically difficult.
In relating polyploid polymorphism to environmental stress, this study provides
theoretical and practical insights. It contributes to understanding the
adaptations of native plants that allow them to prosper in harsh, unpredictable
environments, and provides knowledge of plant responses to stress that
facilitate management of forage and crop plants and can be incorporated into
improved plant breeding programs.
