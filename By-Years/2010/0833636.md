CAPSULE, a capstone project-based learning model, brings the STEM/IT workforce
experience to high school students and teachers through industry-driven projects
and multimedia production. Materials developed at the Museum of Science and
real-world problems solicited from local industry are formulated as projects to
be used in a hands-on capstone elective course or in after school activities so
that students can relate STEM concepts covered in the classroom to real world
applications and learn the engineering design process (EDP). As part of the
course, students visit companies to learn first hand about the day-to-day
activities of the STEM/IT workforce. They also produce their own media content
of their projects. Each year, thirty high school teachers engage in a two week
summer professional development workshop with follow-up during the year for a
total of 120 hours. Activities are developed for school administrators, guidance
counselors and parents to make them aware of the value and importance of STEM/IT
careers and opportunities. The project outcomes are (1) pedagogically proven
EDP-based curricula that can be replicated at the local, regional and national
levels; (2) teachers who connect STEM content to real-world applications; (3)
students who discover the real value of STEM subjects; and (4) a means to
address Massachusetts' capacity problem to teach engineering and technology in
schools. The evaluation plan focuses on the quality of professional development,
student learning, and perceptions of STEM careers. Partners include high
schools, local industry, Northeastern University engineering research centers
and the STEM Education Center, and Boston Museum of Science.
