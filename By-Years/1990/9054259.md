A three week workshop is being conducted in the area of polymer chemistry. The
course is designed for faculty who will be teaching undergraduate courses in
this area. The pedagogical approach aims to overcome much of the reluctance to
consider polymer chemistry as an important aspect of undergraduate training in
chemistry. The course is composed of lectures, lecture demonstrations, and
laboratory experiments. Ramifications of the course beyond preparing faculty to
comfortably and enthusiastically teach polymer chemistry include activities to
inspire faculty to consider supervising undergraduate research in polymer
chemistry and more frequent discussions of polymers in core courses such as
organic chemistry and physical chemistry.
