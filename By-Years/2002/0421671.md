&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centromeres are large chromosome
domains that organize and regulate chromosome&lt;br/&gt;movement. They contain
thousands of simple repeated sequences and hundreds of&lt;br/&gt;RNA-based
transposable elements, all of which are difficult to sequence and manipulate in
the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory. Despite these challenges, mammalian centromeric DNA
has been exploited to create&lt;br/&gt;'artificial chromosomes' that can carry
long segments of engineered DNA. Artificial chromosomes&lt;br/&gt;could also
have widespread applications in agriculture. For instance, entire
biochemical&lt;br/&gt;pathways or multiple disease resistances could be
introduced simultaneously. The experiments&lt;br/&gt;carried out under this
award will fill major gaps in our understanding of plant centromeres and
build&lt;br/&gt;the foundation for creating artificial chromosomes in maize and
rice. The resulting&lt;br/&gt;information will be distributed through online
resources and published articles that are readily available&lt;br/&gt;in the
public domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To expand training opportunities in plant
genetics, two new programs will be initiated.&lt;br/&gt;One will combine
existing on-campus minority involvement programs and establish a&lt;br/&gt;plant
biology genomics focus at the University of Georgia. Hands-on training in
plant&lt;br/&gt;cytogenetics will also be offered through an Annual Cytogenetics
Training Workshop (ACTW) at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin. The ACTW will
provide training in fluorescent in
situ&lt;br/&gt;hybridization,immunolocalization, chromatin immunoprecipitation,
and other advanced techniques&lt;br/&gt;necessary for chromosome-based research.
