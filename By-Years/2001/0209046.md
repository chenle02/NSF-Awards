Intrusion detection (ID) is an imperfect science. With state-of-the-art
techniques, simple attacks with unambiguous signatures can be detected fairly
easily, but trying to diagnose more complex attacks often results in a flurry of
false positives and undetected attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This situation
would be improved if ID systems could work together, so that the weaknesses of
one would be covered by the strengths of another. However, most of the recent
work in combining ID results has focused on the protocol and architecture of the
systems. Even a process as simple as corroboration--attempting to agree on a
single attack diagnosis--is not assured with only protocol and architecture.
Without an underlying body of theory, efforts to combine the results of multiple
ID systems&lt;br/&gt;will still fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LATTICE plan is
to define a consistent and comprehensive way to combine the results of multiple
ID systems. The research will employ a graph theory approach to representing the
conclusions of individual ID systems. Operators can be defined to combine the
graph representations of ID diagnoses in rigorous ways that can be comprehended
and analyzed. The results generated by these methods can be understood as the
conclusions of the multiple systems, taken as a whole. The outcome of this
approach is a rigorous unifying of the abilities and strengths of all the
involved ID systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
