The development of solid modeling as an industrially viable technology was
paced by the development, in the 1970's, of theory and algorithms for boolean
operations on solids, i.e. for converting constructive (CSG) representations
into boundary representations (B-reps). Theory and algorithms for the inverse
conversion, from boundary to CSG (called BCSG), were largely unknown prior to
the work of Shapiro and Vossler in 1989-91. Their cell-based methods are
mathematically sound and have been implemented experimentally, but several
important practical issues remain open. This research addresses those issues
through the following goals: (1) development of significantly better algorithms
for cell-based BCSG conversion; (2) development of a publicly available
implementation of BCSG, initially for a domain of natural quadric surfaces, that
is usable with one or more open architecture (i.e. public) B-rep modeling
systems; and (3) development of theory and techniques, using new algebraic-patch
and constructive-shell representations, to enable BCSG conversion to accommodate
freeform solids. This research will re-establish CSG as an industrially viable
representation for solids, and will enable fully symmetric dual- representation
modeling systems to be built which should be considerably more powerful than
today's B-rep-only systems.
