This project involves a theoretical and empirical study of the allocation of
operating licenses through a competitive market mechanism. Federal, state, and
local governments allocate many different kinds of permits that allow companies
to conduct business, e.g., broadcast licenses, airport takeoff and landing
slots, liquor licenses, and taxi medallions. Previous work has shown that
permitting free-market sale or resale of operating licenses, an approach gaining
popularity with regulators, often does not result in an efficient allocation of
licenses. The issue of whether the market produces an efficient allocation is a
question that can only be answered empirically. Microeconomic theory does not
provide a conclusive answer. The empirical part of this research will analyze
the market allocation of airport takeoff and landing slots and radio
broadcasting licenses. This research is important because it will shed light on
how best to regulate these two public-service industries.
