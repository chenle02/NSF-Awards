The focus of this research project is the measurement of electron excitation
cross sections out of excited levels of rare gases and alkali atoms. The
experiments will contribute to the basic understanding of the physics of atomic
processes and have numerous technological applications. For instance, such
collisions play a dominant role in understanding low temperature plasmas, and
low temperature plasmas are important for lighting, etching of semiconductor
chips and many other applications. Also on a broader impact, this activity will
result in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates, who
will also participate in undergraduate teaching. It is proposed to invite women
and minority scientists to visit the Physics Department and to meet with
researchers and graduate and undergraduate students for possible collaborations
and in order to act as role models and to provide encouragement.
