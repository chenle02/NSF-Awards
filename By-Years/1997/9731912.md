This award from the Chemistry Division will enable the Chemistry Department at
James Madison University to re-establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site for three summers. Ten students from regional small
colleges and universities participate in a 10-week experience coordinated by
Drs. Daniel M. Downey and Gina M. MacDonald. In addition to research in
analytical, nuclear, organic, biochemistry and physical chemistry, the program
includes instrumental analysis and molecular characterization seminars and
symposia, external speakers from government and industry, and field trips. A
unique aspect of the site is the inclusion of faculty members from regional
schools who participate along with their students, thus enabling students to
continue their research project at their home campuses during the academic year
