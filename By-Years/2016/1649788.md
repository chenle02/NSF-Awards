The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory
Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early
stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or
approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the
Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges
and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of
faculty at the institution. The project at Prairie View A &amp; M University
aims to implement machine learning algorithms on the data flow architecture and
to conduct comprehensive performance and energy consumption studies in
comparison with those of classical von Neumann computer architectures. The
project outcomes can address the challenges modern computers based on the von
Neumann architecture are facing to pertaining memory and power walls in the big
data era. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is the first attempt to implement
machine-learning algorithms on the data flow architecture. The results of the
project will demonstrate if the data flow model can be used successfully to meet
the performance, energy efficiency, and scalability requirements of widely used
big data analytics and machine learning applications. Once demonstrated, the
work can lead to the design and implementation of better and faster high
performance computers and Big Data Analytics applications. In addition, the
project will also increase the research capability at Historically Black
Colleges and Universities in High Performance Computing, Computer Architecture,
and Big Data Analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project is funded by the
Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
