The object of this project is to advance the state of knowledge in robustly
representing, interrogating and manipulating the geometry of complex objects
using imprecise/discrete computer arithmetic and developing the necessary theory
and algorithms which can form the basis for CAD/CAM systems of the future. This
theory will involve primarily concepts of interval arithmetic and conditioning
from numerical analysis as well as concepts of stability from differential
topology, of simplicial complex theory from algebraic topology, and basic
concepts of differential geometry, all applied in computational geometry
representations and algorithms. Specific objectives are: To analyze how interval
non-uniform rational B-spline curves and surface patches can be used to obtain
robust machine realizations of flexible free-form boundaries for solids in a
modeling system for complex objects. To develop methods which allow stable
Boolean operations. To investigate how local stability properties of adjacencies
resulting from Boolean operations. To investigate how local stability properties
of adjacencies resulting from Boolean operations can be integrated in a global
topological generalized Boundary Representation cell- tuple structure, so as to
obtain consistent geometric results which remain compatible with a variable
numerical resolution. To obtain a reliable classification of cases where the
resulting information of the system is uncertain and those cases where the
answer is specific.
