ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0210238&lt;br/&gt;P. Kumta, L. Walker, L. Weiss, P.
Campbell and J. Hollinger&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A novel techniques based on modification of ink
jet printing technology for controlled Gene delivery and development of a new
technology for tissue engineering is proposed. The PIs seek to create a
biomimetic extracellular matrix with controlled temporal-spatial patterns of
NanoCaPs that contains DNAs or plasmid growth factor. The controlled patterns
will be created with the ink-jet technology and the performance will be
evaluated in-vitro.&lt;br/&gt;
