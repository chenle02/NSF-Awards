9410102 Savelsbergh This research is focused on the development of an
environment for the implementation of parallel linear programming based branch-
and-bound algorithms for mixed integer programs. Within this environment,
special attention is given to branch-and-cut and branch-and-price algorithms.
Branch-and-cut and branch-and-price are variants of linear programming based
branch-and-bound algorithms. Topics covered in the research include
reformulation, decomposition, row and column generation, row and column
management, branching, parallel architecture, fine and coarse grain parallelism,
task allocation, communication, and synchronization. Modular experimental codes
will be developed to test and evaluate the methodologies developed in the
research. The development of an environment for implementing parallel linear
program based branch-and-bound algorithm for mixed integer programming will
result in a better understanding of the applicability of parallel computing for
mathematical programming. The research outcome will also open up opportunities
for the implementation of special purpose algorithms for certain classes of
problems in logistics and manufacturing.
