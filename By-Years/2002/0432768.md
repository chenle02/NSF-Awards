This proposal seeks partial support for the 28th Johns Hopkins Workshop on
Current Problems in Particle Theory. The funds will be used to help pay for some
of the direct costs of the conference which include the production of the
proceedings CD. The conference will focus on traditional boundaries between
particle phenomenology beyong the Standard Model, string theory, cosmology and
astrophysics. Recent findings in eachof these areas has already profoundly
affected thinking in the other subdisciplines. The conference will bring
together the leading thinkers at the confluence of these fields, speaking the
lingua franca of effective field theory, to share ideas, viewpoints and
techniques.The conference will combine a series of formal but provocative talks
with informal discussion sessions.
