The infrared spectrophotometer is being used in the one year organic laboratory
course and for demonstration purposes in the general chemistry and introductory
chemistry course. The instrument is being used in the organic laboratory for
regular experiments, such as qualitative analysis for functional groups and is
improving the students learning efficiency as well as the department's
instructional capability. Students are also doing special projects such as a
kinetic and mechanism study and structural analysis of the products of oxidation
reactions of various alcohols using a variety of oxidizing agents. The grantee
is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
