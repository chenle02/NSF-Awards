9401302 Plaut The research entails the study of groups which can be isometry
groups of Riemannian manifolds and metrics on infinite dimensional groups. As a
test case, groups actions on infinite dimensional spheres can be studied. The
research has group- theoretic ramifications and thus may be potentially
applicable to algebra and other areas of mathematics. ***
