Fundamental to all linguistic analysis is the actual phonetic data of the spoken
language. With the advent of the sound spectrograph and "visible speech", "ear
phonetics" has become a thing of the past; the quantification of pitch, timbre,
amplitude, and their variation over time is made possible by a variety of
devices, some of which can also be employed to synthesize a speech signal.
Undergraduates in linguistics need to acquire a facility with such devices,
beginning with their earliest attempts to collect and interpret linguistic data.
Core courses in which use of a speech analyzer will be heavy include elementary
and acoustic phonetics, sociolinguistics, phonology, and linguistic field
methods. In addition, the P.I. will be working with students on research in the
analysis of how speakers of various languages encode sarcasm through
intonational and other sub-phonemic means; the relative accessability and
intrinsic interest of the project provide a unique and nearly ideal entry for
the investigation of some fundamental issues, where relative novices can be
expected to make original contributions to knowledge. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
