In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Kathleen Morgan of the Department of
Chemistry at Xavier University of Louisiana will study the chemical energy
content of simple sugars and related compounds. These data are of significance
in helping advance our understanding of how biomass, a renewable and carbon-
neutral source of energy and chemical feedstock, degrades into useful fuels or
chemical building blocks. Xavier University of Louisiana is both a primarily
undergraduate institution and a Historically Black College with hundreds of
science majors. This project will help train undergraduates with the laboratory
and presentation skills needed for future Ph.D. studies or other science-
oriented careers. Outreach activities involving K-8 students are also part of
the funded project, with a focus on public schools in New Orleans.

Carbohydrates are ubiquitous in nature, yet there are still major gaps in our
knowledge of sugar thermochemistry. In this study, heats of formation will be
determined for simple monosaccharides having 2-4 carbons; remarkably, these
values are unknown. A combination of reaction calorimetry, vaporization
measurements, and high-level calculations will be used to obtain the heats of
formation for sugars and related compounds such as 1,2-diols. Although high-
level calculations can often be used to obtain high quality thermochemical data,
the compounds of interest have a large number of important conformations, making
accurate calculations far from routine. The heats of formation determined in
this study will be used in conjunction with bond energies determined by
collaborators, which afford the heats of formation of radicals that are involved
in the degradation of biomass. Together these data will help move forward our
understanding of the mechanism of biomass degradation.
