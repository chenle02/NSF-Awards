Cerion shows more variety in the form of its shell than any other land snail in
the world. Sizes of adults range from 5 to 70 mm in length, shapes from spheres
to very narrow cylinders. If an understanding of how such variety is generated
within a genetic program that varies little from species to species could be
obtained, insight would be gained into an important evolutionary question about
change in form (chimps and humans are also very little different genetically,
but morphologically quite disparate). By measuring shells and establishing
correlations of characters in growth, the principal investigator has shown how
small changes in rates of growth yield major differences in adult form. This key
allows one to make sense of the geographic and temporal distribution of form in
Cerion on the Bahama Islands. In this project, the principal investigator will
continue his series of monographs on Bahaman species, trying to explain
differences in form through the study of correlations discussed above. Studies
of growth patterns in Cerion and the adaptive (or nonadaptive) status of
individual changes that define species and populations will also be continued.
