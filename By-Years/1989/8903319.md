The relationships between the combinatorial and algebraic structure of problems,
and their computational complexity are being studied. This investigation is
using several approaches and concepts applicable to many types of problems in
the mainstream of computer science and operations research. These include:
expressing problems either in a finite algebraic or nonserial dynamic
programming framework, efficient size-bounded reductions, local reductions, the
concepts of polynomial and power index, several hypotheses on the complexity of
SAT and relater problems, the computation dags associated with problem instances
including their layouts in the plane, separator trees, the tight coupling of
problems to resource-bounded computations, and various concepts of "nearness".
The problem areas being considered include combinatorial problems, problems for
finite or finitely presented algebraic structures, problems for recursively or
hierarchically presented objects, and problems for several particularly
important infinite algebraic structures.
