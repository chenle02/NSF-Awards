This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of laser spectroscopy. The purpose of this research will be to
develop a near infrared laser diode intracavity spectrometer for selective and
sensitive analysis of biologically important compounds. The project will utilize
a laser diode in a unique way to develop a compact, rugged and inexpensive near
infrared fluorescence spectrometer. This research will be accompanied by the
development of near infrared chromophores that will be labels for the
quantification of complex molecules. The development of a novel and affordable
analytical spectrometer will result from this project.
