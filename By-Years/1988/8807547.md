This award will enable Dr. Craig Van Degrift of the National Bureau of
Standards, Washington, D.C., to conduct research at the Electrotechnical
Laboratory (ETL) in Tsukuba, Japan, for twelve months. Dr. Van Degrift will
collaborate with members of the group of Dr. Katsunori Shida in a study of
corrections to the quantum Hall effect that depend upon such phenomena as
electron concentration in heterostructures, and the size of experimental
samples. The quantum Hall effect, which occurs in certain materials at low
temperatures and high magnetic fields, causes semiconductors to exhibit a
quantized magnetically induced resistance, the value of which can be used to
determine certain physical constants. Dr. Van Degrift has extensive experience
with the quantum Hall effect, and its application to fundamental measurements,
at the National Bureau of Standards. Working at ETL, he would be able to take
advantage of ETL's own experience, as well as their extensive facilities for the
fabrication of test devices. Close cooperation between researchers of ETL and of
NBS, both organizations responsible for the maintenance of measurements
standards in their respective countries, would be mutally beneficial.
