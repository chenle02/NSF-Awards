This award partially supports the activities of PRIMES (Program for Research in
Mathematics, Engineering and Science), including three annual PRIMES conferences
in 2022-2024. Established at MIT in 2010, PRIMES offers talented high school
students from across the U.S. an opportunity to work on year-long research
projects under the guidance of academic mentors. Groups of students also
participate in reading programs, online research forums, and a residential
summer math camp. The program supports graduate students and undergraduates
serving as mentors and helps diversify the mathematical community by providing
additional opportunities for members of underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential topics for student research projects
include atomic monoids, positive semirings, Benson's conjectures in modular
representation theory, Lie theory in the Verlinde tensor category,
representations of Cherednik algebras in characteristic p, and classical
information theory. More details and information about the program may be found
on the program website:&lt;br/&gt;https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/prime

deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
merit and broader impacts review criteria.
