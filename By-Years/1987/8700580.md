This project investigates low temperature properties of a large class of
lattice models of classical statistical mechanics. The standard low temperature
expansion appears not to apply to this class of problems. A different type of
low temperature expansion will be developed followed by one-step
renormalization. The mathematical properties of real space renormalization group
will be analyzed with the help of numerical experiments of the convergence
properties and fixed points. Results of the research are expected to contribute
to the understanding of physics of matters.
