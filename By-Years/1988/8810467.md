This research centers on the development of generalized Kolmogorov complexity
theory as a tool to apply to problems in various areas of complexity theory
including circuit complexity, pseudorandom generators, and one-way functions.
Building on the principal investigator's work in circuit complexity, this work
seeks to relate the size of the circuit's description to the complexity of
producing the circuit. One goal of this work would be to indicate that there is
a theoretical difference between efficient "general purpose" and "special
purpose" parallel computation. Recent results have shown that probabilisitic
techniques are useful in analyzing the Kolmogorov complexity of sets in certain
well known classes. This research seeks to develop the link between probability
theory and generalized Kolmogorov complexity. Different hypotheses on the
existence of one- way functions have different necessary conditions in terms of
generalized Kolmogorov complexity. Sometimes, these conditions conflict. This
work investigates the nature of the conflict.
