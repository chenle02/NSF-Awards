Dr. Diana E. Wheeler is a new investigator with expertise in the study of social
insects. She plans to study the physiological mechanisms regulating oogenesis in
ants. In some castes of ants (workers), egg production is surpressed, whereas in
the queens egg production is enhanced. Experiments focus on the endocrinology of
these processes. The results will be important to our understanding of the
reproductive cycle in social insects and of practical importance in insect pest
control.
