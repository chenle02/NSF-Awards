The Department of Chemistry and Physics at Texas Woman's University will acquire
a circular dichroism spectrophotometer with this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program. Principal Investigator Sheardy will investigate
the influence of sequence and environment of G-quadruplex nucleic acid secondary
structures. The goals of co-PI Anderson's research are to understand the
function and mechanism of human Glutathione Synthetase. The primary purpose of
co-PI Britt's proposed research is to thermodynamically characterize the
transition states and conformational changes of several non-denatured enzymes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A circular dichroism spectrophotometer will produce
spectral data that provides information on molecular structure and especially
the conformations of bio-molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, enzymes and
nucleic acids. The instrument will be used in research by graduate and
undergraduate students. The theory and practice of circular dichroism
spectroscopy will be incorporated into the undergraduate teaching curriculum.
This training will prepare students to utilize this sophisticated technique in
various careers, especially in chemical, biological and health related fields.
