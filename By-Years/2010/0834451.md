Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships for both undergraduate
and graduate students are being given by this institution to students seeking
degrees in a broad-based Information Assurance (IA) program with a special focus
on computer forensics. The institution's IA program offers a blend of education,
research, experiential learning, and professional development. The computer
forensics program focus benefits from a close association with a nearby Regional
Computer Forensics Laboratory. Each scholarship recipient completing this IA
degree program serves for two years as an IA professional in a Federal
government agency.
