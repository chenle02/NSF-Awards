9457960 Pugh Research is proposed for the synthesis of novel materials using i)
organized solutions to thread macrocycles with polymer to form polyrotaxanes,
ii) chain extension reactions to form polyrotaxane networks, and iii)
intramolecular Claisen rearrangements to form ladder polymers. This will result
in both new topologies and new routes to important molecular architectures. %%%
