9722757 Delmer A plasma-membrane-associated form of the sucrose synthase (SuSy)
enzyme has been found that comprises more than half of the total SuSy activity
of cotton fibers harvested at the most active stages of secondary wall cellulose
deposition. This is a surprising finding, because SuSy had always been
considered a soluble enzyme. This membrane form of SuSy could exist in a complex
with cellulose synthase where it could serve to channel carbon from sucrose via
the intermediate UDP-glc directly to the glucan synthase catalytic subunit. The
work will quantify the ratio of membrane-bound to soluble SuSy, and the
biosynthetic pathway will be probed by in vivo labeling studies. Consecutively,
antisense approaches will be used to interfere with SuSy and sucrose-P synthase
to affect cellulose biosynthesis.
