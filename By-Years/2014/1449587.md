This project will support a workshop for new and future Principal Investigators
(PI's) in the Condensed Matter Physics Program within the NSF Division of
Materials Research. The workshop will be held in Arlington, VA on August 7th and
8th, 2014. The workshop will provide PI's who have just received their first
award, or are attempting to obtain funding, from the CMP program with valuable
information and advice on the policies, procedures and opportunities available
at the National Science Foundation. The workshop will focus on:

- Individual Investigator Programs in DMR - DMR Centers - DMR Facilities -
Other user facilities - Special DMR programs - NSF Policies and Procedures - The
Merit Review Process - What makes a review effective and helpful - Preparing
highlights - Preparing successful proposals

as well as other topics of interest to new PI's. The workshop will provide ample
time for discussion and opportunities to meet with various DMR program officers
