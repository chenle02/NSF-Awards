Consideration of the dynamic interaction between pipes and the fluids they
transport is crucial in the design of piping systems. This project comprises two
components. The first addresses the development and validation of new theory and
analysis techniques for accurately representing the liquid/structure interaction
in piping. The theory is applicable to a wide class of piping applications
subject to general dynamic loading. The second phase of this project applies the
theory to the seismic loading case; the goal is new design guidelines for pipe
design in earthquake prone regions.
