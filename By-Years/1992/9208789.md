This project will seek a unifying connectionist framework for the classification
of time varying signals based on the gamma model proposed by (de Vries and
Principe, 1990, 1991, 1992). The gamma model extends the conventional additive
model because the multiplication of output activations with weights is
subsituted by a temporal convolution, yielding a computationally improved
additive model. This research will have theoretical and practical components.
New insights on the role of temporal weights will be sought, using the theory of
recursive estimation. Likewise, a paradigm to study how the neural network is
representing the history of the input signal will be sought, using Hilbert
spaces. The gamma memory projects a vector of unconstrained dimension onto a
predefined subspace. This same principle will be extended to learning, producing
a backpropagation through time algorithm that has memory requirements
independent of the length of the input signal. As an application, the gamma
network will be implemented in a multiprocessor system for speech recognition.
The P.I. will contrast the gamma model with two of the best available paradigms,
Lang's time delay neural network and Tank's and Hopfield concentration in time
networks, in terms of performance, network complexity and learning
effectiveness.
