This project is part of an overall plan to improve laboratory instruction in
the Biological Sciences through the introduction of modern computer-interfaced
equipment. The plan develops the following areas: (1) the introduction of more
quantitative physiological experiments, (2) the improvement of instruction
involving computers, (3) the application of the computer to data gathering and
analysis and to simulating scientific phenomena, and (4) the introduction of
student research. The course which accrues the greatest benefit from these
developments is Anatomy and Physiology. However, the equipment requested is
being utilized in all Biology courses where appropriate. Because Marymount
University enrolls women primarily and because these women in science pursue
careers in medicine, teaching, nursing and research, the main benefit of these
modern instruments is to provide women with stronger qualifications for
continuing graduate studies or for entering science-based careers. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
