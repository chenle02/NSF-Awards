This award provides partial support for US-based participants in the
international conference "Non-Isolated Singularities and Derived Geometry" to be
held at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (Cuernavaca, Mexico), during
the period July 29 - August 3, 2019. The event will bring together early-career
and senior researchers as well as students. Along with research presentations
intended to disseminate recent developments, it will include introductory
lectures at a level accessible to graduate students. There will also be
discussion sessions, to better strengthen connections among the various research
groups represented and to provide accessibility for junior researchers and
graduate students.

The conference focus is on the topological study of singular algebraic and
analytic varieties. The program includes the following topics, each driven by
recent and fundamental advances: (1) Geometry and topology of non-isolated
singularities; (2) Characteristic classes of singular varieties; (3) Perverse
sheaves and mixed Hodge modules; (4) Lipschitz geometry. The proposed topics
intersect a broad range of research endeavors in fields ranging from pure
mathematics to more applied areas, thus conference participants will reflect a
broad cross-section of mathematical disciplines. In recent decades, the basic
tools involved in the study of singularities have branched out into a myriad of
mathematical territories, and it increasingly becomes important to provide an
opportunity such as this conference for experts in the various related
specializations to interact and cross-pollinate. For more details about the
conference, please see: http://www.matcuer.unam.mx/DavidMassey60th/index.html

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
