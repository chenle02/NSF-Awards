The College of Oceanography at Oregon State University has requested several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V WECOMA, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabi- lities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -SEASOAR towed vehicle:
This device, when towed behind a research vessel, undulates vertically in the
upper ocean and can carry a variety of oceanographic sensors. The depth at which
the vehicle samples can be monitored and controlled by a shipboard operator,
-Electronic components for a sophisticated multiple-opening and closing net and
environmental data collecting system, -Refrigerated centrifuge for processing
samples at sea for later analysis. The instrumentation described above will
increase the capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored research and
engineering projects.
