The PI's research group at the State University of New York College at Geneseo
discovered that the alpha-beta coated gold metal colloid exhibits a quasi-
repetitive color change between pH 4 and pH 10, in which a short-lived
intermediate of the self assembly created only at an interfacial condition was
involved. In this collaborative project, the conformation of alpha-beta
aggregates binding to the functionalized gold colloid surface will be directly
investigated by utilizing high-resolution transmission electric microscopy at
Japan's National Institute of Materials Science, in order to directly clarify
the structure at a nanometer scale. This study will answer 1) why the observed
pH induced quasi-reversible process takes place only for 20 nm gold colloid and
2) why an effective cage-like conformation of alpha-beta is observed at only 40
and 80 nm gold colloid. Results could lead to the development of highly
selective biosensors and have a long term biomedical engineering impact in the
areas of cancer treatment and nanomedicine. This project is the preparatory
stage for a long-term international research collaboration in which top notch
American undergraduates will gain international research experience and be
exposed to innovative biomedical engineering technology.
