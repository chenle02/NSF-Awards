Results of preliminary strontium, oxygen and carbon isotope studies have
revealed progressive cooling, and significant climatic and oceanographic
variability during the Maastrichtian. Episodes of marked increases in
foraminiferal del 18O values correlate with decreases in oceanic del 13C values,
documented sea level regressions, and increases in seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in
the early to late and latest Maastrichtian. The coincidence of these events, and
the similarity between Maastrichtian benthic foraminifera del 18O values and
those of middle Eocene age associated with ice-rafted debris, suggest that the
Maastrichtian isotopic variations could be related to glacio-eustatic phenomena.
The research proposed will investigate and document the climatic and
oceanographic history of the high and mid-latitude South Atlantic and Indian
Oceans from the latest early Maastrichtian to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary
based on foraminiferal oxygen and carbon isotope measurements, and foraminiferal
quantitative analyses. We will attempt to determine the effect of
climatic/oceanographic changes on foraminiferal populations. Stratigraphic
correlation of deep-sea sections will be enhanced by integration of
biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy. This data set is
expected to provide a basis for climatic reconstruction of the Late Cretaceous
including development of new climatic models that are not based on the
assumption of uniform, warm, and equable climatic conditions during the
Cretaceous.
