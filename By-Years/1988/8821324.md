This project by Peter Ogilby of the University of New Mexico, which is within
the Organic Dynamics Program, is aimed at an understanding of the way in which
excited states of molecular oxygen may be generated and destroyed. Of particular
interest, is the excited state interaction and energy transfer between molecular
oxygen and organic molecules. These studies will provide information about the
degradation of organic materials in air. Excited state interactions and energy
transfer between molecular oxygen and organic molecules will be investigated
using a variety of spectroscopic techniques including time-resolved detection of
singlet molecular oxygen phosphorescence and time-resolved absorption studies of
molecular transients (e.g., triplet states and radical ions). Recent results
suggest the following two areas to be especially fruitful: (1) a study of the
oxygen-organic molecule charge-transfer (CT) state and the extent to which it
determines oxygen-organic molecule photophysics and photochemistry, and (2) a
study of oxygen-organic molecule interactions in solid organic polymers.
