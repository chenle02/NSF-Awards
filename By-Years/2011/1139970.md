The goals of this project are to advance knowledge of the workings of
midlatitude storm tracks and their relationship with large-scale westerly jets.
Improved knowledge of the physical processes that drive jets and storm tracks
will lead to better understand of the variability of the closely related surface
temperature and precipitation fields. The three main research objectives are as
below (i) to investigate the influence of surface Ekman pumping on the intensity
of storm tracks; (ii) to examine the processes that drive jet variability; and
(iii) to explore whether the eddy-multiple jet interactions in studies using
highly idealized models of the atmosphere and ocean hold up in more realistic
models of the atmosphere and ocean, respectively. The outcome from the eddy-
resolving ocean model analysis is anticipated to help improve eddy flux
parameterizations for coarse resolution ocean climate
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to training of graduate students,
workshops for middle school teachers will be conducted. These workshops will
blend science content and science pedagogy, providing teachers with
implementation strategies for their classrooms. Thus the benefits to society are
multi-faceted.
