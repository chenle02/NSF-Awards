9450876 Vanasupa This project focusses on enhancing materials engineering
education at Cal Poly in the area of advanced materials synthesis and
processing. With the funds provided by this grant, we will purchase a sputtering
system and an ellipsometer to complete the instrumentation required for a
microelectronics processing lab. Microelectronics processing is an ideal setting
for learning the relationship between materials processing and the resulting
properties: the materials used, like silicon, have properties that are highly
sensitive to processing conditions, clearly demonstrating the link between the
processing conditions and the material properties. Microelectronics processing
also exposes the materials engineering student to a spectrum of engineering
materials, involving polymers, ceramics and metals.
