Supercomputer simulations of the final coalescence and merger of compact binary
stars will be performed using a new 3D relativistic hydrodynamic computer code
developed by the PI and his students. In particular, the first 3D relativistic
calculations of the tidal disruption of a neutron star by a black hole in a
close binary system will be performed using this code. The gravitational wave
signals emitted during these compact binary merger events will be computed self-
consistently as part of the simulations. The dependence of the signals on the
properties of the nuclear fluid will be studied
systematically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coalescing binary systems containing
compact stars are among the most important sources of gravitational radiation
for current laser interferometer detectors such as LIGO. The theoretical study
of gravitational wave sources is crucial for the interpretation of data to be
collected by the interferometers, and for the planning of future, more advanced
detectors. The new hydrodynamic calculations for binaries containing a neutron
star in orbit around a black hole will represent a&lt;br/&gt;significant
improvement over previous, more approximate treatments. The study of coalescing
compact binaries is important for many other problems of great current interest
in astrophysics, such as the origin of gamma-ray bursts, and the production of
heavy elements in galaxies. The 3D&lt;br/&gt;relativistic hydrodynamics code
developed by the PI is a general tool, which will be useful for studying many
other problems involving relativistic stars and fluids. Public outreach
activities are planned that will take advantage of the resources of the nearby
Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum in Chicago and will educate the public
about Einstein's theory of General Relativity and the great discovery potential
of gravitational wave astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;
