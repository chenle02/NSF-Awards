The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Lincoln University will develop and
implement an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in bioinformatics. Very few
undergraduate institutions have programs in bioinformatics, particularly
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This program will have a
major impact on the training and preparation of underrepresented minorities for
careers in bioinformatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lincoln University
Bioinformatics Project will take an innovative approach in bioinformatics
education and research by preparing undergraduate students for interdisciplinary
and computationally intensive research, and increasing the number of well-
qualified underrepresented minority students in graduate programs. Additionally,
a pipeline of well-trained minority students who are well prepared for the
workforce will be generated from the program. The expected outcomes of this
project will advance knowledge in the field of bioinformatics, as the students
will be trained in this growing field while working side-by-side with faculty.
Therefore, it is necessary to instill a practical understanding of
bioinformatics, incorporating its basic usage and critical understanding of the
underlying principles. The minimum skill sets are key cross-disciplinary
concepts, involving a combination of knowledge and proficiency from the fields
of biology, chemistry, computer science, and mathematics, which will have
implications in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
