This project will plan the development of the National Academy of Engineering's
Center for Scholarship in Engineering Education. The center will bring
outstanding visiting scholars and educators together to conduct high-quality
research as a basis for nationwide reform of engineering education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of center is to create a climate of continuous
improvement in engineering education by increasing the body of knowledge on
teaching and learning, cultivating a respected community scholars of teaching
and learning in engineering, and promoting the dissemination and adoption of
this knowledge. The center will: 1) sponsor National Academy of Engineering
education &lt;br/&gt;fellows selected for outstanding research in engineering
education; 2) educate the engineering community about value of educational
research; and 3) support the dissemination of effective innovations in
engineering education. The center will establish future
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
