This award supports the study of equations (both differential and difference)
on affine Hecke algebras introduced by the principal investigator which leads to
a new approach to the theory of special functions and combinatorics via the
representation theory of Hecke algebras. These equations are a generalization of
the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation from conformal field theory and its
difference counterpart. Conformal field theory is an important physical theory
describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter physics
and classical motions of strings in string theory. Besides its importance in
physics, the beautiful and rich mathematical structure of conformal field theory
also has interested many mathematicians. New relations between different
branches of mathematics, such as representations of infinite-dimensional Lie
algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic
group, modular functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is
revealed in the study of conformal field theory. It is believed that the study
of the mathematics involved in conformal field theory will lead to new
mathematical structures which will be important both in mathematics and
theoretical physics.
