Abstract

Award: DMS-0504534 Principal Investigator: Xiaochun Rong

Positive curvature and non-positive curvature have been frequent subjects in
Riemannian geometry, where mathematics from several disciplines interact; such
as differential geometry, analysis and partial differential equations,
transformation group theory and topology. The PI is pursuing a research program
concerning some basic problems in these areas: 1. Interplay between positive
curvature (with Abelian symmetry) and topology. This project is amplified by the
amazing fact that among the manifolds of the same dimension whose sectional
curvature is between two positive constants, all but finitely many admit (large)
Abelian symmetry. 2. The semi-rigidity of the moduli space of non-positively
curved metrics on a closed manifold.

Mathematics is the foundation of natural sciences, and differential geometry and
Riemannian geometry is one of the most important branches of mathematics. The PI
is pursuing solving some basic problems in this field which would have a broad
intellectual impact. PI will continue to actively pursue collaborations with
other mathematicians in US and abroad and to speak at several national and
international meetings a year.

The PI organized Riemannian geometry seminars in summers of 2001-2004, which
were designed to provide a forum for the dissemination of new ideas, in
particular for graduate students. The PI has had three papers with his graduate
students and postdoctoral fellow which were the products of the summer seminars.
The PI will continue the Riemannian geometry summer seminars in the next three
years. The PI has been writing two advance graduate textbooks for three years
(titled: ``The convergence and collapsing theory in Riemannian geometry'' and
``Positive curvature, symmetry and topology''). He wishes to finish the two
books in 2-3 years. This will not only benefit graduate students and researchers
from these areas (due to the lack of graduate textbooks in these topics) but
also help to advertise and disseminate Riemannian Geometry to students and
mathematicians in other related fields, by giving them a quick picture of some
of the research directions of Riemannian geometry, and by showing them how the
subject vitally interacts with differential geometry, analysis and PDE, compact
transformation group theory and topology.
