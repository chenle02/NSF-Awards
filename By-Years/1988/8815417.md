Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition (LCVD) techniques can be used to produce thin
layers of materials with precise spatial control. Although this has been clearly
demonstrated, little has been done to understand the fundamentals of the LCVD
process. Experimental studies of the deposition mechanism for pure titanium will
be conducted using optical, thermal and chemical properties. The results will be
used to develop generic mathematical models for the deposition process.
