9314246 Brown This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
condensed matter physics between Stuart Brown, University of California, Los
Angeles, and Denis Jerome, University of Paris, Orsay. The objective of the
research is to study the magnetic and transport behavior of materials related to
a quasi one dimensional molecular salt known as Bechgaard salt. Hydrostatic
pressure will be used. The U.S. investigator will conduct the characterization
studies and provide the samples. The pressure-NMR measurements will be done in
Orsay. This project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the French
investigators in NMR measurements and provides access to excellent high pressure
NMR facilities in France. ***
