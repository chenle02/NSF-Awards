Both education and training, as conventionally practiced, fail to provide many
individuals with the level of understanding and skills needed to become
productive contributors in a world of fast-changing technology. This project
explores the concept of mentoring as an alternative instructional tool that can
bridge the gap between the concepts stressed in formal education and the
competencies required by the workplace. We view mentoring as a dynamic social
and instructional process initiated when a learner detects a problem in the
context of some activity. In the first phase of the project, we will study
informal mentoring in the workplace and more structured mentoring in educational
settings. We will also initiate laboratory studies, using the first prototype of
a computer-based support system that enables two individuals to work on the same
application with provisions for a multimedia dialogue between participants. This
work will provide the basis for developing a cognitive model of the mentoring
process. That model and the Phase 1 research results will inform the design of
the Distant Mentor, refinement of the initial prototype that will provide not
only multimedia communication for networked collaboration but also support for
specific mentoring activities as reviewing problem solving histories and
generating explanations.
