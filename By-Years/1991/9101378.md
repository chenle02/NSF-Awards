This project concerns the ring of invariants of a set of generic nxn matrices
over a field K, and the trace ring, which is the noncommutative ring generated
by the ring of invariants and the generic matrices. The fundamental problem is
to find presentations for these algebras, which would solve various explicit
combinatorial problems. These combinatorial problems have interest in their own
right, and currently seem more likely to be solved than the general problem of
finding presentations. Other questions to be considered are whether the quotient
field of C(n,r) is purely transcendental over K and what is the structure of the
variety of representations of a group G in the trace ring. The research
supported concerns matrix theory, ring theory and the calculation of invariants.
In particular, this involves an old problem of determining what mathematical
functions are preserved under various transformations. This is of interest in
many areas of science as well as in mathematics.
