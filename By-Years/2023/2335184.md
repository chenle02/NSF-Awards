ACM SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the ACM Special Interest Group
on Data Communication (SIGCOMM). ACM SIGCOMM 2023 will take place in New York
City, United States, from September 10 to 14, 2023. This NSF grant will offer
funds to partially cover the travel expenses to the conference for about 20 US-
based scholars (students, postdocs, and young faculty early in their career with
limited startup funds). It supports young scholars to attend the main conference
as well as the associated poster/demo sessions, workshops, tutorials, and other
activities at SIGCOMM 2023, expanding their research skills and intellectual
horizons. It offers young scholars a chance to engage with senior researchers
from both the academia and industry. Furthermore, since SIGCOMM has a strong
focus on fostering interactions among networking researchers on a global scale,
this award enables young scholars in the United States to connect with a vibrant
international research community. The SIGCOMM 2023 travel grant chair is
dedicated to ensuring the participation of women and under-represented
minorities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
