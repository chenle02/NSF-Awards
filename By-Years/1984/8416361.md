The goal of this project is to determine the role of unsteady fluid dynamics in
the initiation, progression, complication and possible regression of
atherosclerotic plaques. Research will focus on unsteady flow and early
atherosclerotic lesions in three situations: the human carotid bifurcation, the
descending thoracic aorta of monkeys, and the human abdominal aorta. Fluid
dynamics research will concentrate upon unsteady flows in three-dimensional
geometries, the evolution of coherent and random flow disturbances during
pulsatile flows, and unsteady separation. Biological research will investigate
the quantitative distribution of early atherosclerotic lesions, the alignment of
endothelial cells in bifurcating vessels, and the relation between plaque
composition and wall structure.
