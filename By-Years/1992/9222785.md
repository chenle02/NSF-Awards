This award will fund a special session on Neural Waveform Analysis in
Extracellular Recordings during the 14th Annual Conference of the IEEE
Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society meeting in Paris, France. Five
keynote speakers will cover the following topics: 1) multiple extracellular
electrode manufacturing technology; 2) automated systems for detection and
classification of neural waveforms; 3) hardware for on-line detection and
classification of waveforms; and 4) algorithms for detection, classification,
and superposition resolution. This area of research involves complex recording
and analysis techniques that need to be developed further in order to allow
neuroscientists to study large groups of neurons. The special session that will
be supported by this award should stimulate research by biomedical engineers
into this emerging area.
