Darryl Louis Kropf&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 0817045&lt;br/&gt;Title: An Integrated
View of Polarity Establishment in Fucoid Zygotes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research
into the mechanisms that control brown algal development has been hampered by a
lack of molecular and cellular tools. In particular, it has proven to be very
difficult to develop techniques that allow researchers to introduce molecules of
interest into brown algal cells. This project will develop a molecular delivery
system for use with brown algae. The technique uses lipid vesicles filled with
the molecule of interest. The lipid vesicles fuse with the algal cell and
deliver their contents into the cell. Initial results show that specific
molecules can be delivered in this way, and the next step is to show that it
works with many different kinds of molecules. This technique will be truly
transformative in that it will allow scientists to study the function of
individual molecules for the first time. It is anticipated that this technique
will be useful with many different algae, and perhaps with other types of cells
as well. A PhD student and four undergraduates will be trained with this
funding.
