Understanding how behavior emerges from the dynamic patterns of electrical and
chemical activity of brain circuits is universally recognized as a fundamental
mystery in science. Furthermore, better knowledge of healthy brain function has
broad societal implications by laying the groundwork for advancing treatments
for neurological disorders and for developing brain-inspired technologies.
Various brain research efforts around the globe have embraced this scientific
grand challenge. This meeting brings together US and international brain
researchers to discuss the need for coordinating brain research efforts around
the globe, the bottlenecks and challenges that stand in the way and strategies
to overcome these. A particular focus of the meeting is on cyberinfrastructure
and data resources needed to further enhance collaboration and analysis of
disparate streams of neuroscience data.

The Organizers are making a strong effort to invite women and members of
underrepresented groups as participants. Further, the meeting entails extensive
cross-disciplinary interactions, which will be aided greatly by the face-to-face
nature of this meeting. To maximize the workshop's impact, a white paper
summarizing the discussion will be published at a high-profile venue.
