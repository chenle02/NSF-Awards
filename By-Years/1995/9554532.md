9554532 Kamen U.S. FIRST is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to create
a demand for science and mathematics learning among today's students. Creating
this demand requires a change in attitudes and preconceptions that had been
turning American students away from technology. The Robotic Competition is one
way we are currently accomplishing this goal on a national level. The model for
this competition is based on a course at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) where engineering students are challenged to create a product
under time contraints in an interclass competition. The U.S. FIRST National
Robotic Competition extends this idea by involving partnerships between high
schools, universities and the corporate engineering world. In seven weeks, teams
of engineers, teachers and students work together to design and build radio-
controlled devices from a standard kit of parts provided by U.S. FIRST. Teams
then compete against each other in matches in regional and national tournaments.
The machines must be operated by two students, accompanied by two coaches --
other students, teachers or engineers. The National Champion is the winner of
the national tournament. By providing real-life role models for students and by
using the same techniques used by large consumer product companies, students
become motivated and begin to see science as fun, prestigious and professionally
rewarding. ***
