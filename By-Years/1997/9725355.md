This award provides support for an international workshop to plan a phased
approach for a core and outcrop transect from just south of the Triassic Pangea
equator to about 30 degrees N Paleolatitude. The workshop will have national and
international participation and will result in the planning of projects that
will result in a synoptic view of Pangea at better than 20ky level of resolution
for a few million years around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. There will be a
special focus ont he relationship between the giant Central Atlantic Margin
igneous province, the rift-drift transition and Triassic-Jurassic mass
extinctions. The intent is to establish a spatio-temporal matrix of climatic,
biotic, and tectonic data that will allow a substantial portion of Pangea to be
known at the same level of resolution that we know the Neogene. ***
