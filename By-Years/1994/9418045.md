9418045 Anders The velocity of the north American plate relative to the upper
mantle is poorly constrained relative to hotspot derived oceanic plate
velocities primarily because continental, hotspot-related volcanism is very
nonlinear. This project attempts to utilize a broad, more stable measure of the
hotspot passage. The work will measure relative tilts of sediment deposited
during active faulting related to passage of the thermal welt across the
continent rather than the unpredictable volcanism. Results have to potential to
provide an accurate measure of the velocity history of the North American plate
relative to the upper mantle and to provide a better way to assess continental
plate motions relative to the hotspot framework generally.
