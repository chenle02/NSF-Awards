Software quality is a crucial issue due to industry's general lack of knowledge
of Verification and Validation (V&V) benefits and the shortage of V&V
practitioners. This project improves software education at the undergraduate
level and enhances on-the-job professional training, thereby increasing the pool
of professionals with V&V knowledge and skills. The project team consists of an
academia-industry collaboration involving seven academic programs and four
industry partners, and possesses experience in software development, course
development, and project management. The project team is critically examining
the existing V&V course at Robert Morris University, enhancing and modularizing
selected topics, and improving delivery strategies by incorporating academic
research findings and industry best practices. The cogent modules and strategies
developed are being assessed, evaluated, and shared among project participants
and disseminated to other institutions through an NSF supported centralized
repository (NSDL), conferences, publications, professional societies, and
websites. Students and practitioners are being equipped with fundamental
theoretical knowledge and invaluable hands-on experiences that are measurably
increasing their ability to contribute to the industry.
