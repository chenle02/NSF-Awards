Fluctuations in sea level are an important control on the depositional
sequences at passive margins. Current models of sea level change. Oversimplify
the mechanics of continental margin subsidence and flexural loading but consider
adequately eustatic changes. It is proposed to combine these two parameters into
a single model which can rigorously simulate both aspects of continental margin
stratigraphic development. In conjunction with the model development the
investigators plan a detailed study of the stratigraphy of the Baltimore Canyon
Trough. It is the goal of this study to contribute towards the resolution of the
controversy over the shape and amplitude of global sea level changes by
quantitative modeling of the stratigraphy in the Baltimore Canyon Trough. As
part of this process the investigators hope to also better determine the
evolution of the shape of this continental margins.
