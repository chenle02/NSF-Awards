The flow-induced electromagnetic force (FI-EMF) technology is an antifouling
technology that overcomes many disadvantages of existing antifouling materials
and technologies. Unlike existing antifouling agents, this antifouling
technology does not use antibiotics and therefore can be safely used not only
for pharmaceutical and medical devices, but also for food processing, industrial
and maritime applications. The FI-EMF Technology will help reduce the incidence
of bacterial infection without causing antibiotic resistance of the bacteria.
This project will develop prototypes of antifouling urinary catheter, cardiac
stent and coated materials so as to define the regulatory pathway for this
technology.

The proposed technology is innovative because it uses an alternative approach
to antifouling products currently available. This technology could impact
biomedical, clinical, food and ship building industries. From medical devices to
industrial applications, this technology can be safely applied and promote human
health by protecting people from bacterial infection. It is likely that the
mechanism behind the FI-EMF antifouling technology will help the antifouling
research community to better understand the process of bacterial and protein
adhesion to medical devices and metal surfaces. The FI-EMF technology is
expected to provide researchers in microbiology and biochemistry with valuable
information on the relationship between microbes, chemical and electromagnetic
effects in the surrounding environments.
