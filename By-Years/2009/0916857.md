Currently in the Internet there is an increasing number of unwanted, unsolicited
"garbage" packets mainly generated by botnets, which can launch Distributed
Denial-of-Service attacks, worm attacks, and spam. These garbage packets are
allowed to traverse the Internet to cause severe traffic burdens, waste
communication resources, and disrupt the Internet?s normal functions. Such
packets need to be discarded as close to their sources as possible to increase
the availability and reliability of the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to establish a comprehensive and sustainable architecture that
coordinates the routers in the Internet to achieve early filtering of botnet
garbage packets in Internet traffic. The architecture comprises four major
components: rule generation component, rule dissemination component, rule
management component, and rule security component. The objective is to
investigate and quantify the tradeoff between the saved bandwidth originally
consumed by the garbage traffic and the throughput slowdown introduced by the
routers' extra filtering overhead, and find optimal solutions under the tradeoff
function. The evaluation plan will use benchmarks developed under various
traffic traces and network topologies to evaluate the performance of the
developed algorithms and technologies, and derive insights on how far and wide
the filtering rules should be disseminated and installed under different attack
scenarios in order to optimize the performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completion
of the project will create techniques and software that improve the security and
capacity of the Internet overall. Additionally, early filtering of garbage
traffic will limit the damages caused by large-scale botnet attacks, reduce
operational costs for ISPs, enhance the performance of many online services and
applications, and increase the reliability of critical national infrastructures.
