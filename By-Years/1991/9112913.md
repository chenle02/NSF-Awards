Dissociated cultures of neurons obtained from various rat brain regions will be
employed to study the effects of the newly discovered neurotrophic factors,
brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and leukemia
inhibitory factor (LIF) on cholinergic and dopaminergic biochemical
differentiation. Observed effects will be compared to those of nerve growth
factor (NGF). In vivo experiments in which the neurotrophic factors are injected
into specific brain areas will be done to determine whether the effects observed
in culture are biologically relevant.
