The main goal of this project is to investigate a large class of problems in
which asymptotic analysis allows for a detailed study of multi-scale phenomena.
Among the problems to be studied are the asymptotic behavior of branching
diffusion processes, transition between the averaging and homogenization regimes
for transport by cellular flows, and asymptotics of solutions to nonlinear
parabolic PDEs. Several problems concerning random perturbations of
incompressible flows will also be studied. These include the transport
properties of the Benard convection, large deviations for randomly perturbed
incompressible flows, and mathematical analysis of Brownian motors.

The proposed research will provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for
several phenomena that have been actively discussed in natural sciences. In
particular, we will consider branching diffusion processes, which are central in
the study of evolution of various populations such as bacteria, cancer cells,
carriers of a particular gene, etc., where each member of a population may die
or produce offspring independently of the rest. We plan to describe the long-
time behavior of the population in different regions of space when, in addition
to branching, the members of the population move in space and the branching
mechanism depends on the location. Other models to be considered describe the
movement of particles (e.g., molecules) due to a combination of a macroscopic
motion and a small random diffusion. In particular, we'll examine mechanisms
that create directed motion out of fluctuations of a random or periodic velocity
field even in situations when the field itself has no preferred direction. Such
mechanisms are very important in many applications and have been discussed in
hundreds of physics and chemistry papers, although mostly at computational and
experimental levels.
