This action is for support of a workshop planned for the San Francisco Bay area
on November 9 and 10, 1989. The purpose of the workshop is to discuss procedures
used to characterize the dynamic behavior of soil for seismic design and
analysis. The workshop is being supported jointly with the Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI). The workshop will address two topics: (1) methods for
estimating the dynamic properties of soil in situ, at levels of strain
appropriate for use in earthquake design and analysis, and (2) methods for
quantifying the spatial variability of these dynamic soil properties. The
workshop participants are to be chosen for their knowledge and expertise in the
areas of either (1) field and laboratory characterization of dynamic soil
properties, or (2) use of field and laboratory properties in seismic modeling.
The format for the workshop will include a series of state-of-the-technology
presentations, focusing on procedures currently used in North America, Europe,
and Asia to estimate dynamic soil properties in situ, including their spatial
variability. A series of panel discussions will address specific issues related
to dynamic property measurement and overall site characterization, and these
will be presented at plenary sessions. The product of the workshop will be a
document that identifies uncertainties and needs in the areas of dynamic soil
property measurement and overall site characterization for seismic design and
response analysis: it will also provide a guide to topics and priorities
meriting special studies.
