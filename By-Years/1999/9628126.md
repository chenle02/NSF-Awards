Mobile hosts in a wireless network can move from one location to another while
maintaining continuous network connections. This project aims to develop routing
mechanisms for wireless networks that are scalable and are compatible with wired
networks. It integrates the basic IP mobility support with hierarchical dynamic
routing protocols, allowing efficient routing to mobile hosts through secure and
incremental propagation of location information. It separates mobile handoff due
to the air interface from routing handoff at the network layer. Such separation
provides flexible tradeoffs between routing traffic and routing efficiency. Both
mobile hosts and mobile support routers are able to control location propagation
as route changes, in order to adapt to different requirements of applications
and network management. By involving the home agent of a mobile host only in a
routing handoff, it leads to a new mobile handoff procedure with a shorter
delay. It offers better support for multicast from mobile hosts by control over
location propagation and facilitates multicast to mobile hosts by a notion of
potential group membership. The project includes the construction of a wireless
network simulator and the implementation of a wireless network testbed. The
simulator allows detailed performance studies and a deeper understanding of
different alternatives for routing and mobility support in local as well as wide
area wireless networks. The testbed offers an experimental tool for migrating
existing applications to wireless networks and for gaining practical experiences
of network communications on mobile hosts. Tools developed in this project will
be incorporated into appropriate undergraduate and graduate courses.
Transparent, flexible and efficient routing is critical to seamless network
access by mobile hosts as they move between networks in vastly different
environments. Insights gained in this project on routing support for mobile
hosts will also shed light on building m obility-aware applications at higher
levels.
