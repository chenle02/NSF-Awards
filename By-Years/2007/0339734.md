This project uses a high-impact, high-interest program visualization
environment, Alice, to introduce a strong core of fundamental programming
concepts (objects, classes, methods, functions, decisions, variables,
parameters, loops) and problem-solving and design techniques to beginning
programmers. It addresses the high attrition rate of computer science majors
during their first year of study as well as the need for innovative materials
and strategies for teaching programming in computer literacy and service
courses. Unfortunately, students who are not computer science majors often have
poor attitudes toward programming courses and the enrollment of women in
computer science has been declining. The results of a previous NSF proof-of-
concept project includes evidence that this approach can significantly improve
achievement and retention of high-risk CS-majors during their first year. There
is also anecdotal evidence that this approach captures student interest and
motivates positive attitudes for women and
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work has yielded a prototype of
instructional materials and a textbook that work synergistically with the Alice
high-interest software environment. The prototype materials have been pilot
tested and peer reviewed. Other faculty members have successfully used these
materials, but no formal testing has been done beyond the pilot project. Thus,
the project includes using and formally testing the revised materials at
regional test sites during the first and second years of the project. The
regional test sites are at different types of institutions, serving students
with diverse backgrounds and career goals.
