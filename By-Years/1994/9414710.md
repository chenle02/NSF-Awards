The research activity covers applications of differential geometry and analysis
to areas of dynamical systems, control theory, robotics and biological systems.
Recent advances in the theory of geometric phase as applied to mechanical
systems will receive particular attention. The recommended support is provided
to the 19th Conference of the University of Arkansas Annual Lecture series in
the Mathematical Sciences. This workshop will provide a forum for interaction
between researchers and graduate students. Besides providing a valuable
contribution to the mathematical infrastructure of the US mathematical
community, the activity covers topics in line with the manufacturing and
biological sciences intiatives currently pursued by The National Science
Foundation. ***
