The purpose of this project is the collection and publication of at least
twelve reviews covering the descriptive inorganic chemistry of the most
important elements and their simple compounds, both in the pure state and in
aqueous solution. The reviews, for the most part, will be published in the
Journal of Chemical Education. They will later be collected in reprint volumes
for teachers. The reviews are being modeled on the curriculum developed by W. C.
Bray and W. M. Latimer, "A Course in General Chemistry". The general
characteristics of the reviews include: coverage of the chemistry of everyday
materials rather than esoteric compounds; inclusion of laboratory exercises and
demonstrations graded as to suggested usage level; description of safety and
waste disposal methods; and de-emphasis of heavily theoretical models in
comparison with qualitative models. In conjunction with the project, a Policy
Group, consisting of chemical educators from both higher education institutions
and secondary schools is being formed. A second group, the Reactivity Network,
will consist of highly qualified secondary school chemistry teachers who will
serve on writing teams and give presentations about the review program at
professional meetings. This project will address a serious shortcoming in
precollege chemical education by providing materials focused on descriptive
chemistry, an area largely ignored in current texts. Secondly, it will help to
modify the present approach to laboratory work in that the laboratory activities
will become the central feature of the materials, and will involve the solution
of problems rather than the performance of illustrative experiments.
