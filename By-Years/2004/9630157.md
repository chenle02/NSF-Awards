9630157 Price In this proposal Professor Price requests support for
participation of his group at The University of California in two activities
with astrophysical implications. AMANDA is an experiment in the Antarctic ice
designed to record tracks produced by high energy neutrino interactions. The
group led by Price is leading this effort in characterizing the relevant
properties if the ice. The group also is engaged in a significant search for
postulated Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS) by using atomic-force
microscopy applied to ancient mica. ***
