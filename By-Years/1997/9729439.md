9729439 Sunal The planning grant proposal is to provide support to build a
collaborative among stakeholders in West Alabama for the enhancement of science
literacy among individuals and groups who have been underrepresented in science
education activities. The major stakeholders represent a complicated system of
school districts spread over several rural counties and include a small city.
The collaborative will develop a long-term plan for local systemic change aimed
at developing a vision for science instruction of children and the professional
enhancement of K-8 teachers. The activity of the planning will include the
development of strategies for bring outside resources and expertise to the
planning process.
