Louri As device speeds rise, communication rather than device speed becomes the
limiting factor in performance and cost of high-performance computing systems.
Optical interconnects offer the potential for high-speed, scalable
communications that can keep up with progress in devices. This research explores
the application of free-space optics to high-density interconnects that are
capable of bandwidth, interconnect density, and error rates far beyond the
capabilities of current electrical interconnects and backplanes. The approach
consists of: 1. developing suitable optical network topologies; 2. identifying
optical implementation techniques and required devices; 3. identifying interface
components; 4. developing modeling and simulation techniques for evaluating the
performance of the chosen topologies and implementations; and 5. physically
implementing and measuring some of the resulting networks.
