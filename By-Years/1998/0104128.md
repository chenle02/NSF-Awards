Abstract for DMS - 0104128

This project is concerned with the structure of smoothly curved spaces on a
small but definite scale, with the partial reularity and singularity structure
of limit cases of such spaces, with the relations between analysis and geometry
on metric measure spaces, and with the structure of nonpositively curved spaces.
Specifically, we will continue our investigations of manifolds with Ricci
curvature bounded below and their weak limits, of Einstein manifolds and their
weak limits, of metric measure spaces for which a doubling condition and
Poincar\'e inequality hold, and of compact nonpositively curved manifolds whose
volume is sufficiently small.

Smoothly curved spaces (the higher dimensional generalizations of curved
surfaces) play an important role in geometry and in physics. A central issue is
to describe the ``worst possible'' examples of spaces the curvature is
controlled in some specific fashion, and, what is very closely related, to
describe the kinds singularities which can form in limiting cases. This study is
the main concern of our project. An example (from a somewhat different domain)
of what we mean by the ``formation of singularities'', one can think of the
formation of ``black holes''.
