Chorin and Tokman The investigators develop numerical methods that will be
effective in long-time simulations of the multi-scale phenomena evident in
plasma dynamics, particularly in modeling magnetic reconnection. They also use
the methods in studies of plasma dynamics in the solar corona and in laboratory
experiments. They make available a software implementation of the methods. The
methods combine projection techniques with schemes of exponential propagation
type for time-stepping. The dynamical behavior seen in astrophysical and
laboratory plasmas is complicated, and to understand it requires computer
simulations. But the phenomena of interest span a wide range of length and time
scales. Consequently, to compute accurately the solutions of the equations that
describe these phenomena, conventional numerical methods require small steps in
time over very long time periods. Similarly, accurate spatial resolution of the
solutions requires fine spatial meshes. Together, these factors require solving
very large systems of equations at each time step, for a great many time steps.
Such calculations are expensive. The investigators develop and analysze
numerical methods that promise to reduce the computational costs, and apply them
to study plasma physics problems. They make the methods available in software.
This widens the potential impact of the work, because problems with multiple
scales arise in a variety of science and engineering applications.
