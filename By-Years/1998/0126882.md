Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Connecting Mathematics for
Elementary Teachers (CMET) project is connecting prospective elementary
teachers' learning of mathematics in mathematics content courses with how
children understand and learn mathematics. The goals are to 1) enhance pre-
service teachers' understanding of mathematics, 2) improve their teaching of
mathematics, 3) improve prospective elementary teachers' understanding of how
children learn and understand mathematics, 4) help them connect the mathematics
they are learning with the mathematical concepts they will be teaching children,
and 5) facilitate prospective elementary teachers understanding of the
connection between the mathematics they will be teaching in elementary school to
the mathematics and technological skills children learn in middle and high
school. To achieve these goals, supplementary materials are being developed for
one 3-credit hour mathematical content course for elementary teachers. An
expanded supplement of teaching notes is being developed for the instructors.
The materials explore how children learn and understand mathematics, the
mathematics actually taught in the elementary school, and the important
connections at the elementary level to mathematics and the technological skills
children learn in middle and secondary school. The project is emphasizing
mathematics from children's perspectives and how this is directly related to the
mathematics they are learning and will be teaching children. The materials are
being evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for their effectiveness at a
test site. This project provides future teachers in-depth knowledge of how the
subject matter they are learning relates to their future teaching.
