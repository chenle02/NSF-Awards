It is often assumed that minority groups seeking to claim rights are more
successful in federal courts than when working through the legislative process.
Yet, American Indians, which remain the most impoverished group in the United
States, lose in the Supreme Court over 75% of the time. As a result, many
lawyers and advocates have encouraged Indian nations to pursue legislative
rather than judicial solutions to problems plaguing Indian country, even though
little is actually known about how American Indians and Indian nations fare in
the political process. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This study begins to fill this gap
in our knowledge by examining how, when, and with what success the 565 Indian
nations in the United States use the political process to change the law. It
focuses on Indian nations? support or opposition for relevant bills introduced
and enacted between 1975 and 2011, and determines whether such support or
opposition led to the enactment of federal policies beneficial to Indians. Case
studies, selected from trends in the quantitative study and developed using
archival data and new ethnographic research, supplement the initial quantitative
analysis of legislative hearings to better assess the variety of legislative
strategies used by Indian nations and the success of those
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study?s findings will provide legal
scholars, practicing lawyers, law reformers, and legislative advocates with a
more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of how underrepresented communities
might use various institutions and strategies to influence the enactment of laws
and policies favorable to them.
