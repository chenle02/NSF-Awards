The PI will investigate important combinatorial invariants related to Schubert
varieties and other important subvarieties X of flag manifolds. Examples include
the famous Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
The goal is to construct combinatorial models for these objects as a means to
discover common underlying discrete laws. One technique of analysis is via
geometric degeneration of ``patches'' of X. Irreducible varieties are decomposed
in the flat limit. Combinatorial analysis of the components of the decomposition
informs about the original variety X.

Flag varieties and their natural subvarieties (e.g., Schubert, Richardson,
Peterson, Springer, K-orbit closures) form a fundamental cornerstone of the
interplay between algebra, geometry and combinatorics. This project intends to
expand and deepen our understanding of common features of invariants of these
varieties.
