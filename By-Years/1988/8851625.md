This project introduces contemporary nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy into the physical science curriculum by acquisition and use of a
high-field FT NMR spectrometer. Major advances over the past decade have
transformed this technique into a fundamental tool of chemistry and physics, as
well as a cornerstone of emergent medical technology (NMR imaging). Available
equipment is both accessible to nonexperts and capable of performing such
previously difficult or impossible tasks as high-field NMR, 2-D NMR, and
relaxation measurements. With this equipment the students -- a substantial
number go on to careers in science, medicine and industry -- have hands-on
experience with equipment and techniques they will encounter later. The use of
FT-NMR spectroscopy is integrated into the core chemistry and physics
curriculum, which is also critical to majors in related fields. Improved classes
and laboratories, together with existing faculty expertise, serve to enhance
student research. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal
match for the NSF award.
