9612038 Stucky Funds are provided to the American Chemical Society in the
Support of the 1996 ACS Meeting during August 25-30, 1996 to be held in Orlando,
FL. The requested funds would be mostly used to support the attendance of young
faculty and 5-8 postdocs and graduate students. During this 2.5-day symposium
(Macromaterials: Angstroms to Microns), established scientists in the diverse
fields will present results of their research on atomic and molecular assembly
to create three-dimensional patterning. %%% The topics are intended to deal with
connecting atomistic and continuum scales with three-dimensional ordering at
dimensionalities from the Angstrom to the micron level. Invited speakers have
been selected to ensure participation by the leading research groups including,
especially, new avenues of research. The intent is to bring together
participants who have a wide variety of perspectives on macro or mesoscale
phenomena and the interface of inorganic and organic chemistry. ***
