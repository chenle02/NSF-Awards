9420175 Bradshaw This research will focus on characterizing ammonia's (NH3)
impact on the tropospheric chemistry within the remote marine atmosphere through
the quantitative measurement of gas phase NH3, "total" NH3 (i.e. gaseous plus
particulate), and nitric oxide (NO) on board the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft during
the 1995 Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1).
This effort will seek to address NH3's role within the primary ACE-1 program
objective of determining the key physical and chemical processes controlling the
formation and fate of aerosols and how these processes affect the number size
distribution, the chemical composition, and the optical and cloud nucleating
properties of these particles. For a few parts-per-trillion levels of NH3 that
are anticipated over the ACE- 1 study regions, the Georgia Tech advanced
photofragmentation laser-induced fluorescence (PF/LIF) sensor will be used to
acquire high precision ( 10%, 2s) data with sufficient spatial resolution to
enable a detailed characterization of the small spatial scale atmospheric
inhomogeneities that are thought to give rise to bursts in condensation nuclei
(CN) production. These unprecedented measurement capabilities will produce data
capable of yielding new insights into NH3's role in controlling the development
of CN and the growth and activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). In
conjunction with other ACE-1 measurements, this project should provide a unique
perspective of the relative contributions that binary and ternary nucleation
processes make toward controlling the rate of new particle production in the
remote atmosphere. This investigation will also provide the atmospheric
community with needed information of the spatial distribution of NH3 within the
troposphere over remote marine environments. This large spatial scale survey
will also provide the basis for the first quantitative assessment of NH3's role
as possible source of nitrogen oxides (N0x) i n the remote troposphere.
