Margetis DMS-0847587

The investigator focuses on research and education goals at the crossroads of
mathematics with materials science and physics. This research links macroscopic
principles for crystal interfacial phenomena to microscale processes. The
physical mechanisms are described by discrete "particle" schemes for atomic line
defects. However, mesoscopic and macroscopic consequences are best understood
via continuous models. Linkages between models are sought by kinetic theory,
partial differential equations, and stochastic analysis. The education part
includes the training of a graduate student, development of innovative courses
in applied mathematics, activities for mathematics awareness and outreach,
authorship of a book on integral equations, and organization of working group
seminars.

The project addresses fundamental issues in nanotechnology and materials
modeling. The investigator uses tools of applied mathematics to study
systematically how nano-structures decay on surfaces of technologically
important materials. This work is motivated by the pressing need to design
increasingly smaller and faster, yet more reliable, devices. The proposed work
advances the ability to model and predict by theoretical methods the reliability
of devices for the next generation of applications in microelectronics and
information technology. The project integrates research and education:
Interdisciplinary concepts of applied mathematics are shaped into instruction
tools that reach out to students and science experts in diverse areas. This
Career award is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences and by
the MPS Division of Materials Research.
