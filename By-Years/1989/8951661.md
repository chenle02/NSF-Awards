This project is designed to teach geology students how rocks respond to natural
forces within the earth, and utilizes the use of computers. Rock specimens will
be carefully prepared, then subjected to carefully controlled stresses, in order
to determine their strength and manner of fracture or deformation. Sensitive
electronic equipment is used to record their behavior, and the resulting
measurements are collected, analyzed, and displayed by the computer. These kinds
of experiments are useful for planning large construction projects in bedrock,
for understanding earthquakes, and for explaining how folds, faults, and
mountains are formed. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
