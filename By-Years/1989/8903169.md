A new class of methane coupling catalysts has recently been discovered at the
University of Michigan. These consist of iron phosphates promoted by molybdena
or by vanadia. The purpose of this project is to fully characterize these new
materials in order to facilitate their further development. Vibrational
spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron
microprobe elemental analysis are used to determined the active species of iron
phosphate and to optimize the relation between catalyst and promoter. These
catalysts how great promise as an economical means to convert methane to liquid
products (fuels or chemical feedstocks) under mild conditions. They may be
practical for use at remote sites where natural gas is presently wasted because
facilities to transport it are unavailable, although liquid products are
collected. Examples of such sites are the North Slope of Alaska, the Australian
Barrier Reef, and the desert fields of Algeria.
