0214212&lt;br/&gt;Capo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides three years of
Phase I research laboratory technician support in the Department of Geology and
Planetary Science Geochemistry Facility at the University of Pittsburgh. The
University is providing 50% of the salary and fringe benefits for this position.
The facilities comprise sample preparation, clean chemistry, and instrumentation
laboratories. Major instruments include an inductively coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) and an NSF-funded multicollector thermal
ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS). The research technician is responsible for
day-to-day operation of the labs, maintenance of equipment, training of
collaborators and students, and assistance with method development. In addition
to facilitating hands-on class and outreach activities, this position will
provide vital support for research projects focused on Quaternary soil
development and paleoclimatology, modeling of weathering in watersheds,
development of acid mine drainage, Precambrian paleoenvironments, and igneous
geochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
