Resistance reflexes help an animal to counter external forces that would move
its limbs, thus they help maintain a stable posture. During voluntary movement,
those same resistance reflexes must be disabled or reversed to allow the
movement to occur. This study asks how the resistance reflexes are organized to
allow an animal to maintain a static posture, and how they are disabled and
transformed into assistance reflexes at the onset of voluntary movements. While
these questions have been approached in vertebrates, insects and crustaceans,
answers are far from complete. The questions in the current study will be
addressed in the crayfish because relevant circuitry for leg movements has been
described in terms of a set of identified sensory neurons, interneurons and
motor neurons, and their synaptic interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators will use three approaches: (i) in vivo motion analysis and nerve
recordings; (ii) a hybrid in vitro preparation/neuromechanical model; and (iii)
a neuromechanical simulation of the crayfish body and nervous system. This
approach will reveal how the animal controls its reflexes to help stabilize
posture and assist voluntary movements underwater and on land, where the set of
external forces are very different. The mechanisms discovered here are likely to
be used by other legged animals. The approach employs two new tools developed by
the principal investigator's laboratory, the AnimatLab neuromechanical
simulation software and the hybrid neuromechanical interface that links a model
to the nervous system of the experimental preparation. AnimatLab is freely
available at www.animatlab.com, and the hybrid interface will be made into a
commercial-grade electronic instrument. The research will provide training in
neurophysiology, behavioral analysis and computational neuroscience to
undergraduate and graduate students who include members of underrepresented
populations. Those students will participate in helping to teach relevant
portions of the summer B.R.A.I.N. course at Georgia State University for
outstanding undergraduates from around the country.
