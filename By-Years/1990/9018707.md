The broad, long-term objective of this work is to elucidate the rules that
govern protein folding. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has been
chosen as a model system because it is a simple globular polypeptide, and a
large amount of structural biophysical, and theoretical data is already
available for the wild type protein. The basic thrust will be to produce, in
quantity, genetically-modified forms of BPTI that have perturbed folding
properties and characterize these biophysically. Specific Research priorities
are: 1) Address the problem of "designing out" disulfide bonds by making BPTI
mutants missing two or more of the native disulfides. 2) Facilitate work in
collaborators' laboratories on the structure and dynamics of selected BPTI
mutants. This combined genetic and biophysical approach to the dissection of the
folding mechanism of a very simple model protein should help illuminate the
still poorly-understood process of protein folding.
