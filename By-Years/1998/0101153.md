This research plan consists of two themes. The first is concerned&lt;br/&gt;with
investigations into the structure theory of injective-like objects
in&lt;br/&gt;the category of operator spaces, and involves the theory
of&lt;br/&gt;contractive projections on real or complex C*-algebras. The second
is&lt;br/&gt;a study of linear and nonlinear representations of the Lorentz
group with&lt;br/&gt;an eye towards finding physically meaningful models in
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics. The link connecting these two objectives is
described in the&lt;br/&gt;following paragraph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the
pioneering work of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner in the 1930s,&lt;br/&gt;Segal
in the 1940s and 50s, and Alfsen-Shultz-Stormer in the 1970s,
Jordan&lt;br/&gt;algebras, and more recently Jordan triples, have been used as a
model for&lt;br/&gt;the study of the state spaces of quantum mechanics. On the
other hand,&lt;br/&gt;contractive projections have played a key role in the
structure theory of&lt;br/&gt;Banach Jordan triple systems, and those which are
completely contractive&lt;br/&gt;give rise to injectives in the category of
operator spaces (also known as&lt;br/&gt;quantized Banach spaces). The PIs plan
to study the fine structure of&lt;br/&gt;contractive projections on operator
spaces in order to gain a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of their role in
operator space theory, as well as their&lt;br/&gt;role, together with Jordan
structures, in quantum mechanics
and&lt;br/&gt;relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
