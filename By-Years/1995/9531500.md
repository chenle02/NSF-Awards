OCE-9531500 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in
support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V
ALPHA HELIX, a 133 foot vessel, which is owned by the NSF and operated by the
University. Instrumentation funded includes computers, a CD ROM data
recorder/reader, a cover for the MOCHNESS system, a back-up CTD underwater unit.
The requested instrumentation is necessary to support cruises funded by NSF in
1996 and will enhance the scientific capabilities of the vessel in the future.
