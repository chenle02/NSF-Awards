This grant supports the 2023 Maine-Québec Number Theory Conference, which will
take place on September 30-October 1, 2023 at the University of Maine. This is
an annual conference, held at Laval University in Québec in even years, and at
the University of Maine in odd years. It provides a forum for number theorists
from New England, Québec, and beyond, to discuss their research and develop
collaborations. The conference will feature approximately 35 lectures addressing
recent progress in different areas of number theory. The small scale of the
meeting makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young
mathematicians to interact with leading researchers. This award will also
provide some travel support for US-based participants to attend the 2024 meeting
in Québec. The conference website https://mainequebecnt.github.io/ has more
information, including participant lists and programs from recent years.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
