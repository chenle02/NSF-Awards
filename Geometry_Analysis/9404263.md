9404263 Zhu The research entails topics in the geometry and topology of
Riemannian spaces by analyzing bounds on the sectional and Ricci curvature.
Problems relating to heat kernel analysis on certain singular spaces will aslo
be pursued. The research may have potential applications to the theory of
partial differential equations and mathematical physics. ***
