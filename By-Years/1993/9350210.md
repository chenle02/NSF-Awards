9350210 Lackritz "Gas Phase Interfacial Photopolymerization of Vinyl Monomers
onto Metallic Substrates Studied using Surface Second Harmonic Generation" This
AMPP research project concerns the characterization of "gas phase"
photopolymerization shows promise in creating defect- free, uniform thin films
with excellent electrical and optical properties for commercial applications
such as protective coatings and electrical insulators. Other techniques for
making thin films, such as Langmuir-Blodgett deposition and spin coating, yield
films that have poor physical properties, are inhomogeneous, or are difficult to
make. The issues to be considered in this proposal are how the final film
quality is related to the interface and the polymerization mechanism and
kinetics, and the characterization of the gas phase reactions. As a part of a
long-term goal to design novel nonlinear optical techniques to study polymer
processing, this research will develop surface second harmonic generation to
characterize the dynamics at the metal/polymer interface. Using surface second
harmonic generation (SSHG), issues that have not been resolvable in the past
including rate laws and the dependence of the film properties on interfacial
characteristics, can be effectively examined in a continuous, real-time manner.
This research has two important deliverables: i) the development of an improved,
generally applicable, analytical nonlinear optical technique for studying
reactions at surfaces in real time, and ii) the resolution of important
processing and characterization issues in a technologically useful
polymerization method. The project is supported under the Presidential Faculty
Fellow program. ***
