This is a special opportunity effort aimed at exploring the superconductive
electronic device potential of recently-discovered high transition temperature
superconducting materials with transition temperatures approaching at least 40
K. The program includes a study of film preparation and processing procedures,
electrical characterization of the devices, and comparison with currently-
available superconductive devices.
