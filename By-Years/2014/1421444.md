This research explores a new approach to securing systems that are based on
crowd computations, where the operator polls the opinions of crowds--arbitrary
users of the system--to provide a variety of recommendation services. Examples
include services like Yelp, YouTube, Twitter, and TripAdvisor. However, today's
services are known to suffer from multiple identity (Sybil) attacks, where an
attacker creates many identities to subvert the system (e.g., make their
business appear to be more popular on Yelp). Previous approaches have
investigated detecting whether a single identity is likely to be fake, but these
techniques suffer from a number of drawbacks in practice, as attackers are often
able to create many fake accounts or leverage existing black-markets for fake or
compromised accounts.

Instead, the PI is investigating an approach that shifts Sybil defense away from
individual Sybil identity detection and towards directly detecting manipulation
of large crowd computations themselves. In essence, the PI is shifting the
problem from detecting whether a single identity is fake to detecting whether a
set of identities are fake, the latter of which is likely to be significantly
easier for the operator. If successful, the approach could tip the scales back
in favor of the operator, preventing manipulation from attackers using fake,
colluding, and compromised users in a variety of systems.
