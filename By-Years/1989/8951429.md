An interactive video-disc laboratory in physical anthropology is established.
The project includes an evaluation of interactive video- disc authorizing
systems. A Physical Anthropology Video-Disc is being developed. It includes
sections on: human skeletal anatomy; identification, analysis and interpretation
of human skeletal remains; and human paleontology. The video-disc is used for
instruction in both lower and upper physical anthropology courses. The
educational effectiveness of this method of instruction is being evaluated.
Results of the evaluation will be published and copies of the physical
anthropology video-disc will be distributed at cost. The institution is matching
the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
