Quantum Mechanics was one of crowning achievements of modern physics and has
important applications in daily life such as X-ray, TV, etc. More recently it is
the driving principle behind building a quantum computer. The theory of operator
algebras was introduced by John von Neumann in order to provide a proper
mathematical framework for Quantum Mechanics. The non-commutativity which is a
key feature of Quantum Mechanics, is an important aspect of operator algebras.
Vaughan Jones's subfactor theory is built on this non-commutative framework.
Conformal field theory (CFT) is a theory describing critical phenomena in
condensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in string theory.
In recent years there have been remarkable interactions between subfactors and
conformal field theory that have led to many interesting mathematical issues.
The aim of this project is to find solutions to some of the important
mathematical issues that surface in this context which have a wide range of
applications in both mathematics and quantum physics.

Subfactor theory provides an entry point into a world of mathematics and physics
containing large parts of conformal field theory, quantum algebras and low
dimensional topology. The research objective of this project is to develop
further the connection between these subjects, and to find applications in the
other area of mathematics. The project will rely on operator algebraic and
subfactor techniques developed in studying CFT, including insights about old and
new problems provided by the general framework of subfactors. The project's
focus will be on the questions around the reconstruction program which are
strongly motivated by recent construction of subfactors. In some cases there are
strong indications that the subfactors come from CFT in certain ways that have
been well established based on principal investigator's work. Solutions of the
problems that are proposed would have important applications in diverse areas of
mathematics. Results will be disseminated as research publications and
presentations at professional meetings.
