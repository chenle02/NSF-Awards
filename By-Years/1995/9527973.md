9527973 LAKE By far the greatest numbers of species in the world's biodiversity
are members of very varied groups or lineages known collectively as
"invertebrate animals." To date, our knowledge of the relationships among
invertebrate phyla is based primarily on morphological features and the
resolution of relationships on this basis still leaves much to be desired. This
award will provide funds for DNA sequencing efforts for 35 invertebrate taxa and
that information will be used to address morphological, paleontological,
developmental, and biochemical changes or events that occurred during the
diversification of invertebrates. Special attention will be paid to the origins
of deuterostome and protostome animals and the origins of the arthropods and
their hypothesized close relatives. DNA sequences will be obtained for 18S rRNA
for all taxa and for a nuclear elongation factor gene for some of the taxa
critical to understanding older or deeper phylogenetic relationships. This award
will contribute to our currently very rudimentary understanding of an important
and relatively neglected aspect of biodiversity. Knowledge of relationships
among invertebrate taxa has potential applied value as many invertebrate groups
include species that are of economic and medical importance. The phenomenon of
bioprospecting has been revealing important natural products from invertebrates
that show pharmaceutical promise from antibiotics to anesthetics.
