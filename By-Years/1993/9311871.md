9311871 Eisenberger Grazing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques
will be used to investigate the adsorption on long-chain thiol alkyls onto metal
substrates. Adsorption will occur from solution and from the vapor phase. A
comparison of the two processes, their kinetics, and surface defect formation
will be determined by the x-ray structure experiments. The results will be of
fundamental interest for surface science, will provide new information about the
self- assembly of molecules on surfaces, and will provide technologically
relevant information about metal-organo interfaces. %%% The project will use
intense x-rays from a synchrotron radiation source to examine the structure of
monomolecular films of long- chain molecules similar to fatty acids. The
molecules adsorb and chemically bond to metal surfaces and "self-organize" to
form islands and eventually two-dimensional crystal lattices. The dynamics of
island formation, crystal growth, defect formation, and other aspects of the
monolayer films are only poorly understood. The structure studies will provide
fundamental information about the self-organization of molecules in films and
will provide technologically relevant information about the metal-oganic
interface. ***
