This project funded by the REU Sites Program in the Chemistry Division and the
Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) both at the
National Science Foundation (NSF) supports a Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site at South Dakota State University, led by Professor James A.
Rice and colleagues. The site will support ten students during the ten week
summer program that will focused on environmental and green materials chemistry
and provide the students with multi-disciplinary research experiences. The goal
is to provide cutting-edge research experiences, mentoring, and research-themed
professional development to increase the students' preparedness to pursue
graduate school or environmental/green chemistry careers. The Site will
introduce students to environmental and green chemistry where they will learn
about natural and industrial chemical processes that impact societal research
needs. These range from understanding climate change to the fate and behavior of
anthropogenic chemicals introduced into natural and biological systems, and to
making new materials with a reduced reliance on harmful
solvents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site will recruit students from
institutions with limited research opportunities with the primary emphasis on
attracting students who attend tribal colleges, public and private
(predominately undergraduate) institutions in South Dakota and western
Minnesota. The Site will explore a distributive concept where the students will
work in different locations (the host institution, Black Hills State University
and Northern State University) and communicate using Access Grid, a high
definition, internet-based communication system. An expected outcome will be to
integrate undergraduate research into the chemistry curricula at the
predominately undergraduate partner institutions as they work to achieve degree
certification by the American Chemical Society.
