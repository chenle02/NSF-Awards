In order to understand the cellular processes which regulate glyoxysome
biogenesis, Dr. Harada is studying the mechanisms which regulate accumulation of
the glyoxysome-specific enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. enzyme
activity appears to be controlled at the level of mRNA accumulation, preliminary
studies suggest that primary control occurs at the transcriptional level. The
immediate objective is to identify the regulatory elements and DNA binding
factors which regulate the two genes. Regulatory elements will be identified by
gene expression in transgenic plants. Trans-acting factors will be studied by
identifying and isolating DNA binding proteins and by selecting mutation in
genes encoding the factors. Characterizing the sequence elements and factors
regulating isocitrate lyase and malate synthase genes will provide insight into
the control of a germination-related process. %%% Glyoxysomes are specialized
subcellular organelles which serve a critical role during seed germination and
seedling growth. The enzymes which break down stored lipids to provide nutrients
for seedlings are stored in this organelle. Formation of glyoxysomes is highly
developmentally regulated; they are only present in developing seeds and in
seedling and are not present in mature plant organs. This study will elucidate
mechanisms involved in this regulation.
