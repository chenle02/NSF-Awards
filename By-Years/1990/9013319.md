This award enables four independent liberal arts colleges (Amherst, Hampshire,
Mount Holyoke and Smith) to connect to NSFNET through a fractional T1 link (one-
third T1, approximately 500,000 bits per second) to the mid-level network
NEARnet, the New England Academic and Research Network. Access to NSFNET
provides the faculty and students of the four colleges with increased
opportunity for collaboration and use of a wide range of research tools such as
supercomputing and shared databases. Five Colleges, Inc., consists of the four
colleges and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Responsibility for
network operations and management is assumed by the computing centers of the
participating colleges, each of which has established campus- wide local area
networks. The new connectivity vastly improves the file transfer and remote
login capabilities between these four institutions themselves, and with other
institutions.
