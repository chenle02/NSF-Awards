9411918 ENGEL This study explores the potential effectiveness of the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990. Legal entitlements often fail to achieve their
intended results because the beneficiaries are unwilling to perceive themselves
as entitled to civil rights protections, and are therefore unwilling to invoke
the law. This research asks whether American with disabilities view the law as
relevant to their aspirations to obtain employment and whether they are prepared
to use the law in the hiring process or in obtaining on-the-job accommodations
for their disabilities. Extensive, in-depth interviews will be conducted with
persons who use a wheelchair, persons with learning disabilities, and a control
group at each of three different life stages. The contrasting experiences with
disability and working will provide important data about the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and about the
reasons why persons with disabilities do or do not make use of the law. ***
