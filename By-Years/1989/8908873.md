This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of inorganic, bioinorganic, and organometallic chemistry and in the
subfield of structural inorganic chemistry. During the twelve month period
beginning 15 August 1989, Professor Bailey will work with Professor John P.
Oliver of Wayne State University to determine, by X-ray diffraction, the
structures of several sterically hindered and optically active organoaluminum
compounds. These pursuits will enable Professor Bailey to develop her background
in main group organometallic chemistry and to refresh her skills in modern X-
ray diffraction and related computer methods for molecular structure
determination by single-crystal X-ray analysis. These activities should
contribute strongly to her establishing an independent research program in her
own laboratory at Central Michigan University upon her return there in August,
1990. The research area that is to be explored in this project is an important
one and the results of the work could contribute significantly to basic
knowledge in this area.
