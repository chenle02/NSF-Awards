This project investigates the public value of the research funded by social
policy agencies of the US federal government. "Public value" refers not the
outputs of research (in terms of papers, reports, patents, etc.), but the
societal outcomes such research influences, according to the agencies' missions
and as measured by the broadest available social indicators. Studying this
research will broaden the scholarship of public R&amp;D management beyond such
traditional agencies as NIH and NSF, facilitating the comparative study of
techniques including merit review and technology transfer. Moreover, the study
may illuminate mechanisms for producing public value from research and thus
contribute to understanding the relationship between sponsored research and
societal outcomes more broadly. Examining the "public value" of social policy
research means studying the societal outcomes of the research and the
hypothesized causal links between mission-related research programs and these
outcomes. Sources for the articulation of goals and objectives include
authorizing legislation, mission statements, and strategic plans. Societal
outcomes include available, systematic social indicators, as well as ad hoc
indicators that policy makers and stakeholders have used in articulating the
societal problem triggering the need for the research program. The project will
seek to learn how social policy agencies set priorities between current programs
and investing in research, how they manage research for societal outcomes, how
they transfer new knowledge and/or technologies from their sponsored research
into the pursuit of their missions, how they anticipate the linkages between
their research and societal outcomes, and what those outcomes may be.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The current funding is for planning purposes, to develop
the necessary permissions to gather data, develop questions to be asked, and
develop the research design, analysis and interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
