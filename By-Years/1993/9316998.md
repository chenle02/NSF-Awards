9316998 Johnson This award is the starter grant portion of Dr. Johnson's
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award. The broad theme of the
research deals with the synthesis and reactivity of low coordinate and alkyne
derivatives of Group 13, 14 and 15 elements. Three areas will be explored: (1)
The synthesis and characterization of monovalent clusters of boron, aluminum and
gallium as building blocks for the preparation of larger heteroatomic clusters
of high nuclearity;(2) synthesis and characterization of multiply-bonded linear
and cyclic compounds of boron such as borylenes and diborabenzene, and; (3)
synthesis and characterization of linear networks, ring compounds and cages
composed of alkynes and main group elements. These functionalized alkynes will
exhibit a variety of unusual structural and electronic properties. %%% This
research will advance the fundamental structural chemistry of Group 13-15
elements by the rational design and synthesis of unusual structures modeled
after the all-carbon analogs. ***
