This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Gilbert's work as a guest
investigator in the laboratory of Dr. Frederick Fay at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center. The goal of the project is to define the
respective roles of microtubules and actin microfilaments in cell polarization
and chemotaxis, using eosinophilic leukocytes from newts as a model system. Dr.
Gilbert will be combining her background and expertise in the biophysics of
muscle motility with the expertise of Dr. Fay's laboratory, which includes
fluorescence microscopy and microinjection, to develop a new line of research
which is anticipated to significantly enhance her career.
