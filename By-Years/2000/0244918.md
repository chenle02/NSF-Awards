Research will focus on four areas related to the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Experiment: 1) astrophysical analysis of
initial LIGO data in a search for periodic sources of gravitational waves; 2)
systematic understanding and characterization of the LIGO instruments; 3)
commissioning of the interferometers to bring them to design sensitivity;
and&lt;br/&gt;4) development of novel servo controls systems for future advanced
LIGO interferometers. The LIGO data already has unprecedented sensitivity to
potential gravitational waves. As the Michigan group helps improve that
sensitivity further through detector characterization and commissioning, it will
be examining the data closely to find evidence for undiscovered,
electromagnetically quiet,&lt;br/&gt;rotating neutron stars in the galactic
neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery of gravitational waves from
astrophysical objects will mark a major milestone in science, simultaneously
confirming one of the fundamental predictions of gravitational physics, while
opening up an entirely new field of astronomy. The detection of such waves from
rotating neutron stars would be especially interesting because many such sources
are expected to continue emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up
investigation of increasing precision. It is also believed that these waves will
provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The
research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will
provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art
science at the frontier of knowledge.
