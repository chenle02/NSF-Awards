Objectives of this project are to design, build, and test a very stable and
sensitive deep sea pressure gauge. Presently available pressure gauges drift
over periods of time and under differing temperatures and their sensitivity is
often inadequate for modern investigations. Single crystal, semiconductor grade
silicon has very few structural dislocations and foreign atoms. This material
has been proven to be inherently stable and suitable for use as a pressure
transducer. Methods will be developed for sealing a diaphragm to the silicon
crystal in such a way that the transducer will be usable for periods of high
pressure on the seafloor. Various options for constructing electrodes and other
electronic components will also be undertaken. The system will then be tested at
sea and calibrated. Improved pressure sensors will have several applications in
geophysical studies of the sea floor, in physical oceanography, and in industry.
