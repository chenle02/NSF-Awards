0204032 Ward

This is a collaborative research project between Dr. James R. Ward of University
of Alabama at Birmingham, and Dr. Raul Manasevich and Marta Garcia-Huidobro of
Universidad de Chile and Pontifica Universidad Catolica de Chile respectively.
The investigators intend to work on the mathematical analysis of boundary value
problems for partial differential equations. These problems appear in modeling
both slow and fast diffusion, and are useful in the study of populations and
diseases, porous media, and problems that are inherently nonlinear. The
investigators will use topological tools, such as degree and homotopy indexes,
that are useful indicators of system behavior.

Each side brings their own strengths to the collaboration: Drs. Garcia-Huidobro
and Manasevich have extensive experience in quasilinear differential equations
and bifurcations, while Dr. Ward has worked at length with the topological tools
to be used in their joint effort.
