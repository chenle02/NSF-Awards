This award provides support for students to participate in the Tenth Summer
School on Exotic Beam Physics at Michigan State University on the site of the
National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), July 25-July 30, 2011. The
school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are
actively involved in research, and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree).
The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the
afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research.
The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so that the
community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use Facility for Rare
Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In years to
come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad
impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements
to the enhancement of national security. An important element in this progress
will be to extend the study of nuclei into new domains of isospin. This will
require new radioactive ion beam facilities, together with advanced multi-
detector arrays and mass spectrometers.
