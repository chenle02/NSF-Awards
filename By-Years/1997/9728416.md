Biochemical molecules called neurotransmitters carry signals between nerve
cells, or neurons, in the brain. These neurotransmitters bind to specific
molecules that act as receptors on the cell membranes of target neurons. One
class of these receptor molecules is called G-protein coupled receptors, because
they are linked to a class of particular proteins. When a neurotransmitter
signal persists for minutes, the response of the target cell diminishes. One of
the mechanisms for this desensitization is the uncoupling of the receptor
molecule from its G-protein. Recently it has been found that during stimulation
for many minutes by opiate peptide transmitters such as enkephalin and
endorphin, a large fraction of the opiate receptor molecules leave the surface
of the cell membrane to enter the cell in a process called internalization. This
project uses particular labeling techniques, biochemistry and microscopy to test
the novel idea that these internalized receptor molecules become associated with
the nucleus inside the cell, and may play a role in gene expression initiated by
opiates. Results will be important for understanding at the molecular level of
how neurotransmitters may be linked to genetic modulation of longer-term
responses, and so will be potentially important for behavioral as well as
cellular neuroscience.
