Despite numerous studies of the biogenic component in Arctic deep- sea
sediments, several conflicting hypotheses exist concerning the history of
glaciations on the surrounding land-masses and ice- rafting events in the
central Arctic Ocean. This award supports the analysis of lithic and heavy
mineral particles and the reflected light petrography and microprobe composition
of Fe-Ti oxide grains to determine the history of ice-rafting events in sediment
cores from the central Arctic Ocean and determine the sources for these
sediments. This approach has the real potential to differentiate ice-rafting
events in the Arctic Ocean and link ice-rafted detritus to potential sources
from the surrounding landmass and thus provide a definitive glacial history for
the North American Arctic as well as a clearer paleoceanographic history of the
central Arctic Ocean. This ice-rafting history and provenance of the Arctic
Ocean is critical to our full understanding of Pleistocene paleoclimate and
paleoceanography.
