This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Howard University
provides six undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate
in research on topics in various fields of physics. In addition to participating
in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly
activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they
have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program,
every student will have prepared a poster, made an oral presentation of the
research, and written a final report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the nation's first
Historically Black University, Howard University is known for offering
opportunities for women and under-represented minorities to excel in research
careers. Ten faculty mentors will mentor students in projects related to
atmospheric physics, computational and experimental nanophysics and condensed
matter, string theory, and laser spectroscopy. Through mentoring and exposure to
exciting research tools and methods, students will acquire skills in specific
methodology while developing a keen awareness of the applications of physics to
a broad range of science careers.
