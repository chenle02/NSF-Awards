There are two specific aims in this project, one focused on genomic technology
development and the other, on identifying proteins involved in mediating the
effect of a specific hormone, cytokinin, in plant cells. The technology to be
developed involves using mass spectrometers and heavy isotopes to measure the
concentration and modifications of as many of the 30,000 different plant
proteins as possible. This new technology in the field commonly known as
'proteomics' is badly needed in order to convert genomic sequence data into
knowledge that represents a real understanding of the underlying biological
mechanisms. These measurements will be performed with specific 'knockout' mutant
plants that are resistant to the effects of the plant hormone. By measuring how
these mutations affect the presence of particular proteins, the handful of
proteins that are specifically involved in mediating the effects of the hormone
will be identified. Broader impacts of this project beyond the development of a
much needed, generally applicable technology include organizing workshops for
the research community in the methods that will be developed and the
introduction of concepts in functional genomics into high school biology
classrooms.
