9622821 Ataai This proposal is on research which addresses one of the
bottlenecks in protein production frequently reported for recombinant E. coli,
namely overflow production of semi-oxidized sugars and carbohydrates (e.g.
acetate) which reduces the total carbon yield and also indicates inefficient
metabolic biosynthetic/catabolic fluxes. The specific goals of this research are
to: (1) build on the investigators' Bacillus research to experimentally validate
(using NMR) the feasibility of optimized flux distribution centered around
pyruvate kinase (PYK), (2) transfer the yield-increasing strategy to E. coli by
deleting PYK isozymes and analyze via metabolic flux analysis, again coupled
with NMR, (3) determine scale-up potential in terms of mutant E. coli
concentration, recombinant protein production, and oxygen consumption, and, (4)
evaluate whether there is a link between energy-consuming proteolysis and ATP-
generation as shown in high glucose feed E. coli cultures. ***
