This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Undergraduate Curricular Integration of Nanotechnology's
Principles, Applications, Marketing, Health, Safety and Ethics Aspects,under the
direction of Dr. Mansour Tahernezhadi, Northern Illinois University (NIU), will
involve a partnership between faculty from the College of Engineering and
Engineering Technology (CEET), the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS)
and the College of Business (COB) and industry representatives to develop and
implement an undergraduate nanotechnology certificate open to all undergraduate
students in engineering, technology, and science with the anticipated outcome of
recruiting and retaining more students in undergraduate nanotechnology
engineering programs. The certificate modifies three current CEET courses and
creates a new course on nano-structured materials and device/systems aspects of
nanotechnology.
