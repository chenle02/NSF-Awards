0118032&lt;br/&gt;Shraiman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks support for
the developmental biologists participating in the interdisciplinary work on Cell
Signaling Networks at the Aspen Center for Physics scheduled to take place Aug.
19 - Sept. 9, 2001. This workshop will bring together biologists studying a
variety of eukaryotic signal transduction pathways and the role of cell
signaling in embryonic development with a group of physicists and engineers
interested in quantitative modeling of complex biological systems. The goal of
the workshop is to seek ways to assimilate and interpret the rapidly
accumulating empirical knowledge on signaling, to identify most useful subjects
and approaches in quantitative modeling and to discuss the best experimental
strategies for disecting complex signaling networks&lt;br/&gt;
