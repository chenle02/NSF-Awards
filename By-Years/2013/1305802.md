The term tipping point has been used to describe elements of the Earth system
that might, in the face of changing climate, behave non-linearly, irreversibly,
or both. This study will address the likelihood of various physical components
of the Earth system to undergo major and rapid changes (i.e., abrupt climate
change) and, as time allows, examine some of the most important potential
associated impacts and risks. This study will explore how to monitor climate
change for warnings of abrupt changes and emerging impacts and examine gaps in
our current scientific understanding and monitoring capabilities.
