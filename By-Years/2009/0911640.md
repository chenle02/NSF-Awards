This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professors Lisa McElwee-White and Tim Anderson at the
University of Florida to develop processes for the growth of thin films of
barrier material for Cu metallization used in the manufacture of advanced
integrated circuits. The initial target material is ruthenium, which can serve
in interfacial layers for seedless Cu metallization. Mechanism-based design
accompanied by computational chemistry allows evaluation of Ru-containing film
growth precursors before synthesis. An important aspect is the use of
alternative precursor delivery systems designed for all molecules independent of
volatility, thus expanding the range of possible precursors. Following
preparation of potential precursors, rapid screening selects the most promising
candidates for film deposition and characterization. Collaboration with industry
facilitates process development and optimization including reactor modeling.
Graduate students are trained in interdisciplinary team-based problem solving in
chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science. Industrial internships,
mentoring of undergraduate researchers and interactions with industrial research
personnel are used to broaden the students' perspectives. A workshop that one of
the PIs (Anderson) has presented on career development for new and prospective
faculty for the last 6 years at national meetings is being adapted for
presentation to chemistry faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deposition of thin
films is a key technological capability. Innovation often relies on the ability
to deposit films with very specific composition, surface morphology,
microstructure, thickness, and interfacial chemistry. Developing a process for
deposition of a barrier material for Cu metallization will address a current
challenge in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuits. &lt;br/&gt;
