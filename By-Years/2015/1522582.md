Astronomy has been making strides in increasing the participation of
traditionally underrepresented groups. Several recommendations and strategies
for broadening participation, especially of women in astronomy, have arisen from
conferences dedicated to the subject. The "Inclusive Astronomy" conference and
workshop will be held in June 2015 at Vanderbilt University. The focus of the
workshop is on providing resources and advocating for inclusion of astronomers
who identify with more than one underrepresented category, e.g. gender, race,
disability, etc. The conference will cover topics including barriers to access;
creating inclusive climates; inclusion and access to leadership, power, and
decision making; and establishing a community of inclusive practice. The
discussions will result in the astronomical community being better informed of
research on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and in a set of recommendations
that administrators, faculty, and the research community can use as a roadmap to
improve the participation of all in astronomy. This award supports the
conference travel and subsistence of a total of about 30 students and early-
career researchers who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference.
