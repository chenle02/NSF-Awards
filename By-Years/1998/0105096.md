Diana Lane, University of Illinois, Chicago. Ecosystem restoration has become a
widespread activity in recent years. Little is known, however, about the success
of restoration projects in restoring soil quality. The objectives of the
research are 1) to characterize changes in soil nutrients as restoration
proceeds over time, and 2) to determine the mechanisms that control such
changes. The investigators will conduct field studies and experiments across a
unique 25-year chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restoration sites that were
created on former agricultural land. An important aspect of this research is to
determine whether the temporal and spatial variability of soil resources
increase following restoration. Variability in soil resources is characteristic
of natural systems but may decrease when soils are used for agriculture. Results
from this study will improve understanding of the functional consequences of
restoration. In addition, these results will have broader implications for
understanding the development of plant-soil feedbacks following disturbance.
