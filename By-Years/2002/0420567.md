The funds provided to this CSA will support the U.S. Global Change Research
Program Coordination Office in serving, coordinating, and representing the
USGCRP as an integrated, coordinated program. The objective of this office is to
be the coordinator of the interagency process. This involves a diverse array of
activities to carry out the mission given to the Subcommittee on Global Change
Research (SGCR) and the U.S. Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group that are not
strictly within the purview of any of the individual participating agencies.
