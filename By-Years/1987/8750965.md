A microcomputer network will be purchased to improve the content of laboratory
protions of research design and congnitive psychology courses. Specific
equipment includes six microcomputers connected in a network, data acquisition
hardware (for speech digitization and analysis), and software for demonstration,
simulation, and student conducted experimentation in cognitive, social, and
perceptual psychology. These instruments will significantly improve these
courses by presenting fundamental experimental paradigms and by facilitating
active student participation in the design and conduct of research projects.
This "hands-on" experience in the laboratory will introduce students to the
essential methodologies of psychology and develop their critical skills. In
addition, the equipment will be used for demonstration purposes in the areas of
perceptual, social, and language psychology.
