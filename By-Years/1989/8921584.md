A speckle photographic method and a turbulence two-equation model are proposed
for the performance evaluation of melt- particle mixing in gas-stirred ladles
with throughflow. Laminar and turbulent flow studies will be performed on a
simplified water mode. The flow pattern will be determined by a laser light-
sheet flow visualization technique and will be analyzed with automated image
processing. The results can be used for the performance optimization of melt-
particle mixing in gas-stirred tanks with throughflow. Applications of the study
include ladle metallurgy, such as desulfurization of molten iron and steel, and
nonferrous industries, such as copper and aluminum processing.
