9414268 Montgomery This research covers a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary
activity ranging from the design, chemical synthesis and molecular
characterization of organic superconductors, to crystal growth and materials
characterization important to the fabrication of small-scalc electrical devices.
A long range goal of the research is to identify the factors that are esential
to making organic superconductors by design so that so that superconducting
or~anic materials with substantially higher transition temperatures can be
prepared. %%% In the last ten years tremendous strides have been made in raising
the superconducting transition temperature in both inorganic and organic
materials. Because of the higher temperatures that have been obtained with
inorganic materials, the majority of the research and theory development has
been in this area. This proposal covers the synthesis and characterization of
several classes of potential organic superconductors.
