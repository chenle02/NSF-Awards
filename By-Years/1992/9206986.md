The principal investigator will develop frequency domain techniques to study
uniform stability and robust stability for distributed parameter control
systems. These techniques will be used to study several stabilization questions
for mechanical system models. Control theory deals with the theoretical aspects
of understanding how complex systems learn about its environment, process the
information to reduce uncertainty, plan, generate and execute control actions.
It has played a major role in many areas of science and engineering.
