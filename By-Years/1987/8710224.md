A six-month program is planned for the summer faculty internship award in
tribology. The major objective of the training/research program is to acquire
in-depth knowledge of the experimental and computational research in tribology,
particularly in the areas of fluid inertia and viscoelasticity, thermal effects,
such as instability and property variation, thermal interaction between the
fluid film and surrounding environment, and high-resolution computational
techniques. The Institute for Wear Control and Tribology at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute will act as the host institution for the training and
research. A long-term computational and experimental research strategy will be
developed for complex thermohydrodynamic problems of greater concern and
immediate attention.
