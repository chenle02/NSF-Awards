The PI is proposing to study questions in combinatorial representation theory
which arise from problems in mathematical physics, in particular, exactly
solvable two-dimensional models in statistical mechanics and conformal field
theory. Representations studied inlcude finite-dimensional and integrable
modules of affine Lie algebras, loop algebras, and quantum affine algebras.
Questions addressed include the Feigin Loktev conjecture for fusion product,
formulas for refined (generalizations of) Littlewood-Richardson coefficients,
fermionic character formulas for integrable modules of affine algebras,
refinements of the Feigin-Stoyanovsky construction, and semi-infinite wedge
products. The combinatorial questions include identities for certain fermionic
sum formulas for multiplicity coefficients of KR-modules and their
generalizations. A component of the project is a representation-theoretical
construction of Baxter's matrices for generalized vertex models and the
associated functional equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrable models in
statistical mechanics and quantum field theory arise in various contexts in
physics and mathematics. Most recently, in the study of SLE, the fractional
quantum Hall effect, models for entanglement in quantum mechanics and string
theory. These models, which gave rise to the invention of quantum groups, have
remarkable combinatorial properties and have been a fertile ground for studying
properties of representations of Lie algebras and their deformations, as well as
combinatorial and algebraic identities. For example the fermionic character
formulas mentioned above are intimately related to fractional statistics or
anyons.
