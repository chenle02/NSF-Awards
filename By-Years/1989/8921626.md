The NBER Summer Institute brings together economists from universities,
government and international organizations for a few days or a few weeks of
seminars, workshops, conferences and collaborative research. Last year's Summer
Institute included 603 economists from 158 universities and nonacademic
institutions around the world. Of these, 215 attended for the first time. A
similar number is expected to attend this summer. Special efforts are made to
include young economists. The Summer Institute is organized into seven programs:
economic fluctuations, economic history, financial markets and monetary
economics, taxation, international studies, labor studies and productivity. Each
program has its own group of participants and its own structure. Although there
is considerable variation among programs, a typical Summer Institute program
will last for one to three weeks, with seminars each morning and afternoon
devoted to individual research. Some programs conclude with a more formal
conference. Programs may include a variety of subjects or they may be organized
around a specific topic. The Summer Institute provides a unique opportunity for
economists to work closely with others in their areas of specialty for extended
and generally intense periods of research. Although numerous conferences permit
researchers a few hours in which to exchange ideas, only NBER's Summer Institute
lasts long enough to allow serious collaboration among economists from several
institutions. While there are of course presentations of work nearing
completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of the program, where new
ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed and plans for joint
or coordinated research efforts are established.
