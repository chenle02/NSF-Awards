Simulation of Hydrogen and Helium in the Interior of Giant Planets

ABSTRACT

An improved equation of state for hydrogen-helium mixtures at high temperatures
and pressures will be developed. This will be accomplished using newly developed
first principle techniques employing many body simulations (path integral Monte
Carlo techniques at higher temperatures and density functional molecular
dynamics at lower temperatures). The results will be applied to three
outstanding problems in planetary astronomy:

1) Does Jupiter have a core and did it emerge from core accretion?

2) What are the properties of the metallic to molecular transition in hydrogen
inside giant planets and how does it affect the distribution of helium?

3) What mechanism prolonged Saturn's cooling (observed to be twice as long as
predicted)?

Moreover, equations of state for degenerate hydrogen-helium mixtures developed
here will be critical components in models of extrasolar giant planets. These
results are expected to significantly improve our ability to constrain the
physical properties of these planets from transit and radial velocity data.

The final equations of state and the software to interpolate among them will be
placed on the web for public use.
