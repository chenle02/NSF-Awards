This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Braas to initiate independent
studies of peptide biosynthetic enzyme expression in hypertension and
hyperactivity, using inbred strains of rats which express spontaneous
hypertension as a model system. It is anticipated that this award will help Dr.
Braas obtain the preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research
career.
