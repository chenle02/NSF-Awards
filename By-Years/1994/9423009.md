9423009: Sudderth Abstract. Research is planned in abstract gambling theory (a
particular formulation of stochastic control), stochastic games, and the
foundations of Bayesian statistics. Part of the research aims for a better
understanding of a new algorithm which can be used to calculate the optimal
reward function in gambling theory and also to calculate the value function for
a large class of two-person, zero-sum stochastic games. Research is also planned
on a class of many-person, noncooperative games that can be used to study
questions in the theory of money and financial institutions. Finally, research
is planned on certain problems in the foundations of statistical inference.
Research is planned on fundamental questions about how to make optimal decisions
through time in the presence of uncertainty. Abstract gambling theory treats
problems in which a single decision maker seeks to control a process so as to
reach a desired objective. In stochastic games, two or more decision act to
control a process and may have opposing interests. The mathematical theory of
such problems is quite technical, but solutions are of interest in many areas
including business, economics and operations research.
