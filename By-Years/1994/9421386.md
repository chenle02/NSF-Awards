9421386 Gates The goal of this research is to explored aspects of supersymmetry,
supergravity and superstring theory where there is a substantial overlap between
the three areas. The primary purpose of this research is to increase our
understanding of supersymmetry as a principle that can be realized in theories
of Nature. There presently appear to be two candidate area where this seems
likely to occur; (a.) superstring-unified field models of the fundamental forces
and elementary particle and (b.) integrable and soluble systems such as
nonlinear wave propagation in hydrodynamics and plasma systems. To facilitate
these investigations, techniques from quantum field theory, tensor analysis and
superspace geometric analysis will be utilized. ***
