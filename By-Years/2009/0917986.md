This special project develops two case studies on the sustainability of digital
resources focusing specifically on the sciences. The subject of the first case
study is an online resource called ebird, operated by Cornell University's Lab
of Ornithology. The website relies on the volunteer contributions of
professional and amateur bird watchers to amass data on bird abundance and
distribution, and is notable for its sharp focus on users and for utilizing a
variety of revenue strategies. The second case focuses on the NSDL Middle School
Pathway which is of interest as a case study because of the way their leaders
have actively and creatively engaged in developing new sustainability
strategies. The research analyzes the successes and challenges of different
sustainability strategies and revenue models, and point the way toward best
practices for supporting online resources.
