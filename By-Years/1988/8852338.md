The new instruments provided through this award, along with equipment already
held by the department, is supporting the creation of an important new central
laboratory facility for teaching cellular biology. The facility serves seven
upper biology component. Of these courses, four use the facility on a full-time
basis; the remaining three courses utilize the facility on a pre-arranged
academic schedule to conduct laboratory exercises which require cell biology
instrumentation. The new equipment is being used for the preparation and
analysis of living cells. Major items include laminar flow hoods, a fluorescence
microscope, an infrared gas analyzer, and a scanning spectrophotometer. As a
direct result of the acquisition of this equipment, the core curriculum in cell
biology is being substantially upgraded. The project permits the development of
new cell biology experiments, lower division demonstrations, and the improvement
of existing lab exercises. These improvements are bringing stte-or-the-art
techniques to the curriculum and reinforcing the teaching of modern cell biology
principles, thus better preparing undergraduates for future jobs and/or graduate
studies. The grantee is matching the NSF award with a slightly greater sum
obtained from non-Federal sources.
