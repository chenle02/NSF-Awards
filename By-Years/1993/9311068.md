Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a Controlled Stress
Rheometer is to be purchased for use in the PI's departmental laboratory in
several projects. The projects are all in the area of coatings and ceramic
suspensions. They include microgels for coatings, evaluation of floculants, and
liquid composites for better fiber spinnability. The issue in these areas is
quantifying particle interactions in concentrated dispersions. The relevance of
the research is to more environmentally friendly coatings, and better polymer
fibers for a variety of industrial uses.
