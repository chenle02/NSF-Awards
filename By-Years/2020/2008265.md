Machine Learning (ML) is being used in new ways to develop intelligent software.
Meanwhile, serverless computing is redefining how to use cloud computing
platforms. With serverless computing, ML specialists only need to define a set
of stateless functions that have access to a common data store. Current ML
software systems are generally specialized for first-generation cloud computing
systems that do not have the flexibility required for serverless
infrastructures. This project aims to take advantage of serverless computing to
deploy machine learning software. This simplifies the deployments, avoids the
need for infrastructure maintenance, and includes built-in scalability and cost-
control.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Due to the ease of management and ability to
rapidly scale, serverless computation has become the trend to build next-
generation ML services and applications. This project proposes a unified
serverless computing framework that aims to be flexible, agile and efficient for
moving ML into the next-generation cloud to achieve better simplicity,
manageability and productivity. In particular, to bridge the semantic gap
between the serverful ML model and the serverless cloud platform, this project
identifies three major tasks: fine-grained computation management, an efficient
communication strategy and a cost-effective service model.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project aims for widespread serverless computing by removing
server and operation system level details and simplifying the process of
building and managing ML applications. It is a continuum along which developers
and operations teams become more accustomed to increased automation and
abstraction, and more comfortable breaking ML applications into simple, easy-to-
manage microservices, application interfaces, and functions. The result is that
developers are free to target the right tools for the right tasks and to build
ML applications easily that span any number of different serverless
services.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project emphasizes open-source software
development. This will enhance the access to stream data analytic frameworks and
broaden the projectâ€™s impact. Furthermore, the models and workloads/traces from
this project may enable further research by others. The project
repository[https://abclab-uncc.github.io/website/grants.html] (data, code,
results, emulators, and simulators) will be maintained in the next 5
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
