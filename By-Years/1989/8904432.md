Investigations of Carboniferous sediments in Colorado and New Brunswick Canada
have constrained the age of the lower boundary of the Permo-Carboniferous
Reversed Superchron (PCRS) to be Morrowan in age. A reversal sequence has been
determined from Upper Mississippian and Lowermost Pennsylvanian of the
Maringuoin Peninsula which is 50% normal and reversed. This research will extend
this sequence upward so as to determine unambiguously the lower limit of the
PCRS and to correlate this sequence to similar age sediments in Pennsylvania,
Arizona and Nevada. This research will calibrate biostratigraphic zonations with
an absolute chronology and thus improve our ability to date upper Paleozoic
events.
