Ninth grade physical science modules will be developed and tested with the dual
objectives of bringing new content into the subject and of involving students in
computer usage in a way which will help prepare them for entry into today's
computer-based job world. These modules will be developed by the New York Board
of Education staff in partnership with IBM for computer expertise, the New York
Academy of Sciences and Columbia University School of Engineering for technical
content guidance, and Hofstra &amp; Hunter Colleges for input from research on
computer-aided learning. Fourteen modules will prepared, test- taught, revised
as needed, and issued. Teachers in each borough will be given necessary training
to allow introduction into the regular curriculum. The modules will also be made
available for dissemination outside the New York City system. Cost sharing by
the New York City Board of Education and IBM will total $195% of the NSF
funding.
