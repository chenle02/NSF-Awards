IBN-9630161 PI: Yedvobnik A fundamental question in developmental biology is
how cells choose to develop into specific types. For example, the earliest
stages of neural development involve a decision-making process. Groups of
uncommitted cells must decide whether to enter a neural pathway of development,
or choose an alternate pathway that ends with epidermal (skin) development. Such
processes are essential and are shared by a wide range of organisms. In
Drosophila this decision is regulated by a group of genes called the neurogenic
loci, that apparently mediate intercellular communication. Molecular studies of
these loci have demonstrated that they encode membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear
proteins, consistent with their role in cell communication.The mastermind (mam)
gene is a member of the neurogenic loci and codes for a protein with a novel
structure. Interestingly, it is the only member of the neurogenic loci where
sequence information has not provided a clear model for function. Consequently,
additional functional studies of mam are necessary. It is expected that a
complete characterization of the mam protein will provide new insights into
neural development in Drosophila and probably other organisms. Although a large
body of information is available on most of these genes, the role of the
neurogenic locus mastermind (mam), has remained enigmatic. mam shows genetic
interactions with a number of other neurogenic loci, suggesting that it plays an
integral role in the pathway. mam codes for a nuclear protein which has been
demonstrated to bind multiple chromosome sites. These data suggest a role in
gene regulation. Using genetic and molecular approaches the site of mam action
within the pathway will be defined, and also t several hypotheses of mam
function will be tested. Genetic studies will be used to position mam function
relative to the linear sequence of action of other neurogenic proteins. Analysis
of physical associations between mam and other neurogenic proteins will be used
to test hypotheses of mam function. In combination with other work in progress
these studies will provide significant insight into the mode of action of this
unusual protein.
