A three-manifold is a space where an object can move around in three distinct
perpendicular directions. The universe that we inhabit is a three-manifold whose
global structure we do not yet understand. Thanks to powerful theorems by
Thurston, Perelman, and Mostow, we do know that the geometry of a manifold
(measurements of angles, distances, and curvature) is closely tied to its large-
scale structure. What is missing at this point is a quantitative understanding
of how geometry and large-scale topology determine one another. This project
seeks quantitative information of this nature. It contains suitable sub-projects
for graduate students.

More specifically, this project seeks to make progress on several fundamental
questions involving the geometry of negatively curved three-manifolds and their
fundamental groups. One question involves quantitative control on the change in
geometry under Dehn surgery, including applications to the cosmetic surgery
conjecture. A second question involves understanding Kleinian groups in which
two independent elements move a point by a small distance, with applications to
bounding the Margulis constant. A third question involves a quantitative
understanding of the way in which three-manifold groups act on CAT(0) cube
complexes, with an eye toward developing tools for the Cannon conjecture.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
