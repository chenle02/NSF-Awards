9418778 O'Leary This starter grant award to Pomona College will support the
research of Professor Daniel O'Leary. The major focus of the research will be
the synthesis and characterization of oligomeric model systems to better
understand the solution properties of helical poly-(alkylisocyanates). The
driving force for the helical preference is the minimization of steric repulsion
of proximal pendant groups. Steric interactions at the microscopic level will be
accurately assessed with dynamic NMR measurements and single-crystal X-ray
crystallography. Controlled chemical synthesis of model oligomers will provide
microscopic information on the structure and backbone dynamics of polyisocyanate
and advance our understanding of phenomena such as the novel directing efects of
tiny proportions of chiral monomers upon the overall chain conformation,
amplification of a small per-residue deuterium isotope effect, and the solvent
dependence of helix persistence length.
