IBN 97-29344 Neural Regulation of Adrenocortical Cell Functions Recent studies
indicate that the autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system
contributes to the regulation of the cells of endocrine glands. In particular,
the PI has discovered that autonomic nerves control proliferation and secretion
of corticosteroids by the cells of the adrenal cortex. These autonomic nerves
include both sympathetic nerves and the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.
In these studies, the PI's propose to determine the mechanisms used by nerves to
stimulate these adrenocortical cell activities. Four general questions are
addressed: (1) Is the cell proliferation regulated by sympathetic nerve activity
and by which neurotransmitter? (2) Does the growth factor, bFGF, play a role?
(3) Do the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla contribute to the regulation
of adrenocortical cell secretion? (4) What signal transduction pathway is turned
on by the chromaffin cell activity? In order to study the direct neural-
adrenocortical cell interactions, the PIs will use their recently established
co-cultures of nerve and adrenocortical cells for these studies. Taken together,
these studies will contribute to the overall understanding of how endocrine
gland function is controlled and the mechanisms by which the central nervous
system exerts this regulatory function.
