Abstract OPP-9707960 Koester/Syron This dissertation research studies the
development of Magadan, Siberia as a penal colony in the Stalinist period and
evaluates the role of memories of this experience in the historical
consciousness, social relations, and institutions of Magadan. As rapid social,
political, and economic transformation takes place in Russia, memories of Soviet
times are affecting and selectively being brought to bear on the present. By
observing the effects and studying the conscious deployment od these memories,
the project offers insight into the impact of socialist and nationalist
ideologies, state policies of cultural reform and social construction, and the
construction of historical representation, individual experience, and personal
memory. These are addressed using personal testimonies of ex-prisoners and early
residents, in-depth interviewing, and archival research.
