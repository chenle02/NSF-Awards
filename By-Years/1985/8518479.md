In the operation of rechargeable batteries it is desirable to keep the surfaces
of the electrodes as flat as possible. Unfortunately, in real systems a major
problem is the formation of dendrites (whiskers or columns) of material on the
electrode surface; this reduces efficiency and greatly shortens battery
lifetimes. This project will examine the suppression of dendrites by the use of
special flow patterns. The approach is both theoretical and experimental.
