This project is designed to strengthen the teaching of biology at the college.
Students in upper-division courses often tend to compartmentalize the concepts
and laboratory skills learned in one course and do not carry them over to the
problems encountered in other courses. This project develops a series of
experiments that involve the laboratory students of two different courses within
the same semester. In addressing a routine problem, students in Course 1
identify an aspect of the problem that is beyond the scope of their course. They
engage the students in Course 2, who bring the techniques and expertise of their
course to the problem-solving process. The students in the two courses work
collaboratively to address the problem, each using their specialized knowledge
base, problem-solving skills and experimental approaches. The project targets
students enrolled in one 200-level course (Microbiology) or one of four 300- or
400-level courses (Cell Biology, Genetics, Biochemistry and Developmental
Biology). Assistance was received in the C. elegans experiments from Andrew
Fire, Ph.D., at the Carnegie Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. This series of
laboratory sequences affects the biology students in several ways. Students are
challenged to integrate concepts and skills across the various disciplines of
the biological sciences. They use the same experimental organisms in the
laboratory component of several courses and come to an understanding of the
general applicability of these model systems in biological research. They use
many of the same techniques of cell and molecular biology to address a variety
of problems. They are required to communicate their experimental findings
clearly to their collaborators in the cross-over lab, thus strengthening their
writing and oral communication skills. This approach to teaching can be adopted
by other institutions that are interested in the development of their students
as active biologists.
