A major challenge for ecologists is to understand the effects that environmental
stressors have on community structure and function. This research will determine
how a novel stressor - increased atmospheric deposition of nitrogen - is
altering the dynamics of the detritus-based food web associated with the
northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. Three different types of analyses
are proposed to address hypotheses related to the trophic dynamics of pitcher
plan communities. A field 'pulse' experiment will manipulate the species
composition of the food web and the source of nitrogen. Nitrogen isotopes will
be used to reveal the movement of nitrogen derived from anthropogenic sources
and from prey. A greenhouse 'press' experiment will measure the effects of
different food web structures on nutrient uptake and growth of pitcher plants.
Experimental results will be used to develop models of community assembly and of
food web dynamics. The proposed research will reveal the importance of
anthropogenic stressors on co-evolved systems and contribute to a deeper
understanding of the contrasting effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on the
dynamics of non-equilibrial assemblages. The research will result in general
models that can be applied to other ecological communities experiencing novel
stressors. It will involve graduate and undergraduate students in supervised and
independent research.
