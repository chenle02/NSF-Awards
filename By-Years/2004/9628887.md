ABSTRACT PI: Hoogland Proposal Number: 9628887 Because they radically modify
the vegetation and are the primary food for numerous predators, prairie dogs are
important members of the ecosystem of Western North America. However, shooting,
poisoning, and destruction of habitat have drastically reduced prairie dog
populations, and two species are threatened with extinction. Information
necessary for the conservation of prairie dogs will result from the proposed
research. In certain prairie dog populations, mothers sometimes kill the
unweaned offspring of other mothers. Such infanticide sometimes accounts for the
elimination of as many as 22% of all Litters born. Research to investigate
infanticide will be conducted with several prairie dog populations. Prairie dog
colonies crash after outbreaks of bubonic plaque. Information on this important
source of mortality will result from tracking of colonies that were ravaged by
plaque in 1995.
