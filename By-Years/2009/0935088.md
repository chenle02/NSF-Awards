This engineering education research award to Michigan Technological University
will develop problem based learning modules that integrate sustainability and
sustainable design into three mechanical engineering courses spanning the
sophomore through senior years. The goal is to teach sustainability as an
integral part of the day-to-day decision-making and analyses that are
fundamental to mechanical engineering, rather than as a secondary concern. The
mechanical engineering curriculum will be enriched by content that has a direct
benefit to society, thus becoming more appealing to prospective students. The
overall goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering
through developing their understanding of environmental sustainability. These
techniques are expected to increase students' interest in engineering and will
enhance the number who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill
engineering jobs.
