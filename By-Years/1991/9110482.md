This research project examines some of the basic high level computer vision
problems associated with the task of manipulating and assembling structural
frames under autonomous visual control. The approach treats high level vision as
uncertain inference. Uncertainties arising from the sensing process and scene
itself are explicitly represented and resolved with prior knowledge at a high
level of abstraction. The uncertain inference process are realized as a parallel
network, based on a Markov Random Field formalism. The structure assembly domain
focuses attention on geometric reasoning about spatial relationships between
parts, particularly in the presence of uncertainty. Finally, the assembly task
provides a functional goal that can define criteria for deciding when too much
uncertainty is present. This provides a rationale for planning and acquiring new
images in an active framework. This research could have a significant impact on
the flexibility of future computer vision systems, and may also increase our
understanding of human high level vision.
