This project will analyze previously collected data from SOFAR floats and
current meters located in the eastern subtropical Atlantic Ocean. The advection
and diffusion of the subsurface tongue formed by Mediterranean Water will be
emphasized. Also simulation of float tracks will be calculated using results of
the Community Modeling Effort solution for the same region.
