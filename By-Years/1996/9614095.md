This travel grant will provide partial support to about 70 U.S. participants
attending the 1996 International Union for Radio Science (URSI) General Assembly
in Lille, France from August 28 to September 5, 1996. The ten U.S. URSI
commissions select candidates, whose applications are reviewed by the travel
grant committee of the U.S. National Committee for URSI. Speakers invited by
URSI receive primary consideration, but grants are also awarded to younger, less
established scientists and engineers to increase their knowledge of
international activities in their fields, and encourage interactions with their
foreign counterparts.
