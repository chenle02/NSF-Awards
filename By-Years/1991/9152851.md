An electroanalyzer will give students experience in the use of modern
electrochemical instrumentation. Students in analytical chemistry courses will
use the instrument to perform a polarography experiment, a cyclic voltammetry
experiment, and a coulometry experiment. Students in an instrumentation course
will perform experiments in differential pulse polarography and differential
pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. The grantee will match the NSF award from
non-Federal sources.
