This project is expanding an existing partnership between Baton Rouge Community
College Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Division (BRCC-STEM)
and Louisiana State University College of Engineering (LSU-CoE) to increase STEM
students' completion of two year Associates of Science (AS) and Applied Science
(AAS) Degrees at BRCC and four year Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees at LSU
(emphasizing Engineering/Construction Management - E/CM). One project outcome is
to increase the number of BRCC AS/AAS E/CM graduates to 25 annually who have
strong academic foundations for further E/CM study at LSU. For LSU, the goal is
to improve the overall 2nd-3rd year retention and ultimately the cumulative 6th
year graduation rate in engineering by 2-3% annually to the current university
average for all entering freshmen (59%). Grounded in the "sense of community"
lessons learned from an earlier STEP project, the results of small group
discussions with BRCC students and research-based educational practices, these
goals are being met through the following actions: 1) designing and implementing
a pre-engineering learning community at BRCC; 2) integrating supplemental
instruction/academic support such as Peer Lead Team Learning (PLTL) in core
STEM/Engineering courses at both institutions; 3) expanding faculty development
opportunities and supporting faculty-student interaction/collaboration across
institutions that improves student learning; 4) providing the environment and
training necessary to develop mentoring relationships among students
(particularly transfer students), faculty and practicing professional/industry
partners; and 5) implementing mechanisms for effective monitoring and continuous
improvement. This project is serving as a model for STEM Student Success.
