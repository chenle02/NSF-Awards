This is a Major Research Instrumentation award to enable the design and
construction of a new instrument for measuring the activity spectrum of cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN). The principle of operation is that air is drawn
slowly and continuously through a thermal-gradient diffusion chamber in which
the supersaturation increases with increasing distance into the chamber. At the
exit of the chamber, the cloud droplets that have formed are counted and sized
with an optical particle counter. A mathematical inversion procedure is then
used to compute the CCN spectrum from the measured droplet spectrum, assuming a
relationship between the size of a droplet and the critical supersaturation at
which it formed. The proposed instrument is an improvement over existing designs
for two reasons: modern digital electronics will be used for particle detection
and counting, and by use of concentric cylindrical walls the cloud chamber will
be in the shape of an annulus instead of a simple rectangular channel. The
advantage of the annular shape is that undesirable edge effects associated with
side walls are eliminated. The information provided by the instrument is
fundamental for cloud microphysics and also bears on the way aerosol particles
and their radiative effects are treated in numerical climate models.
