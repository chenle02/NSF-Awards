ABSTRACT CTS-9700504 Funding is requested for a thermal anemometer system to
measure the fluctuating temperature and velocity components in a fluctuating
flow field. The equipment will be used to study transition from laminar to
turbulent flow over a heated plate under adverse or favorable pressure
gradients. Experimental data obtained using the equipment will be used to
establish a criterion for the transition to occur. The work is relevant to flow
over gas turbine blades.
