The International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software
(ISPASS), a premier forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial research
focused on performance analysis of computer systems and software, seeks to
increase student participation in symposium and the field. The conference will
be held from March 29-31, 2015 in Philadelphia, PA. The proposed funding would
support the travel of up to 15 eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients
would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel
grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in
the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their
participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort
will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities.
Furthermore, support from this grant will also be available to provide companion
funding for attendees with disabilities and/or parental responsibility for an
infant less than one year old. These efforts are anticipated to broaden the
participation in the conference and, by extension, the research field.
