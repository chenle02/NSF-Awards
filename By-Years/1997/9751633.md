Past research has indicated that the most comprehensive simulation is motion
picture with sound. Nondigital video, however, does not allow the viewer any
selectivity. Digital video gives the user the greatest freedom to select what he
or she wishes to see, in both a linear and nonlinear approach. This project
provides the computer-based technology tools to introduce and integrate digital
media into undergraduate architectural education. With new technologies, the
project raises the level of instruction from traditional media to electronic
media to explore new areas in architectural education to provide a more
comprehensive, enriched learning environment for students. *
