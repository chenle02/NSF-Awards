During the last few years, the Ocean Drilling Program has employed a sampling
strategy in which bathymetric transects are drilled on aseismic ridges in order
to reconstruct the Cenozoic history of carbonate production and dissolution, and
deep water chemistry and circulation. This strategy has evolved from similar
shallow coring programs examining late Quaternary oceanographic history.
Carbonate accumulation in the shallowest sites of the depth transect
approximates carbonate productivity in the overlying waters. If the sites are
close together and only vary in depth, the accumulation rates will record
carbonate dissolution which will be controlled by changes in bottom water
chemistry. The objective of the present project is to acquire seismic data and
core samples from the Ceara Rise in the western equatorial Atlantic. The Ceara
Rise is capped by a thick section of Cenozoic sediments and should be an ideal
site for a depth transect study. Additionally, the data to be acquired will form
the basis for a detailed ODP drilling program which has been proposed for this
area.
