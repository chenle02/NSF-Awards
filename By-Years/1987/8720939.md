To enhance our understanding of the operation of the criminal justice system,
systematic study of the way ethnicity affects victimization and punishments is
needed. Examining the experiences of ethnic groups, Dr. McKanna studies
homicides and lynchings in nineteenth century California, within two mining camp
areas and, during a period in which Hispanic dominance of agriculture was being
replaced by Anglo dominance, in the coastal regions. The data sources being used
by this investigator are rich and varied, including county registers of
indictments, coroners' reports, prison files, and records on applications for
pardons as well as newspaper accounts and secondary sources. This period in
Californian history (1850-1900) is a particularly ripe context for examining the
interrelationship between ethnicity, violence, and mechanisms of social control
because it was a time in which power relationships were in flux, and there were
social tensions surrounding race and ethnicity. Dr. McKanna's research
contributes to our understanding of violent crime and the operation of the
criminal justice system by carefullly considering the important questions of
what the role of ethnicity is in homicides and whether minorities receive equal
justice before the law.
