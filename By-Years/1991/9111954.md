Dr. Midkiff will conduct research on genetic and experiential antecedents of
salt preference. Her experiments will examine the effect of sodium deprivation
during gestation and lactation, with periodic sodium repletion, on the long-term
salt preference of rats. Two genetic strains of laboratory rats will be used:
Fischer-344, which do not spontaneously prefer salt solutions in any
concentration, and outbred Wistar rats, which prefer and copiously ingest salt
solutions at hypotonic and isotonic concentrations. Rats from both strains
reared on a sodium- deficient diet will be compared with control animals
receiving the same diet with 1% salt added. This study is designed to determine
whether early experience with salt can alter salt preference in adulthood.
Previous studies have not found any long-term alteration in salt ingestion as a
result of early experience, although two studies have described an alteration in
water ingestion. Dr. Midkiff's preliminary studies indicate that long-term salt
preference may altered, at least in Wistar rats, by post-weaning sodium
deprivation and repletion. Results from this study will be used to direct
further research into the limits of behavioral change based on early experience,
and into the genetic origins of salt preference.
