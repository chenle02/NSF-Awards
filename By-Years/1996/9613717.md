AST 96-13717. California Institute of Technology. PI: N. Z. Scoville
Astronomical Research with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array This award supports
research, technological development and student education at the California
Institute of Technology's Owens Valley millimeter array. The array is made up of
6 precision 10.4m-diameter antennas, which currently can be positioned out to
maximum spacings of 220m north-south and 200m east-west. All the telescopes are
equipped with dual-channel (2.6 and 1.3mm) cryogenic SiS receivers. At the
shorter wavelength, the highest angular resolution attainable by the array is
0.7 arcseconds. Approximately 50% of the array's observing time is presently
devoted to investigations by non-Caltech astronomers. During the tenure of the
past three year grant, the Owens Valley array has obtained aperture synthesis
images of molecular emission in domains ranging from comets to the envelopes of
evolved stars, to star-forming regions in the Galaxy, as well as the spiral arms
and active nuclei of other galaxies. The array has also been used for extensive
studies of active galactic nuclei, starburst and ultraluminous galaxies at high
redshifts. During the last grant period, the observatory also made a number of
technical advances, including the development of the ability to observe
simultaneously at 1 and 3mm, doubling the continuum bandwidth to 2 GHz, and
installing automated tuning and full LO coverage. An active system to compensate
for atmospheric phase fluctuations was also designed and installation begun. In
the next three year grant period the observatory's scientific programs will
continue to include studies of high redshift extragalactic systems, protostars
and star- forming regions and their associated protoplanetary nebulae, the
structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, collimated outflows from young stars,
interstellar chemistry and a variety of solar system objects.
