The proposed project lies in the area of dynamical systems and also involves
number theory. The main objects are algebraic actions on tori and other
homogeneous spaces by higher-rank commutative groups. The studies of such
actions have contributed signi cantly to advances both in dynamical sytems and
in Diophantine approximations. This research aims to investigate rigidity of
these systems, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of invariant objects
under the action. The main goal is to shed light on how higher-rank,
hyperbolicity and irreducibility, the three typical conditions required in order
for an action to enjoy rigidity, balance among themselves and quantitatively a
ffect rigidity properties.

The field of dynamical system studies long-term trajectories of points evolving
over time according to certain given rules. Having its origin in Newton's
mechanical laws, the subject has found numerous applications in physics,
biology, economics and other sciences. The proposed research will focus on
dynamical systems of arithmetic nature. In other words, the rules of evolution
can be characterized by a set of integers and rational numbers. By studying
dynamical behaviors of such systems, one expects to discover number-theoretical
properties. This work also seeks to strengthen the connections between ergodic
theory, number theory, Lie groups, Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics
by combining methods from these mathematical branches. The PI intends to develop
expository notes, as well as to teach graduate-level courses on relevant topics
during the project.
