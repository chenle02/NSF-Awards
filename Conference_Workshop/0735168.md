Group Representations and Combinatorics at the University of Florida in Sept.
2007. This conference will provide a venue for experts in diverse areas of
algebra and combinatorics to disseminate their research and learn the important
problems and latest methods of the other groups, with the goal of strengthening
the intellectual ties among the represented areas. The broader impacts which we
hope this conference would have are as follows. (a) The diversity of the
participants should foster increased collaboration across disciplines; (b) The
inclusion of many expository talks will give students and new PhDs a good view
of the forefront of research in some parts of Algebra and Combinatorics and a
chance to meet and talk with leaders in the field. (c) Participation in a
conference of this kind may potentially attract talented graduate students to
these fields of mathematics.
