The primary purpose of the proposed research is the determination of the
requirement for acceleration of particles, especially electrons during solar
flares, which is as yet an unsolved problem. Theoretical studies will be made of
the interaction of accelerated particles with ambient plasma including
interactions with particles, waves, and large scale magnetic fields. Comparison
with observed impulsive phase radiation such as X-rays, gamma rays, microwaves
and type III radiation is used for constraining the models and for determination
of the characteristics of the accelerated particles. Comparison will be made
with both old and new observations as they become available during the next
solar maximum, with the goal of obtaining more realistic models and furthering
investigation of the acceleration process. Results from this research should
have direct application to other areas of scientific research including solar
terrestrial relations, magnetospheric physics, stellar flares, gamma ray bursts
and activity in galactic nuclei.
