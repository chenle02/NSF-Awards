Let M be an irreducible highest weight representation of an affine Lie algebra.
This project is concerned with the inner ideal geometry in M and the associated
group G. The principal investigator will study the algebraic and topological
structure of M. She will also work on a characterization of the Kac-Moody group
associated with the affine Lie algebra in terms of inner ideal geometries. An
explicit description of the inner ideal geometry associated with M will be
derived. The research supported falls in the general area of geometric algebra
which is concerned with vector spaces, coordinatization, and the transformation
groups acting on the spaces. Questions concern both the underlying geometry and
the algebra.
