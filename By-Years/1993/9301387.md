9301387 Nowak There is a considerable degree of uncertainty involved in truck
loads. The control systems developed in this study includes passive and active
approaches. Passive control will include short- term and long-term monitoring of
truck loads: in particular, extreme truck loads, fatigue load spectra,
simultaneous occurrence of trucks, travel patterns and site specific difference
in order to improve highway management strategies. Field measurement will be
performed using the data acquisition systems available to the project team.
Special computer procedures will be developed for the signal analysis. The
developed system will perform two functions: measurement of truck loads (axle
loads, spacing, multiple presence) and evaluation of the structural performance
(diagnostics). Active control will include response to occurrence of critical
and undesirable events, as for example occurrence of an overloaded truck. Using
existing lines of communication on selected bridges (owned by State DOT), the
results will be transferred to the State DOT office with the request for action
(further inspection, lane closure or bridge closure).
