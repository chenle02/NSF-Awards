This award supports an innovative science/community partnership through the
Barbuda Research Complex (a collaborative partnership of researchers from the
City University of New York and key community stakeholders in Barbuda, West
Indies) that would facilitate the development of immersive science research
opportunities for informal education on active field research conducted in
Barbuda over the past seven years. For the last four years, the PI has been
engaged in an Arctic Social Science Program supported REU Site project "Islands
of Change," which explored the teleconnections between Arctic human ecodynamic
systems and those of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Although the
community of Barbuda is a long way from the Arctic in miles, Perdikaris makes
these connections salient by borrowing conceptually from the UN's program "Many
Strong Voices" (MSV). MSV is a program that connects Arctic communities and SIDS
communities because of the comparable social and cultural challenges they face
being on the front line of rapid environmental change. This project is in direct
response to the Barbudan community's expressed need for sustained science
education opportunities, which happen outside of the classroom and beyond the
field season. The PI and her research team have developed a model for community
engagement, which culminates in a permanent educational legacy for research
projects, envisioned as an education and museum space that would use placed-
based learning techniques to communicate understanding of science to a public
audience. In addition, the PI and her research team proposes to create an
exhibition in Barbuda, which incorporates traditional and local knowledge that
will ultimately travel to Iceland in collaboration with the Husavik Museum,
which will significantly broadening the reach of the exhibition, modeling
knowledge exchange between the two regions over the course of science research
projects.
