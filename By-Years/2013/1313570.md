Researchers are developing a cyber-infrastructure product that uses a Smartphone
application in conjunction with a cloud-based counterpart to provide real-time
information about people and places surrounding a user during the course of the
day. This technology uses real-time semantic analysis and fuzzy logic to present
the user with only the attributes of people and places that are of potential
interest or benefit to the user. During the course of this project researchers
plan to develop a framework capable of handling large volumes of short messages
that can be processed in a short time and create a cloud-based infrastructure to
perform real-time semantic profile matching to handle the workload created by
all users registered with the network. Researchers also plan to design network
architecture and protocols to facilitate the communication of potentially large
amounts of data from multiple users with minimal interference in a relatively
small spatial location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often find themselves in
large groups in both professional and social settings, for example, at
conferences, shopping malls, airports, and sporting events. Several people in
these groups might share similar professional, social, and/or extracurricular
interests and such knowledge could be beneficial to all. For instance, a
researcher could find a potential collaborator, a businessperson a potential
client, a student a room-mate and so on. This technology has the potential to
enable people from all walks of life to establish new, meaningful relationships
with others in their vicinity, thereby potentially impacting the human
networking paradigm in both the social and professional context.
