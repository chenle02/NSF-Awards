9504186 Kiousis A fundamental experimental and theoretical study on high-
strength (HS) concrete structures is conducted in this project. In the first
part of this research, basic triaxial testing will be performed on HS concrete
to evaluate its lateral expansion tendencies and ability to gain ductility with
increased confinement. A theoretical analysis based on a simple plasticity model
and the compatibility of deformations of the concrete core and the transverse
reinforcement will compliment the experimental work. The second part of the
research will concentrate on the testing of HS concrete structural elements that
are subjected to combined axial compression and shear loading. A theoretical
analysis, based on the concepts developed will be performed to predict the
response of HS concrete structural elements. The research is expected to
contribute to the development of reliable code provisions for the design of HS
concrete structural elements. ***
