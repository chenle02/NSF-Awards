Higher-order, typed, functional languages provide an abstract view of
computation that supports software engineering activities elegantly, and that is
amenable to formal verification. Such languages do not, however, support direct
control over computational resources as is needed in domains such as operating
systems, the Internet, and embedded systems. This project aims at augmenting
such languages with programming constructs, semantic models, compiling and
analysis tools for controlling computational resources, particularly space
usage. Despite its focus on functional languages, the research addresses a
problem common to other modern programming languages like Java that include
automatic space management. All such languages suffer from unpredictable space
behavior, which causes programmers to waste considerable resources on locating
suspected space leaks and optimizing space usage. Furthermore, many of the
methods, like the type-based encapsulation of memory threads, are mostly
language- independent, and hence universally applicable. Two of the potentially
most exciting applications of this language- supported encapsulation are the
guaranteeing of safety for mobile code on the Internet and the optimization of
parallel programs.
