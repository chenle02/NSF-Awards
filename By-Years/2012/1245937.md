This project is creating a suite of learning modules that highlight how
mathematics plays a role in understanding issues in sustainability and helping
to solve associated problems arising in that area. The modules are designed for
use in a stand-alone mode or in concert with one another to form a unit of study
stretching across multiple class periods. The units engage students in discovery
based learning, including active data collection, and they exploit technology
such as the use of Web-based mapping tools on mobile devices. Pilot testing is
taking place at a variety of institutions with faculty first attending workshops
where they collaboratively create materials. Through the use of established
assessment tools the project is adding to the knowledge base of research in STEM
undergraduate education by determining factors that address the effectiveness of
the modules in improving student knowledge and skills and in changing attitudes
about the usefulness of mathematics. The intellectual merit of the project lies
in its use of sustainability - a theme that spans the sciences and the social
sciences, and affects all individuals in their personal lives and as public
citizens, as the motivating context to engage student learning. The project
promises broad impact through its involvement of dozens of faculty members at a
diverse set of institutions for creating, testing, and subsequent implementation
of the modules.
