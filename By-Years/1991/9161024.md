The objective of the research is to explore the feasibility of developing
compact, high concentration, ozone generation equipment for the demanding
requirements of the semiconductor manufacturing and materials processing
industry. Emerging processing technologies using ozone chemistry have given rise
to the need for such equipment. Current generators are inadequate for the task
and too large to be installed in the clean room environment next to the chemical
vapor deposition system or other semiconductor tool. Current double-cooled
generator designs also require a dielectric coolant and a dedicated
recirculating oil cooling system to remove heat from the generator electrodes.
The experimental program will be directed toward establishing the feasibility of
developing a compact generator module and excitation source with the required
performance.
