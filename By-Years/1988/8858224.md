This action is to recommend a Presidential Young Investigator Award for Dr.
Christof Koch. Dr. Koch is one of the most outstanding young investigators in
the rapidly developing field of computational neuroscience. He combines a deep
knowledge of neurobiology with excellent mathematical skills and real expertise
in computer science. He has already created a classic work on the computational
of motion in the dendritic tree of retinal ganglion cells. His work on image
segmentation is very fundamental. Finally, his studies on the detailed
biophysics of the electrical interactions in neural spines is bringing a highly
quantitative approach to the study of learning in the nervous system.
