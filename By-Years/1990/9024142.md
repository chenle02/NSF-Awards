This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Janine
Shertzer of the Physics Department, the College of the Holy Cross. Dr. Shertzer
will continue to use the finite element method to investigate the helium atom,
positron scattering, the hydrogen atom in strong magnetic fields, quantum
heterostructures in the solid state, and the binding energy of the deutrium-
tritium-muon molecule. The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high
quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as potential
for continued significant contributions to scientific research, the academic
profession, and the education of future scientists. Particularly noteworthy
achievements are Dr. Shertzer teaching of upper-division courses, designing
courses for non-science majors, and her research in theoretical physics.
