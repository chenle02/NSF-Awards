A two-semester introductory level collegiate text is being developed which
introduces students to the principles and practices of mathematics. Providing a
breadth of mathematics, a course based on this text would be appropriate for all
students interested in mathematics. Represented in the text are various areas of
mathematics and applications which are presented as themes throughout the text,
rather than as distinct subject topics. The design, review, and field-test of
the text is being overseen by the author team and an advisory board. The project
is also receiving support from the Exxon Education Foundation.
