9504114 Wilkes This dissertation enhancement award supports a 6-month research
visit in Japan for Andrew Stachyra, a graduate student in the Department of
Physics at the University of Washington, who works under the direction of
Professor R. J. Wilkes. Mr. Stachyra will divide his time among three different
research sites over the course of his six month stay in Japan, during which he
will be sponsored by the Professor Yoji Totsuka, the head of the Super-
Kamiokande Group at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) in Tokyo.
Super-Kamiokande is a water Cherenkov detector to be located in the Kamioka
Mozumi mine in Japan. Super Kamiokande is expected to provide new information
that will be useful in the study of neutrino oscillations, in solar modeling, in
supernova modeling, and in setting new limits on nucleon decay partial
lifetimes. Mr. Stachyra will spend approximately one month at the ICRR learning
how the Japanese data acquisition equipment works, two months at the KEK
particle accelerator learning about and contributing to calibration experiments
being conducted with a smaller Cherenkov detector there, and about three months
will be spent at the mine site learning the details of detector construction
before data taking begins in April of 1996. Mr. Stachyra will learn the Japanese
style for constructing electronics for high energy physics experiments and will
be able to compare the Japanese system with the U.S. system. He will be able to
compare the advantages and drawbacks of both systems and learn when one is
preferred over the other. ***
