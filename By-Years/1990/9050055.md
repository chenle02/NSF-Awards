The Puerto Rico Center for Science and Engineering (RCSE) plans to develop,
test, and disseminate a 7-12th grade science and mathematics curriculum as a
pilot Center for the NSTA Scope, Sequence, and Coordination Project in an effort
to bring about major reforms in science and mathematics education. This project
will focus on grades 7-9, will utilize techniques developed in the Science,
Technology, and Society reform movement, and will integrate mathematics with the
sciences in its approach. Five curriculum teams will work closely with NSTA to
develop materials in Spanish which, after testing and refining, are to be
disseminated in Spanish and in English translation to mainland school districts.
