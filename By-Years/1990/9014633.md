This award enables Colby College to connect to NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per
second link to the mid-level network NEARnet, the New England Academic and
Research Network. Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and students with access
to supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network gateways, automated
library catalogs, and a wide range of software. The connection is particularly
important to Colby, which is located in a relatively remote section of the
country. It is of value to the natural science students and faculty, not only
giving access to supercomputers, but also in facilitating joint research with
distant collaborators, and providing them with immediate access to data
necessary to their work. The benefits accrue to the social science faculty and
students, including those in the humanities, especially in projects involving
quantitative applications. Further, as the competititon for the best faculty
grows stiffer each year, the connection to NEARnet and NSFNET will be a powerful
factor in Colby's success in recruiting outstanding faculty, particularly in the
sciences.
