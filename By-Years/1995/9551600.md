This proposal increases the conceptual understanding of students in the
introductory algebra-based physics course, the introductory calculus-based
physics course, and the survey of physics course (for non-science-majors) and
makes clearer at an earlier stage the connection between the scientific method
and the physics lab. This is accomplished by introduction of Workshop Physics,
Tools for Scientific Thinking, Real-Time Physics, and Microcomputer-Based
Laboratory curricula. Twelve Macintosh Quadras provide the heart of the new
physics laboratory, and a host of probes interfaced with the computers enables
the students to gather and reduce data for further analysis. Students in the
algebra- and calculus-based physics courses learn the greater percentage of
their physics from these labs, eliminating to a large extent the lecture
portions of these courses. The curricular materials are being locally modified
to restructure the lecture and laboratory presentation in the survey of physics
course for non-science-majors.
