Lightweight flexible manipulators are playing an important role in current and
future space activities. An existing example is the Shuttle Remote Manipulator
System (RMS) and future plans call for other RMS-like arms to automate space
operations, such as assembly. A key problem to be resolved is to dampen the
vibrations caused by the necessary long reach and lightweight construction of
the RMS system. The objective of this research project is to investigate the
potential passive damping characteristics of piezoelectric film coatings when
applied to flexible structural members. It is proposed to use a polymer film,
PVDF, which has piezoelectric characteristic, to dessipate vibrational energy by
means of an electric current. A layer of PVDF film applied to the surface of a
vibrating member will generate an electric current due to mechanical
deformations. The electric current can be passed through a passive impedance
thus dessipating vibrational energy thereby reducing the vibrations. Using PVDF
film to passively dampen vibrations is a new idea which has not been
investigated. The ultimate goal is to provide an easily implemented modification
to the RMS, or similar flexible manipulator that enhances performance without
significantly increasing system cost, weight, and complexity of control or
computational costs.
