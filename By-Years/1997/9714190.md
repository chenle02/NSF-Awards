This two-year US-France award supports the participation of US investigators in
research workshops addressing numerical analysis of stochastic differential
equations. The workshops, which take place in the US and France in 1998 and 1999
respectively, will be organized by Philip Protter of Purdue University and Denis
Talay of INRIA (the French National Institute for Research in Informatics and
Applied Mathematics). The workshops are aimed at recent developments in
simulation methods, approximation and numerical schemes. The area of stochastic
models has a variety of applications in economics (finance), interacting
particle systems, population genetics, and mathematical biology. The proposed
workshop will advance our knowledge of the use of stochastic modeling processes
in these and other disciplines in physics and engineering.
