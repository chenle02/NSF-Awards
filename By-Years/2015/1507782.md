Non-technical description: At temperatures near absolute zero, superconductors
conduct electricity without any resistance. This property is a consequence of a
particular interaction between electrons, which causes the electrons to organize
themselves into a collective state that renders them immune to scattering. In
nanoscale samples, the nature of this collective state is fragile and can be
manipulated by controlling the physical properties of the samples and their
environment. Using custom developed fabrication and measurement techniques with
unprecedented capabilities, this project aims to design, manipulate and
investigate collective quantum states of electrons in superconducting nanowires.
While serving to train students on cutting edge nanofabrication and low-
temperature measurement techniques, the research is focused on creating a model
system for a fundamental study of collective quantum states of electrons that
will bring about the possibilities of applications in novel logic, sensing and
quantum computing technologies.

Technical description: The project aims to tailor and tune the texture of the
superconducting order parameter by controlling the texture, the underlying
potentials and the boundary conditions. The research team has developed a
dynamic stencil deposition and controlled etching techniques, which are used to
achieve precise control over the size and physical texture of the nanowires,
while graphene and topological insulator materials provide a tunable
electrostatic environment and a spin texture, respectively. The tunability of
this model system provides exciting opportunities to address unanswered
questions, but also to create new quantum states of matter that have not been
studied or even considered before, possibly bringing about a paradigm shift in
the study of quantum phase transitions. The main goal is to create and control
new quantum states, contribute to fundamental understanding of quantum matter,
and harness the quantum degrees of freedom for a host of possible applications.
