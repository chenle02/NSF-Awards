In this proposed study the PIs will investigate the interaction between
channelized and porous flow of melt in the mantle and chemical heterogeneities
that might be present at various length scales. Using theoretical models
constrained by geologic and petrologic observations, they will examine the basic
behavior of systems undergoing melting and their predictions. The research will
primarily be undertaken by a graduate student, with close supervision by the PIs
in a staged manner, progressing from simple to more complex (realistic) models.
It is expected that the new models can be used to test emerging ideas and
observations of chemical heterogeneity in melts and mantle residues in a variety
of melting regimes (ridges, arc, plumes).&lt;br/&gt;
