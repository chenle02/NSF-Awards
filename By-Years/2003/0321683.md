Rice is the most important food source worldwide. The rice genome also serves as
a model for the closely related crops such as corn and wheat. The corn and wheat
genomes are much larger than that of rice so the rice genome provides a cost
effective way to understand these other plants. The International Rice Genome
Sequencing Project (IRGSP) completed a high quality draft sequence of the rice
genome (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, cv. Nipponbare) in December 2002 and is now
committed to finishing the sequence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues
previous, successful work towards finishing the public rice genome sequence. The
300-350 Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones to be sequenced to finished
standards (an error rate of no more than 1/10,000 bases) comprise about 10% of
the genome. Support from this award will also allow the project to collaborate
with groups from other countries to sequence 1% - 2% of the most technically
challenging regions of the genome that remain to be completed. The project will
host and train scientists from other countries participating in the IRGSP.
Training opportunities will also be available for local high school students and
faculty from minority serving institutions in a collaboration between the Cold
Spring Harbor Genome Center and the Dolan DNA Learning Center.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables&lt;br/&gt;All sequence information will be
released according to the Bermuda Agreement/Fort Lauderdale principles
(http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10506537). All contiguous stretches of
sequence (contigs) over 1,500 base pairs in length will be immediately and
automatically released at http://nucleus.cshl.edu/riceweb/, including sequence
and chromotogram files. Assemblies of BAC sequences will be updated weekly and
released to GenBank. The BAC clones sequenced are available through the Clemson
University BAC/EST Resource Center (http://www.genome.clemson.edu). &lt;br/&gt;
