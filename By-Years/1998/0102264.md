&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact of Information Technology on the Future of the
Research University &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a workshop
proposal to consider research university responses to new challenges and
opportunities presented by information technology with a focus on the need for
future policies to ensure the evolving research enterprise will be capable of
addressing national needs. The results of the workshop will be broadly
disseminated. Participants include members of diverse constituencies: early
faculty adopters in innovative uses of information technology, intellectual and
administrative university leaders, and representatives of government and the
private sector. &lt;br/&gt;
