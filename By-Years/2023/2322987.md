The award will partially cover travel expenses of graduate students, post-
doctoral researchers, junior faculty members, and invited speakers from
institutions in the United States to participate in the conference entitled,
"97th American Chemical Society Colloid & Surface Science Symposium,‚Äù which will
be held in Raleigh, NC, June 4-7, 2023. This is the largest annual meeting of
the Colloids community with 500 anticipated attendees. The intellectual merit of
this symposium lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of
cutting-edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in many
areas relevant to the CBET community including technical sessions on Active
Matter, Colloids for Energy and Sustainability, Self- and Directed Assembly,
Wetting and Adhesion, and Machine Learning and AI for Colloids. The conference
will be attended by both prominent and young scientists who will be discussing
present and future directions of research and research challenges. The
conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in
cutting-edge areas of colloids, soft- and active matter, self- and directed
assembly, and relevant emergent areas and will address challenges involved in
advancing the field.

The American Chemical Society Colloid and Surface Science Symposium is a long
standing and most recognized in the areas of colloid and interfacial sciences.
The meeting at North Carolina State University will be organized into 13
sessions and a poster session that covers many research areas and includes
topics that are of special relevance to industry. Special consideration is given
to young leaders in the field and underrepresented minority researchers to
present their research and/or serve as session chairs. The diversity of the
speakers and organizers helps maintain a high degree of creativity and
innovation alongside well-established work in the field. The organization of the
symposium involves a wide circle of faculty from regional universities as well
as representatives from non-educational institutions and companies in the area.
An industry-led session is organized where representatives from several chemical
and pharmaceutical companies are invited to speak on a variety of topics such as
translation of basic science to industry, differences between academic and
industry R&D, and career tracks in different business sectors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
