Currently our undergraduate Unit Operations Laboratory successfully demonstrates
the principles of heat transfer in tubular heat exchangers, momentum transfer in
fluid flow through pipes, fittings and beds of solids, mass transfer in
distillation and solvent extraction, and reaction kinetics in integral and well-
mixed reactors. The deficiency is that have an experiment which is capable of
demonstrating several principles at once is not available. This laboratory
improvement program is intended to remove that deficiency by allowing the study
of heat, mass, and momentum transfer simultaneously in a highly-instrumented
agitated vessel. The vessel is to be 60 gallons in volume, and be instrumented
to allow determination of heat transfer coefficients between the jacket and
fluid, momentum transfer between the impeller and the fluid, and mass transfer
rates of oxygen in and out of solution. The simultaneous effects of gas
sparging, liquid viscosity, and liquid temperature on heat, mass and momentum
transport rates will be studied.
