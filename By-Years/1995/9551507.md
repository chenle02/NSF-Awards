The summer field course is the single most important undergraduate geology
course because it unifies all the diverse aspects of the science. Unlike other
parts of a geology curriculum, the field course in most colleges has remained
unchanged dor several decades. This project adds a new dimension to traditional
field training by integrating it with several new computer-based technologies
that are currently revolutionizing the earth sciences. Through the use of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Satellites (GPS),
computer mapping, and 3-D visualization, the new field course teaches students
how these technologies can be utilized to improve their ability to handle the
increasingly difficult task of dealing with the large and diverse data sets
needed to solve today's complex problems. When the new technologies are used in
a classical field course, the traditional emphasis on data collection can be
shifted to data synthesis and interpretation. Students' critical thinking skills
can only be enhanced by such a change. Formulation and testing of hypotheses
based upon field data are a cornerstone of the new curriculum. As a result,
students can be better prepared for the interdisciplinary role that today's
geologist must play in dealing with complex problems.
