This project supports research on electrically excited excimer lasers,
particularly those that are wavelength tunable. These lasers are found to be
useful in an increasing number of diverse areas such as optical communications,
materials processing of electronic materials, various types of laser
spectroscopy, remote sensing, and medical instrumentation. Previous work by the
PIs on excimer laser was supported under NSF grant ECS-8116646. The main
research objectives of this proposal are: the study of wavelength tuning
techniques of high power, broadband excimer lasers; demonstration of efficient
simultaneous UV/visible laser oscillation on the XeF B X and C A excimer
transition electrically excited in the same active medium; and investigation of
the feasibility of efficient discharge excitation of broadband and
multiwavelength excimer lasers.
