9705703 Levendis This is an award to support research on a process for control
of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen chloride, polyaromatic hydrocarbons
and particulate air pollutant emissions from incineration of wastes. The process
to be investigated consists of injection of sorbents into the waste stream prior
to incineration and then filtration of the incineration products containing
soot, ash and metal fumes through a ceramic filter. Sorbents to be investigated
include water soluble salts of calcium and magnesium such as calcium magnesium
acetate and calcium magnesium benzoate which may be either wet or dry- injected
or blends of limestone, natural gas, coal or ground solid organic wastes.
Results of this project are expected to provide knowledge that can be used in
engineering design of incineration processes that do not produce combustion
products of pollutional significance. Potential applicability includes municipal
waste, medical waste incinerators, coal-burning electric power generating
plants, cement kilns, and other industrial incinerators such as those at wood
pulp and paper plants. ***
