0921925&lt;br/&gt;Martin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE, will take place May, 2010, at the Madre de las Aguas Conservation
Area in the Dominican Republic. Organized by Dr. Patrick Martin of the
Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture and Graduate Degree
Program in Ecology, at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, the
PASI will address the impacts of climate change on the ecology and management of
tropical montane ecosystems or TMEs. The activity will focus on the following
major disciplines and themes: (1) Climate change: past, present and future; (2)
Diversity and biogeographic interactions; (3) Climate and hydrometeorology; (4)
Ecosystem impacts; (5) Disturbance ecology; (6) Remote sensing; and (7) Cloud
forest conservation, restoration and management issues.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PASI will feature methods and models of the effects of
climate change on TMEs and train the next cohort of scientists from across the
Americas in holistic approaches to the science and management of global climate
change. In addition, the PASI will identify key areas of needed research,
formulate viable conservation strategies, and disseminate information through a
PASI website and book.
