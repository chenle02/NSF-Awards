9322172 Annett A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be
continued in the physics department of The Pennsylvania State University at the
University Park campus during 1994-1997. The REU site will involve approximately
16 students in research projects each summer. Students will be involved in
projects covering a wide range of frontier research. As an REU site, the Penn
State physics department will mount an aggressive campaign to recruit students
into the program, with a wide recruitment area covering Pennsylvania and
surrounding, mid- Atlantic region states. Active efforts to encourage minority
student enrollment will include personal visits to targeted HBCU physics
departments at Morehouse, Clark-Atlanta and Cheyney, and will make use of the
Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) of the Big 10 schools. In addition
to their own research projects, students will attend special weekly seminars
designed to broaden their knowledge of physics and encourage interaction with
faculty. Throughout the program, emphasis will be placed on encouraging the
students' interest in careers in physics. ***
