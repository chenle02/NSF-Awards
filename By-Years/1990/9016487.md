This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists in a joint
seminar on "Selectivity in Synthetic and Bio-organic Chemistry," to be held in
Tokyo, Japan, June 2-7, 1991. The focus of the meetings will be on the dynamic
scientific advances in the area of asymmetric synthesis, which spans the entire
spectrum of organic and inorganic chemistry. A U.S.-Japan seminar on this
subject in 1981 served as an opportunity for research groups in the two
countries to share ideas and information. During the last decade, however, there
has been a virtual explosion in the discovery of reactions that deliver levels
of stereocontrol once thought to be impossible to achieve via non-enzymatic
means. The impact of these new tools, coupled with the new enzymatic and
microbial technologies, has dramatically redefined the way absolute
stereochemical, regiochemical and functional group selectivity issues in
synthesis are being addressed in both academic and industrial environments. A
multitude of new chiral reagents and catalysts now exist that are capable of
exerting near-perfect control over those bond constructions where new
stereochemical relationships are established. The development of these new
technologies are based on recent, deep understanding of fundamental issues of
selectivity and molecular recognition. The enormous importance of this area is
manifested in the highly international and cross-disciplinary nature of the
primary contributions in the literature. The co-organizers of the seminar are
Professor Robert M. Williams of Colorado State Unversity and Professor Kenji
Koga of the University of Tokyo. The main topics to be discussed are new
asymmetric synthetic methodologies; enzymatic, whole cell and cell-free bio-
reactor technologies; total synthesis of natural products; biosynthesis;
catalytic antibodies; and reaction mechanisms. In addition, a poster session
will be organized for young Japanese industrial chemists.
