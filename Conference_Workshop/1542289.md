This award supports participation in a one-day workshop, a three-day conference,
and a two-week summer school held at Northwestern University during the period
January through August, 2016. The meetings center on the topic of probability
theory and have the goals of training junior mathematicians in the field and
stimulating new research. Probability theory is a major branch of modern
mathematics. It aims at a rigorous mathematical investigation of collective
behavior of random phenomena and is one of the most applicable branches of
science. The one-day workshop, to be held in February 2016, will feature four
talks on the topic of nodal sets of random functions. The three day conference,
to be held in May 2016, will feature twelve talks by experts on the topics of
percolation, spin glasses, and random media, three central topics in
probability. The Summer School in Probability, to be held in July 2016, will
include five introductory mini-courses on various topics within geometric
analysis, aimed at graduate students and recent PhD recipients. Award funds will
be used primarily for the travel costs of attendees who are graduate students or
postdoctoral scholars at US institutions. The organizing committee will seek
broad and diverse participation in these activities, and will especially
encourage the participation of women mathematicians and members of other under-
represented groups. More information on these events, which are part of an
Emphasis Year in Probability at Northwestern, can be found on the website:

In the last decades, probability theory has emerged as a central and core branch
of mathematics. Part of its importance relies on the connection with several
branches of science, including: mathematical physics, chemistry, statistics,
economics, and other areas of mathematics. The programmed activities share and
promote these connections. Percolation originated from the study of fluid flow
on a porous media, spin glasses are disordered magnets that exhibit
metastability and large complexity, while random media is a common background to
study polymer models. The research on nodal sets of random functions goes back
to the work of M. Kac on zeroes of random polynomials and share deep connections
with semi-classical analysis and topology. These activities and topics present
an excellent opportunity to bring graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to
the forefront of research in probability theory.
