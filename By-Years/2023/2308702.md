Faculty at institutions with minimal or limited research infrastructure often
find it difficult to maintain connections with the broader science community.
This is particularly true for those at minority serving institutions such as
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and at primarily
undergraduate institutions (PUIs). NSF funds will be used to support activities
designed to broaden participation of PUI and HBCU faculty and students at the
annual Plant Biology (PB) 2023 conference sponsored and organized by American
Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB). Conference activities are designed to
enhance their participation at the national meeting and to introduce these
scientists to research resources and funding opportunities that will help them
connect to the broader plant biology research community year-round.

ASPB is a leader in supporting career development opportunities for a wide
variety of scientists. In an effort to boost research engagement at PUIs and
HBCUs for current and prospective faculty, an extended workshop will be held at
PB 2023 for current faculty to meet, share best practices in experimental
design, collaboration, grant writing, and time management for conducting
research. In addition, PUI and HBCU faculty and students will be provided with
numerous networking and mentoring opportunities during the conference and
throughout the year. NSF funds will be used to provide travel awards to PUI and
HBCU scientists and students to attend and actively participate in activities at
the PB 2023 conference to be held from August 5-10, 2023, in Savannah (GA).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
