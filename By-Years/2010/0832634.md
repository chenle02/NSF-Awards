This award provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the
Blue Waters project team and a team of turbulence researchers to explore the
readiness of a turbulence simulation code for use on the Blue Waters system. If
successful it is anticipated that the code will be used for advanced research
into the dynamics of reactive turbulent shear flows and of stratified
geophysical turbulence. A greater understanding of such dynamics may lead to
improved capacity to predict and control pollutant dispersal by turbulence,
better tools for the design of vehicles (e.g. aircraft, trains, ships) to reduce
drag, for the design of combustion systems to increase efficiency and reduce
pollutants, and to improved models for mixing and transport phenomena in
geophysical flow modeling.
