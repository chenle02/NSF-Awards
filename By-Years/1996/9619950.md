Dr. Kenneth D. Jordan and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Pittsburgh are being supported to establish a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects focussing on computational chemistry and molecular
modeling. The program is enhanced by a series of tutorials on the methods of
computational chemistry and molecular modeling and their application to chemical
problems. The interplay between theory and experiment is emphasized.
Participants are recruited nationally.
