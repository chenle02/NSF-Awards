This proposal describes a 2-year program to experimentally investigate the
petrology of the lower mantle, the single largest region of the earth. Using the
laser-heated diamond cell, a natural garnet peridotite composition will be taken
to P-T conditions existing throughout the lower mantle . A combination of in
situ X-ray diffraction and quenched-product analysis will be used to determine:
(1) the identity and quantity of major phases present; (2) the major-element
partitioning between these phases as a function of pressure; (3) the equations
of state of the phases, and hence of the assemblage for direct comparison with
the seismological profiles of the lower mantle; and (4) the solidus temperature
of the assemblage from which tight constraints on the deep-mantle geotherm could
be obtained. Year 1 will concentrate on sub-solidus equilibria, and Year 2 will
concentrate on solidus/liquidus equilibria of the natural peridotite composition
as well as reconnaissance (solid-state and liquid) equilibria of an iron-
enriched composition. These experiments are a direct extension of techniques
used in prior work that successfully determined the ultrahigh P/T equilibria of
individual natural minerals, and they would represent the first time that an
actual rock assemblage had been studied at the conditions existing throughout
the bulk of the mantle.
