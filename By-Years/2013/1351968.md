In this CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Anastassia Alexandrova
of the University of California - Los Angeles and her team are investigating the
potential of sub-nano-sized clusters of platinum and palladium clusters, doped
with other atoms, to be used as catalysts in chemical reactions. Catalysis is
important to the chemical industry in providing efficient, low-energy methods
for chemical synthesis. The young researchers working on this project will
receive in-depth training in state-of-the art computational
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Alexandrova and her research group will
use first-principle calculations and multi-scale methods to probe the chemical
bonding and reactivity in small transition metal clusters, both free and bound
to surfaces. The results from this project will help develop a better
understanding of any reactivity rules for these small clusters, guiding work of
experimentalists in developing improved catalysts. Computational results for
gas-phase clusters will be compared with experimental results. The computational
methods should find applications in other condensed-phase systems.
