9509099 Wedeen the investigator will determine whether homologs of genes that
control development in an animal like the fruit fly, that generates all of its
segments simultaneously, can control development in an animal like the leech,
that adds segments progressively. She will examine the expression patterns of
genes that are likely to be involved in organizing body pattern in the leech
embryo, Helobdella triserialis. The genes to be examined are homologs of the
genes engrailed, cubitus interruptus-Dominant, wingless and hedgehog that are
expressed in stripco in the embryo of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster,
and have been shown in that insect to be required for normal development of
embryonic segments. The cells in the leech embryo expressing these genes will be
identified by their cell lineage and will be ablated by laser to examine what
role these cells play in embryonic development.
