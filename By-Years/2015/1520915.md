Quantum mechanics underlies much of our present technology, including computing.
However, many questions about quantum mechanics remain unsolved or open,
especially in the areas of dynamics and open systems. Exploring new regimes of
quantum mechanics allows us to push towards next generation computing and other
future technologies. A key experimental context to gain this insight is
ultracold molecules, where we have an extraordinary degree of precise control
over many aspects of the quantum problem. In this context, this project supports
the development of a large scale open source code to push such experiments
forward. The code is run on high performance computers. The training of students
in rigorous numerical techniques and high-performance parallel computing is key
to success in a number of arenas in society, from the materials genome
initiative to the space program. This project will train students in a diverse
research environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As more complex molecules approach
quantum degeneracy, the number and complexity of many-body models to describe
them will also increase substantially. Additionally, searching for emergent
phenomena such as quantum phases and robust dynamical phenomena requires
exploration of vast parameter spaces and extrapolation using many different
system sizes. In order to meet these challenges, researchers seek new ways to
design and dispatch simulations and collect and interpret data. Open source
tools which are to have long-term impact must be flexible to adapt to different
physical degrees of freedom, different Hamiltonians, and different dynamical
processes; they must be efficient to manage large parameter exploration; and
they must contain powerful tools for extracting data from large simulations. The
matrix product density operator approach to be developed here will support
innovative research in ultracold molecular physics.
