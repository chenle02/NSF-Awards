9316918 Showers PI and team will continue to conduct high-precision stable-
isotope analyses of dinosaur bones, as well as tests for diagenesis, in order to
determine paleophysiology and migratory habits of dinosaurs. This phase of the
project will focus on two Permian pelycosaurs, a Jurassic stegasaur and
sauropod, and a Cretaceous therapod (tyrannosaur). In order to evaluate bone
isotope patterns, skeletal elements of a modern ostrich and a modern elephant
will also be examined.
