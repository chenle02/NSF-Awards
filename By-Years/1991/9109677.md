With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Jennings will attempt to
provide a mechanistic rationale to account for the observed course of a highly
stereo- and regioselective platinum-mediated organic transformation and to
further explore its potential utility in organic synthesis. In addition, Dr.
Jennings plans to develop new catalytic transformations of olefinic substrates
which will proceed with high degrees of regio- and stereoselectivity to afford
useful products. %%% Metal-facilitated organic transformations have evolved into
a significant subdiscipline of organic/organometallic chemistry. Dr. Jennings
will utilize organoplatinum compounds in a unique manner that is expected to
render them useful as catalysts that are capable of promoting synthetically
useful cyclopropane transformations. In addition to adding significantly to our
mechanistic understanding of metal-facilitated organic transformations, Dr.
Jennings' studies are expected to lead to new methodology that can be used to
synthesize interesting natural products.
