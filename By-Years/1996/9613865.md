9613865 Ma This research deals with metallic alloys that are far removed from
equilibrium, namely amorphous alloys and supersaturated nanocrystalline solid
solutions. The focus is on metastable phase formation using solid-state
processing techniques in binary systems characterized by a large positive heat
of mixing. A systematic experimental approach should lead to clearer
understanding of the formation of metastable phases and their transformations in
immiscible systems. Scientific areas explored include the mechanisms responsible
for amorphization observed in some mechanically-alloyed binary immiscible
systems; limitations to the extent of alloying in such systems; the degree of
stability in these metastable phases; the degree of short range clustering; and
the similarities and differences in thermodynamic behavior of immiscible alloys
prepared through different solid-state techniques. Measurement techniques
employed include calorimetry, transmission electron microscopy, thermodynamic
modeling, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. %%% Development
of the fundamentals of thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of immiscible alloy
systems is needed to understand their synthesis, structure, and stability. ***
