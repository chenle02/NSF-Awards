The aim of this project is to study mathematical problems associated with the
control and performance analysis of stochastic networks. The network models
being considered are heterogeneous, may have complex feedback mechanisms, and
allow for stochastic variability in arrivals, service times and routing. Buffers
in the network enable jobs to be stored that cannot be served immediately. In
addition, the models with control allow for dynamic sequencing and alternate
routing of jobs. Since the complexity of these network models usually precludes
exact analysis, the focus is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation
are being considered, namely fluid models (first order approximations) and
diffusion models (second order approximations). Investigating the interplay
between these models is an important feature of the research. The two main
topics are (i) dynamic control through sequencing and alternate routing, and
(ii) performance analysis for processor sharing networks. With regard to topic
(i), some authors have successfully used diffusion control problems as formal
tools for generating good control policies for some specific network models.
However, there are few rigorous analyses of the performance of such policies.
The PI is developing a systematic approach to finding and interpreting solutions
of diffusion control problems and to analyzing the performance of the policies
generated in this manner. Regarding topic (ii), the processor sharing discipline
is an example of a service discipline for which a natural state descriptor
involves a measure-valued process (to keep track of the residual service times
of all jobs in the network). The PI is studying fluid and diffusion
approximations of processor sharing networks with the aims of understanding the
dynamics of such networks, obtaining measures of performance, and developing
general tools for studying measure-valued processes associated with network
models. Stochastic networks are used as models for complex manufacturing,
telecommunications and computer systems. A challenging problem for such networks
is to design controls that are simple to implement and yet are near optimal in
an appropriate sense. Motivated by such problems, a number of mathematical
questions associated with controlling and analyzing the performance of
stochastic networks are being studied under this grant. Since the complexity of
stochastic network models usually precludes exact analysis, the focus is on
approximate models with a hierarchical structure. As with recent work on the
performance analysis of some networks, the interplay between the levels in this
hierarchy is an important feature of the research.
