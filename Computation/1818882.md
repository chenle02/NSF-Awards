Coupling together two distinct physical fields in medical and geophysical
imaging is capable of enhancing both the space and contrast resolution of
imaging modalities. This project concerns one of such a modality - Current
Density Imaging (CDI) that couples the magnetic and radio-frequency
electromagnetic fields used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with the
electric field used in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). Such a coupling is
resulted in images of the electrical conductivity with significantly higher
quality and accuracy than those obtained by the routine medical imaging
modalities. The general aim of this project is to develop the computationally
efficient and robust algorithms for CDI. The proposed research is in the field
of coupled physics (hybrid) inverse problems whose distinctive feature is
utilizing the interior data available in new imaging modalities in order to
reconstruct material parameters of an object to be investigated. Speaking about
the possible applications of such inverse problems, it should be particularly
emphasized medical diagnostics and marine controlled source electromagnetic
sounding due to their importance for early detection of cancer, minimizing the
rate of false diagnoses, more efficient treatment of diseases, etc., and for
geophysical exploration of hydrocarbon deposits on a shelf. The innovation of
this project is that it is concerned with the development of computational tools
for CDI by utilizing an initial boundary value problem for the weighted mean
curvature flow equation. In order to achieve the general aim, the principal
investigator will: (1) analyze the level set formulation of motion by the
weighted mean curvature associated with the Dirichlet problem for the weighted
1-Laplacian, which is considered as a mathematical model of CDI, (2) develop the
stable and convergent computational algorithms, and (3) conduct the numerical
convergence study in order to demonstrate in numerical experiments the
effectiveness of computational algorithms and quality of reconstruction. The
approach developed in this project is expected to advance understanding of the
geometrical features of CDI. One undergraduate student will be involved in the
project and trained in numerical methods for the inverse problems.
