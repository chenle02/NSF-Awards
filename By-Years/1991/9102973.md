This is an experimental/computer simulation study of the mechanisms of
strengthening in austenitic stainless steels by addition of nitrogen. Mechanical
testing is performed at temperatures between 4 and 900 degrees Kelvin on single
crystal specimens containing controlled amounts of nitrogen. Slip behavior is
examined by electron microscopy. Results are correlated with a flow stress model
developed on thermodynamic principles that predicts flow stress, including
thermal activation of planar slip. This research improves our base for the
development of nitrogen-containing steels. Nitrogen strengthened steels may lead
to low cost, high strength alternatives to our present steels. Such steels can
exhibit excellent combinations of strength and toughness.
