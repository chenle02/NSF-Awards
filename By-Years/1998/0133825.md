This research project will first develop efficient indexing strategies for
spatio-temporal data sets. This will include access methods for future spatio-
temporal queries as well as access methods for historical spatio-temporal
queries. The next step will develop mining techniques for spatio-temporal
databases. Finally the project will generate spatio-temporal data sets for
experimentation. The career development plan will include two new courses on
advanced database applications.
