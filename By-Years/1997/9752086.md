While the market for GIS services may be growing at 35 percent per year, the
Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) observes that the major obstacle
impeding a GlS revolution is a shortage of trained GIS personnel. The Work and
Spatial Information Technology Education (WORK/SITE) Partnership is developing
and establishing a community-based model to integrate GIS field experiences into
high schools and to prepare undergraduate students in community colleges and
regional universities for careers using complex GIS technologies. WORK/SITE is
testing a new educational model relying on emerging skill standards and designed
to respond swiftly to changing GIS technology and expanding workplaae
applications. Primary projects include community-based curriculum modules,
courseware, and Project Kits the Alliance is disseminating using Internet-based
technologies. In the high schools, interdisciplinary teams of four teachers and
four students per teacher work on community-based projects. These address urban
issues that affect the communities. Companies/organizations provide "real life"
projects and data for students to develop GIS solutions focusing on urban issues
such as public safety, crime reduction, brown field redevelopment, and
environmental justice. The model joins partners committed to GIS -- two
traditional educational institutions with businesses -- to train GIS educators
and to develop curriculum which integrates employer-defined, work-based GIS
projects. The curriculum permits students to be GIS practitioners while being
engaged in formal GIS education at the certificate, associates, or bachelors
degree levels. Because the WORK/SITE approach, when fully implemented, relies on
an existing traditional educational infrastructure, it facilitates an efficient
use of societal resources in expanding the availability of trained GIS
personnel.
