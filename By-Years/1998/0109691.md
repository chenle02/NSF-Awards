&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will
develop a new class of real time aerosol mass spectrometers (AMSs) for analysis
of respirable powder and liquid aerosol in pulmonary drug delivery systems.
Three parameters control the effective delivery of drugs to the lungs: (1) the
number density of entrained aerosol particles per unit volume of respirable
fluid; (2) the particle size distribution; (3) the concentrations of active
ingredients as a function of particle size. Aerosol Mass Spectrometers, with
proper calibration, can measure all three parameters simultaneously. Aerodyne
Research, Inc. (ARI), in collaboration with several university research groups,
has developed, demonstrated, and commercialized an innovative and quantitative
AMS system. With suitable modification and calibration, this system could
greatly reduce the time and effort required to characterize pulmonary drug
delivery systems, both for research and for production quality assurance. This
Phase I project will design and test a real-time AMS system to characterize
novel pulmonary drug delivery systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
commercial application of this project will be in the pulmonary drug delivery
analyzer market. Potential customers are likely to include drug delivery
companies, pharmaceutical companies, academic research organizations and
regulatory agencies.&lt;br/&gt;
