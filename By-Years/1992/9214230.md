This award supports Professor Guy Schupp, Dr. William Yelon and two graduate
students of the University of Missouri to collaborate in research on glassy
materials and ferroelectric phase transitions with Professor Walter Steiner and
others of the Physics Department of the Technical University of Vienna. They are
engaged in detailed investigations of the spin dynamics of cluster glasses above
their freezing temperatures and the dynamics of the phase transition of lithium
heptagermanate. These dynamical processes have been studied using high magnetic
field, low temperature facilities in Vienna. Recently, the neutron and gamma ray
scattering instruments at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) have
been significantly upgraded. This enables them to carry out expanded structural
studies and examinations of dynamical and magnetic properties near phase
transitions. The combination of complementary techniques made possible by the
unique facilities at MURR and those in Vienna may provide new and fundamental
insights into magnetic ordering and the dynamics of phase transitions in glassy
and ferroelectric materials.
