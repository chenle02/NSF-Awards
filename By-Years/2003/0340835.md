The goal of this ADVANCE Fellows award is to enable Principal Investigator to
reenter the academic workforce and establish a long-term career basis. The PI
successfully demonstrated technical and educational excellence in her first
academic career and her goal to reenter the academic workforce will leverage
this experience. The PI will be returning to academia after a six year hiatus,
and this award will support her in her endeavors to build the skills to initiate
new research expertise in a topic of significant national need (biosensors and
metrology). The planned research effort will focus on the science for surface
plasmon resonance sensors and biological actuators. Key elements are the
understanding of the interface between the biological function and the sensor
design and performance, and the role of sensitivity (molecular weight and lower-
limit capability) in successful sensor performance. The low-level molecular
weight issue is particularly poorly understood, and relates strongly to not only
sensor design, but to broader impacts in proteomics and drug discovery. The
broader impacts of this award are significant for the research and education in
the biomaterials. The PI plans to develop a Center for Materials
Characterization and Metrology at San Jose State University that will serve
students, faculty, and Bay Area technologists, A key component of this project
is to create new areas of technical expertise for both Dr. Lackritz and the
students and faculty with whom she interacts. There will be a departmental and
campus-wide impact for the planned Center, and her research in biosensors and
metrology will be a key part of ongoing campus technical efforts.
