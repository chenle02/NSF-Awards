Behavioral studies of pigeons probe the higher levels of biological vision.
Preliminary studies with complex visual stimuli (including natural scenes) have
shown great similarities between pigeon vision and early human vision, despite
an evolutionary gap of 100 million years. This suggests the existence of
extraordinarily robust biological solutions to visual analysis. Further
experiments on visual shape categorization are to be performed on human and
pigeon subjects. The goals are 1) to infer underlying algorithms in the two
species; 2) to examine adaptation of these algorithms to the circumstances of
their use; 3) to formalize the algorithms and their adaptive capacities
mathematically; 4) to synthesize biological visual categorization on a computer;
and 5) to develop experimental procedures with the long-term goal of creating
artificial visual machines.
