9300776 Klumpar The propagation of transient impulses induced into the
magnetosphere/ionosphere system. The investigation will use already exiting data
from ground stations located below the high latitude dayside ionosphere taken in
time conjunction with satellite data from the outer dayside magnetosphere
(primarily the AMPTE/Charge Composition Explorer). The focus is on cause and
effect relationships between a specific class of impulsive (3 - 10 minute) high
latitude dayside ionospheric signatures and their simultaneously observed
magnetopause and boundary layer counterparts. Understanding this relationship is
an essential element of the GEM Boundary Layer Campaign. We hope to learn to
interpret the ionospheric signatures in terms of corresponding variations at the
frontal magnetosphere. ***
