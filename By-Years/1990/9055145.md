St. Cloud State University will initiate a five-week, multidisciplinary,
residential Young Scholars project focusing on water quality for 24 students
entering grades 9,10. Students will be exposed to these several disciplines
through an on-campus program and follow-up activities that use a "Science-
Technology-Society" (STS) approach and which focus on STS issues of immediate
relevance to the students and their respective communities. The program will
also include field trips, career awareness workshops, literature to parents on
preparation for careers in science and engineering, seminars on the
contributions of American Indian, Latin American, African, and Asian societies
and minority and female scientists to science and technology. Examination of the
philosophical and ethical aspects of society- science interface is an inherent
and integral part of the STS model, and will be a part of the students'
projects.
