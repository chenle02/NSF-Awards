The goal of this research is to develop heuristically motivated procedures that
can find intelligible and natural proofs of logical theorems efficiently. The
challenge in such automated proof search is to join human and logic based
approaches to theorem proving. Automated proof search is expected to lead to the
discovery of procedures that incorporate significant structures of human
argumentation and can thus be exploited for building "intelligent" tutors. The
Carnegie Mellon Proof Tutor (CPT) depends on such a search procedure for
classical sentential logic -- in a computational and pedagogically efficient
way. The research will build on the experience with CPT and the extension of its
theoretical base, the Intercalation Calculus together with completeness and
normal form theorems, to intuitionistic sentential logic and to predicate logic.
This theoretical base is crucial: it not only sets up the problem space and
provides some, albeit minimal guidance for proof search, but it also guarantees
the correctness of proof procedures. Research tasks include: treating classical
and non-classical sentential logics in a uniform way through intercalation
calculi; generalizing proof search in sentential logics to predicate logic; and
extending the approach beyond pure logic to set theory.
