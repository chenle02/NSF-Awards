Paradigm Development Group, Ltd. has developed a software package that
incorporates the most successful and widely accepted techniques of structured
decision making. This software uses an integrative graphical model, which is
intially expanded (problem structuring) and then contracted (analytical
structuring) prior to analysis via quantitative models. This decision aiding
process will logically and rationally assist the decision-maker in examining all
aspects of complex, ill-structured or partially defined problems. This research
will test the problem structuring elements of this package by presenting it, in
various forms, to four groups of small business people. These business people
share a common complex problem and need to develop strategic and operational
plans to address this problem. One group will receive the basic problem
definition capability of the software (textual queries and compilation of
problem constructs). A second group will receive brainstorming support in
addition to the problem definition support. Cognitive mapping and related
queries (e.g., repertory grid) plus problem definition support will be provided
to the third group. The fourth group will complete the task with pencil and
paper. The results will be based on a weighted evaluation of the number of
options generated by each group. Previous research has shown that the value of
such support depends on its content and format. The results of this research
will be useful to Paradigm Development Group and all other researchers in
devising decision support softwware. This prototype research will lead to a
refined problem structuring software package available for the personal
computer. This product will provide the small business person and individual
decision maker in industry and government with a competitive advantage in the
marketplace.
