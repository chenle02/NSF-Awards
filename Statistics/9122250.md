This award will partially support the travel of approximately 16 scientists
from the United States to attend the 16th International Biometric Conference,
which is to be held 7-11 December, 1992 in Hamilton, New Zealand. The strength
of the meetings lies in the broad international participation of statisticians,
biologists, and mathematicians interested in quantitative and statistical
aspects of biology, genetics, envirnomental science, and other fields. Topics to
be discussed on statistical areas directly related to these issues include
survival analysis, epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology, environmental
pollution monitoring, modeling metabolism and pharmacokinetics; all of which
have direct bearing on solutions to the major concerns of today including AIDS,
cancer and heart diseases, plant science epidemiology and agriculture. In
addition, discussions on fundamental statistical issues of repeated measures,
structural inference, image processing and causal inference all have direct
application to current health related and agricultural sciences. It is
anticipated that the Conference, which is the major international meeting of
biostatisticians and biometricians throughout the world will be attended by 500
or more scientists from the international community. This award will partially
