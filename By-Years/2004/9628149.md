The object-oriented approach to program design has made a significant impact on
the way software is developed and maintained. Programmers have adopted the
object-oriented approach in order to take advantage of better data abstraction,
re-use through inheritance, and polymorphism. However, the very features which
make the object-oriented paradigm attractive also make object-oriented programs
more difficult to understand. The majority of current object- oriented software
development environments and aids provide textual interfaces through which
programmers can answer queries about the program state and assess program
performance. The hypothesis of this project is that textual tools for
understanding object-oriented programs, although absolutely essential, either
fail to provide all the information required by programmers about the dynamics
and global behavior of their code, or they provide information in a manner that
is cumbersome to acquire. Program visualization, through the use of graphics and
animation, provides users with a more complete understanding of their code, both
statically and dynamically. The goal of this project is to develop a
visualization framework with innovative graphical views that assist programmers
to understand, analyze, test, debug, and optimize their code. The views
illustrate both important details about a program and the global context of how
particular pieces of code relate to the entire program. An initial technique
being used is called the Information Mural, which presents very large program
event traces using a focus-plus-context display. One important aspect of the
work with the Information Mural is to identify patterns in the execution of a
program. ***
