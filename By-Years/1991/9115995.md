In this project, the PI, a graduate student, and a collaborator from Italy will
extend an Eddy Resolving General Circulation Model of the Eastern Mediterranean
Sea to include air-sea interaction and vertical mixing, and apply it to observed
circulation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In addition, data from the recent
POEM (Physical Oceanography of the Eastern Mediterranean) study will be
analyzed.
