The regulation of maternal RNAs is critical to early development. Dr. Kimble
proposes to take a combined genetic and molecular approach to analyze maternal
RNA controls in the nematode C. elegans. The fem-3 and glp-1 genes express
maternal RNAs that regulate sex determination and inductive cell interactions in
early embryos. Preliminary evidence suggests that the 3' untranslated regions of
these RNAs regulate their activity at the level of translation. Dr. Kimble
proposes to address the mechanisms by which the fem-3 and glp-1 maternal RNAs
are controlled in three ways. First, she will ask whether the fem-3 and glp-1
maternal RNAs are translationally controlled. To this end, she will examine the
distribution of their endogenous RNAs and proteins and assess their association
with polysomes. Second, she will identify sequence elements necessary for
regulation. To this end, she will inject reporter RNAs carrying wild-type and
mutant sequences from fem-3 or glp-1 into the germ line and assay their
translational capacity in oocytes and early embryos. Third, she will begin to
analyze factors that regulate maternal RNAs. To this end, she will rely on gel
shift assays and analysis of mog-1 mutants. An understanding of how maternal
RNAs are regulated in C. elegans will provide insight into this fundamental
control of early development and also will allow expression of specific proteins
to be manipulated in early embryos.
