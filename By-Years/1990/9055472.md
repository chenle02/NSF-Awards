This project is a three year program for high school biology and agriculture
education teachers that includes 1) three summer institutes to be held at The
University of Wisconsin - River Falls, and 2) a series of twelve 2-4 day
regional workshops led by institute participants. University faculty will assist
in the teaching of the workshops. The summer institutes are an improved version
of a successful institute piloted during the summer of 1990 with Wisconsin NDEA
Title II funds. The purpose of this program is to provide over 300 high school
and agriculture education teachers with new knowledge and teaching skills in the
area of biotechnology. This program is unique in that applications of plant and
animal biotechnology will be featured. It is also unique in that opportunities
for biology and agriculture education teachers to work together will be
emphasized. Master teachers from previous summer institutes will participate as
institute staff so as to share successful classroom experiences and teaching
strategies. An amount equal to 11% of the NSF award will be provided as cost
sharing.
