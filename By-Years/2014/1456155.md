Currently, several aspects are missing in the current polymer or polymer
composites based products. The first one is mechanical strength, which can be
potentially improved by nanofillers. The second one is durability. The third one
is sustainability, as replacing oil based polymers with sustainable filler
produced from wood can reduce the need of using oil based products. This
proposal aims at developing a new generation of high performance polymer
composites with properties superior to the already existing solutions. It is
going to create a very exciting opportunity of having the new generation of high
performance sustainable nanofillers produced in substantial
quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addressing the challenges related to
traditional nanofillers while maintaining structural integrity of nanocomposites
can be achieved by using sustainable bio-based nanofillers, such as surface
modified Nano-Crystalline Cellulose (NCC). A development, optimization and
commercializing of a novel process of making such materials is the basis of this
proposal. Using nanocellulose as filler can be a very promising and scalable
method of producing inexpensive 'green' composites. The proposed technology can
be also very cost-efficient solution, given that USDA projections point out an
extraordinary opportunity for this filler as nanocrystalline cellulose
applications are expected to reach $600 billion mark by 2020 in the US alone.
