The geographical location in central New England, the range and diversity of
the vegetation and the detailed historical records of the Harvard Forest
together comprise a unique site for the study of forest ecology, forest
microbiology, land management and regional planning for the northeastern US.
This project will foster two major areas of effort at the Forest. 1) Forest
ecological research at the site is focussed on the effects of major disturbances
due to catastrophic wind damage on the structural patterns of vegetation,
considered at the species, stand and landscape scales. Techniques will be
generated for the analysis and simulation of such events using computer
graphics, including the development of a geographical information system for the
Forest. Funds will be used to purchase a state-of-the- art microcomputer system
and associated software. 2) Forest soil microbiology at the Forest is centered
on the optimization of forest tree-soil microorganism symbioses with emphasis on
symbiotic dinitrogen fixation by actinomycete-nodulated woody dicots and on
inorganic mineral nutrient uptake, especially phosphorus, facilitated by
vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Funds will be used to build a
small laboratory and to provide refrigerator and freezer facilities needed by
the soil microbiology researchers.
