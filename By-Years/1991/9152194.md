This project establishs a digital system design laboratory for undergraduate
electrical engineering students at the FAMU/FSU College of Engineering. This
laboratory provides a unique "hands-on" experience for junior and senior level
undergraduates through student projects which cover a variety of engineering
fundamentals, ranging from the design and analysis of electronic and logic
circuits, to their implementation using full and semi custom integrated circuit
(IC) design techniques (i.e. MOSIS) or through the use of user- programmable
application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs) such as programmable-logic-
devices (PLDs) and field- programmable-gate-arrays (FPGAs). The emphasis of the
program is to teach undergraduate students the computer-aided-design (CAD)
methodologies of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) design utilizing low-cost
high-performance personal computers and state-of-the-art CAD software design and
analysis
