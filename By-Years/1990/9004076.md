The principal investigator will expand upon his recent discovery of new
homotopy-theoretic structures on complex surfaces. This interdisciplinary
project involves the use of algebraic topology to understand the structure of
the solution space of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential
equations which appear naturally in differential geometry and mathematical
physics. Additionally, he will investigate several problems involving iterated
loop space structures. Two shapes are homotopic if closed loops on them have
identical collapsing properties. For example, a circle and the shape of a solid
coffee mug (with one handle) are homotopy equivalent. But if the mug were to
have two handles or no handles, it would not be homotopy equivalent to a circle.
This concept has been explored by mathematicians for over a hundred years, but
its use in problems related to mathematical physics has been a recent phenomena.
The principal investigator will contribute to this growing interdisciplinary
activity.
