Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks $ 15,000 from NSF to support
fifteen $ 1,000 graduate student and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral travel stipends for
participation in the Society for Conservation Biology&lt;br/&gt;annual meeting
at the University of Kent in Canterbury, U.K., July 14-19,
2002.&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be selected based on the conceptual
significance of the conservation&lt;br/&gt;biology issue addressed including:
quality of the research design and analysis;&lt;br/&gt;applicability of the
research to environmental problem solving; written organization
and&lt;br/&gt;data presentation; merit and feasibility of the
applicant&amp;#8217;s rationale for why her&lt;br/&gt;(his) research will be
substantially enhanced through participation in the U.K. meeting,&lt;br/&gt;as
well as how (s)he will disseminate results from the experience upon return to
the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., through networks developed at the meeting or through
local chapters of the SCB).&lt;br/&gt;Participants will co-author an article
about the meeting for the November, 2002, SCB&lt;br/&gt;Newsletter.
