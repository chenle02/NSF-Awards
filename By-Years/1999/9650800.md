This project involves the implementation of equipment in developing
nontraditional course materials for the Thermal Science and Aerospace
Engineering programs. These innovations extensively utilize a discovery-oriented
learning environment in the Mechanical Engineering Department known as the
Discovery Classroom. In the Discovery Classroom, the traditional lecture hall
has been redefined to include a multimedia classroom, an adjoining experimental
laboratory, and computational facilities to create a unique environment where
nontraditional learning can take place. The Discovery Classroom emphasizes an
integrated approach to engineering education by simultaneously exposing students
to different analysis techniques (theoretical, computational, and experimental)
on a daily basis. The course materials employed are developing student awareness
of the interrelated nature of the different analysis techniques; the advantages,
limitations, and appropriate context for the use of each; and the practical
incorporation of these techniques into the engineering design process. This
innovative approach is redefining several basic thermal fluid science courses at
the sophomore level. Innovations consist of (1) nontraditional lectures that
utilize the experimental apparatus and computer simulations directly in the
lecture hall of the Discovery Classroom, (2) interactive classroom exercises in
which students compare real-time data from the in-class experiments and
simulations to developed theory concurrently, and (3) open-ended design projects
emphasizing rapid prototyping and experimental evaluation of candidate designs.
The major equipment used in this project includes several heat transfer
apparatuses, a potential flow table, a flow visualization system, a data
acquisition system and several computer workstations with software. In addition
to its use in the Discovery Classroom, the equipment can also support a new Heat
Transfer Laboratory.
