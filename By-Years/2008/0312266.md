The objective of this project is to support the Data Grid infrastructure by
developing new and original techniques for efficient storage, retrieval, and
analysis of complex scientific data. The main focus is on the development of a
highly scalable data engine geared toward the needs of analytical computing in
Data Grid environments. However, keys to the realization of the project are the
advances in the areas of indexing and clustering data in multi-dimensional
spaces.

While the main goal of analytical computing in Data Grid environments is to
facilitate hypothesis formulation or to test the validity of a postulated
scientific model, its primary method is usually that of data clustering. Since
typical analytical tasks also rely on ad-hoc data exploration, any data engine
for Grid-enabled analytical computing must support an integrated set of
different retrieval and clustering techniques. The data engine developed in this
project will feature: an efficient and scalable indexing technique for data in
high-dimensional spaces, which will include a practical solution for handling
data with missing information; a new and original access method for similarity
searching in multi-dimensional spaces; and an original technique for clustering
large volumes of multi-dimensional data, which will require no dimensionality
reduction.
