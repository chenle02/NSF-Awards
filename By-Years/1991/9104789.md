This study will involve: 1) Detailed sulfur and reconnaissance O-H isotopic
analyses designed to delineate MVT provinces and constrain sources of
mineralizing brines and sulfur, 2) evaluation of newly designed 87Sr/86Sr dating
method for sphalerite, and application of this method to determine the age of
MVT mineralization. These data will be used to determine the relation between
MVT mineralization, foreland basin development, and deformation in the southern
and central Appalachians, and to test the possibility that significant fluid
migration and possible MAT mineralization preceded the Late Paleozoic
Alleghenian orogeny. The results should provide insights into the genesis of MAT
mineralization, the timing of brine movement in collisional margin basins, and
mechanisms of basinal brine expulsion.
