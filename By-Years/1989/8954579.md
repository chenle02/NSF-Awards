This is a cooperative project for the development of teacher leadership in
science and mathematics at the early childhood level. This two-year project will
involve 67 participants in a three-week summer institute, four follow-up
meetings during the school year, and a leadership retreat. Based on the
successful Tri-County Mathematics Project (TCMP) model and supported by its
trained leaders, this project includes participation by the Office of the Santa
Barbara County Superintendent of Schools, Santa Barbara City College, the
University of California Santa Barbara, and local school districts. The goals
are to enhance preschool and primary teachers' knowledge of science and
mathematics, develop a new cadre of early childhood education teacher fellows to
bridge the gap between preschool and K-3, bring together teachers from different
school districts for cooperative learning, link with TCMP for preschool-12
continuity, implement recommendations of California's School Readiness Task
Force Report, and develop positive early science and mathematics experiences for
young children and their families.
