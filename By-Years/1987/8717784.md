The self-fulfilling prophecy is one of the most important theoretical notions to
have arisen in social psychology. The idea that one individual, entrapped in the
expectations and stereotypes of others, can somehow be caused to fulfill those
expectations, holds out the promise of understanding many important social
phenomena, ranging from the ways in which negatively stereotyped children are
left behind in the educational process, to the ways in which those who have
sought treatment for mental illness are labelled by others and treated in a
fashion that can sustain or increase their difficulties. Despite the clear
social importance of the self-fulfilling prophecy, there has been little theory
developed to predict the conditions under which the effect will take place, or
to specify how the effect can be avoided. Darley and Hilton outline a general
model of social interaction and perception which emphasizes the goal-directed
nature of these endeavors. Based upon this model, these researchers derive
specific predictions about both the occurrence and non-occurrence of self-
fulfilling prophecy effects and will conduct a series of experiments which test
these predictions. If these predictions are confirmed, then two purposes will
have been fulfilled. First, there will be evidence for the validity of a view of
social interaction and perception in which the strategies and goals of the
participants are accorded central importance. Second, there will be a good deal
of evidence about the workings of the self-fulfilling prophecy. More
specifically, there will be some confirmation for a theory that specifies not
just that self-fulfilling prophecies exist, but begins to delimit the conditions
under which these prophecy effects occur. At the level of policy, this should
mean that we can go beyond deploring the existence of self-fulfilling prophecies
and "cautioning against" their occurrence, to make some specific recommendations
about how their pernicious effects can be avoided or even reversed.
