9633756 Corliss This project will compare live and recently-dead (core-top)
specimens of epibenthic foraminifera from depth transects on the Ontong-Java
Plateau. Previous work indicates a systematic decrease of incorporated trace
metals and 13C with increasing depth and with decreasing saturation stat of
calcite. These trends could reflect either an effect of dissolution, or
fractionation during growth under varying saturation state. The effects can be
discriminated by live/dead comparison; if there is no difference then
dissolution does not play a role.
