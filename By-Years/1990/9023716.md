Among the most impressive strides in astrophysics over the last decade has been
in the area of the physics of compact stars. Part of the reason for these
advances has been the less visible but equally important progress made in the
theory of their internal structure. In the past several years the Principal
Investigator (PI) has been at the forefront of the application of solid-state
theoretical physics to the construction of models of white dwarfs and neutron
stars. This one-year award will provide support for a student, Mr. Gordon Brown,
to continue his Ph.D. dissertation on two related topics: disk oscillations of
low-mass X-ray binaries and nonradial pulsations of magnetized neutron stars.
The first of these is currently a keen subject of X-ray observational research.
The second is a new class of pulsation modes endemic only to magnetic neutron
stars ("pulsars").
