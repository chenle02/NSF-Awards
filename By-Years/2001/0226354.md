This Collections project is assembling and managing an extensive collection of
STEM digital video materials produced by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics. The Center's collection of digital video materials supporting STEM
education reform has been developed over the past decade and a half at a cost of
some $15 million, and includes source materials for well-known television
programs such as A PRIVATE UNIVESE along with professional development materials
created for Annenberg/CPB. The collection consists of some 3,500 hours of video
footage, archived in digital form and indexed through a searchable database.
Materials in this collection span a variety of topics and formats and include
high-quality, case-study footage showing teaching in action, rare and difficult
to create materials documenting children's ideas in science and math, interviews
with internationally prominent researchers in STEM learning, and computer
animations and other costly visualizations of STEM ideas. This project is
establishing a library of 350 hours of digital video materials supporting STEM
education that will be available through the NSDL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project
personnel are reviewing the entire collection for materials of value in
supporting standards-based learning. Appropriate materials are being tagged
according to their applicability to these standards, the collection is being
culled to a manageable and useful size, and catalogued so teachers and teacher
educators are able to search the collection by STEM discipline, age level, or
content area. The project is making these materials broadly accessible on a web
platform while archiving a full-resolution master copy as part of the Harvard
Library. The web interface is linking the collection to NRC National Science
Education Standards, AAAS Benchmarks, and state and local standards. The project
is working with advisors from the NSDL Core Integration program to ensure
metadata and formats conform to related efforts of the NSDL. It is also paving
the way for the use of video in education while providing educators broad access
to vital materials supporting STEM education reform. Significant co-funding of
this project is being provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in
the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences in recognition of the
importance that this collection of digital video resources on the nature of
science learning has for K-12 teachers and undergraduate faculty.&lt;br/&gt;
