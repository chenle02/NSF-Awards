This engineering education research project seeks to support and increase
student motivation by understanding situational motivation in the engineering
classroom, and providing rapid feedback to instructors in order to allow them to
impact student motivation. The proposed study will explore situational
motivation and seek to develop new ways to analyze data obtained in the
classroom to track and understand motivation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project is that by understanding student
motivation and collecting data rapidly, it may be possible to develop feedback
tools for engineering instructors to make students more motivated. The
differential impact of various motivational strategies for groups under-
represented in engineering may impact retention and persistence. This project
overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through
preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.
Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results
and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and
practices.
