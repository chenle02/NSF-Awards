The Second U.S.-Korea Synthetic Biology Conference will focus on the latest
advances in synthetic biology research and applications, bringing together key
stakeholders from academic institutions in the United States and Republic of
Korea. The conference includes talks on a variety of areas of synthetic biology
research, and includes group discussions such as biofoundries and the
bioeconomy, advancing synthetic biology education, and using synthetic biology
to address global grand challenges. As a consequence of these interactions, the
conference creates a unique environment for diverse researchers from the United
States and Korea to gather and exchange ideas. The conference also provides a
venue for discussing synthetic biology research in agriculture, biotechnology
and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, the conference aims to give students
and early career professionals opportunities to share their work, to network
with the foremost leaders in the field, and to develop their careers.

Synthetic biology has enormous potential to revolutionize medicine, agriculture,
biotechnology, and energy usage. By sharing knowledge and expertise at the
Second U.S.-Korea Synthetic Biology Conference, scientists in the United States
and South Korea will advance their research programs in synthetic biology and
increase their potential to contribute to these sectors and to the bioeconomy.
The conference gathers an interdisciplinary audience to share technical
presentations on cutting edge synthetic biology research and applications, and
to network and develop relationships for future collaborations. Attendees
include leaders in the field, established researchers, early career
professionals and trainees who will lead the field in the coming decades. The
conference aims to generate promising new approaches in synthetic biology
research and to identify key research milestones in synthetic biology.
