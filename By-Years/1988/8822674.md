This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program to support the research of
Dr. William P. Dailey III at the University of Pennsylvania. The research deals
with the synthesis and reaction behavior of fluorinated carbenes with the major
goal of achieving a detailed understanding of the chemical bonding and
reactivity of high energy compounds and reactive intermediates. Reactivity and
direct spectroscopic detection of singlet carbenes which have the opportunity to
undergo 1,2-rearrangements, such as ethylidenes and methylidenecarbenes, are of
particular interest. Judicious substitution of fluorine on the carbene will slow
or inhibit rearrangement thereby making the carbenes observable under matrix
isolation conditions. The synthesis and reactivity of novel carbene precursors
including diazirines and propadienones will also be explored. Theoretical
calculations will be used as a tool to probe the chemistry and reactivity of the
various systems to be studied.
