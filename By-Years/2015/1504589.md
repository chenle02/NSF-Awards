Loredana Lanzani and her collaborators will explore a number of fundamental
questions in the area of Several Complex Variables and Partial Differential
Equations, with emphasis onthe ambient domain's lack of boundary regularity. To
accomplish these goals Loredana Lanzani and her collaborators will develop new
techniques that hinge upon an interplay of complex analysis and harmonic
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several Complex Variables, Harmonic
Analysis and Partial Differential Equations are major branches of mathematics.
They are of paramount importance in pure and applied sciences and have vastly
contributed to our present-day understanding of such basic phenomena as heat
transfer and celestial mechanics.
