This proposal seeks the partial support of ICCG-10 and ISSCG-8, which will be
held in San Diego and Palm Springs, CA, respectively. The former will be held
from August 16th to 22nd, and the latter will be held from August 9th to 14th of
1992. The conference will examine all aspect of bulk and thin film crystal
growth, with particular emphasis placed on: (1) melt and solution growth of bulk
crystals; (2) thin films and epitaxial growth by MOCVD and MBE; (3) crystal
compounds including electro-optic materials and superconductors; (4) the theory
of crystal growth; (5) crystal growth in microgravity envirenment; (6) novel
growth techniques; and (7) advanced materials, such as fullerenes, light
emitting silicon structures, and others. %%%% Both the Summer School and the
International Conference are the major events organized by and for the crystal
growth scientific and technology community of the world. As such, they are truly
international, as they are organized and planned by the international planning
board. In 1992, it is the U.S. who will act as the host country. Both the Summer
School and the International Conference have plans to publich their proceedings.
Proceedings of this series have been valuable literature in the field of crystal
growth.
