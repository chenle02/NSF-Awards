9414336 Kamoua High performance fundamental mode InP based Gunn sources
operating at D-Band frequencies shall be developed. The goal is to achieve CW
output powers greater than 100mW at efficiencies approaching 5% at 140GHz.
Design of these sources shall be accomplished using a Monte Carlo model. A PhD
graduate student supported by this grant will conduct the actual fabrication and
testing at the EPSD of the Army Research Labs. ***
