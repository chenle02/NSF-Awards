With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Joshua W.
Hamilton and Stephen A. Bobin of Dartmouth College will acquire a Matrix-
assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass
Spectrometer. This instrument, which will be used to obtain very accurate
molecular weights of biological molecules, will be integrated into the existing
Dartmough College Molecular Biology (MB) Core facility. The MALDI-TOF will be
particularly important in a new initiative at Dartmough, the Structural Biology
Genetics, which is an interdisciplinary, collaborative efforts among the basic
science departments of the College of Arts & Sciences, the Dartmough Medical
School, and the Thayer School of Engineering. The main functions of the
instrument in the facility will be protein identification, peptide synthesis
verification and oligonucleotide verification. Five independent investigators
also cite projects ranging from the study of bipolar array of microtubules to
mRNA export in yeast. The use of the instrument by underrepresented groups is
also addressed.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights
on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high sensitivity.
Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique
in most DNA/protein core facilities. The ability to obtain very accurate
molecular weights of biological molecules is fundamental to all biological and
biomedical research and essential in a modern research and training environment.
