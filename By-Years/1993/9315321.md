9315321 Garinther The Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics and Biomechanics
(CHABA) is a standing committee of the National Research Council of the National
Academy of Sciences. This committee provides scientific expertise and advice to
the Federal government agencies on issues related to human hearing, posture, and
vibration sensitivity. The committee responds to Federal and other requests for
information, and selects working groups from among experts in the field to
address particular issues. The written reports receive further review before
publication by the National Research Council, to ensure high scientific
credibility for the information to be used in further decisions. This project is
to maintain an NSF contribution to share with other agencies the ongoing support
of this unique activity that provides scientific advice for national needs. ***
