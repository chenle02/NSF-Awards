The purpose of this research is to examine local atomic order in several
metallic alloy systems that display a metastable transitional state. Early
stages of homogeneous precipitation is examined in aluminum-copper-magnesium,
iron-beryllium and nickel-beryllium alloys. Precipitation from nickel-aluminum
alloys is studied to better understand formation of ordered precipitates. The
structure of ferrous martensites immediately following the quench is being
determined; structural changes from tempering is also pursued. Local atomic
order in mercury- cadmium-telluride is being determined using synchrotron
anomalous dispersion techniques. Advanced X-ray diffraction methods are the
primary experimental tool used to characterize the alloy systems. Advanced
diffuse X-ray scattering techniques from atomic displacements and the associated
analysis are part of the research.
