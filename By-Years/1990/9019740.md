This award will support the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from the University of Texas. The project involves the negotiation of social
identity through the strategic use of language among Arabs and Jews in Haifa,
Israel. The project will investigate how social groups form and transform their
identities in everyday interaction through the strategic manipulation of
language. Objectives include collection of a representative sample of speech
recorded in natural settings; eliciting the pragmatic meaning associated with
variation in such speech; and analyzing the power relations being negotiated in
such interactions. Results will contribute to social and linguistic theory and
will address practical issues of achieving harmonious social relations in
Israel.
