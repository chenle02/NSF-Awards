The primary purpose of this U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr. Todor
Stanev of the University of Delaware and Dr. H. P. Vankov of the Bulgarian
Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy is to study electromagnetic
shower behavior. These showers or cascades accompany the production, propagation
and detection of high-energy particle signals from astrophysical sources. Joint
research efforts will concentrate on defining shower properties by observing
differences between hadronic and photonic showers. Results are expected to
provide details on energy dissipation and may prove useful in identification and
analysis of these high- energy signals in relation to the origin of cosmic
radiation. This project in elementary particle physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
