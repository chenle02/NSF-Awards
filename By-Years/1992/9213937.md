The focus of this research will be to use directed hydrogen bonding interactions
to control the size and shape of self-assembling organic structures in both
solution and in the solid state. The first goal of thew work is to understand
the structural features necessary for the self-organization of different cyclic
and linear hydrogen bonded aggregates, some unsubstituted and some with
photoactive functionality attached. The second goal is to understand the
energetics of self-assembly and the balance between the favorable enthalpy and
unfavorable entropy of aggregate formation. %%% With this award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew D. Hamilton of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Hamilton will
focus his work on the design, synthesis and evaluation of self-assembling
organic structures.
