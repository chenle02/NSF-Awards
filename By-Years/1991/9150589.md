The Student-Oriented project is improving introductory science coerces by 1)
developing new microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) tools useful in a number of
disciplines, 2) developing, supporting, disseminating, and evaluating
interactive introductory physics materials of the type developed in the Tools
for Scientific Thinking project at Tufts University and in the Workshop Physics
program at Dickinson College. The work is being extended to the learning
environments found at large universities. The flexibility of these materials
allows colleges and universities to incrementally introduce changes in the way
they teach. The project is extensively testing both individual learning modules
and total curricula by working with physicists from Dickinson College, Tufts
University, University of Oregon, Boise State University in Idaho, Muskingum
College, Ohio State, Rutgers University, the University of Washington, and
others. Several criteria which will be considered in the evaluation of the
materials include student attitudes toward science, level of scientific
literacy, and conceptual learning gains. Materials are being produced that work
well with underprepared and science-anxious students and with non-science as
well as science majors.
