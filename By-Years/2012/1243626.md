This project supports travel grants to US students and junior faculty to
participate in the 31st IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems
(SRDS)(http://web.mst.edu/~cswebdb/srds2012/)being held in Irvine, CA, USA,
October 8-11, 2012. This is a high quality technical conference for researchers
and practitioners who are interested in reliability, security, availability,
privacy, and safety of distributed systems. It typically attracts 100-125
papers, 25-30 accepted papers, and 75 to 100 attendees. In addition, the
conference also has workshops and PhD forum activities. The middle-sized nature
of this conference makes it suitable for extended technical discussions among
participants. Being held in the US to enable participants from the US to learn
about the computing profession and research environment around the world will
likely to have an enriching effect on the fledgling research careers of the
awardees and start off discussions between them and the academic and industrial
participants from US, Europe and Asia in general.
