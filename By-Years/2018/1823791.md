Title: Access to Civil Justice: Integrating and Advancing Theory and
Practice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year, over
100 million Americans will confront a civil justice problem. These civil justice
problems have broad impacts on those affected, including (among others) their
livelihood, the security of their shelter, their ability to work, their access
to health care, their chances to participate in the rearing of their children,
and care for dependent adults in their lives. Many of these legal problems go
unresolved, and others are resolved unfairly. Achieving meaningful access to
justice for Americans requires an empirically-grounded and evidence-based
understanding of what is currently happening with the public?s access to
justice, as well as which concrete proposals for increasing access to justice
are likely to be efficacious, scalable, and sustainable. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project will consist of a census-style survey of academic
disciplines engaged in access to justice scholarship and an intensive workshop.
It is designed to build a research field and an evidence base by identifying
emerging access to justice researchers, coordinating collaboration across
academic disciplines, and producing a research agenda and original scholarship
to give access to justice research the vigor and definition of a field. The
approach advances access to justice scholarship by identifying new questions for
the field and supporting the development of research projects by promising
early-career scholars working in the interdisciplinary area of access to
justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
