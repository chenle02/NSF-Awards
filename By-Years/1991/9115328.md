It is proposed to determine the feasibility of a new method for nondestructive
evaluation of debonding in fibrous composite materials. The method is based upon
micromechanical predictions which indicate that damage in the form of debonding
in unidirectional metal matrix composites has no influence on the axial modulus
in the fiber direction, but it does have an appreciable influence on the shear
modulus for loading by pure longitudinal composites subjected to combined stress
states remains an open question. The proposed test method will exploit the
knowledge available from the micromechanical predictions to assess debonding in
silicon-carbide/titanium tubes through a series of carefully chosen sequential,
multiaxial load increments. The method is nondestructive in the sense that in -
situ stress and strain measurements provide the necessary data. It is not
necessary to remove the specimen form the test machine, take edge replicas, use
x-ray equipment, or conduct microscopic studies on sectioned portions of the
specimens.
