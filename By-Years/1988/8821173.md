Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers the
chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the study of the physical
and chemical properties of materials. Fundamental knowledge of structure and
dynamics of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and liquid
crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques. Solid-state NMR studies
often complement those carried out using solution NMR and X-ray analysis. Access
to solid-state NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out
frontier research. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program
and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to acquire a
high-field NMR spectrometer suitable for carrying out solid-state NMR studies.
The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include
the following: 1) Solid-state NMR of chemically modified surfaces 2) NMR of
polymer melts, liquid crystals, solids and gels 3) Solid-state NMR spectral
studies of polymer-bound transition metal electrocatalysts 4) Carbon-13 and
phosphorous-31 CP-MAS NMR studies of dioxyphosphoranes 5) Electroactive polymers
and films 6) High-resolution electrophoretic NMR and MRI for the
characterization of microemulsions.
