A 200 MHz NMR spectrometer with 1H, 13C and 2D capability will be acquired to
enhance undergraduate research and instruction. A Varian Gemini 200 Spectrometer
will replace an obsolete and frequently inoperable 60 MHz CW instrument. Several
novel experiments for the FT-NMR instrument will extend beyond 1H NMR in the
organic chemistry courses. It will be used intensively in organic chemistry
instruction and will also be used in laboratory courses in analytical chemistry,
biochemistry, inorganic chemistry and instrumental methods. A number of current
senior projects that cannot be done with the present instrument can be completed
on a sensitive high field NMR. These include structural studies on an
organochlorine compound from a Clitocybe mushroom, characterization of a
sesquiterpene that smells like cedar from a Hygrophorous mushroom,
characterization of a highly reactive aminobenzoquinone from a Lepiota mushroom,
and further structural studies on buzonamine, a novel epoxy-alkaloid from the
millipede Buzonium crassipes. The grantee is matching this award from non-
Federal sources.
