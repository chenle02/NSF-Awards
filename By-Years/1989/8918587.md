It is proposed to study experimentally both nonerodible and bioerodible polymer
pore structure and morphology. Both polymers exhibit structurally complex
systems, and the bioerodible components will show a dynamically changing pore
structure. Although it may not be possible to perform a fully computerized image
analysis of these systems within the constraints of the grant, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy will provide quantitative insight into the
pore morphology of these systems. Photomicrographs of the polymer taken at
various times during the erosion process will allow the changing structure to be
followed in order to provide the basis for the system model.
