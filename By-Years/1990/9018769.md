Understanding basin geometry and its relationship to the sedimentary record is
critical for the development and testing of rifting models. Seismic imaging,
combined with drill hole data and surface geology,provides one of the best
methods for understanding this relationship. The purpose of this project is to
use recently released seismic data from the Newark basin. The studies to be
under taken deal with establishing the relationship of units imaged in the
seismic profiles to units known at the surface, establishing the nature of units
known only in the subsurface, determining the three-dimensional structure, and
working out the relationship between faulting, subsidence, and sedimentation.
