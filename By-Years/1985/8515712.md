This project is a study of molecular diffusion in homogeneous polymer-solvent
systems. The main thrust of the work is an investigation of transport processes
which occur when there is coupling between molecular migration and polymer chain
relaxation. This coupling phenomenon results in "anomalous" diffusion effects
which ave excluded a fundamental understanding of many processes which involve
polymer-solvent interactions. A newly developed oscillatory sorption technique
is utilized to study the coupling of diffusional transport and relaxation which
is unique to polymer-solvent systems. This is the only experimental technique
available which permits an unambiguous investigation of this phenomenon. The
experimental results are used to formulate constitutive equations to describe
diffusional fluxes taking place under conditions where migration and polymer
chain relaxation are interacting.
