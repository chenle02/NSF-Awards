This research involves a synergism of analytical and numerical studies of
problems in combustion and flame propagation. This approach is highly successful
in elucidating behavior of solutions to the highly nonlinear systems of partial
differential equations under study. Interest centers on problems exhibiting
complex spatio-temporal dynamics in gaseous combustion as well as in solid fuel
combustion and in heterogeneous combustion (solid plus gas), which arise in the
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis process for advanced materials. The
goal of the research is to describe transitions to, and the structure of,
complex solution behavior. The project addresses gaseous combustion problems in
the areas of flames with sequential reactions and flames in gas filled tubes.
These systems exhibit transitions to states with greater degrees of spatio-
temporal complexity as parameters are varied. The project also analyzes problems
in solid fuel combustion, in which high temperature combustion waves, referred
to as solid flames, are used to synthesize advanced materials. Research centers
on the areas of solid flames and filtration combustion, which involves
heterogeneous combustion, with reaction between gas and solid phases. The
analytical studies are based on bifurcation and nonlinear stability theories,
which employ asymptotic analysis and singular perturbation theory in the
neighborhood of bifurcation or other transition points to yield a local
description of the solution. An adaptive pseudo-spectral method is employed for
large scale scientific computations, with which the local description is
globally extended. The solutions exhibit layers, localized regions in which the
solution varies rapidly. The adaptive pseudo-spectral method successfully meets
the challenge of accurately and efficiently resolving such layer type behavior.

This project is concerned with understanding processes that occur in energy
conversion and materials synthesis, two areas of national importance. The
research in energy conversion is focused on flame structure and dynamics, which
involve interactions among many physical mechanisms. To determine cause and
effect relations among the various mechanisms, this work explores parameter
dependencies. The research in materials synthesis studies the use of combustion
waves to produce materials having desired properties, for example, extreme
hardness or imperviousness to temperature extremes. In this innovative
technological process, which appears to enjoy advantages over conventional
technology, the combustion wave propagates through the sample, converting an
unreacted solid powder mixture to solid product. When so synthesized, materials
can have superior properties.
