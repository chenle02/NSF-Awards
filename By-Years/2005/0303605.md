The principal investigator proposes to study problems in arithmetic algebraic
geometry and the representation theory of p-adic groups and their Hecke
algebras, which arise in the study of Shimura varieties with bad reduction. A
classical problem due to Langlands and others which motivates much of this
research is the description of the Hasse-Weil zeta function of a Shimura variety
in terms of automorphic L-functions. The former is an object defined using
cohomology which is expected to contain deep arithmetic and geometric
information about the Shimura variety (e.g., the Bloch-Kato and Beilinson
conjectures). The automorphic L-functions are functions of a complex variable
with amazing symmetry properties, whose analytic behavior is better understood
than that of the zeta functions, and which can therefore be used (via the hoped-
for description) to uncover mysterious properties of the latter. A complete
description of the zeta function requires one to consider primes of bad
reduction.&lt;br/&gt;Shimura varieties have historically played an important
role in establishing "higher reciprocity laws" which are at the heart of the
Langlands program, which in general posits an important link between arithmetic
(Galois representations) and analysis (automorphic forms). The study of their
bad reduction is little understood in general, but is often crucial: for
example, it played a key role in the proof of the local Langlands conjecture for
the general linear group over a p-adic field, due to M. Harris and R. Taylor.
The PI proposes to study bad reduction of parahoric type, where many of the
issues which complicate the general picture (describing the reduction modulo p,
problems with combinatorics and endoscopy, monodromy questions) arise, but where
progress is possible by relating the singularities to those in affine flag
varieties, and by applying the theory of perverse sheaves and other techniques
useful in geometric representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;
