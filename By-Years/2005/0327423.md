ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0327423&lt;br/&gt;OCE-
0327446&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without understanding the type, magnitude and time
scale over with dissolved organic matter (DOM) gets modified in rivers and
estuaries, the regional and global delivery of total dissolved organic matter
delivered to the ocean and its chemical and isotopic signatures will be poorly
constrained. For this reason, scientists from the Virginia Institute of Marine
Science and Old Dominion University plan to carry out a multi-technique approach
to determine the photochemical and microbial processes that control the
structural alteration and terminal oxidative losses of total dissolved organic
matter (TDOM) during its residence in the York and Delaware River estuarine
systems. These two temperate estuaries are characterized by different total
dissolved organic matter ages and sources. Utilizing photochemical (i.e.,
irradiation), stable and radio-isotopic, structural &lt;br/&gt;tools (i.e.,
13C-NMR) and bacterial degradation experiments, the PIs will evaluate how the
photochemical and microbial processes mechanistically impact the qualitative and
quantitative nature of TDOM export and how photochemical reactivity of estuarine
DOM is changed by riverine source age, composition and photo-
oxidation/photobleaching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
