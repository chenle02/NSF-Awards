About 2.4 million years ago, our relatively warm plant with an ice budget
confined to Antarctica was thrust into late Cenzoic global ice ages with
pulsating ice sheets at both poles. A fundamental scientific question is the
nature of warm-earth climate dynamics in the few million years preceding this
change. The objective of this project is to test the primary hypotheses for
maximum and minimum ice sheet configuration during the late Neogene using a
finite-element model of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The synergism that will be
applied between Antarctic continent glacial geology, the deep-sea 18-0 record,
and ice physics provides constraints sufficient to limit significantly possible
ice sheet variations. The numerical ice sheet reconstructions that result will
best satisfy available data and have an impact on our understanding of global
environmental change.
