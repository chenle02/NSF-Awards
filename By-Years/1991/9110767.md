This is a proposal to complete the development of a new electrode array to
stimulate neurons in the cerebral cortex. The 10x10 silicon-based array,
arranged as a "brush" on a 4.2 mm square base, will contain circuitry to reduce
the number of lead-wires. The electrodes then will be implanted into the
somatosensory cortex of cats to evaluate durability and biocompatibility for use
as both recording and stimulating devices. Although the eventual goal of the
project is to use such electrodes for the electrical stimulation of blind
individuals to partially restore some visual sensation, the electrode array
should be also useful for recording information from deep cortical structures.
