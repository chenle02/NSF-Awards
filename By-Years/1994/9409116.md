The goal of this RPG project is to address the perception of equiluminant
motion and to ask how eye movements affect perception. In addition, there will
be a test of a model of equiluminant motion which suggests that perceptual
processing of equiluminant motion depends both on information in the retinal
image and on information concerning eye movements. This work will contribute to
the development of basic understanding of motion processing in ways that will
allow for more generalized models of human performance, and will help lead to
better predictions about human performance and will provide information for the
design of displays as well.
