This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Di Stefano and her co-
investigators will use gravitational lensing to explore the local neighborhood
of the Galaxy, the region within 1 kiloparsec. They will develop methods to
identify local neutron stars, to measure their masses and transverse velocities,
and to determine the fraction of them with companions, including planets. These
studies will allow ongoing and new programs, including the planned Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope, to discover and study hundreds of neutron stars. This
work and parallel work may lead to the discovery of dozens of local black holes,
as well as low-mass dwarf stars. Studies of planets around dwarf stars via
gravitational lensing may have implications for our understanding of the
ubiquity of life throughout the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader
Impacts of this program include methods for automated detection and
classification of variability, which has broad application, and training of
graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
