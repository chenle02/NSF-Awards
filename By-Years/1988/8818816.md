The SUNDIAL programs bring scientists from the ionosphere, solar-
interplanetary, magnetosphere and mesosphere disciplines together to study
global aspects of ionospheric variations. The campaigns of observations,
analysis and theoretical modeling are conducted through workshops to enhance
interaction. The steady progress is achieved in global studies by this
coordinated approach.
