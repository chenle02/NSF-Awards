9411856 Kareiva The study of ominvores (animals that feed at more than one
trophic level) has lagged behind studies of more specialized feeders; there have
been no experimental studies of the roles of omnivores in natural communities.
Yet omnivores are abundant in most natural communities. Through a series of
manipulative field experiements, this project attempts to determine how omnivory
influences arthropod assemblages, characterize the community effects of omnivory
based on size structure of predator species, and predict the role of omnivory in
stabilizing or destabilizing terrestrial ecosystems. This research will improve
our fundamental understanding of food web dynamics and the operation of
ecosystems. The results will have application in ecosystem management,
management of biological reserves, and conservation of biodiversity.
