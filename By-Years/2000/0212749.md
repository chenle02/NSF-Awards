Human activities are increasingly affecting earth's environment and ecosystems
not only through direct impacts on climate and element cycling, but also by
increasing the pace of introductions and extinctions of species. Because carbon
and nutrients are cycled through the biosphere and plant species differ in
traits that affect the rates of cycling of these elements, the abundance and
diversity of species must affect ecosystem function. However, the extent to
which individual plant species affect ecosystem function and the relationship
between species diversity and ecosystem response to perturbation are still
largely unknown. To what extent can plant species substitute for each other in
ecosystem function? What key traits determine whether a plant species' effect on
nutrient cycling can be substituted by other species? &lt;br/&gt;A field
experiment in Alaskan tussock tundra will examine these questions by removing
different combinations of plant species in the presence and absence of
fertilization. The investigators will obtain a detailed picture of how
interactions between plant species control how nutrients are redistributed under
fertilization, because nutrients are a primary control over carbon storage in
this highly nutrient-limited ecosystem. They will also track potential
introductions of new species as plant community composition shifts because of
the removals or fertilization. The results will help reveal how human-induced
environmental perturbations may change the mechanisms controlling ecosystem
carbon storage and plant species abundance and diversity.&lt;br/&gt;This is a
