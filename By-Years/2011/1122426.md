Which properties of human language are universal, and which may vary across
languages? Answering these questions will help us understand the unique human
capacity for language, through which we hope to gain insight into the overall
architecture of the human mind. This dissertation project aims to further this
goal through a careful investigation of several interrelated linguistic
phenomena found in Zulu, an understudied Bantu language spoken in South Africa.
MIT doctoral student Claire Halpert, under the supervision of David Pesetsky and
Norvin Richards, will conduct linguistic fieldwork on the sentence-structure of
Zulu, working with speakers in South Africa and the US. Her study focuses on the
factors that govern the complex process of verbal agreement in the language.
Though verbs in Zulu nearly always agree with their subjects, certain
constructions (including some with special verb-subject word order and others in
which a noun lacks an otherwise characteristic "augment") disrupt this agreement
relation in unique ways. By examining these constructions, this investigation
will advance our understanding of the connectons between verbs and nouns and the
ways in which nouns are "licensed" to appear in particular grammatical
positions.

Although Zulu is spoken by roughly 10 million people and encompasses multiple
dialects, numerous dialect differences within the language remain undocumented.
Halpert's fieldwork will begin to remedy this situation, documenting dialectal
variation in several key aspects of Zulu grammatical structure, and will thus
allow for more a fine-grained understanding of linguistic variation more
generally. The project will document multiple varieties of Zulu at a time when
the language is undergoing rapid change, capturing the language at a stage that
may not persist for long. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award
will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong
independent research career.
