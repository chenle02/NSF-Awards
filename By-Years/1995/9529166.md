This dissertation project will provide experimental and naturalistic studies of
the first language acquisition of children between the ages of three and six
years of age acquiring Inuktitut (a language of the Eskimo-Aleut family) as
their first language in Igloolik, N.W.T., Canada. This research will be
particularly significant because (i) it will contribute to providing
foundational knowledge on the acquisition of languages with highly complex
morphology; (ii) it will examine the concurrent acquisition of syntax and
morphology, and the ways in which the child's developing knowledge of one might
contribute to knowledge of the other; (iii) it will investigate aspects of the
human cognitive competence for language in the context of a language (and a
language family) which has been little studied to date; and (iv) it will provide
important descriptive information on a North American language in an area where
there is current concern about severe language loss.
