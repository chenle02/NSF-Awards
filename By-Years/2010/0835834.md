A Novel Information Model For Efficient Routing Protocols in Delay Tolerant
Networks with General Mobility

This project supports the research on a novel information model for efficient
routing protocols in delay tolerant networks with general mobility. Delay
Tolerant Network (DTN) is a type of wireless mobile network that does not
guarantee the existence of a path between a source and a destination at any
time. It has broad applications in sensor-based, satellite, underwater acoustic
networks, and Internet connectivity in remote places. In this project, nodes
mobility cannot be predicted. Routing in DTNs with general mobility poses unique
challenges due to the uncertainty and the time-varying nature of network
connectivity. To facilitate the routing, a novel information model using the
least square methods and their variations are explored. The techniques involve
the information that each node should gather and process so that the message can
be delivered to the destination as soon as possible even though the location of
the destination is unknown and unpredictable.
