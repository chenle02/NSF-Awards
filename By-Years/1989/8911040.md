The objective is a systematic investigation of relativistic meson-theoretic
approaches to low and intermediate energy physics. Topics will include
subthreshold pion production in heavy ion collisions, nucleon-nucleon
scattering, and relativistic nuclear structure. The aim is to provide
complementary information for the discussion of the role of subhadronic degrees
of freedom in low and medium energy nuclear physics.
