The proposed research will investigate highly specific and selective
electrosynthesis of organic compounds under mild reaction conditions using
immobilized enzyme-cofactor electrodes. This process shows promise to provide a
new class of biosensors and to provide for large-scale, energy efficient
manufacturing of organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The approach is to
develop a series of cytochrome P450 enzyme systems that will provide useful
reactions of synthetic value through an electrochemical process.
