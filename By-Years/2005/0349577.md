This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project proposes to
further optimize the techniques for engineering broad-spectrum disease
resistance in crop plants. Protection of crops against pathogens is one of the
most significant unmet needs in agriculture. Despite billions of dollars spent
on fungicides and other crop protection chemicals, significant economic losses
continue to occur every year. Prior Phase I work has established that
overexpression of the transcription factor AtERF1 confers resistance against
several fungal pathogens in Arabidopsis thaliana. The objectives of the Phase II
project are to characterize AtERF1 crop homologs, to demonstrate AtERF1 function
in the tomato crop, to optimize the technology by targeting expression to
different tissues, to broaden the spectrum of resistance through combinatorial
expression with other transcription factors, to optimize AtERF1 function by
creating derivatives with enhanced activity, and to improve understanding of
AtERF1 function by characterization of targets in Arabidopsis and tomato.

The commercial impact of this project will be significant as there is clearly a
market need for conferring broad spectrum disease resistance in economically
important crop plants.
