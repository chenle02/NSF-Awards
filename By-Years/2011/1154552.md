West Los Angeles College's "Riding the Road Map to Transfer" (RRMT) program is
providing approximately 78 S-STEM scholarships over five years to students in
biology, chemistry, geology/earth sciences, and physics/astronomy. The goal of
RRMT is to use high impact activities to engage, graduate, and transfer highly
motivated, predominately African American and Latino STEM students. RRMT student
scholars are (1) receiving financial aid, transfer and career counseling,
faculty mentoring, and presentations by invited scientists; (2) participating in
internships; (3) developing e-portfolios; and (4) building their knowledge of
research techniques, methodologies, and the application of science through
undergraduate research projects and targeted field
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RRMT's intellectual merit includes: (a)
drawing students from and exploring the relationships between the four basic
broad disciplines while reinforcing fundamental scientific principles and (b)
engaging with a diverse faculty from different disciplines through laboratory
exercises, outside-of-class experimental and research investigations, mentoring,
exposure to scientific meetings, and interactions with science in the
workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of RRMT is the direct
enhancement of the diversity of the STEM student body at regional universities
and the larger STEM workforce in Los Angeles. RRMT leverages the college's TRIO
SSS, EOC, and UB programs to recruit and support talented, motivated, and
financially needy minority students into STEM fields. Project findings are being
used to expand the college's understanding of how to support low-income
underrepresented STEM students and are made available to the larger STEM
academic community through the project website and presentations at regional and
national meetings.
