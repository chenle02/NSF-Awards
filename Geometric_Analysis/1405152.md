Abstract

Award: DMS 1405152, Principal Investigator: Mu-Tao Wang

The principal investigator proposes to study the notions of mass, energy,
angular momentum, and center of mass in general relativity. These notions are of
most fundamental importance in any branch of physics. However, since Einstein's
time, there has been great difficulty to find physically acceptable definitions
of these concepts for gravitation. The solutions of many unsolved problems such
as how a black hole forms and how black holes collide rely essentially on these
notions. Recently, the principal investigator and his collaborators successfully
discovered definitions for both isolated systems (e.g. when the observer is very
far away from a star) and non-isolated systems (e.g. when the observer is at
close range with two stars rotating about each other ). The definitions they
found satisfy many highly desirable properties, including the first precise
dynamical description of Einstein's equation.

This proposal describe plans to further explore these new definitions and their
applications. The results obtained in this project are expected to be crucial
steps towards deeper understanding of the universe in a large scale. The
principal investigator also proposes to study geometric flows. These are
differential equations that model how a geometric shape deforms and evolves to
an optimal form in the most efficient way. The proposed research is expected to
have applications in general relativity and mathematical physics. Another line
of investigation will study applications of quasi-local mass and quasi-local
conserved quantities such as angular momentum and center of mass, which he
recently discovered with his collaborators, aiming to anchor and resolve several
problems in classical general relativity. Immediate goals of this proposal
include resolving the invariant mass conjecture in general relativity,
justification of the definitions of conserved quantities at both the quasi-local
and total levels, and applications in the study of the dynamics of the Einstein
equation. The principal investigator will also continue his research on inverse
mean curvature flows and mean curvature flows. Immediate goals include the proof
of a Gibbons-Penrose inequality in Schwarzschild spacetime and the dynamical
stability of the mean curvature flow.
