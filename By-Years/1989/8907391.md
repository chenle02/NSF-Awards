The objective of this project is to provide a sound theoretical foundation for
pricing electric power system transmission reliability. This work will be based
on the use of Jacobian singularity methods and energy function methods for the
quantitative measurement of expected transmission marginal system outage costs
in real time. Because the conditions leading up to major or total collapse of
the power system are nonlinear, real-time prices at any one time and for the
given system condition may be dominated by reliability costs. A major part of
this research project will be the development of methods for assigning economic
values to reliability indices. The fundamental aim will be to match the
dimensions of the reliability indices with the dimensions of reliability for
which outage costs can be estimated.
