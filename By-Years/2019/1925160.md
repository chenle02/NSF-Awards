This proposal will support a symposium entitled "New Frontiers in Antarctic
Marine Biology" at the 2020&lt;br/&gt;Society of Integrative and Comparative
Biology (SICB) meeting will be held 3-7 January in Austin,&lt;br/&gt;Texas. SICB
has approximately 3000 members whose research interests span a wide range of
biological&lt;br/&gt;topics and their annual meetings are widely advertised and
attended. Topical areas will include, among&lt;br/&gt;others, the recent
dramatic ecological impacts of climate changes across multiple trophic levels
in&lt;br/&gt;Antarctic seas, advances in molecular and physiological aspects of
cold adaptation in marine algae,&lt;br/&gt;invertebrates, and fish, the role of
chemical ecology in structuring nearshore macroalgal-
mesograzer&lt;br/&gt;interactions in communities of the Antarctic Peninsula,
revising phylogeographic patterns in Antarctica in&lt;br/&gt;the age of 'omics,'
and advances in the use of biogeochemical markers to track diets and movement
of&lt;br/&gt;Antarctic marine predators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique marine
environment of Antarctica provides an exciting opportunity to showcase a
broadly&lt;br/&gt;based symposium on aspects of the biology of its rich and
diverse marine life. Not only are the topics in&lt;br/&gt;the proposed symposium
timely and to be presented by leaders in the field, they will encompass
cutting&lt;br/&gt;edge science, novel techniques, and future directions. The
presentations will be of pertinence to biologists&lt;br/&gt;(graduate students,
post-docs, and research faculty) working in temperate and tropical
marine&lt;br/&gt;environments, as well as polar marine
environments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
