This program on ionospheric density irregularities will focus on the fundamental
quantitative understanding of the characteristics of plasma turbulence in the E
and F regions of the Earth's ionosphere. The main objective will be to develop a
self- consistent theory of plasma turbulence driven by the Farley-Buneman
instability, which occurs when the cross-field drift velocity of the electrons
exceeds the sound velocity. In addition to the main objective, the PIs will
investigate the intermittent acceleration of electrons in current sheets that
develop because of magnetohydrodynamic activity in the medium.***
