9416119 Hauksson This research is to investigate the effect of lateral
variations in seismic velocity on the amplitude of damaging shear wave energy
within the Los Angeles basin from the 1994 Northridge earthquake in order to
resolve some of the questions of source versus structure as a cause of the
damaging motion. A horizontal acceleration of 0.93 g was measured at Santa
Monica and accelerations greater than 0.4 g were measured at other sites within
the L.A. basin in phases that followed the direct S-wave by more than 5 seconds.
These sites were farther from the source than sites within the Santa Monica
Mountains that recorded smaller accelerations. This complexity in the pattern of
peak accelerations may be caused by complications of the source rupture, for
example directivity of a later sub-event, and may also be caused by waveform
propagation effects through a complicated basin structure. This work is a step
towards the ultimate goal of creating a 3-D model for general use for locating
earthquakes within the Los Angeles basin and predicting the ground motion from
earthquake scenarios from other source regions. This project is a contribution
to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the
Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
