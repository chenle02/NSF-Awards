Abstract EEC-9616957 Landers This award provides funding for the first year of a
five-year continuing award to support the basic research program of the
Logistics Institute (TLI). The Center was created in the fall of 1994 by the
consolidation of the Material Handling Research Center (a joint I/UCRC between
Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Arkansas), the Logistics
Engineering Center (a research Center at Georgia Tech), and the former TLI (a
continuing education Center at Georgia Tech). TLI is currently a joint effort of
Georgia Tech, the University of Arkansas, and 17 "Leaders in Logistics"
companies. The Center is involved in basic research, applied research,
technology transfer, and continuing education. The Center seeks to conduct
research in following three areas: 1) Logistics networks; Logistics
environments; and Logistics information and decision technology.
