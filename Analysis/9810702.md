Abstract Fulton DMS-9810702

The National Academy of Sciences has accepted a proposal form Nirenberg and
Brezis for a NAS Colloquium on Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and
Applications to take place January 4-8, 1999 at the Beckman Center of the NAS in
Irvine, California. It was decided that this particular meeting should also
serve as a school on recent developments in the field for younger
mathematicians, graduate students and postdocs. The purpose of this award is to
support the younger US attendees.
