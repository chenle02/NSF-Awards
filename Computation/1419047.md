Models of complex systems often involve nonlinear differential equations that
must be approximated numerically to gain detailed information. To understand the
behavior of such approximations, this project explores similarities and
differences in the dynamic behavior of the original model and what is obtained
through numerical simulations. Understanding when the original model and
numerical simulations yield similar dynamic behavior leads to greater confidence
when making inferences from simulation results. In addition, stability analysis
is useful in understanding the robustness of complex biological and physical
phenomena. Of particular emphasis in this project is the application of these
results to the dynamic behavior of models of climate dynamics. The techniques to
be developed include approaches to dimension reduction and uncertainty
quantification based upon Lyapunov exponent theory. The understanding of
biological and physical processes will increase due to the computational
techniques developed to address the dynamic behavior of detailed, microscopic
models.

In many areas of science and engineering dynamical systems are employed as
models of complex phenomena. The focus of this project is on approximation of
solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, the investigator and
colleagues are interested in understanding the dynamics of the finite
dimensional approximations and how they relate to the dynamics of the original
dynamical system. The main research topics to be investigated are related to the
application of time dependent orthogonal change of variables and in the dynamics
of traveling waves under discretization. Specific interests include the use of
Lyapunov vectors (analogues of eigenvectors in time dependent stability
analysis) for dimensional reduction of dissipative nonlinear differential
equations, robust stability for time dependent linear Hamiltonian systems, and
techniques for analyzing time dependent stability of numerical time stepping
techniques, stability of plane wave solutions to bistable reaction-diffusion
equations in periodic media, the impact of time and space discretization on
traveling waves, and non-planar traveling waves in discrete media. Techniques to
investigate these systems combine numerical analysis and dynamical systems ideas
to gain a better understanding of computational dynamics both qualitatively and
quantitatively.
