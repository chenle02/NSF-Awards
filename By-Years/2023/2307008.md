This award will contribute to the advancement of national prosperity and
economic welfare by deriving efficient scheduling methods to improve response
times across a range of critical service industries, notably in cloud computing
and data center management. The significant rise in artificial intelligence
applications, particularly large language models, puts a heavy burden on
existing computing environments and requires efficient scheduling of thousands
of processing resources to meet performance requirements. This project will
develop new queueing methods to extend beyond current single- or small multi-
server models to very large scale multi-server models. The project will provide
tools that enable practitioners to design smarter scheduling policies, thereby
improving the responsiveness and efficiency of modern data centers and resulting
in economic and environmental benefits. The project includes activities to
mentor female graduate students, and broad dissemination of results to different
communities through tutorials and an online textbook.

This project will employ queueing-theoretic analysis to explore the performance
of complex scheduling policies, including Shortest Remaining Processing Time and
the Gittins Index, for multi-server queues. The project will develop new theory
for scheduling in multi-server systems that significantly extends previously
considered job models and allows for far more representative characterization of
today's data centers. These include consideration of multi-server jobs, where a
single job requires several servers simultaneously to run, jobs with dynamically
changing holding costs, and dependencies between jobs. The performance metrics
considered will also be driven by today's cloud systems, with particular
emphasis on meeting tail response time targets, rather than simply meeting
average waiting time targets.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
