In this proposal, the PI seeks to extend previous research on the homotopy
theory of homotopy theories in several ways. A major topic of interest is the
continuation of work in progress on higher-categorical generalizations of these
structures. While a few models have been introduced for doing so, in part
motivated by work in algebraic geometry and topological quantum field theory, it
is important to establish that they are all equivalent to one another analogous
to the PI's previous work. In related work, analogues of these models in the
world of operads are being developed, and again it will be important to see
which known results can be carried over and how comparisons can be made.

In another direction, the PI seeks to use homotopy-theoretic tools to explore
further the relationship between Hall algebras and quantum groups. A longtime
open question in representation theory is to find a derived version of the Hall
algebra from which all of the corresponding quantum group can be recovered. It
is anticipated that newly-developed techniques in homotopy theory will provide
new insights into solving this conjecture.
