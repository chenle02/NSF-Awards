ABSTRACT

Precise Age Calibration of the Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian Time Scale:
Implications for Global Correlation and Rates of Processes in the Late Paleozoic
Era

Clyde Northrup, V. Davydov, Walter Snyder EAR-0106796

The geologic time scale is a fundamental tool in Earth Science research -
correlation of events globally, determination of absolute ages, and the
estimation of rates of process all depend on the accuracy and precision of the
time scale. This project will calibrate the Late Pennsylvanian through early
Permian interval of the time scale through a combination of U-Pb zircon
geochronology, stratigraphy, and multitaxa paleontology. Work will focus on the
marine sedimentary sections in the foreland of the southern Ural mountains in
Russia-Kazakhstan, an area that offers a fantastic opportunity for time scale
calibration because the late Paleozoic rocks have numerous, well-preserved
fossils in addition to many interstratified volcanic ash horizons that are
amenable to radiometric dating.
