This award, cofunded by Systems and Synthetic Biology/MCB, Science,Technology
and Society/SES, and Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering/CBET,
will support a workshop that addresses societal issues associated with the
emerging technology, synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is often defined as
the design (or re-design) of biological parts, devices, and systems, toward a
useful purpose. Societal questions about the governance of synthetic biology, as
well as questions about its ethical dimensions and visions of its desirable
futures are important projects for systematic inquiry. Societal research on
synthetic biology is crucial for its responsible development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at Arizona State University
(ASU) in Tempe, AZ, 4-6 November 2014. The workshop will gather approximately 75
social scientists, humanists, scientists and engineers who are working in the
area of synthetic biology and related emerging technologies. Through drafting
assignments prior to the workshop, an engaging combination of plenaries, break-
out activities, and ambiance at the workshop, and aggressive and varied outreach
afterward, the workshop conveners will articulate, and disseminate community-
generated ideas for research on the societal aspects of synthetic biology. The
issues the workshop plans to explore include: biosafety and biosecurity, ethics,
sustainability, DIY/makers, public opinion and values, research and innovations
systems analysis, integration and reflexivity, anticipation and futures,
informal science education, international and inter-agency collaboration, risk,
and governance. The workshop is designed to raise and attend to other issues
that emerge through discussion.
