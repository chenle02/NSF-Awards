This project is an atmospheric modelling effort whose purpose is the examination
of the concurrent evolution of the circumpolar vortex and the antarctic
katabatic wind regime. Katabatic winds occur regularly in the lowest levels of
the antarctic atmosphere and form an equatorward-directed branch of the mean
circulation in high southern latitudes. They transport energy and momentum
northward, thereby alleviating some of the intense baroclinicity that develops
along the periphery of the antarctic continent because of the horizontal
temperature contrast. Boundary layer flows appear to have a significant effect
in forcing large-scale motions in the middle and upper troposphere over
Antarctica. The fundamental goal of this research is to assess how shallow
drainage features affect the heat and momentum budgets of the Antarctic
atmosphere by integrating mesoscale modelling with statistical analyses of
conventional and automatic weather station surface observations. The study will
complement current studies of the general circulation in high southern
latitudes, and of the antarctic stratospheric vortex.
