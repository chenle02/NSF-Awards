As the most voluminous, deepest and longest continually existing freshwater
lake on the surface of the earth, Baikal presents unparalleled opportunity for
paleo-climate reconstruction at a key continental site in southeastern Siberia.
Here, it is proposed to complete our investigations of the fundamental mixing
and biogeochemical characteristics of the modern lake and its tributaries. This
study will provide groundwork essential for deciphering Baikal sedimentary
paleo-climate records. In addition, baseline data needed to establish the nature
and magnitude of perturbations caused by expanding human activities in the
Baikal watershed will be contributed and the chemical conditioning of the source
waters of the Yenisei, one of the most important rivers emptying into the
Arctic, will be defined. Findings from our June, 1988 expedition include: 1)
Deduction of a unique mechanism, related to thermobaric instabilities, by which
mixing of this deepest of lakes occurs ?Carmack and Weiss, 1991!; 2)
Determination, based on CFC, O2 and nutrient distributions, of an 8 to 10 year
average rate of ventilation for the lake and confirmation that Baikal is highly
oligotrophic with nitrate as the limiting nutrient ?Weiss et al., 1991!; 3)
Cycling of major elements in the lake is dominated by riverine throughout;
hydrothermal activity known by temperature anomalies and subsequently observed
by submersible, does not impact the chemistry of the modern lake; lake waters
are undersaturated with respect to calcite phases, consistent with lack of their
occurrence in lake sediments; lake waters are also undersaturated with respect
to opal, however, high diatom productivity assures a sufficient rain rate to
result in the preservation of siliceous materials in sediments which constitute
a sink for Si; of the minor elements, only Ba showed non-conservative behavior
in the lake ?Falkner et al, 1991!. A second expedition to the lake was
undertaken in July, 1991 during which a method by which to use deep water
temperature and oxygen profiles to adequately constrain the extent of
ventilation was established. Sampling, by trace-metal clean techniques was
extended to rivers and land-based hot-springs surrounding the lake in order to
better constrain elemental budgets and to allow analyses of trace elements which
tend to be more sensitive indicators of impact by human activities. Funds are
being requested from NSF to complete chemical and isotopic analyses of this
sample suite and to extend our observations through intercalibration and
coordination with ongoing efforts by Russian scientist. In addition, a workshop
to collate, discuss and publish the findings of our interdisciplinary group will
be held in order to provide the most complete understanding of mixing and
biogeochemistry of the modern lake possible.
