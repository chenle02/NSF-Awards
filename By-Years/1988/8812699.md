This research involves the construction of a series of computational models of
common-sense reasoning about emotion-related phenomena. Computer programs
capable of making inferences, constructing explanations, and learning about
cognitive causes of emotions will be constructed. These computer models will be
based on a theory of emotion that describes when emotions might arise, why, and
what their likely consequences are. The principal investigator will develop an
AI system that can reason about motivation and generate plausible explanations
about emotion- relevant phenomena. The system will be validated by comparing the
explanations it produces with explanations created by people and by having
people evaluate the plausibility and coherence of the automatically constructed
explanations.
