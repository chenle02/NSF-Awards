ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0133978&lt;br/&gt;S. Llewellyn Smith, University of
California, San Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to study three
problems related to the generic phenomenon of a body falling in a fluid, a
problem first considered by Maxwell in 1853. More specifically the first one is
to develop a mathematical model for the vorticity being shed from a falling
plate. Two-dimensional flow will be considered in this analytical study. The
second one involves the extension of the first problem to a falling flexible
plate. In this case, the shape of the flexible body is given as a function of
time and it is incorporated in the solution of the problem. The third problem
considers the falling body through a stratified fluid, experimental
investigation will be made as well as analysis with linear modeling. Numerical
simulations of the problem will be made in collaboration with a colleague at San
Diego State University. Broader impacts of this research, when extended to three
dimensions will include aerospace applications and propagation of seedpods. The
education plan is quite novel, the PI plans to use sports to teach science and
engineering to undergraduates and high school students. The high school students
will be those enrolled in the Preuss School at UCSD, which is chartered under
the San Diego Unified School District offering intensive college preparatory
education program for low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;
