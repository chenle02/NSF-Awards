This project is for continued research on a general purpose, optimization-based
computer- aided-design methodology which will supplement and eventually displace
many currently used heuristic techniques which form part of the engineering
design cycle. Such a methodology is possible because (i) a large variety of
engineering design problems can be transcribed into the form of a very small
number of standard, semi-infinite optimization problems, and (ii) new system
theoretic results facilitate the use of optimization in engineering design. The
research is in three interrelated parts. The first part deals with topics in
optimization algorithms for engineering design and optimal control: (i) optimal
discretization procedures, (ii) superlinearly converging algorithms, (iii)
global techniques for finding designs satisfying specifications, and (iv)
optimal control algorithms for distributed parameter systems. The second part
deals with topics in optimization- oriented system theory: (i) nonlinear system
stabilization via moving horizon optimal control, and (ii) integrated design of
flexible structures and their control systems. The third part deals with the
development of an interactive software system which provides an appropriate
environment for optimization- based computer-aided design.
