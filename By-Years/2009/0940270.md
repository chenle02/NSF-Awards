The goal of this project is to obtain empirical estimates of night-time atomic
hydrogen (H) density and vertical flux as a function of altitude from the lower
thermosphere into the exosphere based on a coupled analysis of measured H
airglow intensity and a sophisticated forward model of radiative transport for
spectral line profile analysis. Knowledge of these parameters is important for
understanding the chemical and dynamical coupling between atmospheric regions.
This effort will utilize existing measurements of multi-line H emission at
unprecedented precision, acquired from a suite of mature, ground-based,
spectroscopic instruments, as well as new data from a novel spectroscopic
instrument, which will be tested and deployed as part of this project.
Additional goals of this work are to characterize the dependence of the H
distribution on geomagnetic and solar variability and to search for signatures
of dynamical populations of exospheric H atoms. H density profiles are useful
for improving empirical atmospheric models and aiding data interpretation and
analysis from other observational research techniques, such as neutral atom
imaging.
