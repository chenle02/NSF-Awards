Abstract

Award: DMS-0104026 Principal Investigator: Michael W. Davis

This is a proposal for research in geometric group theory focusing on Coxeter
groups, Artin groups, and mapping class groups of surfaces. The main problems to
be addressed are the following. (1) For which Coxeter groups is the Coxeter
diagram uniquely determined by the group? For which Coxeter groups is the
fundamental generating set uniquely determined (up to conjugation) by the group?
For which Coxeter groups is the outer automorphism group finite? (2) Are all
Artin groups linear groups? (3) Find a formula for the cohomology with compact
supports of a building. Likewise for the Salvetti complex of an Artin group. (4)
Determine the l^2 Betti numbers of cubical manifolds associated to right-angled
Coxeter groups. Do they vanish outside the middle dimension? This would imply
the Flag Complex Conjecture concerning triangulations of odd-dimensional spheres
and has implications for graph embeddings. (5) Develop a theory of mock
reflection groups. This is a class of groups similar to Coxeter groups which
arise as transformations of blow-ups of hyperplane arrangements. (6) Is the
Torelli subgroup of the mapping class groups of a surface of genus at least
three finitely generated? (7) Can a word hyperbolic group be the fundamental
group of a surface by surface bundle? Must all finitely presented non word
hyperbolic groups contain a Baumslag-Solitar group or an abelian group of rank
two?

Group theory arises from the study of symmetries of an object. When this object
has an interesting geometric structure, one can use geometric techniques to
better understand the group of symmetries. This project involves the study of
certain families of groups which arise in a broad range of mathematical and
physical contexts, such as the study of crystal structures and the intertwining
of DNA. These groups are associated to rich and beautiful geometric structures
which lend themselves to the techniques of geometric group theory.
