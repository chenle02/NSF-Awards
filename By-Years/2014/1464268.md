Sequencing of genomes for numerous species including humans has become
increasingly affordable due to next generation high-throughput genome sequencing
(NGS) technologies. This opens up perspectives for diagnosis and treatment of
genetic diseases and is increasingly effective in conducting system biology
studies. However, there remain many computational challenges that need to be
addressed before these technologies find their way into every day health and
human care. One such daunting challenge is the volume of sequencing data which
can reach peta-byte level for comprehensive system-biology studies.
&lt;br/&gt;Genomic data compression is needed to reduce the storage size, to
increase the speed and reduce the cost of I/O bandwidth required for
transmission of such data. However, existing genomic compression solutions yield
poor performance for Big Genomic Data. Further, the existing state of the art
tools require the user to decompress the data before it can be used for further
analysis. This project is focused on compression of genomic information and
developing a framework which will allow analysis of compressed form of the data.
The project develops HPC solutions for fast compression of Big NGS Data sets
using ubiquitous architectures such as GPUs and multicore processors. HPC
techniques are utilized to compute essential functions such as alignment and
mapping using the compressed form of the NGS data. More efficient encoding of
the NGS data for better network utilization is also being investigated.
