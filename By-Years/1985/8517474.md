The objective of this research is to develop a generalized fabrication technique
for manufacture of three-dimensional contoured surfaces based on a process which
uses thin polymeric films to precisely control local rates of electoplating and
electrodissolution. The process provides a generalized method of transcribing
any two-dimensional optical density map into a three-dimensional surface
contour. The research will include experimental and theoretical investigations
aimed at development of improved films used in this process, computer generation
of the optical masks used to contour the films which in turn form a contoured
final surface by means of electroplating or electrodissolution through the film,
and extension on the method to include electroless plating and
electrodissolution (of silicon) going beyond earlier electroplating work.
