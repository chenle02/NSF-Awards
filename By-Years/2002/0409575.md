This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled " Exploring the Functional Genomic
Differences and Dynamics of aquatic Vibrio cholerae populations." Survival of
epidemic Vibrio cholerae in the aquatic environment is being attributed to
"VSP-1" and "VSP-2" gene islands that are thought to confer adaptive properties,
enabling cells to withstand environmental stresses. It is unknown, however, if
non-epidemic variants, which are found more often in the aquatic environment,
share such genes. This research compares functional genomic analyses and
ecological interactions of V. cholerae non-epidemic and epidemic strains as to
illuminate how subtle genetic differences contribute to population composition
and community-level processes within its aquatic environment. Microarrays are
used to detect differences between genomes and to compare gene expression
responses to factors that influence population dynamics, i.e., salinity stress
and substrate availability.

Fashioning microarray techniques in such a way as to use them in an applied
experimental manner are important tools in future exploration of ecological and
evolutionary theory. The collaborative nature of this project is the beginning
of the Fellow's professional involvement in multidisciplinary efforts. It will
foster the organizational skills and ability to bridge disciplines needed for
future endeavors.
