The "Crafting & Evaluating Interactive Educational Websites" conference will be
developed through a collaboration between the Cornell University Laboratory of
Ornithology and the Exploratorium. The PIs will develop and host a three-day
invitational conference focusing on the practice of interactive web site design,
development, evaluation and maintenance intended to achieve or support informal
STEM learning. The conference, which will be held in Spring, 2005, will involve
50 individuals with a wide range of expertise who will focus on a variety of
issues including audience expectations and abilities, designing for learner
outcomes, testing for usability, evaluation tools and accessibility.

With regard to intellectual merit, conference attendees will explore challenges
and barriers that hinder development of truly interactive web sites and identify
best practices and promising models, tools and technologies for encouraging
authentic public interaction. Conversations begun at the conference will be
extended to a broader audience through development of an online manual, informed
by the conference presentations and commentaries, and designed for use by the
museum, media and research communities. An interactive Web site developed after
the conference will allow Web developers to locate content and ideas for design,
and to share new ideas and results of usability studies and evaluations.
