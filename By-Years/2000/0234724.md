F. Rob Jackson, Ph.D. (Proposal 0234724) "Circadian control of locomotor
activity"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In all animal species, including humans, many
different biological processes (e.g., sleep or general activity) show 24-h
rhythms and are controlled by an endogenous circadian clock, located in the
brain. In the present proposal the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is being
used as a genetic model to study the factors that act downstream of the clock
cells (in the brain) to effect the expression of rhythmic processes. One of
those factors is called Ebony and is the subject of this application. The ebony
gene is expressed according to a circadian rhythm and ebony mutants show altered
activity rhythms. The purpose of the present work is to determine where (in
which cells) the ebony gene acts in the nervous system and to study how those
cells control activity rhythms. The advantage of this research approach in
Drosophila is the use of genetic techniques to examine the cell biology and
biochemistry underlying complex behavioral processes. As many of the factors
comprising circadian clock systems are conserved between Drosophila and
mammalian species (e.g., humans), the proposed work may help elucidate the clock
control of rhythmic processes in other species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
