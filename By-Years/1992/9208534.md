In many problems of shared resources, often termed "public goods," or problems
where the decision outcome of one person depends highly on the behavior of
others, important research questions arise about the nature of trust and
cooperative or defective behavior. In such situations, cooperation works to the
advantage of the group but individuals are privately better off not cooperating.
Experimental evidence from games that reflect the conditions of highly
interdependent outcomes and optional participation, shows that (1) people who
intend cooperation are more willing than defectors to enter into such situations
(i.e. to "trust"); (2) cooperators are relatively more successful regarding
rewards from the experimental games than the defectors, hence the term,
"cooperators' advantage;" and (3) neither intending cooperators nor intending
defectors have special capacity to recognize the intentions of strangers,
meaning that the cooperators' advantage comes exclusively from the
disproportionate probability of participation with other cooperators. This
suggests that players decide to participate by a heuristic where they project
their own intentions to others. This research will further test the robustness
of these results by investigating the effects of experience on the heuristic
that gives rise to the cooperators' advantage. Competing hypotheses predict: (1)
that repeated "sampling" of partners from the population pool will lead
expectations to converge such that the cooperators' advantage is eliminated; or
(2) that available samples of others' behavior are biased and provide both
intending cooperators and intending defectors with confirming evidence of their
original expectations and thus, stimulate little adjustment from experience.
These hypotheses will be tested by providing subjects with various types of
feedback about the choices of others. The findings will bear on the possibility
of cooperation evolving independently of tit-for-tat or other incentive-based
mechanisms discussed in the literature.
