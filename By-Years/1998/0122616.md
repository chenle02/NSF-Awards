ABSTRACT: Semicrystalline polymers are of particular interest to the polymer
community today because of their high performance and low cost characteristics.
It has been shown that control of crystalline morphology can result in greatly
improved properties. The emergence of new and more powerful characterization
techniques has led to new knowledge of structure evolution as well as
deformation processes in semi-crystalline polymers. This allows theoreticians to
perform nanometer scale modeling of deformation and structural evolution of
semicrystalline polymers. The main objective of this symposium is to highlight
the latest research and help shape the direction of future research in this
field.
