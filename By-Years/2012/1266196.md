The Ohio State University Site of the I/UCRC for Experimental Research in
Computer Systems (CERCS) seeks to further build its momentum from its initial
phase of operation through a Phase II award. Areas of research thrust for the
next phase of the Ohio State CERCS site include development of needed
intelligent discovery, visualization, and analysis interfaces for knowledge
management, while addressing systems issues like scalability and performance;
and development of delivery interfaces that are personalized and persuasive. The
site intends to use a virtual ?Living Laboratory? as sandbox environment
provisioned by the site?s I/UCRC members that will allow experimentation with
existing, heterogeneous ?big data? assets in repositories and enterprise
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge management in the era of big data
represents an important area for national competitiveness and one in which
industry-university partnerships have the potential to address real-world
problems. Working with its Industrial Advisory Board partners, the Ohio State
University site of CERCS intends to bring together consumers and technology
providers to research new capabilities for knowledge management and
collaboration. The Living Lab environment to be used by the site is intended for
use by graduate students and undergraduates in order to gain first-hand
experience with big-data issues and solutions.&lt;br/&gt;
