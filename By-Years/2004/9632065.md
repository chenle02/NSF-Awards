Frohnsdorff 9632065 For the U.S. to be a leader in construction technology in
the 21st Century, it is important that it should take action to stimulate
construction materials research, development and new technology deployment now.
A National Coordinating Council (NCC) has been formed for the National High
Performance Construction Materials and Systems (CONMAT) Program. The program
plan includes aluminum, asphalt, coatings, composites, concrete masonry, roofing
materials, steel wood and smart materials. CONMAT is stimulating research and
development within the materials groups and helping provide a mechanism for
supporting a coherent national program involving industry, government, and
academia.
