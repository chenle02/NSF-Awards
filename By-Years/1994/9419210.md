9419210 Bowring This grant provides partial support for the costs of acquiring
an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) to augment to replace a
first generation ICP-MS that is both outdated in terms of its detection limits
for elements with high mass numbers (+80) and has an unreliable service record.
The new instrument will be housed in the center for geochemical analyses at MIT
where abundant technical support is available. This instrument will allow the
PI's to conduct high-resolution, state-of-the-art measurements of Uranium series
isotopic ratios in corals for studies in paleooceanography and allow rapid and
precise determination of rare earth element (REE) concentrations in the
dissolved and suspended loads of riverine waters as a proxy for weathering
intensity. ***
