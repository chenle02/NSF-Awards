9405552 Weldon This research is to determine the size, extent, and timing of
historic and recent surface ruptures associated with the Xianshuihe Fault in
Sichuan Province, China. Preliminary work by U.S. and Chinese scientists
reported at a conference in Chengdu, September 1990, and in the subsequent
literature, indicate that it would be possible to document the ages,
distribution, and magnitude of slip associated with recent ruptures to test the
hypotheses of fault behavior. Excellent geomorphic evidence for multiple
ruptures is preserved in many areas, and trenches described by Chinese
scientists, and one briefly visited during September 1990, contain good
microstratigraphic evidence for the timing and size of events. This study will
add to the extremely limited data set for large strike-slip ruptures so that we
can better understand how "characteristic" ruptures on large faults really are.
Such empirical observations of fault behavior are critical for prediction
efforts and for understanding the underlying physics of rupture processes. This
research is a component of the U.S.-P.R.C Protocol on Earthquake Studies and the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
