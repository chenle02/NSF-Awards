This Phase II project is awarding forty-one scholarships to twenty- three
students fulfilling the requirements to become secondary mathematics and science
teachers. Undergraduate scholarship recipients are selected from eligible
mathematics majors and those interested in seeking a double major of biology,
chemistry or physics and science education. A third year of scholarship support
is available to the double majors. Individuals with a prior STEM degree may
receive a one-year scholarship. The Noyce Scholars are enrolled in a teacher
preparation program utilizing innovative problem-based learning pedagogies and
clinical field experiences in high needs settings.

Vigo County School Corporation, the fifth largest public school district in
Indiana, has partnered with Indiana State University in the Professional
Development Schools program for the past fourteen years. This school system with
a mix of urban, suburban and rural areas provides a range of field experiences
for the Noyce scholars. The close relationship between the university and the
Vigo schools is exemplified by more than half the Vigo County school teachers
holding a degree from Indiana State University.
