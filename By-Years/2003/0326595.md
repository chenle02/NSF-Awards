The proposed research by Dr. Anna Berge of the University of Alaska Fairbanks is
to undertake initial descriptive linguistic research on the contemporary Aleut
language. Aleut is the severely endangered language spoken on the Aleutian
Islands, Alaska and Russia. Previous recorded descriptions of the Aleut language
have been of classical Aleut, before substantial changes occurred through
contact with non-Natives. Such texts are too difficult to be useful to
contemporary speakers or for the planned language revitalization projects
occurring in Aleut communities. The proposed project is the beginning of a long-
term language documentation, revitalization, and education program envisioned by
the researcher and the communities with which she works.
