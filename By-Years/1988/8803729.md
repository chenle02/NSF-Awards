This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, will study
the spectroscopy and photodissociation dynamics of dissociative electronic
states of polyatomic free radicals. This study will elucidate the reactivity and
photochemistry of the prototypical species studied. Initial studies will focus
on small well characterized radicals such as triatomic species containing
carbon, nitrogen and/or oxygen. The knowledge gained in these studies will be
utilized in the study of more complex species, including organometallic radicals
containing one or more coordinatively unsaturated transition metal atom. A fast
mass-selected beam of internally cold radicals is generated by negative ion
photodetachment, and the fragments produced by photodissociating the radicals
are detected. The energy dependence of the photodissocation cross section will
be determined for each radical, followed by photodissociation dynamics studies
at selected excitation energies in which photofragment energy and angular
distribution are measured.
