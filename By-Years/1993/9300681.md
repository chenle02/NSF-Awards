The R/V BLUE FIN is used primarily to support research programs in biological,
physical and chemical oceanography on the S.E. Continental Shelf between Capes
Hatteras and Canaveral. Biological studies include assessment of benthic
communities, micro-/phyto-/and zooplankton communities and their interrelations
on near and offshore nutrients and recycling of nutrients in sediments. Physical
and geochemical studies are closely related to these biological concerns.
Measurements of along and cross-shelf circulation are used to assess the
relative forcing of circulation by the Gulf Stream, winds, pressure gradients
and tides. Current meters, pressure sensors and hydrographic observations are
used to provide the necessary data. The R/V BLUE Fin serves as a platform for
obtaining this data.
