In order to gain a detailed description of the dynamics of nuclear fusion
reactions, a cubic array of thallium-doped cesium iodide CsI (T1) detectors will
be developed. This detector array will cover 95% of the space surrounding the
reaction and will be able to detect the number, energy, and type of charged-
particles emitted by the reaction products. The array will be placed in front of
a recoil mass spectrometer such as the Fragment Mass Analyzer at Argonne
National Laboratory or the Recoil Mass Spectrometer at the University of
Rochester's Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory. With such a combined
detection system, the total number and type of all particles emitted by the
short- lived compound nucleus can be inferred for each nuclear reaction. The
data accumulated by this detection system will be used to investigate the
applicability of statistical decay models in heavy-ion induced fusion reactions.
In particular, the research will attempt to determine what differences exist in
the decay of excited Dy when it is formed by three different nuclear fusion
reactions. ***
