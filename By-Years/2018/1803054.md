Proteins regulate human health. They mediate susceptibility to illness, and they
help repel invading viruses and microbes. This project seeks to establish a
strategy that can measure changes to protein synthesis and activity that vary
with location in the cell or tissue over time. The method depends on the fact
that some proteins emit light under certain conditions. If successful, the
method will provide new diagnostic tools and possibly new treatments. The
project also supports the development of course materials for high school
students. These materials include an in-class demonstration and a hands-on
experiment. This experience should introduce and attract under-represented
groups to biochemical engineering and could increase student interest in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategies to measure protein identity and abundance
directly are limited. Simultaneous real-time location and measurement of a few
proteins within cells or tissue samples is possible with fluorescence
microscopy. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis permits global
measurement of thousands of proteins, but only from uniform samples. The
proposed strategy exploits non-canonical amino acids, in conjunction with
bioorthogonal photochemistry, to tag and isolate proteins synthesized at
specified periods of time and culture locations prior to proteomic analysis. The
analytic methodologies are capable of providing quantitative information for
protein expression within any type of cell or tissue. The strategies developed
use widely available instrumentation and open-source proteomic software
packages, so they could be readily adopted by laboratories
worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
