the use of heterogeneous network computing and tangible tools which will aid
both researchers and educators. The proposed research also includes many novel
approaches which will be explored. The HeNCE programming model includes an
interesting method of dealing with distributed memory. The methods we will
develop for parameter partitioning are neither shared nor local memory. In
implementing HeNCE we will gain practical experience with distributed scheduling
algorithms.
