This project will better determine the conditions under which near- Earth solar
wind monitors can be relied upon to measure the parameters arriving at the
dayside magnetopause. Using upstream spacecraft such as IMP-8, ISEE 1/2, and
IRM, the project will attempt to (1) determine scale sizes of solar wind
features, (2) compare observed and predicted time lags for tangential and
rotationl discontinuities, (3) determine how well IMF Bz can be predicted from
upstream monitors, (4) test if high time resolution magnetic field measurements
can proxy for dynamic pressure, (5) determine how the foreshock preconditions
the solar wind, and (6) determine how the waves generated by discontinuities
interacting with the bow shock propagate to the magnetopause.
