The primary aim of this project is to generate pilot data on the presence or
absence of phytoliths on the dentition of Peruvian skeletal remains. Phytoliths
are plant substances which may be found on the surface of teeth. Phytoliths can
be identified microscopically and are thought to be species specific. Thus,
phytoliths found on the surface of ancient remains may provide information on
the dietary habits of ancient populations. The investigators hope to identify
maize phytoliths on the surface of the Peruvian remains which would thereby
allow future research to track the changes in diet in some New World
populations.
