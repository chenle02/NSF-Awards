This research project examines computational complexity in a variety of
settings. In particular, this research focuses on obtaining lower bounds on the
complexity of solving specific problems in these domains. The main goal is to
extend the body of techniques in circuit complexity, communication complexity,
and resource tradeoff lower bounds that have been developed over the last decade
and find new applications of these techniques for proving lower bounds. Some
specific areas of interest are the study of graph connectivity, the use of
multi-party communication complexity in lower bounds, the power of branching
programs, and the extension of circuit complexity techniques into the domain of
the complexity of proofs in propositional logic --- a subject that is
fundamental to our understanding of the relationship between NP and co-NP.
