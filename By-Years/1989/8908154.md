The methods of molecular genetics are to be used in studying how the information
in the genome is utilized to determine specific cell types that make up the
neural network of Drosophila. Molecular tools, including monoclonal antibodies,
cDNA clones, and the polymerase chain reaction, combined with mutations
affecting behavior and development, will be applied to the problems of the
determination and differentiation of neurons, the formation of neural
interconnections, and maintenance of the nervous system. This work should, as in
the past, contribute both insight into the genetic control of the development of
the nervous system in Drosophila and a steady flow of well.trained young
scientists devoted to this area of research.
