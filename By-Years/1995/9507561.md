9507561 Thompson The largely unanticipated end of the Cold War, and the
consequent difficulties in explaining its demise, underline the need to better
understand the phenomenon of rivalries in world politics. But there is much more
at stake than the history of the Soviet- American relationship for a respectable
proportion of international conflict is embedded within the contexts of specific
dyadic feuds with pasts and futures. To ignore these contexts may seriously
distort the entire analytical undertaking of international relations. This
investigation identifies rivalries in terms of decision- maker perceptions of a
hierarchy of competitive, principal opponents as opposed to the number of
disputes in which states engage. Basic rivalry data, including information on
participants, length, perceptions of the security threat posed by the competitor
and the issues at stake, are gathered on all major powers from 1494 to 1993 and
all minor powers from 1816 to 1993. Other types of information that might be
desirable in the study of rivalries already exists in other data sets and are
not being duplicated. The project creates a rivalry set that can be integrated
into other existing research programs. ***
