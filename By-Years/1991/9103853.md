The netlib system was designed to send, by return electronic mail, requested
mathematical software together with subsidiary routines and any related
documents or test programs supplied by the authors. Since its inception, netlib
has had a significant positive impact on the infrastructure of the computational
science community. This is evidenced by the fact that nearly 150,000 requests
for netlib services were received in 1989 and that more than 200,000 were
projected for 1990. In this proposal support is requested for routine netlib
operation and expansion of its capabilities and the maintenance of NA-NET. The
scope of netlib will be expanded to include new software, including tools for
symbolic computation. Software will also be added which will allow a user to
access netlib interactively.. The use of a production rule expert system the
netlib server for those users with less expertise will be investigated.//
