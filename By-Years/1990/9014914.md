It is proposed to investigate the unsteady stratified motion of dense gas-solid
suspensions in pipes. This is an energy efficient flow regime which occurs at
relatively low velocities, but larger than the sediment velocity. A combination
of experimental and theoretical studies will be undertaken. Measurements on mean
and fluctuating parameters, including statistical correlations, will be
performed in two test loop systems of 51 mm and 127 mm. The instrumentation
development includes the corona charger probe for the velocity measurement. The
basic equations for wave motion in stratified flow will be formulated. Finally,
an approach to scale-up results obtained for horizontal conveying of dense gas-
solid suspensions will be proposed. The results may be used for the design and
scale up of gas- solid suspension transportation systems at relatively lower
operation velocities, with positive effects on energy consumption, particle
attrition and erosion of equipment.
