9316079 Jenkins This project will examine both macroscopic and microscopic
aspects of the substitution of Al into calcic amphiboles in response to
variations in the pressure, temperature, and compositional conditions of
formation. Variations in the Al content of tremolitic amphibole should provide a
wider data base for testing and refining the thermodynamic mixing properties of
amphiboles in the system H2O-CaO-MgO-Al2O3- SiO2. Research on Fe-Tschermak's
substitution will seek to quantify the strong correlation observed between Fe2+
and Al and natural calcic amphiboles. The pressure dependency of the actinolite-
hornblende miscibility gap will be investigated by examining the volume-
composition relationships along the join tremolite-pargasite, which serves as an
approximation to the actinolite-hornblende "join". Considerable attention will
be devoted to the detailed examination of Al distribution in synthetic
amphiboles by using MAS-NMR, IR and XRD Rietveld techniques. This information
will facilitate the extraction of thermochemical mixing properties of Al from
available data on calcic amphiboles.
