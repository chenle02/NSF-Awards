This award to Clarion University of Pennsylvania is for the acquisition of a
Zeiss EVO LS10 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The multiple functions of
this SEM, such as high resolution, elemental analysis capability, and
environmental mode, satisfies the needs of researchers across the disciplines of
physics, biology, and anthropology, enabling them to conduct collaborative,
creative, and innovative projects that significantly advance the knowledge of
their respective fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the SEM is
expected to transform how teachers and students are trained and educated in the
sciences in rural western Pennsylvania. Additionally, Clarion is partnered with
the Barnes Center for Biotechnology Business Development, a product of the
Keystone Innovation Zone (KIZ) program funded by the State of Pennsylvania. The
high-tech companies in the Barnes Center will have access to the SEM,
encouraging further entrepreneurship and providing new research partnerships and
training opportunities for faculty and students.
