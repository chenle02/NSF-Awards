This project will study ritual kinship among Indians in Oaxaca, Mexico. The
research will census ritual kinship relations in a community of Indians, record
patterns of behavior by women in ritual kinship and other social activities, and
collect archival and oral documentation about ritual kinship. The hypotheses to
be tested are that female patterns of ritual kinship are across the same social
statuses, while male patterns tend to cross social statuses to link higher and
lower status men. This research is important because informal and formal
networks of social relations exist in all societies. These networks are commonly
structured by gender and social status, and understanding how these variables
interact will help us understand how and why individuals gain or lose their
place in social networks, with the attendant fortunate or unfortunate
consequences.
