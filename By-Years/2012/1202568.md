The LSAMP Alaska Alliance is the BS STEM undergraduate portion of a
comprehensive longitudinal model that starts with middle school students,
extends through high school, into the undergraduate years, on to graduate school
and into the professions. The project objective is to effect a systemic change
in the hiring patterns in the fields of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) by increasing the number of individuals on a career path to
leadership in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP senior level funding will
allow for:&lt;br/&gt;1. additional improvements to the undergraduate education
experience by building upon the work we are doing at the critical junctures of
the transition between high school and college and the transition from
undergraduate to graduate school &lt;br/&gt;2. expansion of capacity for
undergraduate research; &lt;br/&gt;3. building capacity to conduct international
research projects; and &lt;br/&gt;4. strengthening LSAMP presence on the
Alliance Community campuses.
