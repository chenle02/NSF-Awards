Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and
training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including
applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring
scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to George A. Boxer is
"Torsion in the Coherent Cohomology of Shimura Varieties and Galois
Representations." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of
Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Matthew Emerton.
