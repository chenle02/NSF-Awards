This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports continued fundamental studies of coordination chemistry by Dr. Henry
Taube of the Chemistry Department, Stanford University. Emphasis will be placed
on investigations of the reactivity of metal complexes, including substitution
lability as a function of electronic structure, inner and outer sphere electron
transfer, mixed valence behavior, linkage isomerism accompanying electron
transfer, and acidity of coordinated ligands. Binuclear osmium complexes
containing metals in different oxidation states will be probed, as well as
unusual osmium species containing either a combination of aromatic and
dihydrogen ligands, or facially-bound macrocyclic ligands. Understanding of the
influence of structure and electron movement in metal-containing species is an
essential underpinning for development of molecular-level electronics, molecular
switches and synthetic enzymes. This research will provide new and important
information on how to design molecules to control the transfer of electrons and
of small atoms or groups of atoms.
