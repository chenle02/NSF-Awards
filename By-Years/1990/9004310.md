The two major aspects of germ cell development examined in this proposal are:
a) oogenesis per se (the transformation of oogonia into oocytes) and early
oocyte development and b) the initiation of vitellogenesis. Both the pipefish,
Syngnathus scovelli, and the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, will be used because
of the unique arrangement of developing follicles in their ovaries, where a
sequential pattern of oocyte development is observed. This pattern begins on one
side of the ovary and a gradient of follicles of increasing developmental age
extends to the opposite side. Little is known about the regulation of early
events of oocyte formation in embryonic ovaries of most vertebrates and the
absence of very early stage oocytes in adult ovaries in many species. The
presence of germinal tissue (oogonia and meiotic oocytes) in a restricted but
easily accessible region of syngnathan ovaries makes these teleost ideal for
studying early germ cell events and their hormonal regulation in an adult
vertebrate. The extent of oogonial proliferation and the time for progression of
oocytes through meiosis will be determined in vivo. Dr. Selman will then attempt
to duplicate both processes in vitro by examining the influence of various
hormones and co- cultured tissues on oogonial division and the progression of
oocytes from leptotene up to diplotene stages. The process of follicle formation
will also be examined. Dr. Selman intends to characterize the transition from
previtellogenesis to vitellogenesis in syngnathans and will address the cellular
mechanism(s) responsible for the initiation of vitellogenesis. For this she will
examine follicular vascularization, vitellogenin accessibility, the ontogeny of
functional vitellogenin rectors and the intraoocytic fate of internalized
vitellogenin. Studies will be performed both in vivo and in vitro to determine
whether a cessation of normal lysosomal synthesis and/or activity or a
modification of the endocytic pathway distinguishes previtellogenic form
vitellogenic oocytes.
