This project will use sophisticated theoretical methods to determine the
fundamental properties of neutron stars and black holes. Dr. Ozel and her
graduate students will model the mass distribution of black holes and neutron
stars, simulate accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, perform
relativistic calculations of the spacetime near neutron stars, and investigate
the properties of nuclear matter in neutron stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results
from this project are expected to have an impact in the areas of stellar
evolution, nuclear physics, and gravitational wave physics. In addition to her
theoretical work, Dr. Ozel will continue her interactions with physics teachers
in the Tucson area, and will engage popular outreach on the subject neutron
stars and black holes.
