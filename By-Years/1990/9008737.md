Extension tables are a memo structure for logic programs that save the extension
of a predicate in a table. Subsequent calls, whose answers are in the table, use
a table lookup rather than recomputing the results. Since the terms that are
saved are not necessarily ground facts, the induced subsumption ordering on
Prolog terms is used to avoid saving redundant information in the table. This
duplicate elimination mechanism will be extended by allowing for the
specification of orderings other than those given by the subsumption of Prolog
terms. This enhanced capability modifies the behavior of the execution method to
provide an approximate evaluation of the logic program based on these orderings.
