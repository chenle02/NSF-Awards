Influencing consumer behavior through information is one of the goals of
persuasive technology. This project is to design the presentation and timing of
choices on restaurant-ordering interfaces to influence diner behavior. Using
proprietary algorithms, the team will make personalized meal recommendations
based both on a diner's profile and on their past ordering behavior. The
algorithms evolved from previous NSF funded research on providing diners with
in-the-moment nutritional advice. It is believed that sophisticated diner-
computer interfaces, backed by intelligent recommendation engines, will improve
a restaurant operator's bottom line and deliver a superior ordering experience
for diners. For example, in a recent study the team deployed a self-service
ordering terminal at a Quick Service Restaurant that recommended food
combinations based on a diner's health goal. Goals might be to lose weight,
build muscle or manage diabetes. The result was increased sales for the
restaurant by increasing the individual ticket amount for diners using the
system. The current project aims to improve the quality of the health-based
recommendations made by the system by personalizing them further on the basis of
a diner?s past ordering history. Existing Point-of-Sale systems focus on
reducing operating costs associated with running a restaurant. The team has an
opportunity to supply the restaurant industry with front-end technologies that
instead focus on increasing restaurant sales by making contextually relevant
meal recommendations to diners.

This project has the potential to influence all the orders placed in a
restaurant or cafeteria setting including those placed through web and mobile
interfaces. According to the National Restaurant Association there were 960,000
restaurant locations in the USA in 2010. CNN reported that, on average,
Americans visited a restaurant 193 times in that year. A survey by the National
Restaurant Association found that nutrition is a top consumer trend. Study
results indicate that providing diners with healthy food suggestions through
such ordering interfaces can have a huge impact on the current obesity and diet-
related chronic disease epidemic. Consumer demand is not the only driver of this
trend; new federal guidelines that will go into effect in December of 2011
mandate that all chain restaurants with more than 20 locations provide complete
nutritional information on all of their standard menu items. Ordering at a
restaurant generates significant data about consumer dining behavior that is
either not captured or is captured but never utilized. The proposed self-service
ordering terminals (SmartMenus) capture anonymized diner data, which is easily
available for commercial and academic research.
