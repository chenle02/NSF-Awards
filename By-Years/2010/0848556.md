This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this award, funded by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof.
Tianquan Lian of Emory University and research group will employ transient
absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies to explore ultrafast electron
transfer from quantum dots. The goal of these experiments is to develop a better
understanding of the multiple exciton (electron-hole pair) dissociation as well
as the multiple exciton generation processes that are proposed to occur in
certain nanoscale semiconductor structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
is relevant to many potential applications for nanoparticles, including solar
energy conversion, photocatalysis, nanoscale sensors, and molecular electronics.
In addition to the broader scientific impact of the proposed research, Prof.
Lian will work with undergraduates from the southeast region to become involved
in science. His efforts will include providing summer research positions,
seminar visits, collaborative research projects, and regional
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
