The project updates a curriculum designed almost totally around organismal and
field biology to include laboratory experiences in molecular biology. The
lecture component of the course emphasizes the principles of molecular biology.
The accompanying laboratory provides students intensive "hands-on" experience in
the fundamental techniques of experimental molecular biology.
