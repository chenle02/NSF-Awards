ABSTRACT McAlister, Harold AST-9421259 Support is being provided to carry out a
program of high spatial resolution studies of selected groups of binary stars
using the adaptive optics system of the 1.%m telescope at the U.S. Air Force
Starfire Optical Range located on Kirtland Air Force Base near Albuquerque, New
Mexico. The unique capabilities of the Starfire adaptive optics system provide
the opportunity for directly imaging binaries with angular separations as small
as 0.1 arcsecond. This will permit the accurate measurement of differential
magnitudes and colors for hundreds of binary stars in a regime of angular
separation never before available to such studies. * * *
