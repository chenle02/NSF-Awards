NetFS is a file system interface to the network configuration parameters of an
operating system. All network configuration is performed by file operations,
thus inheriting file system protection, including limited user and group access,
as well as support for hierarchies, which more readily support virtual networks.
This results in fine-grained resource protection for individual network
settings, providing in a safe environment in which applications can have
controlled access to limited subsets of network configuration and control, such
as routing tables, interface configurations, IP security associations, and
firewall rules. NetFS also provides an interface that unifies access to these
networking parameters of the operating system under a portable file system
paradigm. This unified controlled interface also more readily supports advanced
virtual networking, where individual applications are attached to different
subsets of network infrastructure to support concurrent participation in
multiple coalitions.
