9416101 Albanese This encoding technique was motivated by a trial offering a low
cost "Best Effort" ATM/Cell Relay Service. The service is being used to explore
applications for ATM services with unpredictable (no-guarantees) Quality Of
Service (QOS). An initial contribution was submitted to the Enterprise Network
Roundtable (ENR) user group of the ATM Forum describing the feasibility of a
video multicast application over Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) services. Our
contribution proposes to implement a new, optional and selective multilevel
Forward Error Correction (FEC) method in the application layer based on
information priority levels versus having a fixed FEC implementation in the
lower layers. Preliminary research has consisted in software simulation and
initial implementations of PET systems using deterministic algorithms like
polynomial and linear independent equations over finite fields. These algorithms
are quadratic in complexity and the message-size/packet-size ratio limits its
application to recovering IP packet losses only. Proposed work includes: 1)
exploring firmware implementations and the use of probabilistic algorithms to
achieve faster software implementations required to recover IP packets and ATM
cell losses in real-time MPEG-2 and JPEG video streams, where delay is a key
issue for interactive applications; 2) exploring mechanisms based on user
priorities for network routers to discard/filter large amounts of packets that
could cause congestion in low performance networks and receivers during video
multicast transmission by high performance workstations, 3) realizing
performance analysis based on benchmark studies consisting of tests and
measurements done in heterogeneous wide area network (MBone/Internet/ATM)
scenarios; and 4) in collaboration with researchers at UC Berkeley and local
industries, investigating integrating PET systems into specific applications
such as MPEG-2. ***
