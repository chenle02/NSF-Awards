Data centers are increasingly virtualizing network functions that have been
traditionally implemented as hardware appliances. Today's network functions
(such as firewalls and multimedia support systems) are costly to procure,
deploy, and change. With virtualization, these network functions can instead be
implemented as software running on low cost commodity servers. Their placement,
size and connectivity can be adjustable on-demand though management and
orchestration systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop the
theoretic foundations and practical implementations to achieve provably
efficient, low-cost, and robust Network Function Virtualization (NFV) operation
in dynamic and uncertain environments. The project will develop online
algorithms for placing, scaling and migrating virtualized network functions that
take uncertain future network traffic and compute workloads into consideration.
The investigators will model the variability and uncertainty of the compute load
and network traffic in a rigorous mathematical framework to develop control
algorithms with provable guarantees in cost and performance. The three principal
research activities are: 1) exploring online NFV orchestration and scaling under
uncertainty; 2) managing end-to-end queueing performance under uncertainty and
cross-function dependency; and 3) designing algorithms and analyzing key
performance and complexity bottlenecks.
