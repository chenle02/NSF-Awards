9724331 Archer This proposal requests $120,123 to purchase a micro laser Raman
spectropotometer for polymer and biomedical research applications, and for
classroom instruction. Five research projects will utilize the equipment. These
projects include the monitoring of small molecule transport on polymer surfaces,
the stability of polymeric matrix composites, the interaction of B-amyloid
peptides with cell membranes, and for tissue characterization. The equipment
will also be used in a newly developed course on biomedical optics. ***
