Many software developers view evaluation as a burden both because it currently
takes significant effort and because most programmers are not trained in it. In
the context of the PI's area of expertise (planning and agent design in
Artificial Intelligence), the purpose of this project is to address two gaps in
current methodology and pedagogy: the dearth of evaluation methods for AI
software agents and the absence of empirical and evaluation methods in the
undergraduate and graduate computer science curricula. Towards these ends, the
research component creates new methods for evaluation that support AI agent
design and development in the context of two agent projects: a simulated robot
and an information gathering agent for the WWW. The teaching component
integrates evaluation methods into the undergraduate and graduate CS curriculum
by incorporating modules into existing courses where possible and designing new
courses where necessary. Each component exploits existing and new research
projects for exploring issues of evaluation in motivating design. The expected
results are not only new software evaluation methods, documented examples of
their use and two thoroughly evaluated software agents, but also experienced,
new practitioners.
