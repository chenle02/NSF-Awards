For the optimum operation of a new project-based sophomore-junior chemistry
laboratory program at Milliken University, the recent acquisition of a diode-
array spectrometer, a gas chromatograph with integrator, and two microcomputers
provides students with the speed and versatility needed to make fast, accurate
measurements and to process data efficiently. In these laboratory activities,
which have been transformed into separate courses with an emphasis on
experiments rather than exercises, the objective is for students to develop
maximum independence so that the difficulty often encountered in making the
transition into industrial careers or graduate training can be minimized.
