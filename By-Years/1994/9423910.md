Dr. John E. Bartmess and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Tennessee at Knoxville are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97,
eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of
chemistry -- organic, inorganic, analytical, and physical. A special feature of
the program is a seminar and discussion groups on scientific ethics offered by
Prof. Jeffrey Kovac, author of `The Ethical Chemist,` a set of cases and
instructor commentaries.
