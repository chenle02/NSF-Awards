Experimental, theoretical and computational research into the fundamental
properties of strongly coupled dusty plasmas will be performed in order to
understand the mechanism of phase transitions in these novel plasma
environments. Dusty plasmas may be found in the interstellar medium, in
industrial plasma reactors and in the atmosphere. As a consequence of the broad,
interdisciplinary character of the research, the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities is participating in the funding.
