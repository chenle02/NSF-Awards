This project addresses the synthesis and study of novel carbocations and onium
ions. Protonated highly-substituted benzenium dications such as m-xylene,
mesitylene and hexamethylbenzene will be generated in superacids under stable
ion conditions. The elusive bis-, tris- and tetradiazomethane di, tri- and
tetracation, respectively, will be modeled with ab initio/GIAO-MP2 calculations
and prepared and spectrally characterized in superacid solution. A number of
interesting trifluoromethylsubstituted allyl cations and polyallyl cations and
several silylated onium ions, including silylated urea, guanidinium ion,
formamide and acetamide ions, will also be examined. Superelectrophilic
activation of N,N-dimethylmethyleniminium ion, CH2=N(CH3)2+ and the isomeric
isopropyleniminium ion, (CH3)2C=NH2+ will be investigated by hydrogen/deuterium
exchange experiments. Sulfur and phosphorous analogs of dialkyl
ether/poly(hydrogen fluoride) i.e dialkyl thioether/poly(hydrogen fluoride) and
trialkyl phosphine/poly(hydrogen fluoride) complexes will be prepared and
studied as new ionic liquids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. George A.
Olah of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California.
Combining experimental structural and mechanistic studies with theoretical
analyses, Professor Olah and his students are elucidating fundamental steps in
chemical processes. Their studies are focused on the generation, structure, and
reaction chemistry of reactive intermediates bearing one or more positive
charges. Such novel intermediates have been implicated in numerous processes of
laboratory and commercial significance. These studies are providing important
insights into the design of selective organic reactions and into the phenomena
at play in large-scale petrochemical processes such as catalytic cracking and
alkylation reactions.
