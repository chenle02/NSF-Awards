This project supports 10-15 students for their travel to attend the 2015 Annual
Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). ACSAC, which just celebrated
its 30th year, is a top-tier academic security conference that attracts averages
about 250 highly skilled security professionals and student attendees per year.
ACSAC has carved a unique role as a security conference equally attended by
academia, industry, and government. In addition to the technical papers, the
conference program will include keynotes by distinguished speakers, tutorials,
case studies, panels, a poster session, and works-in-progress talks. This
project will support attendance by students, with particular attention given to
those have a paper, poster, or works-in-progress submission accepted at the
conference. In so doing, it will help to provide cybersecurity students with a
broad perspective of the discipline.
