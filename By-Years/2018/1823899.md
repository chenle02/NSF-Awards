The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop
aerogel-based catalysts as a sustainable, environmentally friendly material for
pollution mitigation applications. These materials could reduce or even
eliminate the use of expensive precious metals such as platinum, palladium and
rhodium that are currently used in automotive exhaust after-treatment systems.
Thus, aerogel catalysts could have a significant positive economic and
environmental impact on this nation. Commercialization of these novel materials
will extend the design space available to pollution-control system engineers,
and hence open new, potentially transformative, avenues for meeting current and
future pollution regulations. In addition, this project will enable
undergraduate students to develop entrepreneurial ideas and learn what is
involved in bringing technology developed through fundamental research to the
marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore commercial
opportunities for catalytic aerogels. Aerogels are materials with remarkable
properties, including unusually high surface area, low density, low thermal
conductivity and a nanoporous structure that is stable at high temperatures.
Aerogels can be fabricated using a rapid supercritical extraction method and
tailored to contain different catalytic metal species such as copper, cobalt,
vanadia and alumina. Research in this area is focused on developing methods for
making different types of catalytic aerogels and on testing their effectiveness
in pollution mitigation applications. Catalytic testing of copper-alumina
aerogels under simulated automotive exhaust conditions has demonstrated that
they are capable of converting unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon
monoxide into less harmful gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
