This project addresses the problem of writing parallel programs that are
simultaneously clear, portable, and efficient. The initial focus is on MIMD
multiprocessors, including various shared memory and distributed memory
architectures. The approach separates the expression of a parallel algorithm
from the machine-dependent details that are necessary to achieve good
performance. A programmer first writes an algorithm in a classic, explicitly
parallel style assuming there is unlimited concurrency and that objects are
shared. This basic algorithm is then annotated with scheduling directives and
data mappings to yield an efficient program. The annotations thus affect the
performance of the algorithm on a given architecture but they do not affect its
correctness. A new, object-oriented programming language that supports this
method has been developed. This project is refining the language and approach by
examining additional parallel computing problems, conducting experiments to
assess its performance, and determining the extent to which this approach can be
applied to existing languages and to SIMD architectures.
