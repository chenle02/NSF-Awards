Professor Howard Taylor is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) on the topic of signal
processing in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The algorithm
developed by this group has the potential to greatly improve the productivity of
NMR by cutting the machine time needed to do the most common experiments. The
idea is to insert a noise reduction scheme between the experimental acquisition
of the Free Induction Decay time signal and the final Fast Fourier Transform to
the spectrum. The project will explore, extend and demonstrate the usefulness of
this newly invented tool in sub-fields of chemistry that employ NMR. With
Professor C. E. McKenna, NMR using costly isotopes will be studied. With
Professor G. K. S. Prakash, carbon 13 coupling experiments will be the focus.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NMR is used in virtually every chemistry department for
the analysis of structure and kinetics of molecules, usually in solution and
sometimes in the solid phase. The instruments are costly and require high
maintenance. This work aims to increase the productivity of the machines that
are present now in labs, and to thus free up NMR time for difficult experiments
that require greater data acquisition times. &lt;br/&gt;
