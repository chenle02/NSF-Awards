The project focuses on three major efforts. First, a mechanistic study on Co-Rh
mixed metal catalyst systems will be carried out to probe catalysis by Co-Rh
bimetallic di- and tetranuclear complexes with regard to the highly regio- and
stereoselective silylformylation and hydrosilylation of 1-alkynes. Second,
applications of the silylformylation reaction to the silylformylation-annulation
of alkynyl amines and silylformylation-carbocyclization will be examined as a
route to functionalized heterocycles. Third, approaches to effective asymmetric
induction will be studied by the use of chelation-directed regio- and
stereocontrol in carbonylations. %%% With this award the Synthetic Organic
Program renews support of the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of
Chemistry at the State University of New York, Stonybrook. The ultimate goal of
the work is to design and develop multi-functional multi-catalyst systems that
will enable the chemist to carry out multi-step synthesis in one reaction vessel
in a highly organized manner. The research wiil provide new and efficient
synthetic methods, and an improved understanding of both bimetallic catalysis
and regio- and stereocontrol mediated by transition metal complexes.
