The overall objective of the proposed research is to establish the foundation of
a legged locomotion laboratory that will provide the infrastructure, equipment
and support required for graduate and undergraduate students to obtain research
experience in the areas of design and control of high-performance robots that
utilize legged locomotion. The proposed research focuses on designing legged
locomotion systems for increased agility, although a small amount of controller
development is involved. Here agility is concerned with aperiodic motions which
are not fully addressed by the use of gait or other locomotion strategies
involving predetermined motion primitives. The design methodologies center
around the development of a performance analysis which describes the dynamic
dexterity of legged systems in terms of their ability to use contact with the
environment to accelerate their bodies. In addition to the performance analysis,
the expected results include agility performance measures and actuator selection
methodologies, as well as a study of the interplay between kinematics and
dynamics that results in a high-performance legged locomotion system. These
developments are intended to aid in the production of legged systems which are
highly responsive and adaptable to their environment, thereby improving their
utility in several diverse application areas of great benefit to society. These
areas include search and rescue, for instance searching for lost hikers in
national parks or locating survivors of catastrophic events, as well as
planetary exploration and human-service robotics.
