This project will support several activities which will enhance the scope of
collaborative research in biomathematical modeling at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook. These activities will include a one day conference on
mathematical biology in May 1990, a seminar series in biomathematics during the
1989-90 academic year, and a week-long visit by a senior researcher in
biomasthematical modeling who will lecture and consult.
