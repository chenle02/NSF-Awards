The questions being asked by today's scientists are moving them steadily into
realms where rapid acquisition of data is commonplace, and where sophisticated
and detailed analysis is required to make these data sensible. Exposure to the
uses and applications of the tools required to engage in this work is becoming
an increasing necessity in the undergraduate preparation of young scientists.
The microcomputer with its potential for interfacing to instruments and
apparatus is a central tool in this process. It is the aim of this project to
provide, for chemistry majors, meaningful instruction in and experience with
computer interfacing in laboratory environments. Six computer interfacing units
are being purchased to be used in six different laboratory courses distributed
over the last three undergraduate years. The project is providing an early
introduction to computer interfacing, with units appropriately configured for
use by inexperienced students. Uses and applications are building in
sophistication as students move into more advanced laboratory situations.
Chemistry majors are engaging in multiple experiences with these tools and
techniques, and it is estimated that seventy new students per year are being
exposed to the techniques. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal
sources.
