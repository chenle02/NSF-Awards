This research is to develop and test methods for resolving the fault plane
ambiguity problem, that is, the inability of fault plane solutions from first
motions of an earthquake to resolve which of two orthogonal planes was the
actual fault surface. The research will be done using locally recorded, broad-
band, high dynamic range digital seismograms from the Anza, California, digital
seismic array for the Cahuilla earthquake swarm. The broad-band seismic energy
of the complete body waves should have some directivity information as a result
of the finite source size. Data from portable seismic systems that recorded
earthquake swarms between the Elsinore and San Jacinto fault zones will also be
analyzed. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
