The focus of this research will be the synthesis and characterization of
nanoporous coordination networks that hold great promise as new materials. Two
strategies will be tested. One involves the use of spoke-like building blocks in
which cavities are assembled during crystallization and the other utilizes
macrocyclic building blocks in which pre-fabricated sections of cavities are
covalently constructed prior to crystallization. With this renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jeffrey S. Moore of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois and Dr. Stephen Lee of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan. The focus of this
collaborative research will be the rational preparation of nanoporous
coordination networks. The approach will lead to important progress in the field
of solid state design.
