Through this award, the Chemistry Division provides continued support to a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry and
Biochemistry Department, California State University-Los Angeles, directed by
Dr. Anthony Fratiello. The 10 participants will be recruited from local
community colleges, particularly those with large minority enrollments. The
students select research topics from several areas of chemistry, including
inorganic and organic synthesis, electron spin resonance, nuclear magnetic
resonance, infrared and laser Raman spectroscopies, enzyme kinetics, organic
electrochemistry, lipid biochemistry, carborane chemistry and capillary
electrophoresis. At the end of the program, students present their findings in
seminars and written reports.
