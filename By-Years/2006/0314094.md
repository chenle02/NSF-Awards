This project will address how changes in the structure and circulation of the
stratosphere may impact on the troposphere circulation, and by extension,
surface climate. The main focus of the project is to investigate if the dynamics
of the troposphere has a sensitivity to the dynamical and thermal structure of
the stratosphere. Three possible mechanisms will be considered initially: (1)
the backward reflection of upward propagating planetary-scale Rossby waves; (2)
the remote interaction for non-vertically-propagating waves such as those that
are found in classical treatments of baroclinic instability, and (3) the
meridional circulation via the "downward control" principle. Each of these will
be considered separately in simplified process models, and collectively through
three-dimensional modeling.

Broader Impacts: This work will benefit the climate modeling community by
improving our understanding of the way in which the troposphere and stratosphere
interact, enabling improved model parameterization.

One student will be supported by this project.
