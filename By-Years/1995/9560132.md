This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program will test a novel
method for detecting chlorinated hydrocarbons, and has particular application to
monitoring soil, subsoil, and vadose zones. Chlorinated hydrocarbons comprise
one of the most widespread, chemically long-lived classes of hazardous waste The
compounds are denser than water and migrate downward through groundwater and
vadose zones. It is often difficult to verify the effectiveness of subsurface
remediation methods because remediation activities--such as soil washing and
solvent extraction--may exacerbate the migration. Thus, improved methods are
required to monitor concentrations of these compounds. Any new analysis
technique must be field deployable, provide rapid (real time) response, and must
be selective for chlorinated hydrocarbons in the presence of large backgrounds
of inorganic chlorides. This will be a monitoring method that can provide
continuous determination of changes in the local concentrations of the
chlorinated solvents during remediation. The approach can be engineered for use
with cone penetrometers or can be implemented in fixed locations including well
headspace areas. Vapor including chlorinated organic compounds is sampled
through a membrane used to exclude liquids, then is decomposed in an electric
discharge. The concentration of discharge-produced HCI is measured by near-
infrared diode laser spectroscopy. Fiber optics bring the laser light to the
measurement region from a miniature diode laser that is kept above ground and
that can be multiplexed among numerous measurement points. This approach
guarantees rapid time response and low operating costs. Ppm detection limits for
chlorinated hydrocarbons with a 1 second response time and a measurement dynamic
range of 104 are anticipated. The proposed technology is designed to be
compatible with cone penetrometry in order to take advantage of the market for
remediation diagnostics that has already been created around the use of cone
penetrometers. Chlorinated hydrocarbons account for 35 to 40% of contamination
in soil and ground water at thousands of sites requiring remediation.
