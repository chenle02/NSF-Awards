Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in our understanding
of how the human immune system functions. Advances in molecular genetics have
led to a deeper understanding of the genetic control of immune response, and are
currently leading to an expansion of our knowledge of the relationship between
genes and certain human cancers. But knowledge of these conceptual advances in
biology and of the health-related applications has not yet filtered into the
high school curriculum. In this project, the Biological Sciences Curriculum
Study, in conjunction with the Foundation for Blood Research, will develop,
field test, and distribute an instructional monograph on advances in immunology
and immunogenetics for use by high school teachers and students. The first half
of the monograph will be devoted to an update for teachers and to suggestions
for introducing immunology content into the existing secondary school biology
curriculum. The second half will be devoted to classroom activities. The
monograph will be distributed by the National Association of Biology Teachers to
its 6000 members and by the National Center for Education in Maternal and Child
Health to others on a per-request basis.
