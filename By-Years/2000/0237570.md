Today, high-performance clusters of shared-memory multiprocessors (SMPs) are
employed to cope with large data sets for scientific applications. On these
SMPs, hybrid programming models combing message passing and shared memory are
often less efficient than pure message passing although the former fits SMP
architectures more closely.

The objective of this work is to determine the sources of inefficiencies in
utilizing memory hierarchies of SMPs and to optimize memory behavior. The
novelty lies in the reliance on dynamic binary rewriting, i.e., performance
analysis and tuning are performed on the application while it executes.

The technical challenges are to

1) develop a framework for dynamic binary rewriting, 2) determine coherence
traffic resulting in misses for non-deterministic orders of executions in the
presence of parallelism, 3) identify memory bottlenecks, 4) determine data
dependencies between data references for hot-spots for binaries, 5) study the
potential for memory-improving program transformations on the executing binary
and 6) evaluate the merits of optimizations for large-scale benchmarks among
others.

The key intellectual merit is in providing additional, dynamic optimizations for
long-running applications. The broader impact of this work lies in its
contribution to counter the increasing gap between processor and main memory
speeds by fully exploiting software optimizations.
