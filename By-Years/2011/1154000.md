This project is to increase the number of talented, recent high school graduates
successfully completing the mechatronics engineering, mechanical engineering
technology and electronic engineering technology baccalaureate degree programs
at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology. The objectives are: 1) to
provide 25 four-year scholarships to talented, economically disadvantaged
students enrolled in Vaughn's programs; 2) to improve student support services
by providing scholarship recipients with a centralized hub of academic support
services including: highly qualified tutors, mentors, supplemental instructors
and academic advisors - all located in Vaughn's Teaching and Learning Center; 3)
to increase the number of students who complete undergraduate research projects
under the mentorship of Vaughn faculty; 4). to increase the number of
engineering and engineering technologies scholarship recipients securing
internships with local companies. The project includes a number of interventions
to achieving its objectives, including tutoring, mentoring, industry
internships, and a Technology Day Conference. The project will have a positive
impact on the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields,
particularly Hispanic Americans. The partnerships with industry and other
organizations that include United Technologies Corporation, Delta Airlines, and
the Federal Aviation Administration will help to broaden the impact.
