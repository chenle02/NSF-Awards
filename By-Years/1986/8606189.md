This project is a workshop on the use of plasmas and lasers in electronic
material processing. The workshop is to be held at San Diego State University on
February 23 and 24, 1987. The topics covered relate to dry processing methods
and include: plasma etching mechanisms, molecule-surface-interactions,
application of molecular spectroscopy to diagnostics of etching and chemical
vapor deposition, and applications of laser to microelectronics fabrication. The
workshop includes a panel discussion focusing on critical scientific and
technical issues that need further extensive research and on new methods to be
developed for material processing in the future.
