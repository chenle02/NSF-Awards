Isocoumarins exhibit strong inhibition with elastases (human leucocyte elastase
(HLE) and porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)). Structural and chemical
information permit a plausible mechanism to be proposed for action. The
preferential binding mode, however, is dictated by a complex set of interactions
of the specific isocoumarin derivative with the active site residues. To date,
no two isocoumarins bind in the same way. In order better to understand binding
interactions and preference the high-resolution crystal structure of
7-TosPhe-4-Cl-3-methoxy isocoumarin bound to PPE will be studied. This is the
most potent isocoumarin inhibitor of elastase currently available. The structure
will be refined and structural results will be evaluated and related to the
database of structural information on other elastase complexes.
