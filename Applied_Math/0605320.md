The investigator extends the analysis and the numerical implementation of a
Free-Discontinuity approach to brittle fracture mechanics proposed by G.
Francfort and J-J. Marigo. This formulation departs from the classical Griffith
theory while preserving its essence, the competition between surface and bulk
terms. Doing so, it allows to address the issues of crack path determination,
creation of new cracks, and interactions between cracks. Its numerical
implementation is based on a Gamma-convergence approximation, which gives a
natural way to consider global minimizations over all possible crack sets. The
investigator extends the existing model to account for the propagation of cracks
under thermal loads and in heterogeneous media and conduct numerical experiments
in these areas. He builds a robust numerical algorithm avoiding most local
minimizers, and studies the link between Gamma-convergence and local minimizers
for this model. He implements an overlapping domain decomposition method on
supercomputers and studies the relation between discretization and
regularization parameters.

Fracture mechanics is a very active area of research, with vital applications.
In recent years, the unexpected collapse of terminal 2F at Charles de Gaulle
airport in France, the disintegration the Columbia space shuttle upon re-entry,
and the crash of American Airlines Flight 582 over Queens, NY were all linked to
unpredicted and unexplained fracture. In the area of brittle fracture (which
encompasses materials as diverse as ceramics, glass, and concrete), most
commonly accepted theories are based on Griffith's criterion and are limited to
the propagation of an isolated, pre-existing crack along a given path. The
investigator extends the analysis and the numerical implementation of a
generalization of Griffith's theory, proposed by G. Francfort and J.J. Marigo,
that eliminates these restrictions. He extends the current model to account for
more general problems (thermal loads, heterogeneous materials), and improves the
current numerical implementation on supercomputers.
