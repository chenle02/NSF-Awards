The main theme of this project is the study of knots, three dimensional
manifolds and smooth 4-manifolds by using Heegaard Floer homology, gauge theory
and symplectic geometry. Potential applications would include the construction
of new invariants for knots and links, better understanding of those knots that
admit lens space surgeries and and the construction of new exotic smooth
structures on 4-manifolds. The PI also proposes to study the structure of the
Floer homology invariants and their relationship with smooth 4-manifold
invariants.

The proposal studies the relationship between Seiberg-Witten and Heegaard Floer
homologies and their applications. While the latter theory uses topological
tools and symplectic geometry, the former uses the Seiberg-Witten equations that
are related to gauge theory and mathematical physics. Progress in this direction
should lead to a better understanding of connections between low dimensional
topology and gauge theory.
