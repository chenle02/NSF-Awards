This grant provides support for the conference "Linear algebraic groups and
cohomology" held at Emory University during 16-20 May 2007. The subject of the
conference is linear algebraic groups over a general ground field.

Some main themes of the conference are cohomological invariants; numerical
invariants of torsors; rational points on homogeneous spaces; division algebras
over surfaces and ramification data; and Chow groups and motivic decomposition.
There is an ongoing explosion of results on these topics stemming from
applications of new methods from algebraic geometry.

This conference builds on a series of previous successful conferences in Europe.
It will provide a convenient forum for US persons to attend a conference of a
type that would normally demand international travel.
