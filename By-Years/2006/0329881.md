There is a demonstrated need for disseminating information and technology to be
used in the observation, modeling and forecasting of harmful algal blooms (HABs)
in coastal waters. In response to this need, a workshop has been developed
entitled "Real?time coastal observing systents for ecosystem dynamics and
harmful algal blooms" to be held in Villefrance?sur?Mer, France, 11?21 June
2003. This workshop will be comprised of 26 plenary lectures, 7 tutorials (each
with 4 separate activities), poster sessions with participa"t contributions,
equipment demonstrations and industry exhibitions. Proceedings from the workshop
will be disseminated in three ways: cd and web?based dissemination of plenary
lecture power point presentations, posters, technical guidelines and model
simulations, and a peerreviewed UNESCO volume of the plenary lecture series. The
workshop will be supported by the European Commission and NSF for participant
support costs.
