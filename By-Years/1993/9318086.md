this Gordon Conference will be "Pineal Cell Biology." The conference will
include sessions on cellular biology of the pinealocyte,
melatonin/suprachiasmatic nucleus interactions, cellular and molecular biology
of the melatonin membrane receptor, melatonin receptor agonists and antagonists,
cellular and molecular biology of melatonin, endocrine physiology of melatonin,
melatonin and human reproduction, and melatonin in clinical medicine. The
conference will be attended by 120 scientists chosen to represent a cross
section of young and established scientists in pineal cell biology. ***
