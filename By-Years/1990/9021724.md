This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of New Mexico for
the renovation, repair, and replacement of a portion of Castetter Hall which
houses the majority of that institution's biological research and research
training activities. This building was constructed in two phases, one in 1951
and one in 1969. While scattered laboratories within the building have been
renovated, the area described has never been renovated. The ARFMP grant of
$150,000 and $150,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to
modernize these research and research training facilities which will enhance the
Biology Department's existing strength in ecology and evolutionary biology,
promote its growing strength in cell and molecular biology, and encourage
interactions among disciplines. This project will address the need to improve
the current research infrastructure by replacing the greenhouse with a modern
temperature and humidity controlled facility, by replacing the growth chambers,
and by appropriately configuring research laboratory space and equipping it with
upgraded ventilation, plumbing, and electrical systems. This award contributes
to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for a more
balanced program of biological research and for the training of quality
undergraduate and graduate students in a minority institution. This project will
enhance the importance for the region and for the nation of the University of
New Mexico's program in biology.
