9731851 Hallgren The American Meteorological Society (AMS) proposes that the
National Science Foundation (NSF) join a well-established and respected graduate
fellowship program available to all first-year graduate students in the area of
atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic sciences. The AMS provides administrative
costs of the program. Corporations and government agencies, as well as member
contributions to the AMS Programs in Support of Science and Education, are the
source of fellowship funds. The AMS, founded in 1919, is a nonprofit, tax-exempt
scientific and professional society. Interdisciplinary in its scope, the Society
actively promotes the development and dissemination of information of the
atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic sciences. The Society has its
headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts, and also maintains an office in
Washington, D.C. The AMS has more than 11,000 members from the United States and
about 100 foreign countries, and more than 135 corporation and institutional
members, representing 40 countries. The fellowship program has two goals. The
first is to help ensure that outstanding young scientists enter the fields of
atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic sciences to meet the problems of the coming
decade. The second is to provide sufficient resources to allow each recipient to
pursue a full schedule of academic studies during the first year of graduate
study, which will place them in a position to make contributions to their chosen
field sooner. The fellowships are available to students entering their first
year of graduate school in the fall of 1998, and are intended to permit maximum
formal participation during the year. The fellowship program, established in
1991, is now entering its seventh year. With this seventh year of the program,
the AMS will have awarded over 70 graduate fellowships.
