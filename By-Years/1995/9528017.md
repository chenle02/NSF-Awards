9528017 Giblin Collaborative: Carbon and Electron Acceptor Cycling in Lake and
Estuarine Sediments The decomposition of organic matter in sediments is an
important process which returns nutrients to the overlying water and controls
the amount of carbon buried in the worlds oceans and lakes. Bacteria living in
sediments degrade organic matter using a variety of oxidants in addition to
molecular oxygen. These alternative oxidants include sulfate, nitrate, and the
oxides of iron and manganese. It is now clear that these alternative oxidants
are intensively recycled near the sediment-water interface and that the amount
of decomposition being directly carried out using oxygen is smaller than
previously believed. This has important implications for our ability to model
the carbon budgets of aquatic ecosystems and other sediment processes, such as
the release of contaminants. The PI's will 1) examine the factors controlling
the use of alternative oxidants, 2) determine how the age and type of organic
matter influences oxidant recycling, and 3) determine whether the presence of
alternative oxidants increases total organic matter decomposition.
