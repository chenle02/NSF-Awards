This project is establishing a research-based comparative physiology program
with a focus on environmental and metabolic physiology. The goal of this project
is to maintain a hands-on live-animal approach to studying physiology while
introducing students to research-quality equipment and techniques. Newly
purchased equipment is improving the technological scope of the affected courses
and allowing students to conduct original or semioriginal directed research
projects in an intermediate-level comparative physiology course. The new
equipment includes a computerized, small-animal physiological data acquisition
system that monitors metabolism, temperature, and other standard biosignals for
extended periods of time; a clinical biochemistry analyzer which measures
several blood/hemolymph metabolites; and a freezing point osmometer to determine
accumulated blood/hemolymph antifreeze production. Students in this program are
studying behavioral and physiological thermoregulation in animals in response to
environmental and internal factors such as acclimation photoperiod and
temperature and endogenous or exogenous fever-inducing pyrogens; physiological
responses of animals to cold, i.e., production of antifreezes, cryoprotectants,
and ice-nucleators; and metabolic rates of animals in response to a wide variety
of factors such as activity, temperature, diet, hormones, circadian rhythms, and
acclimatization conditions. Many of the students are continuing with the
advanced-level Research in Physiology course in which they work in pairs on
original research questions of their own design. These projects typically result
in student presentations at local or national meetings, and they form components
of a manuscript to be submitted to a refereed journal. Finally, students may opt
to continue a study as an independent project or honors thesis.
