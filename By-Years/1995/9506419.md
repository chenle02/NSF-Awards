Abstract Edmund Seebauer Surface diffusion on semiconductors is examined in this
study using two experimental approaches and molecular dynamics. The previously
developed applications of second harmonic microscopy (SHM) for study of low-
coverage surface diffusion in Group IV semiconductors is broadened to include
III-V and II-IV materials. This includes the first quantitative measurements of
ion-enhanced surface diffusion. The effort focusses on wide bandgap materials
which may show very pronounced ionic effects on surface diffusion. In addition,
spatially unresolved second harmonic generation is used to test the general
theory connecting surface diffusivities with reaction rate constants. Initial
experiments involve chlorine on silicon (111). Extension to halogens or hydrogen
on III-V or II-VI materials is planned if initial tests succeed. Finally,
molecular dynamics simulations of the influence of adatoms on surface
heterodiffusion are performed. This is a basic study of the fundamentals of
surface diffusion. It has a broad range of potential relevance, including the
processing of electronic materials, thin-film formation, heterogeneous
catalysis, and corrosion protection. ***
