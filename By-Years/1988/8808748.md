This research considers the drying process in solid food materials. A magnetic
resonance imaging system will be used to simultaneously measure transient
moisture profiles and structural changes in foods during the drying, tempering
and cooling stages. Data for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous foods over a wide
range of drying conditions will be collected for model evaluation. Drying
processes are found in many diverse applications including the food industry.
The understanding of this phenomena is inhibited by the lack of detailed
measurements within opaque bodies. This research will provide nondestructive
measurements of three dimensional moisture profiles and structural changes with
magnetic resonance imaging. This information will provide previously unavailable
data to a very important engineering process.
