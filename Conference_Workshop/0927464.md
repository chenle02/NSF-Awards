Abstract Deaconu

This award is for partial support of the sixteenth West Coast Operator Algebra
Seminar (WCOAS), to be held at University of Nevada, Reno on October 17-18 2009.
This will provide full travel support for speakers, graduate students, and
postdocs, and partial support for other participants. It is expected that
approximately 60 participants, including some 25 graduate students and postdocs,
to attend the weekend seminar, which will feature nine 50-minute talks on
current topics.

The WCOAS is a tradition among the operator algebraists in the western United
States. It provides an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own
results; furnishing an opportunity for researchers learn about recent research
of others and to stay abreast of current work; fostering collaborative research
by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work with one
another. It also offers encouragement and nurturing of graduate students and
postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about
recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras; creation and
maintenance of a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists; fostering
connections between the faculty and students at research universities and those
at primarily undergraduate institutions.
