To honor Dr. David Blackwell's numerous contributions to mathematics and
statistics, the American Statistical Society, the University of California at
Berkeley, and Howard University convene the David Blackwell Memorial Conference
at Howard University on April 19-20, 2012 in the Blackburn Center. Dr. David
Blackwell was an outstanding African-American mathematician and statistician who
made profound contributions to several areas of mathematics, game theory,
probability theory, information theory, dynamic programming, logic and
statistics. This significant event organized by three collaborating institutions
simultaneously recognizes Dr. Blackwell's legacy as well as advances in
mathematics and statistics. The two-day conference brings together leading
theoretical and applied mathematicians, statisticians, and other scientists to:
(1) Recognize and acknowledge Dr. Blackwell's myriad contributions to
scholarship in multiple areas and disciplines. (2) Discuss how Dr. Blackwell's
work shapes and influences the field-at-large and their respective scholarship.
(3) Explore and develop new ideas and approaches to questions arising from
mathematics and statistics. (4) Provide a forum for a diverse group of
undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior
faculty to interact and collaborate with experts in the field of mathematics and
statistics.

Evidence of Dr. Blackwell's intellectual contributions is visible in many arenas
and scholars continue to build on that knowledge base. In so doing, conference
participants continuously underscore and reinforce the intellectual merit of Dr.
Blackwell's and their own work. The conference is an opportunity for
intellectual exchange and discourse among scholars from diverse backgrounds. As
new generations of scholars from increasingly diverse backgrounds enter the
fields of mathematics and statistics and more broadly, science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM), through the Dr. David Blackwell Memorial
conference they become members of the community of scholars who innovate and
make breakthroughs within their respective fields. The conference website is
