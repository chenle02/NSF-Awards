The principal investigator will study fluid-rock interaction under high-pressure
conditions. To do so he will experimentally investig- ate the solubilities of
talc+enstatite, enstatite+forsterite, albite, and jadeite at high pressure. This
will provide constraints necessary to evaluate mass transfer processes in
subduction zones.
