This proposal is a request for a three-year, youth-based program for 45 Chicago
area youth. It is a year-round program with a summer component that focuses on
environmental science and technology education. There is a major focus on job
skills training together with work experience that respond to the general labor
shortage for well-prepared science and technology professionals to fuel the 21st
Century economy. The program is geared towards teens who have limited
opportunities in their own communities to study technology and who are primarily
African Americans, Latinos, females or from other backgrounds that are under-
represented in technology-based professions and from low-income communities.
Over the course of a three-year period, 15 students will be recruited each year,
with 45 ultimately participating in the third year of the program, i.e. 90
budgeted participants including returning students. Students receive an average
of 365 contact hours each year for a total of 1,095 hours. The program will
produce a stream of technologically trained students from under-represented
groups to enter the workforce or pursue education toward STEM careers.
