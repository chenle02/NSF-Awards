9550061 David Page The All Learn Mathematics project is a three-year project to
improve the mathematical understanding and the classroom pedagogy of middle-
grades teachers of mathematics in Chicago Public Schools, grades 5-8. The
project will involve 500 classroom teachers and provide 100 hours of enhancement
for each teacher over two years in eight summer institute days, monthly after
school sessions, and project staff working in the classroom. Teachers will work
in cadres of fifty teachers to build collaborative networks in addition to the
specific enhancement. The program will assist teachers and administrators in
building parental support and a students helping students environment in the
school. The project will target schools in the Chicago Systemic Initiative and
develop cadres of 50 teachers in each of Chicago's ten subdistricts. The project
is funded at $1,932,417 with cost-sharing at $1,016,267 or 53% primarily from
the local schools in the Chicago school-based structure.
