Savanna baboons represent a group of closely related populations living across
subsaharan Africa outside the tropical rain forest. Scientists do not agree
whether they comprise one or several species because, although they are very
similar morphologically, populations differ significantly in social
characteristics. For the analysis of primate social organization and its
relationship to humans, savanna baboons are thus excellent subjects. In order to
understand the social relationships among individuals in such a population, it
is necessary to know who are the parents of individual infants. Previous studies
have been hampered by knowing only who is the mother each infant. Previous long-
term field observations of this population by the Principal Investigator have
resulted in knowing all individuals behaviorally. Maternity is known, but
paternity--based on behavioral observations--is only assumed. In this study
genetic studies (paternity tests) will also determine who the father is of each
infant. These genetic studies will test the hypothesis that such behavioral
father (based on observations of the animals) is also the genetic father. As a
result of this study it will be possible to test a variety of behavioral
questions such as: whether inbreeding and incest occur; whether paternal
certainty is related to protection from infanticide; and, whether male access to
alpha status is related to the status of his father.
