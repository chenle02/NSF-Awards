DMS-0347342 Irena Peeva

The proposed research deals with the structure of free resolutions and their
applications in Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Topological
Combinatorics. Resolutions will be studied over polynomial rings and their
quotients. In essence constructing a resolution over a ring R consists of
repeatedly solving systems of R-linear equations. From another point of view,
resolutions provide a homological method for studying the structure of modules.
The idea to associate a resolution to a module was introduced in Hilbert's
famous 1890 and 1893 papers. This CAREER project focuses especially on
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and Koszulness of toric varieties, lower bounds
on Betti numbers, asymptotic structure of infinite free resolutions, free
resolutions over rings with restricted powers, and monomial resolutions.

Peeva will organize a workshop and a summer school on resolutions. She plans to
organize other conferences as well. Such conferences provide a forum for
discussion of recent developments and foster research. This CAREER project also
aims to aid undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to
discover the beauty in mathematical ideas, to inspire them, and lead them to
explore exciting open problems and conjectures. Peeva is also writing a book on
resolutions.
