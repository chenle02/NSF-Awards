Dr. Haegel has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator. She is
active in research on optoelectronic properties of semiconductor materials, with
emphasis on transient behavior and space charge-related effects in high
resistivity materials. In this research program for the National Science
Foundation she will pursue studies to include the following: (1) electrical
transport and trasient phenomena in high resistivity materials, such as high
purity materials at low temperature, semi-insulating gallium arsenide, or large
bandgap materials, (2) transition from transport dominated by carrier lifetime
to transport dominated by dielectric relaxation as a function of temperature,
(3) effects of extended defects, and point defects on optical and electronic
properties, (4) development of new techniqaues to characterize semiconductor
thin films and heterostructures. The ultimate goal of the research is to acquire
the knowledge and understanding necessary to study both optically and electrical
induced transient effects in materials over a wide range of time scales to
elucidate the dynamics of the interactions between free and trapped carriers and
defects in semiconductors. The research is important for materials used in
high=speed switches, fast detectors, isolating substrates for optoelectronic
circuits, and future communications and computation systems.
