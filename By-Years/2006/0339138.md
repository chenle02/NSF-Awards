0339138&lt;br/&gt;Son&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most active areas of
research in nuclear physics is the study of matter under extreme conditions:
high temperature, high baryon number density and high parton density. In this
three-year U.S.-France cooperative research project, theoretical physicists from
the University of Washington, Columbia University, Universite Paris-Sud, and the
French Center for Atomic Energy will investigate properties of QCD (quantum
chromo dynamics) at high parton density regime. This regime can be achieved in
high-energy heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(Brookhaven) and Large Hadron Collider (CERN) and in deep inelastic scattering
experiments at HERA. Issues of quark-gluon plasma formation in heavy ion
collisions and its relationship to the small-x wave-function of a high-energy
heavy ion will be addressed. They will follow with studies of the quark-gluon
system's evolution and of experimental signatures characteristic of high parton
density initial state and subsequent equilibration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
U.S. and French researchers have expertise in field theory, non-equilibrium
kinetic theory and phenomenology, which will be used to explore properties of
QCD. Their investigations will advance understanding of QCD under extreme
conditions and impact ultra relativistic heavy ion experiments running and
scheduled at Brookhaven, CERN and HERA. The National Science Foundation (NSF)
and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) jointly support this
project. NSF provides funding to the U.S. investigators for their visits to
France. The CNRS covers the costs of visits by the French investigators to the
United States.&lt;br/&gt;
