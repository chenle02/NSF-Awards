The focus of this project is on designing robust multi-core systems at lowest
cost that are resilient to hardware failures. It is motivated by an imminent
paradigm shift in hardware design resulting from the growing problem of hardware
failures in future process technologies. The central vision is to develop
techniques and tools for designing hierarchical robust multi-core systems that
are globally optimized across multiple abstraction layers ? circuit,
architecture, runtime, and application ? without incurring the high cost of
expensive redundancy techniques. An inter disciplinary approach will integrate
research and education required to enable future robust systems. Because of its
cross-cutting nature, the proposed research has the potential of having a major
impact on future systems, enabling future technology scaling, thus making
everyday lives better.
