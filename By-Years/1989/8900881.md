Research in Particulate Systems Engineering is crucial to advances in
combustion, atmospheric, and environmental sciences, nuclear winter studies,
nuclear reactor safety, and materials manufacturing. The purpose of this project
is to provide research experiences for 12 undergraduate students in this area at
the University of Missouri-Columbia (UMC). At least half of the students will be
selected from institutions other than UMC, with several recruited from Stephens
College (a woman's college), Lincoln University (HBCU), and other undergraduate
schools in the state. Each student will undertake a specific research project,
and a faculty advisor will work with the student to develop his/her research
skills. The purpose is to infuse bright undergraduate students with enthusiasm
towards research careers, including graduate level education. Some of the
research projects include: (1) the use of mathematical and physical modeling to
predict the behavior of a given particulate system, (2) explore the modeling of
an aerosol reactor, including particulate characterization and production of
superconducting materials, and (3) the use of neutron activation analysis in
particulate studies.
