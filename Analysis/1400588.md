For many centuries the classical mathematical tools of basic calculus and
algebra have been widely used in the study of many real-world phenomena. However
there are two important assumptions that play a crucial role in their usefulness
that do not always hold. First, calculus can only be used when, like the surface
of the earth, the quantities of interest "appear to be flat" from up close. In
addition, many properties in algebra use the fact that when multiplying numbers,
changing the order of the factors does not affect their product. Unfortunately
there many real-world situations that cannot be modeled adequately under these
assumptions. For example, when an online merchant recommends a particular
product based on previous purchases, the information that is relevant consists
of quantities whose variations can be more accurately described as "jumps":
whether or not we buy a particular product causes a sudden change in quantity
sold. In quantum physics, or physics at nanoscopic scales, the order in which
factors are multiplied can affect the product. The PI proposes in this project
to develop modern versions of existing mathematical tools in the absence of
those seemingly simple assumptions. The particular tools that will be considered
are relevant for computer science and quantum physics.

The PI will carry on a program that studies the counterparts of various aspects
of Banach space theory (mainly related to study of ideals of operators and
approximation properties) in the context of metric spaces and operator spaces.
This will be done by combining methods and techniques from the local theory of
Banach spaces with modern nonlinear and noncommutative approaches. The nonlinear
aspects include using Lipschitz-free spaces to investigate whether or not
certain approximation properties for Banach spaces are invariant under Lipschitz
isomorphisms; and also answering quantitative questions about embedding finite
metric spaces into Hilbert spaces. On the noncommutative side, the project aims
at proving composition theorems for certain classes of mappings acting between
operator spaces, constructing almost Euclidean subspaces of finite-dimensional
spaces of trace-class operators, and defining a Radon-Nikodym property for
operator spaces.
