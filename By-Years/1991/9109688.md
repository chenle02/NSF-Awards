Points in scene, when illuminated, reflect light not only in the direction of
the sensor but also between themselves. These interreflections can appreciably
alter the appearance of the scene. Existing vision sensors and algorithms do not
account for the effects of interreflections and hence often produce erroneous
results. An initial investigation studied the effects of interreflections on
shape information recovered by shape-from- intensity methods (e.g. photometric
stereo). It was discovered that, for Lambertian surfaces, the erroneous (pseudo)
shape recovered in the presence of interreflections is unique and can be
mathematically related to the actual shape. An algorithm has been developed that
uses a physical interreflection model to recover the actual shape of the surface
from the psuedo shape. The research will be extended in the following
directions. (1) The analysis of non-Lambertian (e.g. specular) interreflections.
This entails the development of mathematical models for non-Lambertian
interreflections as well as their application to the problem of recovering
accurate shape in the presence of interreflections. (2) The detection and
correction of errors produced by existing vision sensors (spot scanners, light
stripe range finders, stereo systems) as a result of interreflections. For each
sensor, a sensor model is used to obtain physical constraints that aid the
analysis of interreflections. All analytical results will be verified by
laboratory experiments. This research should achieve (a) fundamental advances in
the analysis of interreflections and (b) substantial improvements in vision
sensing technology.
