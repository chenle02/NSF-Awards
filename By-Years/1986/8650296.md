The Biology Department of Hiram College is engaged in a curricular program of
enhancement called "Project Excellence." Under the aegis of this campaign, two
electron microscopes (a transmission and a scanning EM) have been obtained
recently for the expansion of the Molecular Biology program. This current
project provides ancillary instrumentation to complete the electron microscope
facility. An ultramicrotome, glass knife maker, critical point dryer, gold
sputtering device, rotary vacuum pump and two specimen polishers round out the
suite of instruments needed to prepare specimens for ultramicroscopic study. In
addition, this award is providing an ultracentrifuge to broaden the college's
capabilities for student laboratory experiences in molecular biology.
