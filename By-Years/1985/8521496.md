In this project, new optimal control theories and algorithms applicable to
structural control under earthquake excitations are developed. These optimal
control algorithms, including globel controls and critical-mode controls, will
take into account the measurable earthquake ground acceleration. The
effectiveness and efficiency of the developed optimal control algorithms are
examined and compared. Their advantages and drawbacks for practical applications
are identified. In-depth studies of various aspects critical to the practical
implementation of structural control under seismic environments are also carried
out.
