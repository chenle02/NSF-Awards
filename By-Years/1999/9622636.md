This is a joint project between Dimitri Bertsekas, MIT and Andrea Goldsmith,
Caltech. The scarcity of channel capacity to support emerging multimedia
wireless applications requires efficient strategies for using the available
bandwidth. Any system using fixed frequency reuse and base station assignment
must be designed relative to worst-case interference assumptions. Dynamic
resource allocation is a more efficient strategy, where frequencies, base
stations, data rates, and power levels are dynamically assigned relative to
current and potential system conditions. In this work, we propose to formulate
the general resource allocation problem as an optimization problem subject to
interference constraints. The cost function is very general. It can incorporate
most of the practical systems complexity in the optimization framework,
including cell handoff due to user mobility, multiple classes of traffic, and
channel variation. We consider both FDMA and CDMA methods of dividing up the
available systems band width. We will apply linear programming to minimize the
instantaneous cost function, and dynamic programming techniques to minimize the
cost function over the infinite horizon. The dynamic problem formulation will
utilize recent developments in neuro-dynamic programming techniques.
