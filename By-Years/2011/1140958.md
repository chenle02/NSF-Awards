In this project, a team at the University of La Verne is adapting its successful
strategy for teaching junior-level cell biology laboratory, called Design Your
Own Experiment (DYOE). It is now being combined with activities promoting
scientific literacy and the course targeted to the sophomore-level. In response
to increased enrollment, the class size has increased so that laboratory
equipment must be shared. When not actively working with the equipment, students
develop their skills in reading, writing, and speaking about topics in cell
biology through journal club, critiquing and writing about the scientific
literature and the students' own written scientific work, and preparing data for
presentation. The approach is also being tested in a second course,
Developmental Biology. The team is developing assessment instruments to evaluate
the success of the combination of DYOE and literacy work in improving overall
student learning. The model is likely to be attractive to many schools
experiencing enrollment increases without a corresponding increase in resources.
A tangible product of the project is a laboratory manual, customizable by the
adopter, in both student and instructor editions.
