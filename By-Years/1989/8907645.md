This grant supports a search for scalar admixtures in the weak interaction
leading to nuclear beta decay, by a Grinnell College faculty member and
undergraduate students. The measurements will be carried out by this group using
radioactive sources of Grinnell and also using accelerator-produced sources at
the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory in North Carolina and at the
Princeton University Cyclotron Laboratory.
