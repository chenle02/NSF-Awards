Professor Watts is a pioneer in infrared absorption spectroscopy of van der
Waals molecules. His past work has included both experimental and theoretical
studies. In the current research, he will continue and extend these
investigations to provide information about molecular interactions, potential
energy surfaces, intramolecular energy transfer, and vibrational dynamics. This
information is needed to test calculations of collisional and condensed phase
properties as well as to describe how chemical reactions occur. In the near
future, Dr. Watts will measure the high resolution infrared spectra of both
small, weakly bound,van der Waals and strongly associated clusters using
F-center and carbon dioxide lasers, the angular distributions and energetics of
infrared induced cluster fragmentation by time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and
theoretical and experimental investigations of state resolved differential
scattering measurements on the He/HF system.
