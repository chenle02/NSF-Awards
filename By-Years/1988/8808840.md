It has long been recognized that there is a relationship between stressful life
events and disease. For example, grief and bereavement appear to be associated
with increased morbidity and mortality among the survivors. Depression, which
often follows a loss or a separation is associated with a twofold increase in
risk of cancer over a 17-year follow-up period. Similar, significant
correlations, although retrospective, exist between stressful life events and
the incidence or onset of major medical disorders, including AIDS. Given such
correlations, it becomes important to examine what impact stress has on immune
function. Dr. Linda Watkins will focus her research efforts on two inter-
related questions which, taken together, should shed light on the underlying
bases of immune responses to stress. First, a systematic examination will be
performed to clearly define the temporal window within which exposure to stress
can alter the immunologic response to antigenic challenge. Second, studies will
be done aimed at defining mechanisms which allow these changes in immune
function to occur. Standard plasma and tissue assays will be used.
