The PI plans to study finite dimensional normed spaces and convex bodies using
methods of Fourier analysis. The idea is to express different properties of
convex bodies in terms of the Fourier transform and then solve geometric
problems using Fourier analytic methods. This approach has already led to
several results including a complete analytic solution to the Busemann-Petty
problem on sections of convex bodies. The PI plans to develop new connections
between the Fourier transform, spherical harmonics and parallel section
functions (X-rays) of convex bodies that will lead to new results on critical
sections of convex bodies, intersection and projection bodies and to new results
of Busemann-Petty type. A significant part of the work will be related to
several open problems of the local theory of Banach spaces. This includes
several possible Fourier analytic approaches to the slicing problem and the
study of the central limit properties of convex bodies.

An important direction of the geometry of normed spaces is the study of
geometric properties of convex bodies based on the properties of sections and
projections of these bodies. This direction has already found numerous
applications to engineering and medicine, starting with the classical theory of
X-rays and geometric tomography. The goal of this project is to develop a new
approach to the study of sections and projections of convex bodies based on
methods of Fourier analysis. New connections between sections of convex bodies
and the Fourier transform have been recently found by the PI and have already
led to an analytic solution to the Busemann-Petty problem of whether smaller
bodies can have uniformly larger central sections. The connections with Fourier
analysis and geometric tomography will further relate methods and results of the
Banach space theory to different areas of mathematics, engineering and medicine.
New techniques for computing the Fourier transform will have independent value
and can also be applied to signal processing and statistics.
