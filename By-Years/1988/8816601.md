Pessagno and Blome will continue their efforts to calibrate the Jurassic time
scale in western North America. The work will involve the collection of
important groups of microfossils from the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The third
year of the award will be devoted to formal descriptions of the fossils that
prove important in the refinement of the biostratigraphic zonation. Calibration
of the time scale and description of fossils will provide a basis for
correlation events in western North America with those elsewhere in the world
and will provide information on the rate and timing of continental accretion of
western North America.
