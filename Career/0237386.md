DIMENSIONAL TOPOLOGY

ABSTRACT

This project focuses on the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds via contact
structures. Over the last several years, the investigator and his collaborators
(Colin, Etnyre, Giroux, Kazez, Matic) have developed a largely cut-and-paste
theory of tight contact structures. Taking this program further, he plans to
conclude the project on finiteness questions for tight contact structures (with
Colin and Giroux), investigate Legendrian and transverse knots (with Etnyre),
and explore connections with foliation/lamination theory (with Kazez and Matic).
More fundamentally, he seeks to understand the nature of tightness, and
relations with hyperbolic geometry and finite type invariants of 3-manifolds.

This project is a continued study of 3-dimensional spaces. The 3-dimensional
spaces we study will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean)
3-dimensional space. These objects may be very complicated globally, but a local
observer cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is
sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere. In our work, we seek to better
understand 3-dimensional spaces by employing a new type of probe, called a
contact structure. Although mathematicians have been cognizant of contact
structures for decades, a good understanding of such structures has become
gradually possible only over the last twenty years. Contact structures are also
intimately connected with 4-dimensional geometry (the geometry of space-time),
quantum physics, and dynamics (such as fluid dynamics).
