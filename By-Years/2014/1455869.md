It is scientifically daunting, yet society poses a grand challenge to
neuroscientists to discover how complex brain function emerges from the activity
patterns of individual neurons and the small interconnected circuits that they
form. One important open question is how does the brain integrate different
sensory inputs to create a cohesive perception of the world? Neuroscientists
have a good understanding that senses are integrated at the cognitive level, for
example that the perception of flavor is an integration of taste and smell. But
the field has a poor understanding of the underlying mechanism - how circuits of
brain cells wire multiple senses together. This project takes an
interdisciplinary approach using genetics, live brain imaging, virtual reality
behavior and engineering analysis to determine the elemental neural circuit
mechanisms by which sensory modalities are integrated for perception. The
researchers seek to identify the cellular identity, cell-cell connections,
function, and neuro-chemical interactions that link sensory modalities together.

For this work, the researchers use a powerful neuro-genetic model system: the
fruit fly Drosophila, which exhibits a rich multi-sensory repertoire of behavior
in the laboratory, and for which there exists a wealth of molecular-genetic
tools to study and manipulate identified neurons and neural circuits. A large
body of evidence has demonstrated that in flies olfactory signals boost the
strength of visual stabilization reflexes analogous to our own gaze-stabilizing
eye movements. The researchers will test the hypothesis that olfactory signaling
alters the response strength of neurons within the visual processing pathway,
and that olfactory sensory pathways are linked to visual pathways by
neurosecretory cells releasing biogenic amines. The researchers make use of
virtual reality flight simulators, and live imaging using state-of-the-art
multi-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to genetically target calcium
reporters within select interneurons and neuromodulatory circuits innervating
the visual regions of the brain. They expect to discover that neurosecretory
cells are excited by odor, and release biogenic amines into visual processing
centers, which in turn alter the membrane properties and synaptic integration of
visual motion circuitry. They expect that genetically silencing these
interactions eliminates behavioral responses to visual motion that are well
known to be enhanced by simultaneous presentation of odor cues. The project is
conceptually linked with an outreach effort to K-12 students by outfitting a
Mobile Fly Lab to provide demonstration workshops at local elementary schools.
