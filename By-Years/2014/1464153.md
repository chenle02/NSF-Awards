Growing concerns about the quality and safety of water and beverages, present an
immediate need for sensing devices that are portable, easy to use, and
inexpensive. Use of existing laboratory instruments such as atomic absorption
spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy, and x-ray
fluorescence for heavy metal testing is expensive, laborious and time-consuming.
The I-Corps team has developed a portable electrochemical chemical sensing
system (E-Tongue) that mimics the human gustatory system using disposable
electrochemical sensors combined with pattern recognition techniques for
detecting heavy metals. The rapid, user-friendly, low cost, and portable
E-Tongue will lend itself readily for on-site testing of water and beverages.
The economic impact of this technology is expected to be quite significant since
this technological platform will address the large market for water and beverage
analysis instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps team has developed an
E-Tongue prototype for toxic heavy metal detection. It consists of a compact
potentiostat device with disposable screen printed electrodes. The E-Tongue
prototype will be trained to identify target elements as well as predict their
concentrations in water and different beverage matrices containing buffer
solutions. The E-Tongue demonstrations will initially focus on detecting lead,
cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. The detection capabilities will be expanded in
the future to include other heavy metals including chromium, nickel, copper, and
zinc. The E-Tongue performance will be tested and evaluated by comparing it with
results obtained using standard analytical methods. Several performance
parameters such as selectivity, limit of detection, repeatability, precision and
accuracy will be determined
