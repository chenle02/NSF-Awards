Alabama Agricultural &amp; Mechanical Universityâ€™s Research on the Hill Network
(RotH Net) is a dedicated and frictionless network fabric to serve as a Science
DMZ for multidisciplinary research programs. The RotH Net provides a secure
digital workspace where researchers can compute, store, and share research data
on a 10G connection to Internet2. This network fabric facilitates transfers of
large datasets from projects serving multiple research labs. Data collected from
Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for scientists and farmers to evaluate crops at
scale while simultaneously creating crop maps and large consistent datasets that
were previously imaginable. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index images will
prescribe fertilizer applications, estimate yields, and identify weeds. Other
facilities dedicated to data-intensive science are enabled by the project,
including research into Ion Accelerator Technology and Ion beam modification of
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RotH Net includes a full set of science DMZ
components serving to re-architect the campus border to support high performance
science data flows across campus and external to the campus network. One
additional component is the Open Storage Network (OSN) pod, a set of deployable
units of distributed storage with minimal administrative overhead and petabyte-
sized storage capable of high-throughput, and high-speed large volume data
transfers. The OSN provides a cyberinfrastructure (CI) service to address
specific data storage, transfer, sharing, and access, challenges. The project
also supports a fiber extension connecting campus research facilities and paving
the way for flexible growth in high performance research and education network
connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
