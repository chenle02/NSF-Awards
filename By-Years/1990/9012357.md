This project has three parts. Part one consists in developing new parallel graph
algorithms that are efficient in their use of processors. The focus is on
developing algorithmic building blocks that are useful in combinatorial
optimization, e.g. shortest paths. Part two consists in obtaining new
approximation algorithms for problems that are too difficult to solve exactly.
Two such problems are finding a minimum-weight collection of edges in a graph
whose deletion yields a planar graph, and finding a minimum number of edges to
add to a graph to make it chordal. The first problem arises in planning the
layout of a manufacturing facility, the second problem in solving sparse linear
systems and linear programs. Part three consists in developing improved
algorithms for variants of multicommodity flow, a problem that arises in the
above approximation algorithms as well as in a variety of network analysis
problems.
