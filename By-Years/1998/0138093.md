Professor Andres Campiglia of North Dakota State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for fundamental studies exploring the
use of low temperature matrices for the spectroanalysis of polyaromatic
hydrocarbons, which are toxic compounds found in the environment. The use of
multiple parameters (e.g. excitation wavelength, emission wavelength,
fluorescence and phosphorescence lifetime) will allow the analysis of complex
mixtures of PAH's at very low concentrations. A fiberoptic is implanted in the
matrix itself for sensitive detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyaromatic
hydrocarbons are extremely toxic compounds found in the environment, near oil
refineries, for example. The spectroscopic detection and identification of
complex mixtures of closely resembling compounds is an analytical challenge.
Students will be trained in methods of low temperature emission methods that
have the potential for significant impact in the rapid, cost-effective sampling
of soils and water in polluted areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
