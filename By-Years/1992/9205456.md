This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is for partial support of a conference on bioinorganic copper chemistry. The
funds will be used to reduce the registration fee of graduate student and post-
doctoral to one half that of other conferees. This conference will bring
together participants from the inorganic and biological chemistry communities to
discuss the most recent discoveries concerning the chemistry of copper in
biological systems. Attendence of such conferences by junior researchers can
provide significant enhancement to their education and a boost to their careers
as independent scientists.
