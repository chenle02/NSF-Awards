The PI's research includes the use of fixed-point methods, the method of
moments, and complex-analytic singularity analysis to study additive functionals
on random trees, which arise in the analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
It seeks to explain, using continuum random trees and Brownian excursion or
otherwise, an invariance of distributions observed across various random-trees
models. A refined analysis, under the so-called random permutation model, of the
periodic asymptotic distributional behavior of additive functionals for trees
with large branching factor also extends to urn models and multi-type branching
processes. Additionally, the research encompasses digital analyses and
improvements of algorithms for searching and sorting, such as the widely-used
Quicksort; use of a perfect simulation algorithm pioneered by the PI to estimate
mixing times of Markov chains statistically; and the novel application of Mellin
transforms to the study of small deviations (small-ball probabilities) for
Gaussian random fields.

The research to be performed lies at the interface of probability and computer
science. It involves the design and application of efficient algorithms for
computer simulation from complicated probability distributions; the
probabilistic analysis of algorithms and data structures arising in connection
with such basic and important algorithms as Quicksort, which is the standard
sorting procedure in Unix systems and which, in a computer science review paper
in 2000, was cited as one of the ten algorithms with the greatest influence on
the development and practice of science and engineering in the last century; and
the novel application of a common analysis-of-algorithms tool ("Mellin
transforms") to an area of probability ("small deviations", involving the
estimation of the chance of certain uncommon events).
