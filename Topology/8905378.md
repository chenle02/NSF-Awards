M. Davis and R. Charney intend to work on topics in geometric topology and
geometric methods in group theory. They will apply Gromov's theory of non-
positively curved spaces to Artin groups associated to infinite reflection
groups. In addition, R. Charney will study building-like complexes and mapping
class groups of surfaces with group actions, M. Davis will work on some problems
concerning right-angled Coxeter orbifolds. All these projects involve very
concrete geometry and some deceptively simple questions about an algebraic
structure called a group. Traditionally, various groups have been used in the
analysis of topological spaces. In these projects, however, topology can be
expected to pay its dues to algebra by helping to answer some questions in group
theory.
