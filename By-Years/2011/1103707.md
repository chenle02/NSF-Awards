This award provides funding to the Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES),
RET Site: Enrichment Experiences in Engineering (E3) for Teachers Summer
Research Program, under the direction of Robin L. Autenrieth. The funding will
pay travel expenses for a team of three site members to participate in the 2010
Teacher Research Experience (TRE) Conference, to be held at Inner Harbor,
Maryland on October 21-24, 2010. This conference is being sponsored by NOAA,
NSF, Department of Energy, Department of Education, Columbia University and
COSEE. Eight NSF RET in Engineering Site Programs have been invited to
participate in this multi-agency conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
the TRE Conference is to engage the teacher research experience program
community by: 1) identifying operational and evaluation best practices, 2)
establishing connections and partnerships between programs, and 3) collaborating
to meet individual project challenges. The main conference themes are: 1)
Evaluation; 2) Sustainability; and 3) Transfer.
