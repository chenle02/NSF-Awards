The goal of this research is to increase knowledge of the electronic structure
of highly correlated materials. A combination of angle-resolved photoemission,
resonant photoemission, inverse photoemission, x-ray absorption, and extended
x-ray absorption fine structure are used to probe both information as to the
symmetry and origin of the states. Angle- resolved photoemission results are
aimed at new theory that will account for correlation effects and translational
symmetry. Nickel oxide and high temperature superconductor materials are being
investigated.
