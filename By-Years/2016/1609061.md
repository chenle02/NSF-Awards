Nontechnical description: This project is focused on the effect of hydrogenation
on the microwave absorption properties of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. These
nanoparticles have the potential to advance the field of microwave absorption,
leading to a number of practical applications in areas such as
telecommunication, spacecraft communication, wireless communication, radar
detection, satellite navigation, etc. The research team aims to understand the
underlying mechanisms of how hydrogenation affects the microwave absorption of
inorganic nanoparticles with various phase compositions and surface
morphologies. The principal investigator provides training opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate students and popularizes his research efforts and
results via various outreach activities, reaching to the local community and
underrepresented groups. He develops online courses focused on electronic and
photonic properties of these materials, which are available to the public.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: This project tackles newly observed
phenomena by the PI's group of significantly increased microwave absorption in
hydrogenated titanium dioxide nanoparticles that cannot be explained with
traditional mechanisms. The project goal is to reveal the underlying mechanisms
and to elucidate the effects of hydrogenation by comprehensive approach,
studying structural, chemical, optical, electronic, dielectric and microwave
absorption properties by employing various characterization methods such as
X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, (valence band) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a
transmission line technique with a network analyzer. The project integrates the
research activities with educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate
and high-school students.
