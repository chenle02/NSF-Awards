This award provides funds to The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory to support
ten undergraduate students for participation in a Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site Program focusing on field studies of plant reproductive
biology. Each student will attend the RMBL for ten weeks. Guidance will be
provided by supervising researchers in scientific design, project selection and
initiation, and project completion. Students will be encouraged to participate
in the many research opportunities available at the RMBL, such as formal and
informal seminars, interactions with visiting scientists, and exposure to all
levels of a field biology community. The RMBL is particularly proud of its
success in educating women interested in field biology, and in attracting senior
female scientists. Plans for increasing minority student participation are
included in this project.
