The University of Iowa seeks to provide a three-week summer residential Young
Scholars Program in engineering with follow-up activities during the academic
year. The program will serve 60 students entering grades eleven and twelve.
During the program, students will participate in a guided creative design
project involving a real-world, social- technical problem. Program activities
include: seminars and fact finding/observational field trips related to the
project design; individual career counseling; and seminars and laboratory visits
to learn more about engineering, mathematics, and the sciences.
