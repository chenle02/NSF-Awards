This project, `Development of a Multichannel Time-Resolved Fluorometer for
Macro and Microstudies', is to update and improve the ability of the Time-
Resolved Fluorescence Facility at Mount Sinai to provide pertinent information
about the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their
complexes. The present instrumentation in the Facility was funded in part by a
1986 NSF award (DMB-8516318) entitled `A Multi-User Laser for Time-Resolved
Fluorescenc'. The new proposal has three main objectives: replacement of the
outdated, limited-wavelength range pulsed laser system with a state-of-the-art
pulsed laser system capable of providing the UV and visible excitation
wavelengths required by numerous research programs construct and implement a new
sample chamber with three simultaneous detection channels to enhance the
collection and the precision of time-resolved fluorescence intensity and
anisotropy data sets combine time-resolved fluorescence with microscopy to
permit studies on 'micro' samples A three year program is outlined, with most of
the acquisition/development of the major components to occur in the first year.
Implementation, testing, and commissioning will be performed in the following
two years.
