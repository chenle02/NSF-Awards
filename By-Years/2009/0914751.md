This project is an analytical study of quantum error correction and quantum
control. The aim is to develop theoretical and computational techniques to
construct error correction codes for quantum channels with general noise, based
on matrix- and Lie-theoretic considerations.

Quantum computing is a rapidly-growing area of multidisciplinary research. If
large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve important
problems that lie beyond the capabilities of current classical computers. While
the development of quantum computers promises far-reaching implications, there
are still many open theoretical questions and experimental challenges that must
be overcome. For example, a quantum computer must employ a method to correct
data errors that result from the inevitable uncontrollable interaction between a
quantum system and its environment, a phenomenon known as decoherence. One of
the main goals of this project is to further develop algorithms for error
correction in a quantum channel. The project will also investigate other
mathematical problems in quantum control theory.
