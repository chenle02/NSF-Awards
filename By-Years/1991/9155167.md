This project, housed at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio,
focuses on the training of 75 under-prepared high school physics teachers in an
intensive summer program plus an academic year component which includes a new
course on "Teaching Physics Concepts" and follow up sessions utilizing
experienced teachers as mentors. Building on a previous project which involved
175 teachers, emphasis is placed on hands-on activities including the building
and performing of inexpensive demonstrations. Continuing project activities
include the replication of the program on a local basis by the participants to
multiply the number of teachers affected.
