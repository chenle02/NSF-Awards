9610373 Funds were requested for the purchase of a digital camera and lens,
frame grabber board and a pentium personal computer. The purpose of this
equipment is to record internal deformations of planar specimens of earthen
materials by means of image analysis. These internal deformations are then
processed using regression analysis techniques to compute strain components. The
equipment will become part of the geotechnical engineering research laboratory
at Northwestern University. The equipment will be used in on-going research of
post-peak response of soils, and to study deformation and fracture propagation
of rock and grouted sands. ***
