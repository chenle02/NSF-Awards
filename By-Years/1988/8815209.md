This award will support Professors Abhay Ashtekar and Lee Smolin of Syracuse
University in a research collaboration with Professor Carlo Rovelli of the
University of Rome. The investigators plan to continue their very fruitful
collaboration on one of the fundamentally important unsolved problems of
physics: the quantization of general relativity. The proposed research involves
further investigation of two new representations for quantum gravity: the self-
dual representation and the loop space representation in which quantum states
are defined by suitable functions on the space of loops on a 3-manifold. The
collaborators have been at the forefront of research in quantum gravity theories
and have made significant progress in the construction of the physical state
space of gravitational fields. This collaboration will allow them to extend
their promising search for solutions to the problems of quantum general
relativity.
