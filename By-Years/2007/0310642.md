This collaborative project funded under DMS-0310642 and DMS-0310354 is a CARGO
full team award made under solicitation
http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02155/nsf02155.htm.

Geodesists and computational geometry specialists use different mathematical
tools for building surfaces from sampled points. One part of this project
(DMS-0310642) encompasses cross-fertilization of tool development along with
merging and extension of the underlying mathematical theories. The mathematical
development will address issues in statistical adjustment theory, meshing and
other computational geometry applications, and modified polyhedral Morse theory.
Another part of the project (DMS-0310354) deals with exposing and equipping
undergraduates to work on such problems by offering courses and summer REU
workshops. The mission is to involve research at all levels, based on the
interplay of fundamental ideas, such as curvature, polyhedral geometry, graphs
on surfaces, and combinatorial topology, eventually leading to advanced topics
such as noise handling in geodetic data, Morse theory, mesh generation of
surfaces, and smoothing.

Using statistical adjustment methods, traditional geodesists fit smooth surfaces
to noisy surface data. Using computational geometry, our computer scientists
have begun developing and will continue to develop efficient algorithms for
finding meshed surfaces that are close to and provably homeomorphic to densely
sampled smooth surfaces. The interplay between differential and discrete
geometry has sparked a renewed interest among mathematicians and theoretical
computer scientists to find algorithms for computing topological invariants and
for examining properties of surface decompositions and of graphs on surfaces.
The research offers challenges to graduate students, undergraduate students, and
research faculty alike.
