In an attempt to increase the thermal conductivity of polymer matrix
composites, a model which includes metal- coated fibers and metal-coated
microspheres, is proposed. To accurately evaluate the thermal conductivity of
this material system, a micro-mechanic model will be developed based on the hot
wire thermal conductivity method. The performance of the model will be assessed
through digital simulation studies by employing the finite element method.
Further evaluation will be performed experimentally by measuring the thermal
conductivities of the material in different directions, using the hot wire
thermal conductivity method.
