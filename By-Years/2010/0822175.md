The Algebra Project in Cambridge, MA is developing and conducting research on
what it describes as the Cohort Model for addressing the mathematics education
of students that perform in the bottom quartile on state and district tests. The
model has the following characteristics: 1) each cohort school commits to four
years of reduced class size of 20 students and a common planning period for the
teachers; 2) cohort students commit to take mathematics classes every day for 90
minutes for four years and to participate in summer institutes; 3) students use
Algebra Project instructional materials for all four years; and 4) teachers
agree to 2-3 weeks of professional development per year and classroom visits by
Algebra Project team members. The predicted outcome is that most students will
remain in the cohort for all four years and that almost all of those who do will
perform well enough on college entrance exams to be admitted and will test out
of remedial mathematics courses.
