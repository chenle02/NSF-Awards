This project is to analyze gamma ray and x-ray data which were obtained on a
long duration balloon flight from McMurdo, Antarctica in December 1990. The data
include gamma rays produced by a solar flare, background radiation (mostly from
aurora) and possibly gamma rays from the supernova, SN1987. The flight was
longer than any prior high altitude flight for a large (approximately 1500 Kg)
payload. It lasted for 9 days and circumnavigated the south pole. The balloon
flight was jointly supported by NSF's Division of Polar Programs and NASA's
Suborbital Program.
