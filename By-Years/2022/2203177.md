This project is co-funded by a collaboration between the Directorate for
Geosciences and Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure to support Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning and open science activities in the
geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Machine learning model will be used in this
project to predict the distributions of five zooplankton species in the western
Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) based on oceanographic properties. The project will
take advantage of a long-term series collected by the Palmer Long-Term
Ecological Research (LTER) program that collects annual data on physics,
chemistry, phytoplankton (or food), zooplankton and predators (seabirds, whales
and seals). By analyzing this dataset and combining it with other data collected
by national and international programs, this project will provide understanding
and prediction of zooplankton distribution and abundance in the wAP. The machine
learning models will be based on environmental properties extracted from remote
sensing images thus providing ecosystem knowledge as it decreases human
footprint in Antarctica. The relationship between species distribution and
habitat are key for distinguishing natural variability from climate impacts on
zooplankton and their predators. This research benefits NSF mission by expanding
fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes as well as
aligning with data and sample reuse strategies in Polar Research. The project
will benefit society by supporting two female early-career scientists, a post-
doctoral fellow and a graduate student. Polar literacy will be promoted through
an existing partnership with Out Of School activities that target Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, expected to reach
120,000 students from under-represented minorities in STEM annually. The project
will also contribute to evaluate the ecosystem in the proposed Marine Protected
Area in the wAP, subject to krill fishery. Results will be made available
publicly through an interactive web application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Principal Investigators propose to address three main questions: 1) Can
geomorphic features, winter preconditioning and summer ocean conditions be used
to predict the austral summer distribution of zooplankton species along the wAP?
2) What are the spatial and temporal patterns in modeled zooplankton species
distribution along the wAP? And 3) What are the patterns of overlap in
zooplankton and predator species? The model will generate functional
relationships between zooplankton distribution and environmental variables and
provide Zooplankton Distribution Models (ZDMs) along the Antarctic Peninsula.
The Palmer LTER database will be combined with the NOAA AMLR data for the
northern wAP, and KRILLBASE, made public by the British Antarctic Surveyâ€™s Polar
Data Center. This project will generate 1) annual environmental spatial layers
on the Palmer LTER resolution grid within the study region, 2) annual species-
specific standardized zooplankton net data from different surveys, 3) annual
species-specific predator sightings on a standardized grid, and 4) ecological
model output. Ecological model output will include annual predictions of
zooplankton species distributions, consisting of 3-dimensional fields (x,y,t)
for the 5 main zooplankton groups, including Antarctic krill, salps and
pteropods. Predictions will be derived from merging in situ survey data with
environmental data, collected in situ or by remote
sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
