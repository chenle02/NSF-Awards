Processes of sexual selection include competition, generally between males, and
mate choice, typically by females. In the latter, discriminating females may
obtain from males 1) direct, material benefits that influence their survival and
fecundity and/or 2) indirect, genetic benefits that are only expressed in the
subsequent generation. Female choice based on genetic benefits requires that
genetic variance for the chosen male character(s), and the female preference,
exist, but the directional selection imposed by female choice should eliminate
such variance. To determine how this paradox may be resolved in natural
populations, the investigator will study mating behavior of the lesser waxmoth,
a species in which males attract females with an ultrasonic advertisement
signal. Previous studies demonstrated substantial genetic variance for the male
signal and suggested that a genetic tradeoff exists between signal
attractiveness and development rate. The current project will use inbred lines
and quantitative genetic techniques to evaluate the extent of this tradeoff and
how it may maintain genetic variance in male
attractiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will contribute to our basic
knowledge of acoustic signaling and perception and how these behaviors are
related to life history and development. Moreover, analyses of the inbred lines
will reveal the genetic relationships between sexual and developmental traits
and how genetic correlation may influence the expression of behavior and its
variation.&lt;br/&gt;
