The project focuses on mathematical research in certain partial differential
equations (PDE) that model phenomena in physics, engineering, materials science,
and economics. The study of PDE arising in models for composite materials, in
particular fiber reinforced materials, is of increasing importance due to
industry's need to design for improved performance. The mathematical research of
the Monge-Amp√©re equation and related equations has particularly significant
applications in differential geometry and optimal mass transport such as, for
example, constructing surfaces with prescribed Gaussian curvature and
reflector/refractor design. The principal investigator (PI) will carry out
research closely related to these topics and will attempt to address some of the
open questions in these areas. He will engage graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers in the work of the project.

The PI will focus his attention on several questions in three main topical
areas. First, he will develop new methods to study elliptic and parabolic
equations with mixed boundary conditions and rough coefficients in nonsmooth
domains by using tools from harmonic analysis and conformal maps, parabolic
equations with nonlocal time derivatives or more generally with nonlocal
derivatives in both space and time, and Kolmogorov equations of ultraparabolic
(or hypoelliptic) type with measurable coefficients. Second, the PI will study
the regularity theory for degenerate fully nonlinear equations, in particular
the m-Hessian equation with optimal power, the degenerate quotient Hessian
equations, and more general types of Hessian equations with elementary symmetric
polynomials. Finally, regarding PDE arising in the study of composite materials,
the PI is particularly interested in composites with Lipschitz inclusions, and
quasilinear or singular/degenerate equations of this type, and will develop new
methods for the analysis of these PDE.
