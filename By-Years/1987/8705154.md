This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support purchase equipment for
wideband channel measurements for wireless indoor communications. Results of
these measurements will be used for developing a statistical model and computer
simulation for the channel. The scope of applications for wireless indoor
communications is wide and it is expected to expand drastically in the future.
Current research activities in this area are motivated by wireless LANs(WLLAN),
wireless PBX systems, and portable phones (1). In the future these applications
will be complemented with wireless communication between mobile robots and other
services unknown at the present time. Wireless indoor local network is expected
to revolutionalize communication between various items of equipment in
manufacturing floors, offices, research labs, hospitals, warehouses, and
shopping areas. This grant is funded with additional support from the
Instrumentation, Sensing and Measurement Program in ECSE and the Automation and
Systems Integration Program in DMCE.
