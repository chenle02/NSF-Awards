This award provides support to continue a successful REU Site at the Demographic
Research Laboratory, Western Washington University. Ten undergraduates,
recruited nationwide, will participate in "Applied Demographic Research on
Migratioon" for two months in the Summer, 1992. These students, supervised by a
project team of professional demographers, will focus their research efforts on
the study of migration profiles and analytical models. A variety of data files,
including the 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample and the County to County
Migration Flow file, 1990 STF's and the Cumulative General Social Survey will
serve as primary data sources for the research experiences for undergraduates.
The project provides undergraduates the opportunity to become involved in the
research process and to expand their research-related competencies through an
intensive, two-month research project.
