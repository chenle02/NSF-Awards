This award partially supports the the participation of approximately 90
students, postdocs, and early-career participants without grant support in the
31st Annual Workshop on Recent Developments in Electronic Structure Theory,
which will take place at Urbana, Illinois, in May 2019. The workshop will bring
together approximately 150 researchers from academia, industry, and national
laboratories. The workshop allows researchers in this field to network and share
new developments in simulation techniques for molecules, liquids, solids, and
nanomaterials. The techniques are used broadly in physics, materials science,
and in chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
