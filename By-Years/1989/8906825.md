Beetles of the Family Staphylinidae comprise one of the most diverse insect
families known. Among the staphylinids, members of the genus Platydracus are
large and conspicuous predators on fly larvae and a variety of forest-dwelling
invertebrates. As such, they play an important role in the ecology of tropical
forests. Dr. Alfred Newton proposes completion of a taxonomic monograph of the
New World representatives of the genus, including description of 70 new species
and production of an identification key. Evolutionary relationships will be
reconstructed using cladistic analysis, and the geographic distribution of
species will be compared to their evolutionary relatedness. The proposed
monograph will find a wide and keenly interested audience among forest
ecologists, systematic and economic entomologists, biogeographers, and
evolutionary biologists. Specifically, ecologists will use the monograph as an
identification guide in their studies of community structure; entomologists may
want to pursue possible natural control mechanisms within the genus,
biogeographers will use the group as a further test of the Pleistocene refugium
hypothesis, and evolutionary biologists will use the monograph as a platform on
which to study the evolution of ecological specializations.
