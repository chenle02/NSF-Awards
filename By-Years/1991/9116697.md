A major goal of the National Science Foundation is to serve as a catalyst in
helping to increase the number of minority Ph.D.s in the sciences. In order to
accomplish this goal, NSF must first become better informed of the barriers that
beset minority scientists already in the pipeline. Attendance at the workshop
will be open to everyone. The purpose of this workshop is to provide a framework
that can serve as an operating model at the program level. The eleven
participants are already role models at their respective institutions and will
share their experiences with the scientific community. They are also principal
investigators of NSF research awards. The charge to them is to suggest a
feasible plan that will be available to everyone.//
