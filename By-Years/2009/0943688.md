This project will focus on using the already deployed resources of OSG sites to
support the needs of the growing community of hight throughput computing (HTPC)
users in using parallel codes and tools. Special attention will be devoted to
HTPC applications with at most 8 processes that can run on a single multi-core
node. Interfaces to local batch system will be developed and deployed to support
the scheduling of single-core and multi-core applications. The project will
provide necessary user support in configuring, managing and using these
resources.
