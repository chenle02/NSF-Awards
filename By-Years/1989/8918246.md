One of the goals of modern evolutionary biology is to understand the forces
that determine the distribution and maintenance of genetic variation in natural
populations. Two of the primary evolutionary forces are 1) genetic drift, the
change in gene frequency due to random processes associated with small
population size, and 2) natural selection, the differential survival and
reproduction of individuals. The purpose of the proposed research is to quantify
the relative importance of these forces in populations of the desert plant,
Linanthus parryae. This species flowers after winter rains, and individuals
produce either white or blue flowers. Previous research by Dr. Sewall Wright,
one of the founders of the field of population genetics, suggested that the
population size of this species was quite small, and that the two flower colors
were maintained in natural populations by random genetic drift. The alternative
hypothesis is that different colored plants are adapted to different local
conditions, perhaps due to contrasting abilities to attract pollinators and
produce seed. Because flower color is an inherited trait, this selective process
will cause a change in the genetic make-up of the population. The proposed
research will identify how random events and selective differences between
individuals can contribute to evolutionary changes in plant populations. Such
information is vital to our understanding of biological diversity.
