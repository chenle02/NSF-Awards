This award is for partial support of a five-day workshop on Groupoids in
operator algebras and noncommutative geometry" to be held at the Institut Henri
Poincare from February 26 to March 2, 2007. The organizers are Jean Renault,
Jean-Louis Tu, and Ping Xu. It is part of the IHPtrimester on Groupoids and
stacks in Physics and Geometry" organized by Kai Behrend, Jean Renault, Jean-
Louis Tu, and Ping Xu. Groupoids and groupoid C*-algebras have played a central
role in the study of noncommutative geometry, including foliation theory,
measured equivalence relations, twisted K-theory, noncommutative dynamical
systems and index theory. The workshop aims to promote interaction between
mathematicians, physicists, and groups working on related areas from different
aspects. It brings together leading experts and young researchers in these
subjects to address the important questions.
