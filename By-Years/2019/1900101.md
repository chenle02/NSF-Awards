The three-dimensional hyperbolic space can be modeled by the upper half space of
the three-dimensional Euclidean space, where the shortest path between two
points is either along a vertical line or a vertical semi-circle. The boundary
of this space is the plane together with the point at infinity. Most often the
trajectory of a collection of symmetries in this space accumulates on a fractal
on the plane, the study of which is related to dynamics of flows on the
hyperbolic manifold, given by the quotient of the hyperbolic three space by the
symmetry group. One beautiful example of such fractals is the Apollonian gasket
which is constructed by a theorem proven by the ancient Greek geometer
Apollonius. Fractals are abundant in nature as can be seen in the coastlines,
ocean waves, Romanesco cauliflowers, etc. A drop of oil in soy sauce creates a
circle packing akin to the Apollonian gasket. This project is expected to be of
value in interpreting the structure of fractals arising in
nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas most of hyperbolic three manifolds have
infinite volume, the dynamical rigidity properties of hyperbolic manifolds have
been investigated mostly for finite volume cases. The project concerns with
dynamics on infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds, which turn out to be quite a
rich theory and has several deep and striking applications. This project
involves new interactions between hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian groups, ergodic
theory and number theory. Investigating this new territory requires many new
ideas both from geometry and dynamics and opens up new interactions between
these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
