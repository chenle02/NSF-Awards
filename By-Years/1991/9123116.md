This Doctoral Dissertation study uses interest group theory, especially the
relationships between the state and functional groups in society, to explain how
natural resource policies are made in the developing world. Specifically, the
research posits that the state, being at the pinnacle of a system of limited and
structured, albeit meaningful, public invlovement, seeks that type of bargaining
with interest groups within society which furthers its own power and endurance.
This conceptualization puts developing world conservation programs into a
broader political context, and links an understanding of environmental policies
to an understanding of the broader political power relationships within the
polity. The project test these and related propositions about African
environmental policymaking, using Zimbabwe's elephant conservation regime as a
case study. Using survey research, interviews, and contextual data, this
research empirically probes the nature of wildlife conservation policymaking in
Zimbabwe, with a firm theoretical eye toward generalization about conservation
policy regimes in the developing world, especially the role of group-state
bargaining in policymaking. The research will be conducted under the auspices of
the University of Zimbabwe's Centre for Applied Social Sciences (CASS), which
has been executing research on the human dimensions of wildlife conservation for
over three years.
