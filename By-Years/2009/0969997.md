Control of complex systems at the atomic scale is at the frontier of nano-
technology. At this scale, the effects of quantum mechanics allow for a
fundamentally new generation of information processing devises such as quantum-
computers, communication systems, and precise sensors. These effects will be
studied in a joint theoretical-experimental project involving ultra-cold vapors
of approximately 1,000,000 cesium atoms trapped and probed by laser light. This
collection of atoms act as a single unit analogous to a spinning top. The
collective spin will be controlled with lasers and magnetic fields in order to
create new quantum states that can form the foundation for encoding and
communicating information at the quantum level.

The research will contribute to the knowledge base of quantum information
science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly
interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the
project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The
project will become a cornerstone of the newly-formed Center for Quantum
Information and Control. Video conferencing will be used to allow participation
of CQuIC partners in the regular activities of CQuIC, including weekly group
meetings and research seminars, and strengthen the connections between junior
and senior members through an annual research retreat. All students and senior
personnel will actively participate in the Southwest Quantum Information
Technology (SQuInT) network, including the annual workshop. During its 11-year
history SQuInT has provided a vibrant avenue for exchange of ideas and results
in QIS, with particular emphasis given to PhD students, postdocs, and new
researchers in the field.
