This project will continue the operation of the cosmic ray neutron detectors
that are already located at McMurdo and South Pole, Antarctica. It is expected
that this project will continue through the next solar maximum. The scientific
goals of the project are: 1) To elucidate the nature of long-term variations and
North-South asymmetries of solar activity. 2) To investigate the acceleration,
coronal transport and interplanetary transport of energetic solar particles. 3)
To better understand the three-dimensional structure of interplanetary magnetic
turbulence. 4) To reach an improved understanding of the solar modulation of
galactic cosmic rays.
