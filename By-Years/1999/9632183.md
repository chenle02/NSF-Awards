The proposal is a request for support of a symposium "International Radiation
Symposium: Current Problems in Atmospheric Radiation". The symposium will
provide a forum for multidisciplinary discussion of remote sensing and
physical/natural science studies related to atmospheric radiation. Ten science-
discussion sessions are planned with participation from both international and
US scientists expected. An emphasis of the symposium will be discussiojn of
phenomena and processes relevant to high-latitude research. The symposium will
bring together a large number of scientists studying a problem that is very
important to the development of an upcoming research program, Surface Heat
Budget of the Arctic Ocean.
