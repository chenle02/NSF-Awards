This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will provide funding to participate
in the search for neutrino-less double beta decay in 136-Xe with the EXO-200
experiment, currently being installed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)
in Carlsbad, NM. Observation of the neutrino-less double beta decay process
would imply that neutrinos are Majorana particles; this would have a profound
impact on our understanding of the nature of fundamental particles and their
pattern of masses as well as on our understanding of the structure and evolution
of the early universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXO-200 will be the first
operational experiment with greater than 100 kg of enriched isotope and will
probe the absolute scale of neutrino masses down to 0.3 eV. The group will
participate in installation, commissioning, operation and data analysis of
EXO-200, with emphasis on the avalanche photodiode's performance, neutron-
related backgrounds and the cosmic ray veto counters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of the program includes ample opportunity for undergraduate and
graduate students. They will partner with a local collaborative to introduce the
excitement and scientific merit of underground science to teachers of middle and
high school science students. They will also bring about broad science
understanding in south-eastern New Mexico.
