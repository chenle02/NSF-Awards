This project will provide support for a group travel grant to the Second World
Congress to be held August 13-18, 1990 in Uppsala, Sweden. The World Congress is
jointly sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the Bernoulli
Society. The scientific content of the conference covers a wide range of topics
in mathematical statistics, including graphical structures/expert systems,
inverse problems, percolation, image analysis, population dynamics and branching
processes, asymptotic methods in statistics, likelihood inference, stochastic
calculus, environmental monitoring, counting processes and survival analysis,
combinatorial probability, experimental design and quality improvement, and many
others. Opportunities will be provided for participants to learn about the
latest developments in these areas and to interact with each other in informal
spontaneous sessions.
