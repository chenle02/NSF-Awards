Wu 9420625 The genetic basis of hybrid sterility between Drosophila simulans and
Drosophila mauritiana has been shown by this laboratory to be clusters of
strongly interacting loci which jointly lead to male sterility. One of the
clusters is between the f and Bx marker, occupying about 5% of the X chromosome.
The objective of this proposal is to clone and characterize a hybrid sterility
gene, Ods, which is an important component of that cluster. After cloning and
characterizing the gene, it will be used to test the various evolutionary
hypotheses at the molecular level. Specifically, we will test for the most
significant feature of Haldane's rule, the very rapid evolution of hybrid male
sterility. %%% The genetic basis of speciation and species differences is
undoubtedly one of the central questions in evolutionary biology. It is crucial
to clone and characterize a gene which can be identified as having a role in
functional divergence between species in order to understand the molecular basis
of speciation. Such a cloned gene will make it possible to experimentally test
the various contending evolutionary hypotheses at the molecular level. ***
