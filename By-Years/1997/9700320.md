Solid freeform fabrication (SFF) methodologies allow arbitrarily complex shapes
to be automatically built in a layered fashion directly from Computer Aided
Design models. In the development of SFF techniques for tooling manufacture, the
creation of parts with a high level of geometric accuracy is important. This
research focuses on predicting, measuring, and minimizing tolerance loss in
parts produced by thermal deposition based SFF processes. With thermal
deposition, tolerance losses in SFF are caused by residual stress, taking the
form of large-scale part warping or dimensional changes. The ability to predict
and control tolerance loss is critical for manufacturing intricate assemblies
with interconnecting parts such as injection mold tooling. Experiments and solid
mechanics analyses are proposed to measure and predict tolerance loss in simple
geometries and for fully complex three-dimensional parts. Results will be
demonstrated by producing complex shaped, multi-material injection mold tooling.
This research is central to the understanding of the fundamental issues which
control part tolerance loss. It may lead to useful mathematical models for
predicting part tolerance loss as a function of part geometry. The model-based
test results could provide a good indication of the best means for maintaining
part tolerance. The research is interdisciplinary in nature and it has a strong
tie with industry.
