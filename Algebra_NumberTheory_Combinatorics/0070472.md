The investigator studies the module theory of the algebra of invariant
differential operators on a simple complex Lie algebra, in particular, he
studies finite dimensional modules. He is currently considering the case of rank
two Lie algebras, with success in the case of the Lie algebra of type A. The
investigator and a colleague study commuting involutions on reductive algebraic
groups, and the corresponding double coset spaces by the fixed groups of the
involutions. We determine the structure of the double coset spaces, and their
relations to quotient spaces of special kinds of split tori by appropriate Weyl
groups.

Symmetry groups, such as the collection of all rotations of a sphere, play a
fundamental role in mathematics and physics. Understanding these groups and the
ways they can act is basic to our knowledge of the physical and mathematical
universes. Research on symmetry groups has been very active and productive for
the last 75 years. The investigator and colleagues study these symmetry groups,
related mathematical objects, and the different ways they can act and interact.
