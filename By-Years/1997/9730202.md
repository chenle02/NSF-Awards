This award to the University of Illinois at Chicago, (UIC) entitled"EuroLink:
High Performance International Internet Services between Research and Education
Institutions in the United States and Europe/Israel" provides support for a High
Performance International Internet Services connection between the advanced
networks of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden),
France, Netherlands, Israel and NSF's very high-performance Backbone Network
Services (vBNS). The overall consortium (European networks plus UIC) is called
EuroLink. EuroLink proposed to provide four links, each nominally at 45 Mbps,
between the European NRNs and the vBNS via the NSF-funded international
connection point for high-performance networks, STAR TAP , in Chicago. It is
anticipated that other European countries may join EuroLink in the future.
Round-the-clock operational support will be provided under subcontract to the
Indiana University Network Operations Center (NOC). The Indiana NOC also serves
under a companion HPIIS award to TransPAC for Asia-Pacific collaborations, and
it also provides operational support to the Internet2/Abilene network.
