The investigators will analyze observational time-series near-infrared data of
variable stars in order to reduce uncertainties in the Hubble constant, which is
used to determine the age of the universe. They will focus on variable stars
that belong to eclipsing binaries in nearby galaxies and us stellar atmosphere
models, in order to calculate accurate stellar radii. The calculated stellar
radii and measured periods and magnitudes will be used to derive distances that
will be incorporated in the extragalactic "cosmic distance ladder," from which
an improved value of the Hubble constant can be derived. This work will have
broader impacts in that it involve the participation of a graduate student from
an underrepresented group, and the PI will give bilingual talks to the public
and maintain a public website in Spanish.
