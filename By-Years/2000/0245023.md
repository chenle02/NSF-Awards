This research will explore the properties of ultracold plasmas and Rydberg
gases. Plasma is by far the most common form of matter in the universe, but is
usually quite hot, even when created in the laboratory. The researchers of this
project developed a technique that starts with laser-cooled atoms to produce
ultracold plasmas, with temperatures as low as a few K. This work will study the
properties of expanding ultracold plasmas. The researchers will investigate how
to excite and probe collective excitations of the plasma, such as ion acoustic
waves. They will measure the equilibration time for the electrons in the plasma,
which is critical in determining the dynamics of the system. They will adapt
methods from plasma physics to confine the plasma, which will allow longer
periods of time for investigations, as well as change the dynamics related to
the expansion process. On the broader impact, a greater understanding of these
systems may have relevance for atomic processes in plasmas, astrophysical
processes occurring in the interior of planets and stars, as well as for
inertial confinement fusion.
