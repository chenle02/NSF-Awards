9418769 Grosjean This proposal supports a two-year postdoctoral fellowship for
Dr. David Grosjean at NEC Corporation at Tsukuba and at the Research Center for
Utra-High Voltage Electron Microscopy at Osaka University. Project funding will
enable Dr. Grosjean to spend two years in Japan, resident at NEC, in order to
conduct research on microelectronics with Dr. Hidekazu Okabayashi and other
Japanese electrical engineers. The PI has proposed to work on the very
challenging and technologically important problem of the electromigration of
aluminum atoms at high electric current density in submicron aluminum lines. He
will also gain knowledge of metal film preparation and electrical
characterization and stressing equipment. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Grosjean
will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and
equipment at NEC Corporation and Osaka University. Therefore, this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
