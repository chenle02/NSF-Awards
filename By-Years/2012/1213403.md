With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program, Professor Robert M.
Waymouth of Stanford University will develop electrocatalysts for
electrodehydrogenation of alcohols. Specific challenges for investigation are
electrooxidation of alcohols at low overpotentials to maximize the energy
efficiency of anode electrooxidation catalysts. A central hypothesis guiding
this program is that transition metal catalysts active for the reversible
transfer hydrogenation of ketones with alcohols constitute promising candidates
for alcohol electrodehydrogenation catalysts. Catalysts which mediate reversible
transfer hydrogenation reactions operate at the reversible potential for alcohol
oxidation; a grand challenge is to exploit this promising reactivity to develop
new electrocatalysts for reversible electrooxidation. Mechanistic concepts that
have been developed for chemical transfer hydrogenation catalysis will be used
to guide the research and to devise new strategies to facilitate the proton and
electron transfers that are critical to energy-efficient electrooxidation
catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The energy-efficient conversion of chemical
fuels into useful forms of energy is critical to our energy future. This work
will provide new insights on strategies for extracting electrons from chemical
fuels and the fundamental science that underlies anode electrocatalysts for fuel
cells that convert chemical energy into electricity. Discoveries from this
research will illuminate key principles in mediating the energy efficient
conversion of chemical energy into useful forms of electrical energy. These new
insights will not only inform the quest for more efficient fuel cell catalysts,
but are central to all technologies that mediate the interconversion of
electrical energy and chemical energy. In addition, the PI will contribute to
develop a new generation of scientists with expertise in this economically
relevant field.
