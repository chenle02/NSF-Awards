The present research project aims at investigating the properties of control,
optimization, stability and long-time behavior of interactive structures, which
are mathematically modeled by inhomogeneous systems of strongly coupled partial
differential equations with an interface. Both the single partial differential
equations describing each a constitutive component of the overall structure as
well as the coupling between them, may be linear or non-linear, dispersive, and
oscillatory.

<br><br> Investigation will be carried out initially on four canonical
motivating classes of interactive structures. They are intended to serve as
benchmark cases for the general topic of physically significant interactive and
non-trivially coupled Partial Differential Equations. They are: (1) the noise
reduction problem in a structural acoustic chamber, by use of 'smart
material/structure' technology; (2) flutter control of a 2-dimensional wing
immersed in a subsonic or supersonic 3-dimensional gas flow in aeroelasticity;
(3) plasma heating and plasma confinement in the control of magnetohydrodynamics
equations; (4) asymptotic suppression of turbulence in viscous incompressible
fluid dynamics.
