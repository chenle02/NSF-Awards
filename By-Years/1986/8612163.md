This is a study of superlattice device behavior using a supercomputer. A New set
of semiconductor equations which was proposed by the author will be used to
investigate the effects of velocity overshoot, finite intracollision duration,
boundary conditions, tunneling, energy quantization and hot electrons on the
current transport in these devices. The high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)
will be analyzed first and the results will be compared with those of other
devices such as HBT's, THETA's, devices with different composition of A1, and
devices using different materials other than GaAs.
