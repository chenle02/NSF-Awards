This project aims to develop a new framework for using neural networks and
fundamental process knowledge to model, optimize and control dynamic
biotechnology processes. This research group has recently proposed parameter
function neural networks as an effective means of using both fundamental process
knowledge and neural networks to model dynamic processes. They use the parameter
function concept to model the industrially important process of the production
of hemoglobin though induced recombinant bacteria using experimental data
available from Baxter Hemoglobin Therapeutics. In general, this project
investigates the feasibility of using the parameter function neural network
modeling technique to successfully model a complex industrial biotechnology
fermentation and find new improved operational strategies for that process. The
anticipated results of this project may have widespread impact on modeling and
optimization of industrial processes, especially the biotechnology processes of
fed-batch bioreactors.
