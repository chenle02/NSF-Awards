&lt;br/&gt;This proposal intends to tackle several of the central problems
facing the intersection of String theory, Cosmology and Field Theory. The group
will apply new effective field theory and model-building techniques and study
the phenomenology of these new ideas.. Many of the investigations center around
theories with extra dimensions and involve relating String theory to cosmology.
Heavy Quark effective theories will be used to understand the phenomenology of D
and B mesons and understand physics beyond the standard model. Emphasis will be
on disentangling new physics at the TeV scale and how it relates to various
generalizations of the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;The questions this proposal
hopes to address are what are the robust signals connected with different
theoretical ideas? What windows of opportunities exist for the different
experiments? How can theoretical scenarios be best distinguished?&lt;br/&gt;
