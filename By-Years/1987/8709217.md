The cyclical behavior of real wages has traditionally been regarded as an
important issue for understanding business cycles. A long history of empirical
research on this topic, however, has produced a bewildering array of conflicting
evidence. Recently this has led many macroeconomists to formulate theoretical
models that imply no cyclical pattern in real wages. Numerous fragments of
evidence, however, suggest that the seemingly non-cyclical behavior of aggregate
real wages on average masks regular underlying patterns which vary according to
sector and whether the time period is dominated by real or nominal shocks. The
purpose of this project is to: (a) systematically catalog the real wage
implications of alternative theories, with special attention to multi-sector
models; (b) conduct new empirical analyses including detailed investigations of
how real wage patterns vary with time period, union status, and several relevant
industry groupings; (c) treat composition biases inherent in aggregate time
series data through careful use of longitudinal microdata from the Michigan
Panel Study of Income Dynamics. This research is important because it will
provide a better understanding of the behavior of real wages over the business
cycle.
