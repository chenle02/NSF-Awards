DAVIES This research is centered on the use of rhodium(II) catalysts with D2
symmetry for enantioselective cyclopropanation with vinylcarbenoids. The work
will evaluate a range of potential catalysts and will be applied to the
synthesis of chiral cyclopropane amino acids, nucleoside derivatives and a new
class of sesquiterpenes called tremulanes. The factors leading to chiral
induction by rhodium(II) carboxylates will also be elucidated.With this award,
the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Huw M. L. Davies
of the Department of Chemistry at wake Forest University. Professor Davies will
focus his work on the use of rhodium(II) catalysts to achieve the the synthesis
of optically active cyclopropane derivatives.
