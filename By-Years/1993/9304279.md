9304279 Griess This award supports research aimed at developing a theory which
will unite all the sporadic simple groups by means of infinite dimensional
groups. Specifically, the principal investigator will investigator the general
structure of infinite dimensional groups associated to lattices. He will study
finite structures associated to Lie groups and develop a general theory of
automorphism groups of a class of nilpotence class 2 groups. He will further
classify finite subgroups of finite dimensional simple Lie groups by data such
as labeled Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The principal investigator will also work on
a new version of a moonshine module. A group is an algebraic structure with a
single operation. It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics
and chemistry. The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are finite
simple groups. One of the major results in mathematics of the past decade is the
classification of the finite simple groups, the proof of which would require
10,000 to 15,000 journal pages. This research is aimed at using this
classification in the study of arbitrary finite groups. ***
