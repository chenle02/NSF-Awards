9501824 Hess In this CAREER award, dynamic models of structural assemblies using
threaded fasteners are developed. These models accommodate the interaction of
friction and vibration as well as the dynamic constraints and nonlinearities
inherent to threaded components. The dynamic models of these structural
assemblies, such as aircraft structures and orthopedic fixations, lead to design
criteria which minimize maintenance and structural failure due to vibration-
induced fastener loosening. The criteria are tested through extensive
experiments with aircraft assemblies and orthopedic fixation assemblies. The
educational program complements and integrates research in the areas of
nonlinear vibrations and tribology with industrial partnerships at both the
undergraduate and the graduate levels.***
