9404366 Fu The scope of research is concerned with the methods of characteristic
cycles to analyse the geometric structures of classes of singular spaces. The
techniques arise from complex geometry and representation theory. Another
component of the research involves curvature measures of singular metrics in
Riemannian geometry. The research has potential applications to other branches
of mathematics including algebraic geometry, number theory and may have
applications to mathematical physics. ***
