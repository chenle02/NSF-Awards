Previous work by Ken Kodama has investigated changes in the magnetic properties
of sediments subjected to various degrees of compaction. Of special interest has
been the discovery that the paleolatitude signature recorded at the time of
gentle settling on the seafloor becomes degraded during subsequent compaction.
In the present study, Kodama will conduct investigations on the microscopic
scale to gain an understanding of how grain interaction and reorientation
contributes to this change. Controlled mixtures of magnetite- bearing clays will
be subjected to hydraulic loading to imitate burial, and relationships between
clay fabric, magnetite particle alignment, and degree of sediment compaction
will be examined with electron microscopy and X-ray techniques.
