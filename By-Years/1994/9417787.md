9417787 Anderson The aims of the proposed research are: (1) to develop and test
a novel approach to assess the pre-eruptive gas content (especially CO2) of
basaltic magmas through analysis of glass inclusions in phenocrysts and scoria
glasses; (2) to apply the approach to Kilauean picrites and differentiated lavas
in order to constrain the bulk CO2 contents of parental magmas, and to quantify
gas loss during magma storage, transport, and eruption. This approach will allow
estimation of pre-eruptive gas contents and bulk CO2 in many magmas, including
ones for which gas monitoring data is non-existent. Reliable estimates of pre-
eruptive magmatic gas would be conceptually important for understanding magma
dynamics, volcano evolution, relations between volcanoes and plutons, and
volcanic emissions relevant to climate change and mass extinctions.
