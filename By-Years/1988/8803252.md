This work investigates the use of object-oriented technologies for the modeling
and management of engineering and computer aided design and computer aided
manufacturing data. Four types of interface tools will be investigated in this
work: (1) high-level query languages for searching engineering object-oriented
databases; (2) application program interfaces to engineering object-oriented
database systems; (3) higher-level user interface management systems for
engineering applications using object-oriented database technology to manage the
interface and provide a repository for application data; and (4) parallel
processing tools for improving performance of data management and to support
efficient interfaces to object-oriented database systems for engineering
applications.
