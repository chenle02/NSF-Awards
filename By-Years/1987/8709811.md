The research funded by this proposal extends research under a previous NSF
grant. The research combines empirical case research with modeling methods to
develop (1) a behavioral multi-attribute understanding of queues, (2) new
performance measures for queueing applications that incorporate the behavioral
attributes, and (3) develop and test a new class of management science queueing
models. The working laboratories for the research include a retail branch of the
U.S. Postal Service, a major retail bank and a national department store chain.
The longer range outcome of this research include new directions for research on
queueing theory and a prescriptive methodology for very significant productivity
improvements in congested service systems that would increase customers' utility
of the queueing experience at costs for less than required to add servers or
technology to speed service.
