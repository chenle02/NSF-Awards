This project involves the study of the solubility of gases such as nitrogen,
methane, and ethane in water and is related to a DOE-supported study using
mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons. This supercomputer project permits use of the
Cornell PSF for medeling of these systems at pressures up to 15,000 psi.
Computer simulation is being used in this award of service units to permit the
search for better understanding of the project experimental data in terms of the
underlying intermolecular forces.
