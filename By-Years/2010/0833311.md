In the Phoenix metropolitan area, high-need schools often experience on-going
vacancies in the teaching staff and a high turnover rate of qualified teachers.
This project attempts to identify and support up to 60 qualified secondary
science teachers who will persist in high-need environments. Using different
methods of recruitment, in conjunction with a marketing plan, science students
are being identified and recruited to participate in undergraduate or post-
baccalaureate programs that have extensive field experiences with diverse
students, strong content knowledge requirements, and on-going opportunities to
build their understanding of science as inquiry instruction. While students are
completing their initial certification course work, field placements are being
arranged in high need settings that consist of students who are Native American,
Latina/o, or African American. Upon graduation, STARR Noyce teachers participate
in science-focused induction programs, which specifically support their use of
science as inquiry in diverse classrooms, their development as science teachers,
and their socialization into the school community.&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the
dissemination of these findings is expected to direct future recruitment
endeavors in this area.
