The National Science Foundation-owned research vessel R/V Oceanus has been
successfully operated by Oregon State University (OSU) since 2012. This award
represents year-1 of a five ?year renewal cooperative agreement. The vessel has
sailed throughout the Pacific Basin in support of a wide variety of peer-
reviewed projects for NSF, as well as the Office of Naval Research, and other
Federal and State agencies. Oceanus supported much of this work due to the
vessels operational versatility, economic efficiency and the ability to work
both in the near shore environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seagoing research
planned for 2018 is expected to cover a wide range of disciplines. Schedules
cruise will scientists understand the hydrographic parameters of the oceans as
well as various chemical processes associated with marine sediments and oxygen
minimum zones (OMZ). Other studies will focus on chemistry, inner shelf
dynamics, and other physical characteristics that should ultimately increase the
body of knowledge around such varied topics as benthic infauna, animal
physiology, and underwater sound propagation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 181
planned operating days on the CY 2018 schedule, the ship will work from the Gulf
of Mexico, the Bering Sea and the West Pacific Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
