A numerical modeling study of short internal waves and their approach to
dissipation (through breaking) and mixing in the presence of longer waves is
proposed. Important processes, which will be studied, include: refraction by
steady shear, refraction by the vertical divergence of the background flows,
interactions amongst short waves, phase-group interactions, ray
convergence/divergence, and short-wave induced mean flows. The PIs will develop
a variety of different numerical codes to attack these problems. The level of
intensity with which they approach each problem will be adaptive and depend upon
ongoing developments within their research program.
