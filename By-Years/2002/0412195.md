The CAARI 2004: 18th International Conference on the Application of Accelerators
in Research and Industry will take place October 10-15, 2004 in Fort Worth,
Texas. This conference is the largest accelerator application conference in the
world. During the conference nuclear physics principles and techniques are shown
to have a wide variety of applications in solving modern problems. In the
medical industry these include the use of accelerators in radiation therapy and
the production of nuclear isotopes for Positron Emission Tomography, which by
any measure is one of the best medical scanning techniques. During the
conference there is also a symposium on Ion Implantation. Ion Implantation is a
technique for using accelerators to implant ions into silicon to produce chips
for the semiconductor industry. Ion implanted chips are used in most household
electronics and these products represent a 50 billion dollar a year market.

Approximately 800 participants from 50 countries will attend CAARI 2004.
