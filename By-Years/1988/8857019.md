This work involves investigation into several problems of dynamic security
assessment for large-scale electric power systems. The emphasis is on the
problem of voltage instabilities and proposes to develop a probabilistic
security measure for this problem. Along with this is an investigation into the
nature of the regions of attraction of equilibria in models that involve
reactive power flow and voltage effects. Initial investigations have shown that
the regions of attraction and unstable equilibria points are radically different
in models that include voltage dynamics. Of particular interest in this work
will be extensions of any techniques developed to systems that incorporate
controllable high voltage dc links.
