The factors which control the distribution and rate processes of phytoplankton,
bacteria and higher trophic levels in the coastal environment are of particular
importance to the proper characterization and management of our nation's land-
margin systems. Dr. Simenstad and colleagues will study the dynamics and impact
of anthropogenic effects upon the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) in the
Columbia River. The ETM is hypothesized to promote and control microbial
conversion of entrapped organic material and to facilitate the maintenance of
dense populations of primary consumers, which exploit the microbial loop for
food. This well experienced team will undertake a multi-disciplinary effort
focusing on the physics and biology of the system. It is expected that the
effort will provide valuable information about the physical processes which may
ultimately control the retention and recirculation of the biological components
within the estuary.
