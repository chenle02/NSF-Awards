This grant provides support for research which will make use of simultaneous
observations of ultra low frequency (ULF) electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC)
waves by instruments located in the Arctic, the Antarctic and on satellites
orbiting within the Earth's magnetosphere. These pulsations have frequencies of
between 0.1 and 5 Hz. The ground-based instruments are (or were) in Sondre
Stromfjord, Greenland, the Finnish magnetometer chain, and the Antarctic
stations, Siple, South Pole, McMurdo, Casey, Mawson and MacQuarie Island. The
satellites to be used are the AMPTE (Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer
Explorers/CCE (Charge- Composition Explorer) and Viking (Swedish). The eventual
goal of this correlative study is to enhance the utility of future ground- based
observations to be used as a diagnostic tool to infer magnetospheric processes
in the EMIC source region.
