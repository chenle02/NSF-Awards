9732434&lt;br/&gt;Conlon&lt;br/&gt;This award will support Michael ConlonI and
two graduate students from Creighton University in cooperative research with
Suzanne Holmgren and J÷rgen Jensen of the Department of Zoophysiology at the
University of G÷teborg, Sweden. The research will identify an antagonist to the
peptide bradykinin, which is produced in teleost fish such as the rainbow trout
and Atlantic cod. The results will shed light on the evolution of the peptide
system, and will also further understanding of the action of pharmacological
substances associated with bradykinin effects in mammalian systems.&lt;br/&gt;
