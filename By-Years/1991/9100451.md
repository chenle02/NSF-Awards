The Graduate School of Oceanography at University of Rhode Island will receive
support for shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel
ENDEAVOR, a 177-foot research vessel that is owned by the NSF and operated by
the University. A significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in recent
years and again in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The
Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea component and an
ashore component. The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific
personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; main- tenance, repair, and
calibration of scientific instru- mentation; instruction and supervision of deck
operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going
scientific parties. On shore activities include the mainten- ance, repair, and
calibration of shared use seagoing equip- ment and assisting scientific
personnel in preparing for field work on the vessel. Shipboard technicians
funded by this award have broad responsibilities for providing the coordination
and assistance needed for the successful completion of research projects at sea.
The level of activity and amount of support are closely related to the size and
capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit and capability.
