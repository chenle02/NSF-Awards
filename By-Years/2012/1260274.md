Funds support the acquisition of a new gas chromatograph to be used in
paleoceanography and paleoclimate research at Brown University, specifically in
the application of alkenone paleothermometry to understanding the ocean's role
in climate change on timescales that range from tens to millions of years and
from regional to global scales. Existing equipment in the laboratory has played
a central role in high profile research and in training a large number of young
scientists, but it has reached the end of its serviceable life and must be
replaced. The more modern capabilities of the new instrument will also enable to
laboratory to expand its toolbox to include a wider array of biomarker-based
proxies for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts include technical training for graduate and undergraduate students, both
at Brown and from collaborating institutions, which further supports student
research opportunities. The lead investigator also maintains an active outreach
program for high school students and teachers each summer in which biomarker
analysis is a major component. Results of biomarker research are also
disseminated more generally through publications and an active speaking program
to general audiences.
