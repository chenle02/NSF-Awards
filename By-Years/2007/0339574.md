0339574&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will demonstrate the feasibility of a new luminescent oxygen sensor that
can be deployed within aircraft fuel tanks. This sensor takes
&lt;br/&gt;advantage of recent advances in polymeric materials and microchip
lasers to produce an oxygen sensing system that is not degraded by fuels or most
other organic chemicals. This is not simply an overcoat for existing luminescent
probes, but rather a unique new formulation. This sensor will be the first that
can be deployed within the tank to make real-time measurements of the oxygen
concentration while the airplane is in operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
sensor will be capable of measuring oxygen concentrations in chemically harsh
environments such as those encountered in fuel tanks. A direct impact of this on
society will be safer air travel by eliminating, or significantly reducing the
danger of a deadly fuel tank explosion. The key to being able to measure in
these chemically harsh environments is the use of Teflon AF as the matrix
material; like other Teflon materials, Teflon AF is virtually immune to chemical
degradation. This opens the door for development of a whole host of luminescent
sensors that can be deployed in chemically harsh environments including the
measurement of water in fuels and alcohols, and the measurement of carbon
dioxide in chemical processors.
