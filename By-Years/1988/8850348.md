This science teacher development project at North Carolina central University
will provide middle school teachers with updated content concepts, materials and
curriculum development. Twenty-five middle school teachers (grades 5-8, earth
science teachers) will be enrolled in a semester workshop held during the spring
semester of the academic year 1988-89. The ten week program will include
fourteen three hour evening sessions and four day long Saturday field trips. The
workshop will review new concepts, effective ways of incorporating contemporary
issues, the use of computer assisted instruction and the importance of field
experiences in the curriculum. Major areas of study will focus on four basic
units: Introduction to Earth Systems, Atmospheric Systems, Geological System and
Hydrological Systems. A field trip is scheduled for each major unit. The formal
workshops will emphasize laboratory activities which illustrate the four basic
units and can be used, with minimal modifications, in the classroom. During the
follow-up phase participants will work under the direction of the workshop staff
to implement the workshop materials into existing courses. Upon successful
completion of the project, teachers will be awarded six continuing education
units or three hours of graduate credit. This project is important to the
Teacher Enhancement Program since it addresses an area which has been ignored in
our middle school curriculum. it also allows teachers the opportunity to assume
ownership of the curricular materials use in their classrooms.
