This research is to analyze the performance requirements and specifications for
tooling used in the Super Plastic Forming (SPF) process. This will be followed
by investigations of several refractory ceramic materials as potential
candidates for tooling to meet the demands of current SPF process and advanced
SPF for future high temperature metal alloys. Integral heating of the tooling to
perform SPF will also be considered. SPF is finding wide use in the manufacture
of complex shapes for the aerospace applications from aluminum alloys, titanium
alloys and other specialty materials. The identification and development of
superior tooling materials with integral heating for advanced SPF, will be a
considerable benefit to the metal-forming industry.
