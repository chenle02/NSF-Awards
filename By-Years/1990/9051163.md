Mathematics majors are benefiting from a newly instituted capstone experience
that includes real-world modeling projects in actuarial science, dynamical
systems, and statistics. This experience is enhanced by the use of a laboratory
equipped with Macintosh computers running Mathematica, Fortran, and other
appropriate software. The institution will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
