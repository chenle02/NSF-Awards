This RUI award provides support for a research program on collisions of cold,
dense samples of Rydberg atoms. The Rydberg atoms in this environment are
strongly coupled by the dipole interaction. Two novel features define this
environment. First, the atoms move a distance that is significantly less than
their mean separation during the time the collision lasts. Second, the mean
atomic separation is less than the impact parameter, indicating that many-body
effects are important. The interactions of a dense sample of cold Rydberg atoms
are therefore less like those in a "normal" gas, and more like those
characteristic of a diffuse liquid or disordered solid. The term "frozen gas"
has been used to describe this environment. Two major areas of research will be
pursued: 1) Exciton processes in a frozen gas, in which various predictions of
an exciton diffusion model for migration of population away from close atoms
will be investigated and 2) Preliminary investigations of multiphoton
radiatively assisted collisions in the many-body regime. By virtue of being at
an undergraduate institution with a significant number of physics majors, this
research program offers educational preparation for students wishing to continue
on to graduate school or enter the advanced high-tech workforce.
