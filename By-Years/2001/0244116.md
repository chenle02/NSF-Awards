Title: A Unified Approach to Analyze Vibration of Rotating Flexible
Structures&lt;br/&gt;Rotating machines appear everywhere in our daily life. They
could range from high-tech&lt;br/&gt;applications (e.g., jet engines) to
ordinary household appliances (e.g., washing machines). For&lt;br/&gt;the past
decade, rapid technology advances in various industries call for more accurate
vibration&lt;br/&gt;analysis for rotating machines. For example, high-speed,
high-density hard disk drives (HDD)&lt;br/&gt;require accurate geometric design
of rotors and housings to meet stringent vibration specs.&lt;br/&gt;The purpose
of this project is to develop a unified approach to analyze vibration of
rotating&lt;br/&gt;machines with arbitrary geometry, complexity, and axisymmetry
of the rotors and the stators.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research consists of three
parts. The first part is mathematical development of the&lt;br/&gt;unified
approach integrating finite element analysis and gyroscopic effects. The second
part is to&lt;br/&gt;verify the unified formulation experimentally for
axisymmetric and asymmetric rotors. The third&lt;br/&gt;part is to extend the
unified formulation to systems that employ multiple rotating
components,&lt;br/&gt;such as multi-stage turbines and network storage devices
hosting dozens of HDD.&lt;br/&gt;This research is novel and revolutionary,
because it applies to rotating machines with&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary geometry and
complexity. For the society, this research will help many
industries&lt;br/&gt;produce faster and quieter rotating machines with higher
reliability and efficiency. Also, this&lt;br/&gt;research will enhance education
through an informal intern program, an effective technology&lt;br/&gt;transfer
through industrial short courses, active participation of underrepresented
students, and&lt;br/&gt;improved research infrastructure (e.g., disclosure of
software tools, patents, and test facilities).
