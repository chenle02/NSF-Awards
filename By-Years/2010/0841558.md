ATIP has reported on HPC activities for more than a decade and is well known
throughout the Asian S&T community. ATIP has already conducted three China HPC
Workshops. The current proposal is for support for the first ATIP workshop on
HPC in India. As distinct from China, India has an established reputation for
software development, both as an outsourcing site as well as for indigenous
software for large applications. The First ATIP Workshop on HPC in India will
include a significant set of presentations, posters, and panels from a
delegation of Indian academic, research laboratory, industry experts, and
graduate students, addressing topics that include Government Plans, university
Research, Infrastructure, and industrial applications. This component will
include both Indian and international vendors to get their perspectives on the
status of computing in India. Another important component will be a panel in
which panelists and the audience identify topics that are suitable for
collaborative (US-India) research and the mechanisms for developing those
collaborations. A key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique
opportunity for members of the US research community to interact and have direct
discussions with top Indian scientists who will travel to the US to participate.
A specific goal of the Workshop is to motivate the preparation of joint research
proposals with researchers from both US and India. This activity is jointly
funded by CISE/CCF and the Office of International Science and Engineering.
