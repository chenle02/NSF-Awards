This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at making
Photovoltaic (PV) solar electric power more affordable to our nation and to the
world. The technology in this program, represents a new process for the
manufacturing of cadmium Telluride (CdTe) solar cells. In this process the
contact layers of copper-doped tellurium nanoparticles are sprayed on rather
than sputtered, which promises to be a more efficient method of manufacturing.
The successful CdTe solar cell prototype will be designed with input from
potential end-users as a means of increasing the likelihood for
commercialization. It is anticipated that this process will result in solar
cells with superior initial and long-term efficiencies. Such improvements in
performance could result in reduced costs for solar cell manufacturing ($/W),
higher power during operation (kW-h/yr), and an extension of the useful lifetime
- three aspects that will allow solar energy to be more competitive with
existing methods for electric power production.
