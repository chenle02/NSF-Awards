This award is for a pilot project involving two anthropology professors and one
graduate student in Botswana. The project will study the economic and
reproductive strategies of men in a pastoral society; interview mothers about
their perceptions of sex differences in infants to try to explain a dramatic sex
bias in mortality against male infants; and develop a methodology for analyzing
the differences in work effort of men and women, adults and children. This pilot
research is important to help the investigators develop their procedures for a
large scale study of the conflict between biological goals, such as reproductive
success, and culturally defined goals such as maintenance of the patrilineage.
Understanding of how cultural transmission transforms biological motives is
important in understanding how to maintain biological well-being.
