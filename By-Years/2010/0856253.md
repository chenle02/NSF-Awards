This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The main goal of this project is to search for a signature
in the energy-dependent composition of the primary cosmic rays of a transition
from galactic cosmic rays to a higher energy population of particles from extra-
galactic sources. While the primary mission of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory
is to search for high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin by measuring
events in the deep detector induced by neutrinos from below, the dominant signal
in IceCube is due to downward events caused by cosmic-ray interactions in the
atmosphere. By looking for events from below, IceCube uses the Earth as a shield
against this downward background. With its surface component IceTop, IceCube
makes a 3-D air shower array with important potential for studying the downward
cosmic rays. The novel feature of the IceCube/IceTop air-shower array is its
large acceptance for events observed in coincidence. IceTop will use the ratio
of the signal in the deep detectors to the signal on the surface to measure the
relative concentration of different groups of nuclei in the primary cosmic
radiation in an energy range not accessible to direct measurements with
satellites because of the low intensity. The angular dependence of showers
measured by IceTop alone and other features of the data are also sensitive to
primary composition. This gives a complementary sensitivity to composition that
in principle will remove some of the model-dependence inherent in the
simulations used to interpret the data. Continued reliance on postdocs and
students provides a broader impact to this proposed research and firmly grounds
this effort in its educational mission.
