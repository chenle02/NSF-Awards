Coherent Technologies Inc. will develop compact, efficient, robust solid state
lasers operating in the near and mid-infared spectral regions, that provide
multi-watt output power, broad continuous tunability, and room temperature
operation. These lasers will be based on chromium and cobalt-doped zinc
chalcogenide hosts, and will play an essential role in a variety of applications
including remote sensing, spectroscopy and in medical science in both surgical
and dermatological use.
