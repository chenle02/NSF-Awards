Sethna 9404936 The research involves the development of new parallel algorithms
to investigate the physics of disordered magnetic spin systems with very slow
dynamics, and the implementation of those algorithms on the parallel machines at
Cornell's Theory Center. The combination of the elegant algorithm we have
developed and the impressive power of Cornell's parallel computing resources
promises to yield the first numerical answers to some long-standing questions.
