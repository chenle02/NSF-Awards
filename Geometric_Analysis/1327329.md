This grant supports three meetings of the Lehigh-Harvard Conference on Geometry
and Topology with the first one taking place at Lehigh University on May 24-26.
The conference is held at Lehigh University two years out of three, and at
Harvard University every third year.

The conference brings leading researchers of national and international stature
in geometry and topology to discuss their latest work. The conference makes it
possible for the community of geometers and topologists from the region and
around the country to learn the most recent developments, to meet with each
other and to share mathematics. The conference is also dedicated to the
development and training of of graduate students and young faculty in geometry
and topology. An important component of the conference is to attract and help
graduate students and recent Ph.Ds to come from all over the country to learn
and interact with principal speakers and other senior mathematicians; there are
also ample chance for them to present their research results when the conference
is held at Lehigh. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought
and encouraged.
