Theoretical models and DNA sequence analysis will be used to study gene
conversion and other problems in genetics. A particular family of statistical
tests that can detect specific instances of gene conversion as well as cryptic
patterns of gene conversion will be studied. One aim will be to develop
parametric models that would allow gene conversion and point mutation rates to
be jointly estimated from DNA sequence data. A second major goal will be to
apply these techniques to study gene conversion in the Alu family of repeated
sequences, which has about 500,000 repeats in the human genome and constitutes
about 5 per cent of total human DNA. The subfamily structure and relationships
of the Alu repeats will also be studied, both for their own sake and for the
extent to which family heterogeneity may affect statistical tests for gene
conversion. The spontaneous mutation of genetic material is a major contributor
both to evolution and to genetic disease. In many particular cases this
mutation, rather than being purely random, has been shown to be the result of a
conversion or copying process from nearby similar genetic material. The first
part of the proposal will develop tests for detecting a cryptic pattern of gene
conversion that may appear purely random, and to estimate the relative
importance of the two mutational processes at a particular genetic loci. A
significant pattern of gene conversion may imply a similar nearby genetic locus.
Alu sequences are not only interesting for what they can tell about the
evolution and structure of genetic material, they also have been used as tags of
pieces of human DNA that have been cloned into bacterial plasmids or yeast
chromosomes. If nearby Alu sequences show a pattern of gene conversion under
certain circumstances, this can help to piece together these clones in the
construction of the human genomic map.
