This is a proposal for a workshop that will focus on empirical research related
to the representation and participation of women, minorities and persons with
disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together a broad array of researchers whose
work informs a Science of Broadening Participation. Knowledge that is derived
from a Science of Broadening Participation can further our understanding of what
does and does not work to increase the scientific talent pool. A Science of
Broadening Participation would employ a variety of theoretical and
methodological approaches to answer research questions related to issues of
access, opportunity and inclusion in STEM fields. Fundamentally, it would
address important questions that deal with the inequitable distribution of
educational and economic opportunities, and demonstrate the ways in which this
inequity impacts the achievement of women and underrepresented minorities. The
Workshop will include a small group of 25-30 distinguished scientists working in
the science of broadening participation across the fields represented within the
Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences as well as a few scientists from
other areas engaged in the work of broadening participation in STEM. The 2-day
workshop will take place at the National Science Foundation, June 23-24, 2008.
