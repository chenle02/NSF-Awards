Professor Muroga's research is on VLSI design synthesis and starts with the use
of the negative or NOR gate as the basic logic gate for IC design. He has
developed design tools to automatically solve various IC design problems and
integrated them into a synthesis system, SYLON. His research is on improving
SYLON's capability to design compact networks with a large number of inputs. He
is also modifying SYLON to design networks which are fast on critical paths.
Compaction of ROMs is being addressed using a novel technique of storing a
disjunction of minterms at each crosspoint of memory lines, instead of single
minterm. When the minterm density is either high or low, or when the number of
minterms is small, there is good compaction. Synthesized designs are expected to
be competitive with manual designs. The proposed research is in an important
area of automated design of VLSI chips, called design synthesis. The Principal
Investigator's approach is novel. He is internationally recognized as an expert
researcher in this area, has a history of quality research, and the potential to
continue producing good research.
