This project is concerned with the following topics in commutative algebra: (1)
the structure of the prime ideal spectra and the groups of invertible ideals in
certain rings of integer-valued polynomials; (2) the structure of the
homogeneous complete ideals in the polynomial ring kıX,Y,Z! and the connections
with linear systems of curves in the projective plane; and (3) the projective
line over a countable 1- dimensional local domain R and the structure of the
spectra of integral domains between the polynomial ring RıX! and its field of
fractions. Commutative rings are algebraic structures possessing a commutative
addition and a commutative multiplication. These structures occur throughout
mathematics and algebra. Common examples include polynomial rings, and rings of
algebraic integers in extension fields of the rationals. This project is
conerned with a variety of questions on the structure of commutative rings.
