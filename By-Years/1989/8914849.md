The proposed research is concerned with separating a mixture of proteins in
aqueous solution through selective precipitation, i. e., by formation of a phase
rich in the target protein in equilibrium with a second phase where the
concentration of the target protein is very low. Precipitation is achieved by
salts or nonionic polymers or both. To obtain a quantitative understanding of
protein- precipitation equilibria, a molecular-thermodynamic model based on an
extended Guggenheim/McMillan-Mayer osmotic viral expansion is presented. The
goal of this research is to establish an engineering-oriented correlation for
rational design of protein-precipitation processes. A long-range benefit of this
research is that it is likely to provide useful knowledge for better
understanding of protein crystallization.
