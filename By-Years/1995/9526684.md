9526684 Connelly Deep crustal features associated with continent-continent
collisions are difficult to study in most phanerozoic orogens because the
exposure levels are seldom deep enough. The Nagssugtoqidian Orogen of west
Greenland has attracted much attention as one of the worlds most completely
exposed foreland-to-foreland transects of a deep precambrian Orogen. However,
recent work has failed to confirm the presence of major displacement, crustal-
scale shear zones and thrusts anywhere in the orogen that should mark a
continent-continent suture. This project, in conjunction with the Danish
Lithosphere Centre, will attempt to date, characterize and interpret
metamorphism of this belt, previously thought to be a type example of a deep
suture, and develop a tectonic model for its formation. Results should determine
if the deformation was due to an intracontinential or an intercontinental
tectonic setting. ; Oh +' 0 $ H l D h S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n (
