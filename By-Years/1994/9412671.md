This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of the influence of developed countries on the
establishment of land conservation areas and policies in developing countries.
The research will be conducted through a combination of quantitative analysis of
cross-national data on land conservation schemes and intensive analysis of three
case study countries: Costa Rica, Kenya, and Brazil. Interviews with key players
in these countries as well as in organizations based in the developed world will
be carried out to try to understand the sources of variations in willingness to
establish land conservation areas. Problems of sustainable development in the
developing world have serious consequences for all of humanity. In recent years
governments and organizations in the developed world have tried to foster
sustainable development in various ways, such as by encouraging land
conservation projects in the developing world. Yet we have a poor understanding
of what causes some countries to respond favorably to such proposals and others
to reject them. This project, by examining responses to land conservation
appeals around the world as well as in three case study countries, will promote
understanding of this vital topic. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the
next generation of social scientists. This project will also contribute to the
Human Dimensions of Global Change research initiative.
