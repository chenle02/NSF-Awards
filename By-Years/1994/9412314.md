9412314 Saka An Exploratory investigation will be made of the tribological
behavior of shape memory alloys under an SGER award. Both dry and lubricated
sliding test will be conducted on NiTi shape memory alloys with various
martensite transformation temperatures. The effects of pseudoelasticity and
thermally triggered shape memory on friction, wear, and wear mechanisms will be
determined. ***
