A multi-element hot-wire probe responsive to fluid vorticity (local rotation
rate) is to be furthr developed, and its utility explored in measurements of
coherent vortical structures in turbulent boundary layers. These structures are
largely characterized by their spatial vorticity distribution, which as been
impossible to measure directly in the past.
