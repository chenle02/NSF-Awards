The purpose of this project is to develop a modern Advanced Genetics
curriculum. The course developments being funded include laboratory courses in
Somatic Cell Genetics and Microbial Genetics. These courses teach concepts and
techniques of modern genetic approaches to answering questions about biological
structure and function. Specifically, course development is employing new
equipment for the culture, observation and storage of animal cells, including
CO2- regulated incubators, biological containment hoods, inverted phase-
contrast microscopes, and cryogenic freezers. In addition, gel electrophoresis
apparatus and other equipment are being acquired for the biochemical analysis of
alterations in gene expression that can be detected in cell culture and
microbial models. In addition to these specific course developments, the
equipment permits a greater involvement of undergraduates in meaningful
individual directed-research projects. The grantee institution is matching the
NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
