The PI plans to core offshore the British Virgin Islands (BVI) on drowned reefs
for sealevel change and sea surface temperature records. This will extend the
Caribbean record from 20 k.yrs. to 60 k.yrs. and extend the Carbon 14
calibration to 40 k.yrs. BP Wireline coring offshore BVI will also replicate and
fill in important gaps in the Barbados records. A lifeboat capable of wireline
coring in water depths of up to 100 m and cores of up to 200 m length has been
designed and developed with institutional funds. A Plasma 54 mass spectrometer,
capable of rapid analyses of elements and isotopes, will be used for decipher
the coral record.
