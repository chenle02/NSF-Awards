Two investigators are conducting complementary numerical modeling to gain
understanding of gravity wave propagation and spectral evolution and the
parameterization of these effects in large-scale models of the atmosphere. One
employs fully nonlinear three dimensional studies of wave superposition and
interactions to assess spectral evolution with altitude, influences on wave
anisotropy and momentum fluxes from mean and low-frequency wave shears, and the
dissipation accompanying wave superposition. The other addresses wave
propagation and behavior in low-frequency wave and mean shears at thermospheric
altitudes where three dimensional effects are not important in determining wave
amplitudes and mean flow interactions. Both approaches substantially revise and
update existing parameterization of gravity wave effects employed in several
models of the lower and middle atmosphere and thermosphere. Specifically, the
revisions: (1) more accurately describe the effects of wave superposition,
interactions and instability; (2) replicate observations of wave activity,
variability and effects; and (3) extend to greater altitudes than previously
possible with parameterization schemes.
