The objective of the study is to help each level of government investigate,
adopt and implement streamlined administrative procedures and processes which
identify and eliminate existing barriers to safe, decent, affordable, and
environmentally sound housing and building. A working group of national
organizations representing the public and private sectors' interest in the
regulation of the design, construction and occupancy of residential, commercial,
institutional, industrial and other buildings will be brought together to
assemble, develop, and promote the implementation of streamlined model
administrative processes, procedures, and enabling legislation for states,
localities, and federal government to adopt and use.
