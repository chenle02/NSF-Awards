Abstract The initial planning phase of the Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program
(STEP) is coming to an end with the identification of the first set of research
projects. These projects must now be integrated into a coherent
interdisciplinary program that focusses on the solar-terrestrial environment as
one complex interactive system. Specific science objectives for the
implementation phase must be defined, and national STEP programs must be
combined with the projects identified by the STEP Steering Committee. This
effort will establish an International Science Coordinator Office with the PI
acting as the Coordinator during the next two years. These duties include (i) to
work with the participating scientific community in the definition of science
objectives and coordination of planning and implementation of STEP projects;
(ii) to produce all major scientific reports of STEP; (iii) to facilitate the
world-wide promotion of the program, public understanding, and participation of
scientists in developing countries; (iv) to participate in relevant scientific
meetings on behalf of STEP. ***
