One of the Federal government's missions is to act as an unbiased mediator in
the resolution of disputes. One avenue for achieving resolution is the court
system. There are other avenues, though, such as the National Mediation Board
(NMB) which is required to mediate labor disputes in the railway industry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on a three-year collaborative technical project
between NSF and NMB, this workshop will develop a broad technical and
socio/legal research agenda for on-line dispute resolution and labor
negotiation/mediation in Federal transporation agencies. In addition to a report
to be widely distributed, the event will allow a forum for a broad selection of
interested parties to begin forming a community of interest. Attendees will
include lawyers, transportation experts, and computer scientists from academia,
industry and Federal agencies that have mediation responsibilities.
