Geochemical and thermal anomalies in ODP holes in accretionary prisms indicate
episodic fluid flow; some seismic reflection data in prospective drilling areas
show spatially separate, thigh-amplitude reflections along the decollement zone,
perhaps suggestive of fluid rich dilatant zones. Fluids may flow along mud-rich
fault zones in a coupled fluid-pulse, dislocation, high permeability system. In
order to test this concept this project will conduct a pilot experimental study
of dynamic permeability or the transient ability of sediments to transport
fluids during deformation. A constant-flow rate permeameter coupled across a
triaxial cell will measure pressure differences generated by constant flow
within deforming samples. Experiments will be conducted on muds at moderately
low confining pressures to simulate conditions in the decollement zone or other
faults within drillable depths near the toe of the accretionary prism.
