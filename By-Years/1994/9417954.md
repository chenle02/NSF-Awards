9417954 Wallin The Klamath Mountains have been in their present position since
the Permian, however there is considerable controversy about their origin in
pre-permian times. Essentially, two hypothesis are current - that theses lower
Paleozoic rocks were part of a microplate (Sonomia) that was accreted during
Permo-Triassic time or that the Paleozoic euqeoclinal rocks in California
(Klamaths) are tectonostragraphically equivalent to coeval rocks in Nevada. This
project will utilize the spatial distribution of the age range of Zircons eroded
from precambrian rocks along the pacific margin, and the age range of detrital
zircons in several formations in the eastern Klamaths to discriminate between
these models. Additionally, the work is expected to elucidate the age,
provenance and tectonic significance of lower paleozoic siliclastic rocks (Yreka
terrane) in the eastern Klamaths.
