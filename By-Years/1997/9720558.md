This proposal concerns with both research and educational activities in
mathematical biology. The research project focuses on the use of differential
equations and dynamical systems theory to study the role of heterogeneity on the
dynamics of infectious diseases and host-parasite interactions. Two particular
host-parasite systems are used: the human-tuberculosis (microparasitic) and the
human-schistosome-snail (macroparasitic) to highlight the generality of our
approaches in the study of host-parasite interactions. This project will look
at: the impact that the host heterogeneity in infectivity has on the coexistence
and coevolution of competing strains of TB -- regular TB and drug resistant TB
strains; the effect that the long and variable latency period of TB has on the
evolution of parasite virulence; and to study how control programs of
macroparasites (schistosomiasis) affect parasite genetic diversity. In spite of
the long and lasting connection among many fields of mathematics and biology,
few students have sufficient training to work effectively at the interface of
these fields. The educational project centers on introducing courses in
mathematical biology at both undergraduate and graduate levels at my home
institution. Such courses are currently non-existent at Purdue University. This
project consists of developing curricula for the two courses, preparing lecture
notes and designing research projects suitable for Purdue students, as well as
teaching these courses. Both courses will be designed for students majoring in
either mathematics or biology. The goal of these educational activities is to
give students experience in interdisciplinary studies, as well as in
mathematical biology, thus strengthening their backgrounds and making them more
versatile for employment. This award is funded through the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
