9502493 Grant This is an award to provide the support this investigator
requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science Foundation Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. The intent of this program is to
encourage the early development of academic faculty as educators and
researchers. The research this investigator plans to conduct is directed toward
determining the effects of biologically produced polymers on the rate at which
aggregates form and settle from aqueous suspension. He plans on characterizing
the aggregation process by comparing a relatively clean system using polystyrene
microspheres with one involving exocellular polysaccharides produced by
heterotrophic bacteria. The investigator's education plan centers on modernizing
the laboratory component of a core undergraduate course on microbial processes
and coordinating this with other laboratory based courses in the environmental
core involving physical and chemical processes. The research this investigator
plans on conducting is expected to be used in improving procedures used in the
engineering design of processes for removal of particles originally present in
aqueous suspension or produced during water and wastewater treatment processes.
The goal of the educational component of this project is to provide
undergraduate engineering students illustrations of the fundamental
relationships that exist between chemical and microbial systems used in
environmental engineer practice. ***
