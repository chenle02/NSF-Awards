This research program on X-ray is a continuation of the development of mask
response studies, process modeling and photoresist characterization. The program
will provide new insights and techniques in the areas of semiconductor
manufacturing using X- ray Lithography-based techniques. Thrust: Development and
study of X-ray Lithography process components suitable for 0.25 micrometer and
below. These studies capitalize on the uniqueness of the X-ray source, the
electron storage ring Aladdin, and of the facilities of the Center for X-ray
Lithography. Methods: concentrate on key areas offering the highest productivity
and likelihood of making a significant impact. These areas will involve the use
of the inspection and characterization facilities available at the Center for
X-ray Lithography to maximize the effectiveness of the studies. We plan to
continue the study of mask response, extending it to silicon carbide and
polysilicon membranes and to continue developing new fundamental photoelectron
models in the area of photoresist modeling. New topics will be started in the
area of projection X-ray Lithography, based on the use of the existing X-ray
microscope, and of alignment with the implementation of the linear Fresnel zone
plate system. Goals: to further characterize and understand mask response; to
perform preliminary experiments in projection X-ray Lithography; to extend the
physical models of photoresist response; to implement and test a novel alignment
scheme based on linear Fresnel zone plate.
