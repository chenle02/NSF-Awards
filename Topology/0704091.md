One of the central problems of low-dimensional topology is the classification of
smooth simply connected 4-manifolds. In this direction a basic question is
whether any topological simply connected 4-manifold which admits a smooth
structure in fact admits infinitely many. This proposal suggests a technique
called 'reverse engineering' which can be used to attack this problem. Many,
perhaps all, of the examples of infinite families of pairwise nondiffeomorphic
but homeomorphic simply connected 4-manifolds can be recast as examples of
reverse engineering. In recent years there have been exciting developments in
producing new examples of smooth simply connected 4-manifolds with b^+=1, and a
main goal of this proposal is to use reverse engineering to find even better
examples. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop more systematic
constructions of smooth 4-manifolds with the hope that a general picture begins
to emerge that will suggest a classification scheme.

The broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship between
mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students in topology, and career development of postdoctoral
fellows. Four-dimensional geometry and topology has very close ties to physics.
For example, the proposer will study geography problems for symplectic manifolds
which have been shown to impact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple
type'. Any general results concerning Seiberg-Witten theory hold the prospect of
engendering interaction with the physics community, and this will be a basic
concern. Another basic goal of this is to address 'pipeline issues' in
mathematics. Our approach is to to get students and young mathematicians working
on interesting problems. A key aspect of this proposal is the development of
problems which are accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students.
It presents problems which will be suitable thesis problems for students and
research projects for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan State. It also discusses
computational problems which are suitable for advanced undergraduate students.
