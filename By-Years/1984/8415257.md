The general objective of this research is to continue development of a
prototypical artificial intelligence (AI) system which is designed to give legal
advice to design and construction engineers. The existing AI system, the
Differing Site Conditions Systems (DSCAS), is a well defined first step toward
developing an AI system for contract management; however, there are several
limitations of the system. The objective of this research is to remove these
limitations. The specific objectives of this research are: to increase the
sophistication of DSCAS such that the user will not need to possess more than
rudimentary legal knowledge, to modify the program structure to allow DSCAS to
find and explain all of the reasons why a claim might be disallowed, and to give
the program the capability to cite relevant case law in justifying its solution.
