Daytona State College is adapting and implementing a series of best practices
for recruitment and retention in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) associate of arts (AA) programs. The goal is to expand the
talent and diversity of students entering and completing STEM degree programs.
The STEM Community Scholars Program is motivating and recruiting graduating high
school students and first-year college students to pursue STEM degrees by
providing services that support participants' academic success, including
setting high expectations, continual and intrusive academic advising, strong
social ties, financial assistance, and transfer assistance.

The program strategies are helping students learn to be successful in STEM
fields. The focus of the project is increasing enrollment in STEM programs;
impacting graduation rates both in the program and across the STEM disciplines;
assisting students in applying to STEM baccalaureate programs; and
comprehensively evaluating the selected strategies.

The program is serving nearly 300 students over five years. Underrepresented
groups in STEM fields are being recruited to broaden the diversity in STEM
fields. The project team consists of educators who are committed to ensuring the
success of the students and institutionalizing the strategies and activities
that are most successful.
