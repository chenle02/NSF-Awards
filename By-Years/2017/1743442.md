CyVerse is a national computational resource that provides cyberinfrastructure
to enable basic and applied research across the life sciences, and to train
scientists in its use. The strong shift towards open innovation and open science
necessitates a new level of interdisciplinary collaboration among geographically
distributed teams of researchers. These collaborations require a higher level of
scientific, technical, and computational rigor to ensure reproducibility and
productivity as teams bring their customized analysis pipelines, toolkits, and
best practices for wider use and dissemination. The expertise of the groups
involved in the proposed work uniquely positions this project to meet these
future needs and to continue providing best-in-class services to a diversity of
life science researchers. CyVerse provides and supports a vertically integrated
set of flexible and highly usable software-based services tailored to meeting
the distinctive needs of life science researchers at all career stages,
technological proficiencies, and computing services demand. CyVerse provides a
cyberinfrastructure for the life sciences that acts as a "gateway" through which
a broad diversity of researchers and educators can access remote and powerful
computing resources through an interface that hides the complexity of
cyberinfrastructure and presents a suite of familiar tools and data sources.
Resources like CyVerse have transformed the way scientists work with data,
accelerated the pace of discovery, and have democratized participation in
leading edge research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are
to sustain the core activities of CyVerse to continue providing service to
existing users and to accommodate new users of this infrastructure. To meet
these needs CyVerse will continue to provide reliable cyberinfrastructure
through access to scalable computational and data management resources, ensuring
that those resources are robust, secure, and dependable. CyVerse will also
continue to enable science by providing support to science and research
communities through targeted scientific collaborations and partnerships.
Finally, Cyverse will continue to provide user training in the effective use of
CyVerse for research. CyVerse's training and education activities have benefited
scientists at all levels of expertise and will continue to positively impact the
ability of life scientists to pursue data-enabled
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
