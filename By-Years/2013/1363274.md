In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism B
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Matthew Shores of Colorado State
University is investigating new transition metal complexes whose physical (spin)
properties are linked to the presence of guest molecules. This research aims to
support the development of (1) inexpensive colorimetric sensors for colorless
anions of biological (phosphates, chloride) and/or environmental (nitrate,
cyanide, perchlorate) significance; and (2) new magnetic resonance contrast
agents that reversibly turn on when interacting with target molecules. The
project will support magnetic collaborations between the PI and 7 other research
groups who do not have ready access to sensitive magnetic measurement techniques
and data interpretation experience. Potential societal benefits include the
discovery of new anion sensors and turn-on magnetic resonance contrast agents as
well as a cross disciplinary training ground for graduate and undergraduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on controlling the spin-
states of first-row transition metal complexes via secondary, non-covalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonding. The aim is to switch reliably between
low- and high-spin states, in both directions, with a variety of chemical
triggers. The research involves design and synthesis of new Fe(II), Fe(III) and
Co(II) complexes, solid state and solution phase structural and magnetic
characterization, and guest binding studies monitored by UV-Visible and NMR
spectroscopies. Toward increasing environmental stability of promising
molecules, cellulose-based hybrid materials are targeted where anion-dependent
spin-state switching is expected to persist at the surface-solution interface.
Incorporating anion-dependent spin-state switching properties to paper-based
devices generates an opportunity for new sensors, easy to use, with wide
portability and easy (visual) detection, suitable for wide distribution to
citizens to estimate exposure to anionic pollutants.
