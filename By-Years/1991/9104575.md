This project deals with the complex structural geology of the coastal belt of
Maine from New Hampshire to New Brunswick, the development of a major regional
strike-slip fault system and its relationship to possible oblique convergence
during the Mid-late Paleozoic. It focuses on an area containing two large faults
(Norumbega and Nonesuch River faults) and a complex zone linking them. The work
involves detailed structural analysis of these faults and transition areas and
will attempt to determine strain amounts and kinematic mechanisms for fault
interaction. Results are important to the regional tectonic story, including the
arrival of exotic terranes, but also is of interest from a microstructural
process-related perspective.
