This project will research some basic and important areas in cryptography and
theoretical computer science that have significant interaction with
combinatorics, in particular, secrecy and authentication codes, secret-sharing
schemes and universal hashing. Informally, a secrecy code is used in order to
keep the contents of message secret, while an authentication code is used to
ensure the "integrity" of a message, i.e. that the message has not been tampered
with. Threshold schemes and secret-sharing schemes were introduced to handle
problems such as key distribution and shared control of jointly initiated
events. Universal hashing is a technique to ensure good average-case behaviour
of hash function, and has applications in diverse areas of theoretical computer
science, including cryptography. New constructions and algorithms will be
investigated for these types of cryptographic protocols. The problems to be
researched include: construction of optimal codes for authentication and secrecy
and construction of codes which permit arbitration; construction of secret-
sharing schemes for general access structures and efficient implementations of
these codes; and constructions and bounds for universal classes of hash
function. All of these questions involve combinatorial designs in a fundamental
way, both in constructions and in characterizations.
