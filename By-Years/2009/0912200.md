A Conference on Ecosystem Services will bring together government and non-
governmental leaders as well as scholars to advance the use of the concept of
ecosystem services in conservation, restoration, resource management, and
development decisions. The issue of ecosystem services and their valuation and
location has become an increasingly important factor in resource management and
conservation, in decisions related to prioritizing conservation and development
locations, and in the management of public lands. This 3-day conference will
facilitate interactive discussions across disciplines, the creation of research
partnerships, and the development of a research agenda.
