This award from the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation
supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Site led by Professors
Terence A. Nile and Penelope J. Pynes, both at the University of Carolina-
Greensboro (UNCG). The REU Site entitled "Multi-site, Multi-institutional
International REU Program" will train 10 undergraduate students for an 8 week
summer research experiences at the Universities of Bath, Bristol and Cardiff in
the United Kingdom (UK). The participants will be recruited after their
sophomore and junior years with at least half (50%) from underrepresented
groups. While providing students with a first class international experience,
the program will give students, especially those from smaller institutions, the
opportunity to undertake cutting edge research in synthetic chemistry at well-
equipped major research universities. Thus, the multi-site, multi-institutional
REU site will provide an international undergraduate research experience (IURE)
for students from the US at three institutions in the
UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the award involves working closely
with the students supported by the REU Site to find additional research
experiences, both on and off their campuses, as they progress through their
undergraduate degree programs. A document will be prepared that summarizes the
procedures necessary for a successful program of this type and it will be used
this internally to facilitate similar programs in other disciplines at UNCG.
This information will be submitted for publication in the Council of
Undergraduate Research journal and presented at regional and national meetings
of undergraduate research organizations.
