Extensive improvements in undergraduate engineering design and manufacturing
programs will be implemented. The CAD phase is well under way. This thrust
targets the vital expansion of the CAM program through the acquisition of a
Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). The proposed system will be integrated with
the existing CAD facility to provide a comprehensive undergraduate CAD/CAM
capability. Specific goals are to provide undergraduate students with hands-on
experience with computer interfacing and control of modern numerically
controlled machine tools, robots, and assembly and inspection equipment while
exercising CAM and CIM principles and operations. The FMS contains a control
station, a mill, a lathe, three robots, tooling for assembly, a continuous
conveyor, and vision inspection. A totally new and state-of-the-art dimension
will be added to the undergraduate curriculum.
