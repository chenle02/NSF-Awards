The Department of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh is opening a
computing lab which will utilize innovative techniques of artificial
intelligence, known as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) of Discovery Worlds
(DW), to strengthen undergraduate training in introductory economic analysis.
The ITS/DW approach stimulates more independent thinking and helps students to
develop sharper analytical skills than previous instructional applications of
computers, but it also has more demanding hardware requirements which limit the
number of workstations which the Department can afford. This award provides
funds to improve the lab by outfitting it with a more optimal number of
appropriately configured workstations. The new lab will consist of 30 (in place
of 15) workstations using an Economics PC Discovery World program developed
collaboratively by the Project Director and the University's Learning Research
and Development Center. The lab and software system will be used by students in
introductory microeconomics courses with enrollments of approximately 3,000
undergraduates per calendar year. The Pitt ITS/DW project has been the subject
of numerous scholarly articles, attracting interest because of encouraging
evaluative results and the portability of the basic approach to other schools
with PC facilities. The grantee will match this award with non- Federal sources.
