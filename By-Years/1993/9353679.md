9353679 Collins The Section of Women in Science of the New York Academy of
Sciences will hold a one-day Workshop/Conference for Re-entry Women in Science
and Engineering at the Academy in October, 1994. Intended outcomes are to: (1)
provide career advisement for re-entry women, particularly minority women
interested in physical science and engineering fields; (2) establish mentoring
networks linking women scientist mentors with prospective re-entry women to
facilitate enrollment of women, including minority women, into baccalaureate
programs; (3) establish a network of small peer groups linking re-entry women by
disciplinary interest and/or locale; (4) prepare and disseminate a book based on
the workshop/conference and supporting information for re-entry women; (5)
prepare and disseminate a videotape on the workshop/conference to motivate other
prospective re-entry women; and (6) prepare and disseminate a quarterly
newsletter to conference participants to motivate their ongoing preparation in
peer study groups, and facilitate their enrollment into B.S. programs in the
physical sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer science. ***
