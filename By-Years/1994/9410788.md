Approximately half the proteins that are present in living systems are
associated with biological membranes, and these proteins preform some of the
most interesting and important functions in the cell. The proposed work is
directed at studying membrane proteins called ion-channels which facilitate
signaling in nerve cells. In order to understand how the nervous system
operates, information on the molecular structures of ion-channels will be
required, and it will be necessary to characterize the specific changes in these
structures that control nerve cell activity. At the present time there is not a
single ion channel from the nervous system that is characterized at the
molecular level. In general , there is a lack of molecular information on
membrane proteins because efficient experimental techniques to study these types
of proteins have not been developed. This proposal will develop new
methodologies to examine membrane protein structure. One approach will use a
technique called mass-spectrometry, and it will be combined with traditional
chemical labeling techniques to determine how proteins are structured in
biological membranes. Dramatic improvements in mass spectrometry in the past few
years have made it a very powerful and ideal technique to investigate proteins.
A second approach will place molecular probes called spin-labels at specific
sites in membrane proteins to provide information on structure and changes in
structure. These techniques will be applied to an ion-channel called the
acetylcholine receptor. The acetylcholine receptor is a membrane ion channel
that functions at the neuromuscular junction, and it is typical in size and
complexity to many other ion channels in the nervous system.
