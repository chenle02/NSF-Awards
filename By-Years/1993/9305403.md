The proposed studies apply classical phage genetic approaches to the screening
of massive combinatorial primary structure libraries related to the leucine
zipper of yeast transcription factor GCN4. The object of these studies is to
define sequences which can form heterodimers with wild type GCN4 leucine
zippers, and to characterize primary sequence requirements for
heterodimerization. %%% The roles of amino acid side chains in protein
dimerization processes will be evaluated by altering the primary sequence
randomly of a simple leucine zipper structural motif. The functional
significance of each new structure (there will be millions of such structures)
will be screened, in a genetics based system, in terms of ability to dimerize.
Two types of populations will be sequenced: (1) those molecules which can form
heterodimers with the wild-type GCN4 leucine zipper, and (2) those molecules
which form stable homodimers, but not heterodimers (with the wild- type leucine
zipper). Such studies will shed considerable insight into the structural
constraints involved in peptide-peptide, protein-protein interactions.
