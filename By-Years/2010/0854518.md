The project is dedicated to the organization of an interdisciplinary Workshop
on Mathematical Modeling and Computer Simulations for Soft Materials, to bring
together scientists from different fields, ranging from applied and
computational mathematics and applied physics to a variety of disciplines
relevant to soft matter physics, unified by their common interest in search for
a deeper understanding of soft materials. The workshop is conceived specifically
to identify new challenges for theory, modeling and simulation of soft
materials, and to investigate the growing role of applied and computational
mathematics in meeting those challenges. The goal of the workshop is to attract
researchers at all levels, from graduate students and junior researchers to
leaders in the field, with focus on breadth and diversity of the participants.
Particular emphasis is placed on the training of young participants. The results
are disseminated in a format useful to students, scientists and engineers,
through graduate courses with interdisciplinary audience at Colorado State
University, and through the publication of a refereed Collected Lectures volume
of the invited and contributed talks.

From blood and lipid complexes, detergents, paints, plastics, personal care
products, to liquid crystals and bio-materials, we are made of and surrounded by
soft matter in all aspects of our lives. While many properties of hard matter
are now understood, we are still on the learning curve with soft matter, and the
study of the salient features and complex behavior of soft materials is one of
the 21st century's challenges, requiring the development of new tools, new
understanding, and an unprecedented level of interdisciplinary collaboration.
Progress in materials science achieved in the last decades, as well as the rapid
development of computer technology, have brought scientists to a better
understanding of soft matter behavior and phenomena. Although much progress in
this area has been made in recent years, fundamental challenges remain, such as
the development of a unified scientific approach to soft materials, and the
conversion of the important scientific discoveries into useful technological
solutions. The workshop brings together experts in mathematics, physics and
engineering to explore and develop the potential in this rich interdisciplinary
area, and generates a diverse, cross-disciplinary, but highly cooperative
research environment that increases the accessibility of this interdisciplinary
field to both students entering the field and non-specialists. The workshop
presents a broad spectrum of current research and prospects for future
directions that provides young researchers with an intensive learning experience
and a larger perspective beyond their individual PhD thesis topics.
