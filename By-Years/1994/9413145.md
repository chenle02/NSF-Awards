Success in science requires a solid background in a scientific discipline in
addition of extensive laboratory experience. However, for scientists to develop
into accomplished professionals, a wide range of "survival skills" also are
needed. These skills can be divided into three categories: communications (e.g.
the ability to communicate both orally and in writing), economic issues (e.g.
securing employment), and personal development (e.g. managing time and stress).
While higher education focuses almost exclusively on the content of the
scientific discipline and on research methodology, little attention is paid to
those skills that can make the difference between technical and creative
competence and success. This award is to enable (1) development of a
comprehensive series of workshops on survival skills; (2) production of
materials and relevant literature to assist instructors in higher education to
teach their students these skills; and (3) support of workshops to disseminate
this information to faculty members from a wide range of institutions so as to
enable other educational programs to initiate similar courses. Evaluation will
be carried out for the materials and workshops to assess the success of these
activities. Special emphasis is being placed to improve access for under-
represented groups. Providing a solid foundation in career skills for women and
ethnic minorities may play a pivotal role for ensuring their successful entry
into the scientific profession. An important benefit of increasing the diversity
of scientists while maintaining their quality is the incorporation of a
diversity of approaches to scientific problems which can only serve to improve
science.
