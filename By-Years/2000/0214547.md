EAR-0214547&lt;br/&gt;Kress&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In August, 1997, the Department
of Geology acquired a number of valuable pieces of experimental equipment from
Stanford University. Equipment includes: 1) A high-capacity 1.4 GPa Harwood two-
stage gas compressor and smaller third stage "vernier" pump. 2) Two 5 cm bore
internally heated pressure vessels and a smaller 4.1 cm bore vessel, all with a
design pressure of 1 GPa. 3) A large collection of valves gauges and tubing.
Building on funds already provided by the University of Washington, the
investigators will assemble this equipment into a working state-of the-art high-
pressure high-temperature experimental facility. This facility will be used for
experimental exploration of geological problems under conditions ranging from
ambient to 1 GPa (10,000 bars) pressure and temperatures up to 1,500 degrees
centigrade under controlled or monitored fugacities of hydrogen, oxygen and
sulfur. This PT range is not accurately accessible by any other commonly used
experimental method. This facility will be capable of exploring conditions found
over most of Earth's continental crust and down to upper oceanic mantle. This
pressure and temperature range also includes the probable source region for
Martian shergottites (Ghosal et al., 1998). The large volume of this
experimental apparatus and the ability to incorporate numerous electrical
feedthroughs into the high pressure environment allows tremendous flexibility in
experimental design. Furthermore, because the pressure medium is a gas,
pressures can be measured accurately, and one can be assured that the pressure
experienced by the sample is entirely isotropic. Ultrasonic experiments are
proposed that can only be done in this type of device.&lt;br/&gt;***
