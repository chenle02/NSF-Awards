The objective of this project is to characterize the chemical and physical
characteristics of aerosol particles above, in, and below stratocumulus clouds.
The study will be carried out as part of the DYCOMS-II project (Dynamics and
Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus), off the California coast in July 2001. The
interaction of aerosol and cloud particles will be evaluated by comparing the
size distributions and chemical composition of particles measured within cloud
with those outside the cloud. Measurements of the cloud droplet size
distribution will be used to investigate the effects of aerosol particles on
cloud microphysical properties. Instrumentation includes particle spectrometers
for the size range 0.005 to 6400 micrometers. Electron microscopy of aerosol
samples will be used to identify chemical functional groups, including organic
species, and elements. The residue of cloud droplets collected by counterflow
virtual impaction will be analyzed the same way. The data will give insight on
the following scientific problems: (1) the chemical composition of particles
incorporated into cloud droplets; (2) the effects of different aerosol chemical
types and size distributions on cloud microphysics; (3) the degree of chemical
processing of the aerosols by cloud; (4) the extent to which the observations
can be approximated by physical and chemical cloud models. The ultimate goal of
the research is to improve the ability to parameterize the radiative, dynamic,
and thermodynamic effects of clouds in large-scale models of atmospheric
circulation and climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
