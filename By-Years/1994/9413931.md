This is a proposal to purchase a "fluorimager," an imaging detector for
visualizing and measuring spots on gels, membranes, TLC plates and other labeled
biological materials. The scope of research for which the instrument will be
used includes analysis of DNA binding proteins (transcription factors) whose
function is to regulate transcription of genes during normal cell growth an d
differentiation and during embryonic development, the study of transcription
factor interactions that result in enhancement or suppression of gene
expression, molecules (CAMs) and human cytoskeletal proteins. It also includes
the molecular and genetic basis for the generation of the immune repertoire,
analysis of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, the study of interaction
between lymphocytes and hematopoiesis, the constitutive expression of growth
factor genes in the growth regulation of normal epithelial and neuroectodermal
cells, the study of the mechanisms of regulation of innate resistance of natural
killer cells and phagocytic cells and the regulation through cytokines of the
differentiation and activity of DC4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, and the structure
and conformation of normal p53 protein.
