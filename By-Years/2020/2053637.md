This Disaster Resilience Research Grant (DRRG) project contributes to the
advancement of national health, prosperity and welfare by creating new knowledge
on how coastal storm and flood events affect municipal finances. Disasters may
cause fiscal distress for local governments when revenues shrink and expenses
grow, thereby affecting their ability to provide adequate local public services
such as policing, public works, and education. The extent of local distress
depends in part on what other actors do, including local property owners and
higher levels of government. This project collects twenty years of New Jersey
data from property tax records, municipal budgets, and state and federal budgets
to create a fiscal impact model; uses a phone survey of coastal residents and
focus groups with public officials to create a behavioral model; and joins them
to support the deliberations of a stakeholder group based in coastal New Jersey.
This group will explore ways to incentivize more effective management of coastal
hazards and increase transparency about how coastal storm and flood events
affect municipalities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Better risk management in coastal
areas depends in part on re-aligning the incentives experienced by households
and local jurisdictions by changing the rules of the intergovernmental public
finance. This project extends the method of Fiscal Impact Analysis, a widely
used method to assess the local fiscal impacts of land use development
proposals, to the situation where coastal hazards cause local fiscal impacts. It
also develops a novel agent-based model of intergovernmental fiscal relations to
allow strategic exploration of alternative incentive structures. The project
integrates these two tools into a simulation modeling system that can support
stakeholder deliberations about more protective coastal risk policy. More
broadly, the project will help local decision makers to mitigate fiscal stresses
from adaptation decisions outside the municipal sphere of influence. From an
equity perspective, it serves fiscally distressed coastal communities that often
have vulnerable residents residing in the flood plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
