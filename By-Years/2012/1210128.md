This action funds Nicholas Ryan Hill of the University of Wisconsin-Madison to
conduct a research project, entitled "Improving Identification Methods of
Pulsating Star Properties," during the summer of 2012 at the University of
Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The host scientist is Dr. Karen
Pollard.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in using a graphics
processing unit (GPU) accelerated spectral synthesis computer code to study non-
radially pulsating stars. To identify properties and pulsation modes of these
stars, scientists must generate synthetic spectra to compare to the spectra of
an observed star. Since the synthesis is computationally expensive, only limited
amounts of spectral data can currently be analyzed. GPU acceleration of this
task will thus allow scientists to study more of these stars to better
understand their environments and evolution.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Additionally, the GPU spectral synthesis code developed
during this research project will be made openly available for others to use in
their work.
