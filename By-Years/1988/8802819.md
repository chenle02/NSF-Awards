The beginnings of human use and control of fire has been an important concern
for students of human origins since it is crucial for understanding early
hominid cultural adaptation and development. Recently, traces of fire in early
Pleistocene contexts have been reported at Koobi Fora, Kenya. However,
archaeologists lack a methodology to distinguish whether these remains are
naturally occurring or the result of human endeavors. To help remedy this
situation, the student will conduct a series of actualistic experiments in Zaire
and Kenya on the effects of campfires, tree stump fires and grass fires to see
how they may be manifested physically and macroscopically in the range of
sedimentary environments used by early hominids. The research will result in new
methods and techniques to help determine the presence of fire in archaeological
sites around the world.
