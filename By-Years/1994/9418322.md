9418322 Harrison This project is to conduct 40Ar/39Ar analyses of a suite of
samples already collected from the Zanskar shear zone in the Lhasa district of
the central Himalayas in order to date the movement on this fault. The Zanskar
shear zone is part of a major low-angle normal fault system known as the
Southern Tibetan Detachment System that appears to span the entire length of the
orogenic collision front. The timing of this remarkable feature is poorly
constrained in the Zanskar region, although about 1000 km farther east the fault
is known to have moved at 23-20 Ma. The project will measure 40Ar/39Ar on 16
separated minerals and determine detailed thermal histories, timing of fault
initiation and slip-rate history. The results will provide needed insight on the
origin and evolution of this extensional fault system and will help understand
the tectonic evolution of other major compressional orogenic systems.
