9706188 Ritzwoller This research is to implement developments done under
previous work on earth normal modes including improved measurement techniques
and expanded catalogues of more than 3,000 even and odd degree structure
coefficient estimates of 90 observable multiplets below 3 mHz. This work will
extend this catalogue of normal mode (generalized) structure coefficient
estimates from 3 to 5 mHz focusing on data analysis of mantle-sensitive modes,
rather than analysis of core-sensitive modes. The goal is to generate
coefficient estimates, estimated errors, and misfit statistics for at east 100
new multiplets. This expanded catalogue will be used to assess existing mantle
models. ***
