BLUMSTEIN SBR-9513040 This award provides support for a National Consortium on
Violence Research located at Carnegie Mellon University. The Consortium will
develop a comprehensive and focused program of research on the causes and
consequences of violence. It is designed to bring the fullest range of insights
and perspectives to improve our understanding and ability to effectively deal
with the growing problems of interpersonal violence. The Consortium will
coordinate empirical and theoretical research multidisciplinary research and
research training across a broad range of individual and societal aspects
related to the subject of interpersonal violence. The Consortium is comprised of
a team of prominent researchers with a significant variety of disciplinary
backgrounds (i.g. biology, criminology, economics geography, operations
research, political science, psychology, public health, public policy,
sociology, statistics) and extensive research experience and methodological
expertise that will be applied to the study of violence. This multidisciplinary,
multi-institutional research team consists of 39 individuals at 24 institutions
in 11 states and 4 countries. The Consortium will focus on increasing knowledge
about the dynamics of violence at three levels of violence: (1) Individual
Development Level--how and why people develop into violent individuals, and how
and why they cease to be violent; (2) Situational Dynamics Level--how and why
some conflict situations escalate into actual violent encounters, while others
do not; and (3) Community Dynamics Level, how and why some communities,
including public-housing communities in particular, develop high levels of
violence. As an integral part of its extensive research agenda, the Consortium
is strongly committed to training the next generation of scholars in research on
violence. This will be accomplished through a post-doctoral program that
emphasizes strong technical and research skills; a decentralized pre-doctoral
program; re cruitment of undergraduates to do research with consortium members;
and recruitment as research collaborators faculty members from institutions with
large minority populations. External communications, especially with
practitioners and policy-makers, will also be an important activity. Spurred by
the extremely high levels of violence in the United States compared to other
industrial nations, and by the dramatic rise in violence among young people in
recent years, interpersonal violence has emerged as a highly salient matter of
public concern that urgently needs major concerted scientific attention. The
search for effective public policy and intervention strategies has made it clear
that much more intense effort is needed to develop sophisticated and
comprehensive scientific approaches to generate valid and applicable knowledge
about the many facets of violence. In supporting this National Consortium, the
National Science Foundation seeks to create a vehicle to advance fundamental
knowledge on violence and to serve a catalytic and leadership role in
stimulating new scientific connections on this issue. ***
