The 1997 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Communications Architectures, Protocols and
Applications will be held in Nice, France, from September 16-18, 1997. This
conference is the premier technical meeting that examines the state-of-the-art
in computer networks and communications. This proposal requests funding to
assist ten United States-based graduate students in attending this meeting.
Participation in conferences such as Sigcomm is an extremely important part of
the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers and be exposed to leading edge work in the field. The support
requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who would
otherwise be unable to attend SIGCOMM'97.
