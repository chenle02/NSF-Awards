This proposal is a collaborative research project, involving Ocean Engineers
and Applied Mathematician, to develop computational methods for analyzing the
interactions of water waves with floating vessels. Computational methods will be
developed for problems ranging from linear wave interacting with practical
structures to second-order, weakly- and fully nonlinear wave simulations with
simpler body shapes. Parallel processing methods will also be pursued.
