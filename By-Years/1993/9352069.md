9352069 Veath The overall goal of this project is to provide authentic "real-
world" experiences in the physics curriculum. Creation of an observatory for
undergraduate teaching and student research is the mechanism for the
implementation of this goal. Specifically the project not only provide authentic
experiences in a variety of physics classes, but also institutes new
quantitative courses and opportunities for student research and senior
portfolios. Pre-service secondary teachers in a new course of laboratory
methods, design activities utilizing the new technology for pre-service
elementary teachers and non-majors, thereby reducing their "technophobia".
Working with professional organizations like the American Association of
Variable Star Observers and International Amateur-Professional Photoelectric
Photometery, undergraduates engage in observational astronomy program that
result in professional presentations of their results. Existing telescopes are
upgraded by the addition of electronic digital setting circles and integrated
CCD imaging photometers. ***
