This proposal requests funds to obtain a scanning electron microscope. Six
investigators will comprise the main user group. The projects proposed include
the following. Characterization of the manner by which bacterial cells attach to
biological surfaces, sulfide ores, manganese oxide and clays. EDAX will be
utilized to study the distribution of manganese in hydrothermal vent bacteria.
Another project will use the instrument to study the geometrical relationship
between eye lens shape and the muscles responsible for shape changes. A final
project will investigate the mechanism by which the symbiotic bacterium Anabaena
azollae is inoculated into its host water fern, Azolla.
