This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports work by Professor F. Ann Walker at the University of Arizona to probe
the peroxidase activity of the nitrophorins (NPs). These ferriheme proteins,
from the saliva of the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus, are known to
sequester NO in the salivary glands and release it into the tissues of the
victim during a bite. Preliminary findings have shown that these proteins also
react with hydrogen peroxide or peroxyacetic acid (PAA) to oxidize typical
substrates of peroxidase enzymes, as well as the important biological effector
norepinephrine. The high-valent intermediate known as Compound I is formed after
rapid mixing of H2O2 or PAA with NP. Two forms of Compound I are seen at
different pH values; at high pH the typical Compound I spectrum is observed,
while at low pH a different signal, novel for peroxidase enzymes, but previously
seen in model heme complexes, is observed. The factors that cause the appearance
of each of these signals, their disappearance to form tyrosyl radicals of the
protein, and their subsequent reactivity with organic substrates, will be
investigated in this project. A course on peroxidase and oxygenase enzymes will
be developed and offered to undergraduate and graduate students in Chemistry,
Biochemistry and Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of Arizona, and the
course materials will be made available to others on the
WWW.&lt;br/&gt;Peroxides and their oxidation reactions are important in chemical
and biological systems and in industrial settings. The mechanisms of hydrogen
peroxide (and organic peracid) reaction with transition metals are relevant to
large scale chemistry and biochemistry, as well as to the reactions that produce
deleterious Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in plants and animals. Investigation
of the high valent reactivity of the novel ferriheme enzymes to be studied will
provide insight into the factors that stabilize each of the high valent Compound
I species and their subsequent reactivity with organic substrates.
