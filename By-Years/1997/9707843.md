Award Abstract Fellow: Raquel-Olguin Jaakkola Proposal number: DBI 9707843 This
action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1997. This
fellowship supports research and training in the area of animal behavior and
cognition. The title of the research and training plan is "An experimental
technique for testing if dolphin whistles are used as names." @ottlenose
dolphins produce individually distinctive "signature" whistles. Previous
research has assumed that these whistles function to broadcast individual
identity; but it has not been tested whether signature whistles actually label
individuals, that is, serve as referential names. This research develops a
technique for testing whether dolphins can identify other individual dolphins on
the basis of their signature whistles.
