This Small Business Innovation Phase II Project will develop information
theoretic methods to separate fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) signals from the
noisy electrical environment of the maternal abdomen based on statistical
properties of the mixtures (blind source separation). The separation is done
using a recently introduced algorithm (Mermaid) that is computationally and data
efficient. Phase I research showed that Mermaid is a marked improvement over
prior methods of FECG separation. The project will develop the technology for a
comprehensive fetal and maternal monitor including fetal heart rate, FECG, and
maternal Electrohysterogram (EHG, which measures contraction information) in a
very compact device. The project includes clinical studies designed to provide
the information necessary to create and validate NeuroDimension's system and
also to illustrate its effectiveness. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Potential markets
include hospital-based fetal monitoring, home/physician's office fetal
monitoring and stress tests, and use as a research tool. The monitor not only
will be less expensive than current monitors, but also will provide additional
information that can dramatically improve patient care and reduce costs by
avoiding unnecessary procedures.&lt;br/&gt;
