ABSTRACT A workshop on the structure of the lexicon, with particular emphasis
on semantic fields, will be held in the summer of 1989 in Tucson, Arizona, to
coincide with the Linguistic Society of America Summer Institute. In spite of
recent significant research on the lexicon, the global structure of the lexicon
-- in particular the notion of semantic fields -- has received relatively little
attention. Semantic field theory has been a useful descriptive tool for
comparing vocabularies across languages, for analyzing metaphor, and for
explaining certain psychological phenomena. The workshop will provide a forum
for prominent researchers from various dis- ciplines (linguistics, philosophy,
psychology, and anthropology) to come together to clarify the concepts and
issues, develop new research strategies, and formulate interdisciplinary
hypotheses concerning lexical organization. The results of the conference should
help to show how semantic field theory and related theories dealing with the
structure of the lexicon can provide new and deeper insights into the structure
and use of language.
