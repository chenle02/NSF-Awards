This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a
fully functional prototype 3-D laparoscope, which will be superior to the 2-D
laparoscopes currently used in surgeries, based on laser illuminated
miniaturized projector for computer generated light patterns and two cameras for
acquisition of color and depth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application
of this project will be in surgical operations. This device will have the
capacity to provide depth and computer enhanced view of the surgical domain more
akin to open surgery. This would allow for more precision in surgical
procedures, thereby eliminating hand-eye coordination issues and reducing
mistakes and accidents. &lt;br/&gt;
