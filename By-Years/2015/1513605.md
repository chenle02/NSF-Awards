Spin glasses are disordered spin systems invented by theoretical physicists in
the early 70's. The aim is to describe the strange magnetic behaviors of certain
alloys. Over the past decades, physicists' investigation has generated a series
of methodologies and predictions. In the community of mathematics, spin glass
models are purely probabilistic objects that present highly complex random
structures. The general aim of this research project is to pursue mathematical
investigation of physical phenomena including the complexity of the random
Hamiltonian, the structure of the Gibbs measure and the thermodynamic limit of
the free energy. As well as being important in the field of probability, the
tools and results obtained in this research plan are relevant to a variety of
scientific branches including computer science, theoretical biology and social
networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, this proposal is concerned about
the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. The PI will investigate the structure
and the role of the functional order parameter in the low temperature regime. In
addition, the conjectured ultrametricity of the Gibbs measure and the problem of
chaos in temperature will be analyzed following the Guerra-Talagrand replica
symmetry breaking bound. The PI will as well study the central limit theorem for
some physical quantities such as the overlap and magnetization especially at the
critical temperature using Stein's method. Another direction is the SK model
with heavy tail disorder. As now higher order interactions are allowed, the
system has been predicted to exhibit unusual spin glass phenomena. The last part
of the project involves the bipartite version of the SK model, which was used to
model collective properties of two interactive large groups of individuals
motivated by the studies of the social and neural networks, biology and
economics. The PI will be concentrated on the computation of the limiting free
energy.
