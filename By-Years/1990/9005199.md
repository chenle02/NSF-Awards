This project is to investigate the accretion of the Earth and the separation of
the Earth's core and crust from the Earth's mantle, by analyzing well
characterized samples from different geochemical reservoirs with neutron
activation analysis for the moderately siderophile and chalcophile trace
elements Mo, W, As, and Sb, and by determination of metal/silicate partition
coefficients for As and Sb. The varying depletion relative to elements with
different affinities for Fe-metal or sulfide provide clues to the events
involving accretion and metal segregation in the mantle, including the
possibility of late veneers that accreted on the Earth after core formation, or
the possibility of metal retention in the mantle during core formation.
Determining the abundances and depletion of these elements un samples from
terrains of different geological ages will also address the timing of core
formation in the Earth, because the possibility of continued core formation
through a substantial portion of geologic time has been invoked to explain some
of the recent lead isotope results for samples from the mantle.
