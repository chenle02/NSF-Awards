This award supports projects encompassing experiments in two different broad
research areas. The first research focus emphasizes precision measurements in
fundamental systems, notably simple objects such as atomic helium and molecular
hydrogen. A new project will test the antisymmetrization postulate in quantum
mechanics by measurements in molecular oxygen. The second research focus is on
the study of molecular dynamics in highly excited Rydberg atoms. A new direction
for the group in molecular dynamics will concentrate on the utilization of
coherent excitation and control to achieve selective branching ratios for
photogenerated processes.
