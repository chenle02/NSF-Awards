Living organs respond to mechanical load not only by deformation, but also by
growth, resorption and structural remodeling. While the elasticity of soft
tissues is relatively well-studied, the interaction between mechanical factors
and adaptive growth remains poorly understood. The goal of the project is to
gain understanding of coupled stress-growth motion through (1) developing and
evaluating biomechanics models for stress-regulated growth and remodeling in
vascular system; (2) developing finite element formulations for the simulation
of coupled stress-growth motion; and (3) investigating the mechanical aspect of
aneurysm growth and remodeling. The research will bring new dimensions into the
biomechanical analysis of soft tissues. A better understanding of tissue
adaptive behavior and the relation to physiological functions is expected to be
obtained out of this research. The project plans to incorporate the research
results into classroom teaching by introducing new teaching modules for
continuum mechanics, computational mechanics and vascular mechanics courses. It
also offers educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to
work on leading edge research projects.
