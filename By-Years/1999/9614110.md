9614110 Nolet This grant provides $46,764 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring computer equipment for the Geophysics faculty at Princeton.
Specifically, these funds will be used over a three year period to acquire a SUN
E3000 compute server will multiple CPU's, expanded memory and mass storage. This
expanded computational ability will serve four faculty and their graduate
students for a range of interesting and fundamentally important seismological
research projects including, tomographic imaging of the upper mantle requiring
inversion of huge seismological data sets, production of synthetic, long-period
seismograms using laterally heterogeneous Earth models to ground truth the
validity of inversion schemes applied to actual data sets, studies of the
temporal and spatial distribution of earthquake foci beneath Kilauea volcano,
Hawaii in order to better constrain the mechanisms and conduits for magma
transport, and visualization of the kinematics of fold growth and fault motion
in both 2-D and 3- D using iterative restoration techniques based on high-
quality 3- D seismic data. ***
