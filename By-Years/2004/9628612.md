The Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Iowa
will purchase computer workstations and network servers to augment its existing
network for research in applied and mathematical statistics. The equipment will
be used for several research projects including: (1) Some Correlation Testing
Problems for Spatial Data (2) Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Nonlinear
Continuous-Time Models (3) Inference for Semiparametric Models with Applications
to Analysis of Censored Data (4) Maximum-Likelihood Methods for a Generalized
Class of Multivariate Categorical Response Models (5) Graphical User Interfaces
for Statistical Analysis and Planning. These projects all involve the
development of fundamental statistical methodology which has potential for
immediate applications to the problems of society. Furthermore, all of the
projects involve highly computationally intensive methods and require the
ability to handle large amounts of data. Several also require high-resolution
and dynamic graphics capabilities.
