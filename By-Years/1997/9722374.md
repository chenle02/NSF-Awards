Abstract 9722376 Beeson This is a career award to determine the association
between the kinetics of early T cell activation and the biochemical and
functional response of T cells. During an immune response antigenic peptides
bound to proteins of the major histocompatibility complex(MHC), bind to T cell
receptors. The studies outlined in this award will correlate the structural
features of the reactions between peptide-MHC complexes and specific T cell
receptors with the biochemical reactions involved in an immune response.
Computer models of peptide-MHC complexes will be used to design altered peptides
predicted to slightly enhance or disrupt T-cell receptor binding. This will be
accomplished by substitutions of amino acid residues with side chains that
interact with a TCR. Such altered peptides are known to block or modify normal
immune responses. The kinetics of the reactions between these altered peptide-
MHC ligands and T cell receptors will be studied. Changes in intracellular
calcium, redox potential and cytokine release will be used to relate the
molecular events at the cell-cell interface with the biochemical pathways
responsible for the immune response. For the teaching component the investigator
will incorporate biological topics into the curriculum of an organic chemistry
course. Moreover his graduate and undergraduate students will be doing research
that involves chemistry, biochemistry and immunology. %%% The studies outlined
here will further our understanding of the immune response, by examining in
detail the molecular reactions between the antigen and the T cell receptor and
the biochemical reactions which follow. ***
