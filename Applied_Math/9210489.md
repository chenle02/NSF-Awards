One source of difficulty for time dependent problems for composites is the
presence of an additional length scale in the form of frequency or time of
observation. The goal of this project is to obtain a cogent description of the
response of composites to time-dependent loadings and to arrive at effective
medium theories which give a macroscopic description of the response. In this
phase of this continuing research, the emphasis will be on those cases where the
interaction of the stress and displacement field in the composite with the
boundary is expected to be strong. Of interest is the description of boundary
layer-type phenomena, and their influence on the macroscopic behavior of the
composite. The tools used will be a combination of asymptotic analysis,
analytical methods for partial differential equations, and numerical
experimentation. The eventual goal is to arrive at accurate and efficiently
computable models of wave propagation in, and vibration of, composite
structures. Composite materials are now commonplace building materials,
especially in high-tech applications, therefore it is important to know their
mechanical properties. The goal of this research project is to build on the
knowledge-base on the mechanical properties of composites, with particular
emphasis on their dynamic behavior.
