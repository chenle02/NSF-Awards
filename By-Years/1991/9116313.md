The development of new techniques in molecular biology has opened many new
channels for investigating anthropological questions. Key among these new
techniques is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which allows the quantitative
amplification of exceptionally small quantities of DNA. This has led to the
generation of DNA samples from ancient soft tissues and bone. However, one
unresolved problem derives from the sensitivity of PCR; contamination with
modern DNA can confound the results. This Exploratory Grant for Anthropological
Research will allow the conduct of several well controlled experiments to test
decontamination procedures. The PI will artificially contaminate forensic
samples with genetically engineered DNA. After using various protocols the PCR
amplified DNA can be compared to expected results for precise determination of
the efficiency of decontamination. In addition, though techniques for isolating
DNA from bone have been published, there are no protocols specific to teeth. The
research also will optimize the conditions for isolating DNA from teeth. As
teeth are the hardest part of the body and the most likely to be preserved this
technique will have potential uses in forensic and evolutionary applications.
