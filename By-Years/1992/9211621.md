This research is concerned with techniques for designing and verifying
distributed protocols. It develops a framework for parallel composition of
protocols, applying it to designing adaptive protocols and building a software
tool supporting this meth\-o\-dology. It shows that parallel composition allows
modular development and reuse of existing protocols and demonstrate its
applicability by deriving several protocols. The research involves developing
constructs for specifying interactions between the component protocols and
deriving proof rules to infer properties of the composite protocol from
properties of the component protocols. Results are developed about techniques to
modularize distributed programs. Adaptive protocols significantly improve
performance by taking advantage of the changing environment and adapting
accordingly. The goal is to develop a framework for deriving adaptive protocols
using parallel composition.
