This project involves the research, development, and dissemination of techniques
and tools necessary to perform rigorous, systematic processor design-space
exploration. The key element is a framework in&lt;br/&gt;which architectural
simulators and targeted compilers are automatically derived from a common
architectural description, providing architects, microarchitects, and compiler
developers with a&lt;br/&gt;dynamic, yet coherent, environment within which to
design processor systems. Such a system would enhance productivity and design
quality by tightening the loop between architectural decision-making
and&lt;br/&gt;realistic performance feedback and by allowing for more productive
collaboration among the members of a prototyping team. The resulting reduction
in design cycle times will counter increasingly restrictive&lt;br/&gt;market
pressures, safeguarding the practicality of designing both new general-purpose
microprocessors and application-specific processors (ASIPs), such as those found
in networking hardware, cellular&lt;br/&gt;telephones, and next-generation
digital devices. Additionally, this research will provide invaluable experiences
for both undergraduate and graduate students in computer architecture and
compilers. This&lt;br/&gt;same system is an ideal mechanism by which students
can interact with tangible examples of computer architecture and compiler
concepts -- it will allow them to rapidly prototype systems, experiment with new
ideas, and thereby build intuition about computer systems.
