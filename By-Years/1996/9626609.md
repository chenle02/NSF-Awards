Mesterton-Gibbons 9626609 The investigators use evolutionary game theory to
study cooperative behavior among animals. They work toward a general theory that
categorizes cooperative behavior in nature as kin-selected behavior, group-
selected behavior, byproduct mutualism, or reciprocal altruism. In pursuit of
this goal, their investigation focuses on cooperative behaviors that can be
excluded on a priori grounds from the first two categories mentioned above.
Examples of such behaviors are food sharing in ravens and defensive behavior in
lions. Accordingly, the investigators focus on reciprocity versus mutualism and
develop a mathematical model with the power to discriminate between these two
categories of cooperative behavior. The model is important because many examples
of reciprocity in nature have been hypothesized, but hardly any have been
proven: without such a model, virtually every example is equally interpretable
as a case of mutualism. The goal of the study is to determine whether animals
can cooperate in nature because they keep score of favors done to -- and favors
received from -- specific individuals, or because acting in their long-term
self-interest coincides with acting in the best interest of their community,
even though they do not keep score. From a purely scientific perspective, an
answer to this question will advance current knowledge of animal behavior
considerably. From a more utilitarian perspective, even though the study's
primary subjects are non-human animals in the wild, the investigators' findings
will be relevant to achieving cooperation among humans as well. In particular,
the study's findings may help to solve the urgent problem of the commons, i.e.,
the problem of designing cooperative social structures for sustainable
management of the global environment.
