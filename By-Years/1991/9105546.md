Extension of paleoneurological studies to the spinal cord allows functional and
phylogenetic interpretations of the anatomy and locomotory patterns of fossil
taxa previously thought to be inaccessible. Preliminary morphometric analysis of
vertebrae of living mammalian genera indicates that the mammalian spinal cord
differs from the reptilian cord in several characters with osteological
ramifications. These characters can be used to recognize the appearance of
mammalian spinal traits in the fossil record. A relationship between the size of
segmental spinal cord cross-sectional area and locomotory mode has been
demonstrated in living reptiles and used to predict limb function in extinct
taxa. Measurement of a wide range of living mammalian genera will establish
standards of relative spinal cord size for different locomotory patterns.
Comparison of these values to those obtained from fossil taxa will allow
reconstruction of the adoption of different patterns of limb use in a variety of
mammalian orders. Osteological specimens of living and fossil genera will be
studied in a small number of rich museum collections using computer-based
imaging.
