The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
polymer chemistry between B. Milosavljevic of the Boris Kidrich Institute for
Nuclear Science and J. Kerry Thomas of the University of Notre Dame is to
investigate the effects of high energy radiation on polymer materials. The
researchers propose to develop a theory on the nature of the products formed by
high energy radiation. The high energy radiation work will be carried out at the
Boris Kidrich Institute and polymer characterization will be handled by the
University of Notre Dame on their pulsed laser facility. The results of this
research on the use of radiation to create miniature circuits on polymer
materials will have an important impact in the microelectronics area. This
project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science
and Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav
institution.
