The objective of this research is to develop a damage model to model the crack
growth that occurs in hollow cylinder tests of Indiana limestone, as well as in
other complicated boundary value problems. The damage model will be developed by
implementing a micromechanical model into an elastic finite element code. The
outcome could eventually eliminate the need for empirical constitutive relations
in brittle rocks for which micromechanical models have been developed.
