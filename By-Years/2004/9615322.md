This award is for two years of support to perform radar investigations across
former shear margins at Roosevelt Island and Ice Stream C in order to measure
changes in the configuration and continuity of internal layers and the bed. The
broad goal of these investigations is to gain an understanding of ice stream
flow and the timing and mechanisms of ice stream shutdown. A high-resolution
short-pulse radar system will be used for detailed examination of the uppermost
hundred meters of the firn and ice, and a monopulse sounding-radar system will
be used to image the rest of the ice column (including internal layers) and the
bed. Changes in the shape and continuity of layers will be used to interpret
mechanisms and modes of ice stream flow including the possible migration of
stagnation fronts and rates of shut-down. Variations in bed reflectivity will be
used to deduce basal hydrology conditions across lineations. Accumulation rates
deduced from snow pits and shallow cores will be used to estimate near-surface
depth-age profiles. Improved understanding of ice stream history opens the
possibility of linking changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet with the geologic
evidence from Northern Victoria Land and the ocean record of the retreat of the
grounding line in the Ross Sea.
