This is a study of the role of altruism and self interest in shaping behavior
towards the environment. A better understanding of this relationship is
important because climate change, ozone depletion and loss of biodiversity all
involve resources that are in large part public goods. For this reason, most
mechanisms proposed to mitigate global environmental change involve public
policies that require a tradeoff between individual and collective costs and
benefits in the provision of environmental quality. Structural equation models
will be used to analyze data collected in phone interviews with 500 individuals.
This study will provide baseline information on public views on key global
change issues, such as greenhouse warming and species loss. The study will also
contribute to our understanding of how willingness to pay for public policies
aimed at reducing global warming and speciesloss depend on environmental
attitudes and values.
