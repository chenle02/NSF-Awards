This SGER proposal addresses a high-risk area in current wide-area high
performance networking - precise and insightful network measurement. Network
measurement is high-risk for this environment because it is extremely difficult
to do with any real accuracy or impact. This proposal seeks to develop and
prototype methods, techniques, and guidelines for deploying and using state-of-
the-art measurement tools to create a uniform measurement infrastructure across
the International Research Network Connections (IRNC) funded by NSF.
