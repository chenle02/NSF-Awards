The evolutionary causes of genetic differentiation in natural plant populations
are poorly understood. Estimates of gene flow are necessary to distinguish the
relative roles of selection and random genetic drift in producing population
structure. The purpose of the proposed research is to estimate the contributions
of gene flow, the mating system and selection to population genetic
differentiation in the marine angiosperm, Zostera marina L (eelgrass).
Preliminary data suggests that eelgrass populations are genetically
differentiated, despite the potential for long distance dispersal and high
turnover rates of colonization patches in the marine environment. Estimates of
the effective population size, the mating system and the contribution of adult
migration to realized gene flow will be incorporated into existing predictive
models of genetic differentiation. The possibility that genetic drift
contributes to observed population structure will be evaluated by 1) estimates
of the spatial scale over which gene flow occurs, and 2) transplant experiments
designed to detest spatially varying selection. Information gained from this
study will be used to evaluate the generality of tends regarding pollination
systems, gene flow and population genetic structure established in terrestrial
systems.
