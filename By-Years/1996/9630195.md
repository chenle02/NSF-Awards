9630195 Pratt Because plants are immobile and also depend upon sunlight as
their source of useful free energy, it is important that they be able to modify
their growth and development in accordance with their ambient light environment.
It is therefore reasonable that plants have evolved a number of photosensory
pigments, among which the phytochromes are the best understood. The focus of
this research is on the properties and function of a newly discovered
phytochrome, phyF. Specific objectives focus on two general goals. Firstly, and
most importantly, the function(s) of phyF will be identified and related to
those of other phytochromes. Secondly, key physicochemical properties of phyF
will be identified as a prelude to understanding its immediate, molecular mode
of action. Collectively, this work will provide a relatively complete picture of
this newly discovered phytochrome and will form the basis not only for future
investigations directed towards elucidating its immediate mode of action and its
structure/function relationships, but also for exploiting its potential for crop
improvement.
