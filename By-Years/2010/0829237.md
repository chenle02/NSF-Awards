A novel approach will be developed to realizing immune system
functionalities&lt;br/&gt;in automotive engines animating living organisms. Such
a system would enable automotive and robust detection of abnormal behavior to
achieve desired system performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cross-disciplinary
investigation could fundamentally change design process of complex systems such
as engines and machines, and enhance education. Design of self-configuring
anomaly detection agents analogous to the white blood cells in the human
organism will become a new trend of design approaches for mechanical systems and
machines. &lt;br/&gt;
