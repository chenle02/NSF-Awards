Computational Statistics is emerging as an important area in its own right,
focussing on the development of statistical methodology which could not exist
outside of the framework of modern computing resources. This research activity
will focus on three principal areas which include the visualization of high
dimensional structures, modern nonparametric statistical inference methods for
high dimensional data and computational algorithms related to these methods.
Specifically: Three dimensional Andrews and related plots; The grand tour in
three dimensions; Data set mapping; Finding structure in k-dimensions using
grand tour and parallel coordinates; Nonparametric density estimation in high
inference using ridge estimation in hyperspace; and Computational algorithms for
generalized nonparametric function estimation.
