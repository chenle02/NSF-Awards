9616241 Hammond Trace element distributions in seawater and in the sediment
record are often used as proxies for both modern and paleooceanographic
conditions or processes. However, before their full potential can be realized,
the behavior of these elements after deposition and shallow burial on the
seafloor must be clarified. In this study, researchers at Oregon State
University and the University of Southern California will study the geochemistry
of two potential paleoindicator elements, barium and germanium, in the hard
parts of planktonic marine organisms deposited in sediments collected from
several oceanic regions. Specifically they will evaluate the common assumptions
that Ge is not fractionated from deposited siliceous frustules and that the
Ba:Alkalinity relation in seawater is related to a coupled stoichiometry between
organic carbon decomposition, dissolution of barium, and dissolution of calcium
carbonate. The results are expected to better define the advantages and
limitations of these elements as tools for paleooceanographic reconstructions.
