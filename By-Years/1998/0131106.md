The focus of this research is to extend diffusion clock methods to determine the
rate constant of propagation, ionization (activation) and deactivation in the
living polymerization of isobutylene, styrene and styrene derivatives, as a
function of solvent, temperature and catalyst. Knowledge of these rate constants
is fundamental for overall control in cationic polymer synthesis and also
important in new catalyst development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Rudolf Faust in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts,
Lowell. Professor Faust will focus his work on determining the absolute rate
constants in cationic polymerization. These studies will promote renewed
research in catalyst design and thus lead to the production of more efficient
polymerization catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
