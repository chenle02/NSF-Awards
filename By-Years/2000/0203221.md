&lt;br/&gt;The research builds upon previous work in the area of protein
diffusion on the surface of erythrocytes. The investigator will develop
numerical algorithms to efficiently evolve the shape of the cell membrane as a
function of time. Thermal fluctuations insure that the membrane's dynamics will
be stochastic and it is anticipated, on the basis of preliminary results, that
these fluctuations will be sufficiently large in amplitude and sufficiently long
in duration to account for the escape of band 3 protein from the cytoskeletal
"corrals "on the surface of the red blood cell. The simulations may provide a
microscopic justification for the choice of empirical parameters in earlier
studies, or, it may prove necessary to include the dynamics of the cytoskeleton
to achieve agreement with experiments. In either eventuality, the investigation
will quantify the relative importance of membrane fluctuations and cytoskeletal
dynamics on protein mobility. The algorithms developed will be of use in future
studies of cell motility and other biological behavior that is dependent upon
dynamic membrane fluctuations.&lt;br/&gt;
