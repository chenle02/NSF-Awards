CTS-9311159 Purdue University Hilary H. Lackritz ABSTRACT The
spectroellipsometer to be acquired with this equipment award will be used for
the investigation of local microstructure and optical properties of polymeric
films in conjunction with other spectroscopic methods. Different techniques for
the preparation of the films (Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, spin-coating, and
dip-coating) will be compared on the basis of film characteristics. Thin polymer
films and their optical properties are important to the economic competitiveness
of the Nation in production of new generations of computers and audiovisual
equipment. wa F H ! ! ! F ~ ~ ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp; Arial Apple
