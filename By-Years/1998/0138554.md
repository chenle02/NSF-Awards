ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CCR-0138554 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Janos Sztipanovits (Adam
Porter) &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Vanderbilt University (U Md)&lt;br/&gt;Title:
Workshop, December 13-14, 2001, on New Visions for Software Design and
Productivity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports costs of travel and local
arrangements for a workshop to define a future vision for Software Design and
Productivity (SDP) research. The workshop is hosted by Vanderbilt University on
December 13-14, 2001, bringing together 50 to 75 software researchers to discuss
the directions for research over the next 10 years to improve software
development productivity and quality. The participation is determined by a
national call for white papers on SDP research and a review by a Program
Committee established for that purpose. Successful applicants are invited to
join Federal agency representatives and policy makers to identify research
needs, capabilities, and shortfalls through open discussions. The final product
of the project is a full report on the outcomes of the workshop that will be
made available to Federal SDP R&amp;D program managers and the community at
large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
