The first area of research involves the study of functions of a Markov process
and is motivated by problems in modelling the dynamics of ionic channels in cell
membranes. Problems of identifiability, characterization, restoration of noisy
recordings, and parameter estimation are outlined. The second area of research
has to do with the study of drug interactions and fitting response surfaces by
asynergistic functions.
