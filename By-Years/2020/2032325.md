The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is development of a novel, safe and effective,
non-invasive, vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no approved
vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, and some candidates are administered intramuscularly.
The proposed intranasal vaccine directly interacts with the respiratory tract
and may provide improved protection and virus clearance. The proposed vaccine is
non-invasive, easy to administer, and may be effective in a single dose, thus
impacting future social distancing needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop an intranasal
coronavirus vaccine and determine the most promising formulation, with tasks
including: 1) synthesis of novel coronavirus antigens and formulation of
intranasal vaccine using liposome nanoparticles, including antigen discovery,
liposome nanoparticle formulation, and in vitro characterization; 2) preclinical
testing of intranasal coronavirus vaccine in an animal model, including
intranasal vaccination, serum antibody analysis, virus challenge and analysis of
protection efficacy. The outcome of this Phase I study is to obtain an optimized
nanoparticle intranasal vaccine formulation for induction of robust T and B cell
responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
