This project is a National Science Foundation and National Bureau of Standards
outreach program for faculty of minority institutions. The proposed conference
presents an opportunity for NSF to acquaint 25 faculty members from 15-20
minority institutions with relevant NSF programs and NSF in general. It also
provides an opportunity for NSF program officers to identify key people at
minority institutions who can facilitate the identification of potential
reviewers and who can identify researchers and encourage participation in NSF
programs. The strengths of the proposal are that (1) prior conferences have been
judged useful to the National Bureau of Standards, (2) joint sponsorship will
significantly reduce the costs for all sponsoring agencies and programs, (3)
this form of activity moves beyond passive approaches of individual programs and
acts as a catalyst for the whole Foundation.
