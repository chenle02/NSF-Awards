The PI will continue to investigate circulation mechanisms of tropical climate
variability, using upper-air data sets, in particular the National Center for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
40-year reanalysis, land surface station records and long-term ship observations
in the tropical oceans. The annual cycle, interannual variability, and long-term
evolution will be examined. Specific tasks are the following: a) to investigate
upper-air mechanisms of the Southern and North Atlantic Oscillations; b) to
undertake diagnostic basis for seasonal forecasting of the Indian summer monsoon
rainfall and boreal autumn rainy season of East Africa by examining upper-air
processes in the Indian Ocean; c) to evaluate equatorial zonal circulations
using the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and NCEP-NCAR
reanalyses datasets; d) to develop climate prediction techniques for the Indian
summer monsoon rainfall and short rains of East Africa based on diagnostic
methods; e) to study centers of action, in particular the long-term evolution of
the North Atlantic Oscillation and climate of East Asia, using the NCEP-NCAR
data set; and f) to continue synergistic activities including contributions to
training courses in Tropical Meteorology in the United States.
