Financial support is requested for acquisition of a mass selective detector to
be used with an existing gas chromatograph. The resulting gas chromatograph-mass
spectrometer combination would be used in structure determination of complex
biological molecules in plant extracts. Applications in structure determination
include studies of the complex carbohydrate portion of plasma membrane
arabinogalatan-proteins and studies of possible non-amino acid constituents of
oil body proteins. Applications in detection and quantitation include
measurements of endogenous plant hormones in plants exposed to drought or
chilling stress and in seeds during germination. These projects require
capabilities of sensitive and quantitative chemical identification that cannot
be achieved without a mass selective detector.
