Consumer products often carry warranties which are either one- dimensional
(indexed by time in service or amount of usage) or two- dimensional (indexed by
both of these variables). The focus of this project is on two-dimensional
warranties, virtually an unaddressed topic. The warranty scenario raises at
least two classes or research issues: the specification of an optimum
price/warranty combination, and the forecast of a reserve fund to meet future
claims. The former is multidisciplinary, involving aspects of economics, game
theory, marketing, operations research, and probabilistic modeling. The latter
involves the analysis of time series and point processes in two dimensions, for
which the use of Bayesian methods is appropriate. This project addresses the
following aspects of these issues. 1. Formalization of the first issue to
facilitate mathematical development of the individual pieces. 2. Development of
probabilistic models for the occurrence of events (failures) indexed by time and
usage. 3. Renewal theory for points in a plane generated by the models
developed. 4. Development of meaningful utility functions based on subjective
probability considerations which describe the competitive behavior between
manufacturers and consumers, and between manufacturers. 5. Development of a
technology for undertaking times series analysis in two dimensions. 6.
Statistical inference for point processes in a plane. Although all aspects of
the project are motivated by the warranty problem, items 2, 3, 5, and 6 have
scientific merit of their own and will provide new tools for the decision
sciences.
