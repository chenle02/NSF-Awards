The aim of Dr. Feher's research program is to contribute toward an understanding
of the primary processes in photosynthesis, i.e., the mechanism of conversion of
electromagnetic energy into chemical free energy. He is focusing his studies on
the photosynthetic process in purple bacteria (e.g. Rhodopseudomonas
sphaeriodes). The work is divided into two main categories: 1) Structural
aspects of the reaction center: In parallel with the determination of the
spatial (three dimensional) structure of the bacteriochlorophyll-protein complex
called the reaction center (RC), the electronic structure of the primary
reactants (donors and acceptors) is being determined by a variety of techniques,
including electron paramagnetic resonance, electron nuclear double resonance and
optical spectroscopy. The effects of structural modifications of the RC (e. g.
by site directed mutagenesis, removal of iron etc.) on the function are being
investigated. 2) Functional aspects of the reaction center: Electron transfer in
RCs is being investigated by measuring the effect of electric fields on the
kinetics as well as the effect of isotopic substitution (deuteration).
Protonation of both the one and two electron states is being studied using site
directed mutagenesis.
