CoCoRaHS or the Community Collaborative Rain and Hail Study builds on previously
funded NSF research on precipitation patterns in the western portion of the US.
This award will expand the current citizen science efforts to include those
living in the Great Plains including Eastern Colorado, Western Nebraska,
Northwest Kansas and Southeast Wyoming. Participants gain experience in data
collection and analysis while working with scientists and contributing to a
national research study. CoCoRaHS volunteers will learn about the impact of
regional weather patterns on agriculture, water resources and environmental
quality while collecting rain, hail and snow data. Participants are also invited
to take part in other activities to build on the research experience including a
series of seminars, field trips and workshops. The project will result in the
development of the following materials: graphic depictions of data using ARC-GIS
software, a teacher curriculum, an upgraded website and a quarterly newsletter.
