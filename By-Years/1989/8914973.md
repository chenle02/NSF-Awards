This project is directed at increasing the number of Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) involved in VLSI CAD-related teaching and
research. More specifically, appropriate faculty from selected HBCU's will be
identified to serve as the focal point for their universities VLSI activities.
These participants will attend the 2nd Annual VLSI Education Conference and
Exposition which will provide a forum for communication between educators,
industrial representatives, government sponsors and vendors in areas of common
interest in VLSI education. The targeted HBCU's are: Tuskeegee University,
Southern University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, Howard University,
Hampton University and Prairie View A&amp;M University. The benefits of this
effort are twofold. First, faculty participants from the HBCU's will gain ideas
on course and laboratory development, research opportunities, access to contacts
throughout the country, etc. Secondly, it is anticipated that these faculty will
serve as the catalysts for involving HBCU's more aggressively in the national
focus on VLSI.
