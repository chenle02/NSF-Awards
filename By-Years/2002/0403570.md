This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing a
conference on "High Energy Physics and Cosmology". . It will take place from
December 17-21 at the Lago Mar Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. . The funds
will be used entirely to support graduate students, Post-docs and junior faculty
who otherwise could not afford to attend the meeting. This meeting will be of
particular benefit to the students and young scientists attending this meeting
as it will provide them with a broad picture of progress in understanding the
interface between cosmology and high energy physics. The conference is well
timed to provide information from recent experiments at MiniBooNe, MINOS,
KamLAND &lt;br/&gt;SuperK and SNO. It will be a great opportunity for students
and PostDocs to learn from the distinguished speakers and become appraised of
the most recent exciting data on neutrinos and cosmology. The aim of the NSF
funding will be to partial support for lodging, travel and registration for
students and young scientists. A committee is being set up to administer the
funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of $5000 is requested for 12
months.&lt;br/&gt;
