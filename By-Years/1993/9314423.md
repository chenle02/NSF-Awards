9314423 Benkovic This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in biochemistry between Stephen J. Benkovic and Jean-Pierre Mahy of the
University Rene Descartes, Paris, France. The objective of their research is to
create catalytic antibodies, similar to those found in hemeproteins, with the
ability to induce an immunological response to an appropriate hapten. A hapten
is an antigen that is incomplete and cannot by itself cause antibody formation.
The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in antibody
induction, screening and selection of catalysts. He will focus on the
mechanistic characterization of antibody promoted reactions and produce a
computer model of the antibody structure. This is complemented by the French
investigator's expertise in the synthesis, characterization and chemical
properties of porphyrin haptens. The research will advance the development of
these catalytic antibodies and enhance understanding of the influence of
proteins on the catalytic properties of "heme" - the iron component of
hemoglobin. ***
