Ion lasers, which were first used for large-scale commercial applications in the
late 1970's, have been improved steadily over the past 10 years. While
replacements for these basically inefficient lasers are frequently discussed,
these replacements seem always to be just over the horizon. In fact, broad-based
commercial applications have been developed on the basis of continuous
improvements in reliability and cost reduction. The recent development of dense,
vacuum-tight aluminum nitride (AlN) presents the possibility of one more major
improvement in this technology. Presently, the plasma- confinement bore is made
of beryllium oxide (BeO), which is expensive, poisonous, and suffers from
limited availability. AlN, which is being developed as a heatsink material for
the electronics industry, is potentially very low cost, non-toxic and is
available from a wide range of domestic suppliers. The proposed work will
evaluate the suitability of AlN as a laser bore material. Techniques for
metalizing and brazing the material must be developed and the material's ability
to withstand the heat loads and plasma erosion effects of an air-colled ion
laser must be tested.
