This project aims to develop efficient numerical algorithms for a class of
important systems in science and engineering that are modeled with high-
dimensional partial differential equations (PDE) such as the many-body
Schr√∂dinger equation. Examples of such systems include many-body quantum
mechanics, dynamics of chemical systems, learning and control of complex
systems, and spectral methods for high-dimensional data. The numerical solution
of high-dimensional PDE has been one of the greatest challenges in computational
science and remains a formidable task even with today's computational power and
algorithmic advances. Efficient numerical simulations present opportunities for
major breakthroughs in scientific understanding. This project will employ modern
techniques to develop novel efficient numerical algorithms for such important
systems. Graduate students will be trained through involvement in the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project combines mathematical
analysis and algorithmic design to make progress in numerical methods for high-
dimensional PDE. The research will draw from and further develop ideas and tools
from recent advances in computational physics, quantum chemistry, and machine
learning. In particular, the project will use modern techniques for large-scale
optimization and nonlinear parameterization of high-dimensional functions.
Specifically, the PI will (1) develop novel highly efficient coordinate
algorithms for large-scale eigenvalue problems, and (2) develop and analyze
efficient methods based on neural-network parameterization of the solutions for
high-dimensional PDE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
