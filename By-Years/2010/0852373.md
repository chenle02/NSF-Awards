ABSTRACT: SOUTHEASTERN LIE THEORY WORKSHOP SERIES

Lie theory represents a major area of mathematical research. Besides its
increasing importance within mathematics to geometry, topology, combinatorics,
and algebra, it has important applications outside of mathematics in areas such
as physics, chemistry and computer science. Over the last 30 years, the
universities in the southeastern region of USA have hired a steady stream of
mathematicians working on different aspects of Lie theory and its applications.
This project focuses on using the current infrastructure to build a sense of
regional unity and foster cohesive research collaborations in the region. Annual
regional workshops (for 3-4 days) in Lie theory will be held. These workshops
will bring together senior and junior researchers (including graduate students),
and create an academic environment which will encourage the exchange of ideas
along with the awareness of research opportunities.

This project will also setup a regional network of researchers in Lie Theory to
improve communication and collaboration. This network will significantly
strengthen the recruitment and retention of graduate students in mathematics,
the placement of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who have been
trained in the southeast, the visibility of area mathematics departments at both
the national and international levels, and the quality of graduate education and
research in mathematics. Funding from this grant will support the first three
annual workshops in Lie theory. These will be held at the North Carolina State
University (2009), the University of Georgia (2010), and the University of
Virginia (2011).
