The objectives of this project are: to relate noise production to gas dispersion
phenomena occurring in agitated tanks; to investigate to what extent the
interaction between the sparge ring and impeller controls bubble size; and to
develop a non-visual characterization method for the assessment of gas
dispersion in chemical engineering processes. The work is based upon classical
sound analysis techniques, coherence studies, and acoustic intensity
measurements. The three major regions of interest include the impeller region,
the bulk of the tank, and the sparge ring area. The investigations identify the
various sound sources in gas dispersion and their paths to receivers, determine
the noise characteristics in frequency and space of the various gas dispersion
phenomena occurring in the tank, and rank the various sound sources as to their
importance to receivers. The equipment consists of hydrophones, hydrophone
calibrator, and power amplifier.
