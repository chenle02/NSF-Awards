ATM-9420045 The Principal Investigator and his research staff will continue
their research on the analysis and numerical simulation of convective storms and
associated severe weather phenomena. The research is aimed at furthering
understanding of the processes involved in the transformation of thunderstorms
to mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and the quantification of the role of
potential vorticity on the genesis and evolution of MCSs. The researchers also
will investigate the physical factors responsible for the formation and
maintenance of severe straight line winds and tornadoes. The research combines
the use of an interactive, nested-grid model, viz. Colorado State University s
(CSU) Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) with analysis of data gathered
by high- resolution observational systems, including the CSU-CHILL radar, a
national research facility. The linkage between modeling and observations
provides iterative testing of hypotheses by numerical simulations, validation
and refinement mf the models and objectively analyzed documentation of storms.
An additional important element of the planned work lies in new developments in
the RAMS' physics and numerics. ***
