9410646 Chen This project investigates a challenging problem in nonlinear
control. It aims to provide a systematic synthesis procedure for designing
output tracking controllers that apply to nonminimum phase nonlinear systems.
Not only does the controller provide stable asymptotic tracking, it also ensures
that the transient error will be within a prespecified bound. This achieved by
using a novel approach of stable inversion. In this approach, the nonminimum
phase system is first stably inverted to obtain desired (and stable) state and
input trajectories that map exactly into the reference trajectory. With this,
the nonminimum phase control problem is converted into a minimum phase one. Then
a feedback controller is designed to stabilize the closed- loop system and to
ensure robustness to certain types of uncertainties. This research is expected
to make significant contributions to the tracking problem as well as the basic
understanding of nonlinear systems. The new procedures developed can be applied
to many engineering problems, such as aircraft control, rocket control, medical
equipment, nondestructive evaluation, leading to superior performance and
economic benefits. ***
