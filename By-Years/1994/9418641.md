Proposal Number: IBN-9418641 Principal Investigator: Cheryl Sisk This award is
to provide a high-resolution epifluorescence microscope for research
neuroendocrinologists at Michigan State University. High-resultion fluorescence
microscopy will be used to localize biological molecules to specific
subcompartments of individual cells within particular areas of the nervous
system. These molecules are tagged with fluorescent markers that show particular
colors under ultraviolet light. That way different molecules can be tagged with
different colors to determine, for example, if a particular pair of molecules
occur together or separately inside specific cells. These scientists will use
the microscope for concurrent detection of activity-dependent markers and
steroid receptor proteins, for comparisons of enzyme expression patterns in mast
cells and glia, and for colocalization of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters in
different regions of the brain. Furthermore, this technique can be used to
determine how the distribution of these molecules changes when the animal is
involved in different behaviors or, for example, is subjected to different
photoperiods such as those that occur with the seasons. This microscope will
also be equipped with a teaching head so that the scientists can use the
microscope for teaching undergraduates these state-of-the-art histological and
immunocytochemical techniques.
