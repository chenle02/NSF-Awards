9353094 Gardner This project is continuing the development and testing of
dotsplus, a tactile printing technique that incudes both braille and raised
graphic images. Dotsplus is primarily intended for mathematics, science,
engineering, and other technical documents for which braille is very cumbersome
or impossible. Project activities include the conduct of wider tests and
continued development of supporting technology. The project director is
collaborating with braille authorities and with a group developing a tactile
computer screen. He is also working with several European groups on
technological developments and methodology for education of disabled students on
making mathematics symbols on computer screens accessible, and on document
storage standards. ***
