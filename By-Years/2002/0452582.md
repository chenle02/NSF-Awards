This proposal asks for funds to convene a multi-disciplinary workshop to address
the social psychology and social cognition underlying survey participation. The
goal is to expand on recent theory and research in social psychology related to
persuasion, cooperation, motivation, person-perception, and interpersonal
interaction, to examine the issue of survey nonresponse in detail.

In order to realize this potential, the investigators would convene a workshop
of 15 to 20 individuals from the fields of social psychology, sociology,
anthropology, linguistics, statistics, and survey methodology. A workshop that
runs for three days and takes place in a retreat setting would allow the
participants to get to know one another well and encourage the development and
exchange of ideas. Workshop proceedings would be recorded, and a report prepared
for publication.

To prepare for the workshop, a planning group will write a white paper to review
the theoretical perspectives that might be of relevance and to formulate a set
of questions to be addressed by the workshop. The investigator propose that this
planning group, (Colm O'Muircheartaigh, Norman Bradburn, Kenneth Rasinski, Jon
Krosnick, and Robert Groves) meet to formulate the agenda for next year's
workshop and decide on the participants.
