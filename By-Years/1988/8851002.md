Combining coursework with an apprenticeship program, this 2.5-year project will
prepare "crossover" teachers from other disciplines to teach middle school
mathematics and science. Each summer, the 56 participants will attend a three-
week summer workshop at which they will study appropriate mathematics and
science content and related teaching strategies. The 28 science teachers will
focus on chemistry and physics, while the 28 mathematics teachers will study
problem-solving, probability and statistics, and other topics in middle school
curriculum. Teams of four teachers from the same district will be led by a
master teacher who will provide guidance and support during the academic year.
Academic-year activities will also include eight meetings of participants with
the project staff. The evaluation will identify those characteristics that
promote the success of "crossover" teachers in their new role. The university
and the school districts are contributing in cost- sharing an amount equal to
32% of the NSF award.
