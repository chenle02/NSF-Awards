The work proposed considers the fracture of linearly elastic materials under
dynamic loading in the presence of limited plastic effects. A micromechanical
view is adopted, and the effects represented by arrays of crystals defects, or
dislocations. These are studied in a series of idealized, transient problems.
This transient nature itself distinguishes the work from many existing crack-
dislocation studies. Such analyses must confront mathematical difficulties which
do not arise in quasi-static studies. Nevertheless, length scale and wave
propagation considerations place a premium on exact, preferably analytic,
solutions. A major task of the proposed work is in boundary/initial value
problem solution development.
