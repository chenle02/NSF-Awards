This award to Dr. Rebek of the Scripps Research Institute is funded by the
Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program and is directed at
harnessing the unusual behavior of molecules in confined spaces to perform a
number of desirable tasks. The confined spaces are the reversibly formed
capsules and the tasks comprise the control, acceleration and even catalysis of
reactions inside the space. Capsules with chiral spaces will be applied in
asymmetric synthesis and separation science. Capsules attached to surfaces built
up through layer-by-layer self-assembly will "write" information on the
nanoscale. Polymeric capsules will be prepared, characterized and evaluated as
"smart" materials. These materials respond by expansion and contraction to
changes in signals in the environment.

The majority of all medicines are synthetic small molecules that exert their
beneficial effects by fitting into the small spaces of human proteins. This
proposal intends to research the behavior of molecules in the small spaces
inside synthetic containers. The size, shape and chemical surface of the
containers are controlled by laboratory synthesis designed to manipulate the
container and contained molecules to perform tasks. The tasks include reversible
expansion like muscle movement, storing information like nanoscale computers and
acting as reaction chambers as a laboratory flask. Students and postdoctoral
fellows will be trained on how to perform research; these researchers are likely
to move on to the nearby biotech and hightech industries. This project attracts
high school teachers and students in the San Diego area. The Scripps outreach
program on campus will manage these summer internships.
