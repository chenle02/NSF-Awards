"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Sensory Ecology of an Animal Communication Network"
(IBN 0239164/0238854)

Animal communication is often multi-modal, as production and detection of
signals may involve several sensory modes. Conspicuous, multi-modal signals may
be intercepted by receivers that are intended (potential mates) or unintended
(eavesdropping competitors and predators) and the evolution of signaling
behavior is subject to trade-offs between conflicting selection pressures. This
research will use field observation, environmental measurement and laboratory
experimentation to examine how eavesdropping competitors and predators intercept
and exploit the courtship signals of spiders. Studies will examine how visual
and vibratory signals of male wolf spiders are influenced by the complex forest
floor environment and transmitted within a "communication network" of potential
receivers. The "active space", or transmission range of multi-modal signals will
be measured in the field with computer-assisted illuminance spectrophotometry
and laser doppler vibration recording. Sensory cue isolation and video/audio
playback experiments will determine how multiple modes of communication
influence signal detection by other spiders, as well as vertebrate and
invertebrate predators. Taken together, results of field and laboratory studies
will allow a better understanding of animal communication in a complex
environment. Collaboration between researchers from a university and a liberal
arts college will promote teaching, training and learning through post-doctoral
training, involvement of undergraduate students from both institutions in the
research, and a research and education partnership with the environmental
education center where field research is done.
