The foci of this research are twofold. First, the development of new
independently folded polypeptide motifs will be carried out. The two design
targets are an all beta-structure (BBB) motif and a mixed alpha- and beta-
structure patterned after charybotoxin which includes a number of disulfides in
the native state. Second, the structure of the BBA motif will be manipulated to
effect the formation of a discrete dimeric structure by `domain swapping.` A key
feature of the dimerization studies will be the development of fluorescent amino
acids with solvatochromic properties for studying protein association phenomena.
With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Barbara Imperiali of the Division of Chemistry at
the California Institute of Technology. Professor Imperiali will focus her work
on designing and developing methods for the de novo synthesis of functional
polypeptides. The detailed analysis of the cooperative forces involved in
folding small oligopeptides into compact structures will contribute to the
understanding of the architecture of the protein biopolymer.
