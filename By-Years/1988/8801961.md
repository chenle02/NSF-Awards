This research is concerned with the analysis of very large systems of linear
and integral equations having some particular mathematical structure and with
the derivation of efficient algorithms for such equations. This includes
1)analysis of the definition of recursive and parallel recursive structure of
matrices and kernels; 2)algorithm design for implementation on modern computer
architectures; 3)convergence and complexity analysis of difference schemes for
the numerical solution of integral equations with structured kernel; and
4)roundoff error analysis of fast algorithms.
