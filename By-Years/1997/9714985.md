Graves 9714985 The Material Handling Research Colloquium (MHRC) is a biannual
event that attracts the leading researchers in the field, focuses on the current
state of material handling research, and influences future directions for
research. The prime goal of the 1998 MHRC is to enhance its stature as a major
international forum that strengthens and broadens communication between U.S.
researchers, both academic and industrial, and their counterparts in Europe and
Asia. A second goal is to increase the participation of the material handling
user community of researchers and the site of Motorola Semiconductor and
educational facilities in Tempe, Arizona is expected to assist in this regard.
In addition to Motorola Corporation, the Material Handling Institute, Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of
Louisville, and Penn State University are co-sponsors along with the National
Science Foundation. Encouraging this MHRC model for research interaction and
communication in the international research community should help to link the
U.S. focus on system operations to the European focus on equipment design and
the Pacific run focus on controls and intelligent systems. A successful 1998
MHRC should also see increased numbers of user industry researchers
participating with academies and material handling equipment producer
representation.
