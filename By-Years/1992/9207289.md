The Sixth Meeting of the International Society of Molecular Plant- Microbe
Interactions (IS-MPMI) will be held in Seattle, Washington, 11-17 July, 1992.
This society has member scientists from 25 countries who are studying
interactions between bacteria, and fungi with their host plants, using molecular
techniques. These interactions include both the microorganism and the response
of the host. Members of the society are also interested in the consequences and
applications of these interactions to biotechnology. This meeting represents the
major forum for the exchange of information and ideas between scientists whose
research is providing a rapidly expanding body of knowledge in an increasingly
important area of research in plant science.
