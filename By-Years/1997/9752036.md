MPR Associates is preparing two multimedia curriculum packages to support
curricular initiatives in both secondary schools and community colleges. Each
module permits independent study, encourages collaboration among students, and
provides a compendium of resources to assist students in addressing authentic
workplace issues. The project is taking place over three years during which two
scenarios are being constructed and tested in NSF systemic initiative sites and
elsewhere. They are being built around the design and maintenance issues raised
by the Boeing 777. These materials will lead to strong learning experiences for
high school students headed for careers as technicians in workplaces that rely
on the use of advanced technologies. The focus will be on careers in aviation
and the mathematics, science, and technology subjects that arise in important
and engaging ways within this industry. National mathematics, science, and
technology standards will be incorporated into two "electronic scenarios"
combining video, graphics, gaming, simulation, and text into a computer-managed
multimedia package, Products of this grant will include the complete multimedia
curriculum packages, a teacher's guide, and evaluation and dissemination
activities.
