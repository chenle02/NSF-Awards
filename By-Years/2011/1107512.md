This is a doctoral dissertation research project on how young Alaska Native
women develop leadership skills through an ethnographic examination of Native
Nations Pageants. Native Nations Pageants are not beauty contests, the
participants are judged on a broad range of skills including: knowledge of their
heritage language, traditional storytelling, singing, or dancing, and
demonstrated leadership skills. Although Native Nations Pageants have existed
since the 1950s, very little scholarship beyond descriptive narratives has been
done to date. This research project will examine why the many American Indian
and Arctic Nations have adapted the western construct of a ?beauty contest,?
into their own culturally appropriate form. This project will study the
relationship between these pageants in Alaska and their relationship to
developing young women as role models and leaders for Alaskan communities.
Understanding the process of developing young leaders in indigenous communities
could be critical to creating opportunities for creating leadership skills and
the long-term sustainability and well being of these diverse communities and
cultural groups.
