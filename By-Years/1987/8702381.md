Cell-cell interactions and later developmental events during the Chlamydomonas
sexual cycle are known (or presumed) to be controlled by alleles at the mt, or
"mating-type" locus. mt exemplifies a master regulatory gene orchestrating the
expression of groups of unlinked cell- type-specific genes. This proposal
describes work designed to determine which aspects of sexual development are
under direct mt regulation, and to define the circuitry of genetic pathways that
underlies progression of the sexual cycle. Intensive searches for mutant
phenotypes showing mating-type-limited expression will be conducted. Altered
chloroplast gene transmission (under mt control) will be used to identify
mating- type-limited (mtl) mutants. Through the characterization of sexual
development in mutant strains (microscopy), analysis of chloroplast inheritance
(marker transmission genetics and DNA-specific flourescence microscopy),
measurement of linkage between mt1 gene loci, and definition of epistatic
interactions between these genes in constructed double mutant strains, the mt
locus will be identified and distinguished from the genes it regulates.
Induction of second-site suppressor mutations and characterization of the
suppressed strains will be used to further clarify the primary functions of the
mtl loci. Genetic analysis of mating mutants will also be used to evaluate
alternative models for the mating-type "switching" typical of homothallic
species. The proposed experiments will lay a genetic foundation for the eventual
understanding of the molecular basis of differentiation of the sexual stage of
the organism. Chlamydmonas is a simple one-celled plant and an understanding of
the mechanisms involved in the simple differentiation of mating types may give
insight into the more complex mechanisms used in differentiation in higher
plants.
