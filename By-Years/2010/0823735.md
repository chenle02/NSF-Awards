This award supports participation of doctoral students from U.S. universities in
the 12th SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium to be held July 13-14, 2008 in Chicago,
IL in conjunction with the 23rd National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
July 13-17, 2008. The Doctoral Consortium aims to: (1) provide a setting for
feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research
directions; (2) develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of
collaborative research; and (3) support a new generation of researchers. The
Doctoral Consortium organizers strive to recruit and include students from
underrepresented groups (e.g., women and underrepresented minorities) and
smaller schools and schools with less established programs in artificial
intelligence. Each student gives a 25-minute presentation to be followed by 20
minutes of discussion; there are one-on-one meeting with a faculty mentor. There
will also be opportunities to discuss career issues in both academic and other
career pathways. A report on the Consortium will be published in the AI
Magazine.
