In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Cynthia Larive of the University of California
- Riverside and her graduate student researchers will be supported to develop
instrumentation for coupling online microcoil nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
detection with electrophoretic separation. The group will investigate the
structure of the biologically important glycosaminoglycan (GAG) carbohydrate
with two-dimensional NMR methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy is an important physical chemical method that gives
precise chemical and structural information. The methods that Prof. Larive and
her student researchers will develop will enable scientists to determine the
solution-phase structures of some important carbohydrates. The work has the
potential to provide important information on the biosynthesis of these
carbohydrates, as well as guiding scientists in the design of new drugs and
measurements of purity of related GAG-based pharmaceuticals (e.g. heparin). The
graduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in
developing cutting-edge analytical NMR experiments. As part of this work, Prof.
Larive will continue her strong efforts at encouraging students from
underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences.
