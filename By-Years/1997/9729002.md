Emotional expression in language shows great variation crosslinguistically; how
and to what extent are questions central to linguistic and cognitive
anthropology. Preliminary research on written materials indicates that emotions
which we English speakers would call 'love' can be subdivided in Japanese into
two native categories, koi and ai. Japanese also has different grammatical
characteristics of emotional expression, the discursive rules for which are not
yet thoroughly understood for two of three descriptive word classes.
Furthermore, many anthropological and popular sources describe a preference for
nonexpression or underexpression of emotion as a Japanese cultural ideal. The
interaction of these semantic, grammatical, and cultural phenomena has never
been examined. There are, however, sites in Japanese culture where emotional
expression is valued and expected, which would allow data collection through
interview and participant observation. Enka is an overtly emotionally
expressive, indigenous Japanese musical genre whose lyrics often focus on love
and its loss, and nostalgia for one's hometown, similar in some respects to
American country music. Enka music will provide a culturally appropriate frame,
not only yielding data for analysis through examining its lyrics but also as a
basis for elicitation of discourse about emotions by native speakers. This
project will analyze both grammatical and semantic aspects of conversational
Japanese and the poetic lyrics of enka music to describe the linguistic and
cultural phenomena characteristic of emotional expression in Japanese, with
specific attention to potential discursive evidence for categories of koi and
ai.
