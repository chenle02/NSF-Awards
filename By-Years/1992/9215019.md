An emerging theoretical framework in stream ecology attempts to describe how
physical disturbance regulates ecosystem structure and function at multiple
spatial scales. A major goal of this emerging framework is to predict ecological
attributes of lotic ecosystems based on knowledge of geomorphology and
hydrology, which together can describe how stable or frequently disturbed
benthic habitats are. The PI will characterize lotic invertebrate communities in
functional terms (e.g., life history, mobility, size spectra, and morpho-
behavioral attributes) that should represent integrated organism responses to
physical disturbance. Using these non-taxonomic indices, The PI will test the
hypothesis that community structure is quantitatively related to habitat
stability and disturbance. Research will be conducted on 10 carefully- selected
streams in the Eastern Deciduous Biome to isolate the mechanism (habitat
disturbance) hypothesized to explain much variability in invertebrate community
structure.
