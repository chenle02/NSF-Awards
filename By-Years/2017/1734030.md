A physical and quantitative understanding of the processes of life and living
systems must describe biological functions in different contexts and across a
wide range of systems. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers award the Center
for the Physics of Biological Function (CPBF) will probe the unifying physical
principles that govern the emergence of essential biological functions. A joint
effort of Princeton University and the Graduate Center of the City University of
New York, the CPBF will bring together theorists and experimentalists to study
biological functions in a quantitative and systematic manner across a range of
diverse systems. From cells to organisms to groups of organisms the CPBF will
explore functional behavior, the mechanics of biological networks, the impacts
of limited physical information within systems, and how biological systems set
efficient parameters. The CPBF will foster the training and development of a new
and diverse generation of scientists at the interface of physics and biology. It
will expand successful existing interdisciplinary programs for undergraduates
and graduate courses, and develop a dedicated undergraduate summer school. In
addition, the center will host seminars and symposia that will connect CPBF with
the larger scientific community and will engage in public lectures in New York
City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CPBF research activities are organized around
four themes, each of which will involve close collaboration between theory and
experiment. The first focuses on animal behavior from the development of
organisms to locomotion. The second considers the emergence of collective
phenomena in groups of molecules, genes, neurons, and organisms. The third theme
studies the role of physical limits on information transfer and processing in
the genetic code, neural circuits, cellular sensors, and genetic and biochemical
networks. The fourth theme examines the mechanisms through which biological
systems arrive at a particular operating point from protein number to adaptive
immunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Physics Frontiers Centers award is co-funded
by the Division of Physics and the Division of Chemistry within the Directorate
of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Emerging Frontiers within the
Directorate for Biological Sciences as part of Understanding the Brain
activities.
