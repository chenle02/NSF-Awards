0075944&lt;br/&gt;Pellmyr&lt;br/&gt;Mutualistic interactions create resources
that are exploited by parasites. These parasites sometimes evolve from
mutualists and they can greatly alter the dynamics of the interactions. Obligate
mutualisms, such as those between seed-parasitic pollinators and their hosts,
make excellent models for the study of such reversals because of their
simplicity. This study will use a recently evolved cheater yucca moth and its
pollinating sister species to test the first explicit scenario for any obligate
mutualism of how it can evolve. In this scenario, specific life history traits
and ecological context are suggested to greatly facilitate this type of
diversification. The project has three objectives. First, the study will use
phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA and morphometric data to test explicit
hypotheses about changing geographic ranges and history of coexistence between
the cheater, two pollinators, and their shared host over the last 2-3 million
years. Second, experiments will be used to test the hypothesis that the
pollinator that gave rise to the cheater has requisite behavioral plasticity and
ovipositor morphology to make the shift from pollinator to cheater habit
comparatively easily. Third, the study will test a hypothesis suggesting that
offset emergence phenology between coexisting pollinators facilitates the
evolution of cheating in the later species. Taken together, this project would
place a multi-species mutualism in its historical biogeographic context, and use
a very recent case of evolution of cheating within that mutualism as a template
to experimentally test specific but generalizable hypotheses about this
ecologically important process of diversification.&lt;br/&gt;
