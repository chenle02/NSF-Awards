The performance of dynamic seals depends on the local liquid pressure between
the two sliding surfaces. By controlling the local surface topography it is
possible to control the fluid pressure on a micro scale. In this project
patterns of surface topography are created by differential wear of various
segments of the surface which have been treated to have different properties to
some depth or to have different surface roughness. Results from Phase I of this
study show that the concept is feasible. In the current phase a theoretical
model will be developed for differential wear and the resulting fluid pressure
development and experiments will be conducted on a number of surface
modification processes as means to develop the differential wear patterns which
give optimal seal performance.
