This project has the goal of developing planner-generalization techniques that
can be used to modify AI planning algorithms to remove some of the restrictive
assumptions found in classical approaches to AI planning, such as: perfect
knowledge about actions and objects and history of the planning environment,
static planning environment, instantaneous actions, discrete time, determinism,
black-and-white solution criteria. A starting point for the project will be the
PI's preliminary results on a method to "non-determinize" forward-chaining
planners. Using both theoretical and empirical techniques, the project will
explore ways to systematically generalize planning algorithms to deal with
nondeterminism, actions with probabilistic effects, and temporal issues. Results
of the project will provide theoretical and experimental underpinnings necessary
to enable AI planning to better address the needs of real-world planning
applications such as manufacturing planning and ship movement planning. It is
intended that implementations of algorithms developed in this project will be
made available as open-source software.
