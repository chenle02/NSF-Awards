This project addresses mathematical problems related to the motion of an ideal
fluid. The question of uniqueness will be studied for the system of equations
describing fluid motion with special emphasis on "rough" flows. In this
situation, the trajectories of fluid particles may not be uniquely defined at
some points. The vanishing viscosity limit is deeply connected with uniqueness
and will be investigated for such classes of flows. Qualitative properties of a
possible blow-up set will also be considered. Another line of research focuses
on the linear stability of an ideal fluid. The main question to be addressed in
this area is how the growth rate of a small perturbation is related to the
location of the spectrum of small oscillations. The interrelation between linear
instability and nonlinear instability for flows of an ideal incompressible fluid
will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical study of the basic models
describing fluid motion forms a foundation for a number of applications, such as
meteorology, geophysics, astrophysics, engineering, and the theory of
turbulence. This research explores one of the two commonly used models
describing the motion of fluids, and investigates whether the initial
distribution of velocity in a fluid flow determines the future velocity
distribution. Stability of general classes of fluid flows will be studied, and
in particular, the question of whether stability can be determined by
characteristics of small oscillations. Potential applications of this research
include modeling of large and small scale structures in turbulence, as well as
stability of vortices in the atmosphere and ocean.&lt;br/&gt;
