This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Mark M. Banaszak-Holl at the University of
Michigan to utilize silylene, germylene or stannylene together with an aryl
halide for intermolecular CH-activation and to determine the mechanism of these
new reactions. This new knowledge will be applied to processes that combine C-H
activation with reactions important in the area of organic synthesis, such as
the formation of carbon-carbon bonds using Stille cross-coupling. This chemistry
represents the first example of CH-activation chemistry leading directly to the
formation of bonds between carbon and group-14 elements. This new chemistry
occurs by a poorly understood, radical reaction initiated by the interaction
between the silylene, germlene, or silylene and the aryl halide that activates
the ipso carbon of the phenyl ring to perform a hydrogen abstraction, while at
the same time allowing formation of a new bond between the metalloid and the
carbon of the activated hydrocarbon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to
activate the hydrocarbon and then immediately carry on the synthetic process to
the next step would make some synthetic organic reactions more amenable to the
environment. An additional environmental benefit is that this chemistry may help
to make silicon-based synthetic reagents more accessible and thus help to
replace the use of tin. This research program also interfaces with the Michigan
Chemical Sciences at the Interface of Education (CSIE) and Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) programs for the training of our next generation of
scientists including minority participants who are now in graduate school or
hold faculty positions. &lt;br/&gt;
