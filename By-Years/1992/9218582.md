Numerical solutions to the problem of salt water intrusion have traditionally
been validated by attempting to reproduce previous numerical and analytical
solutions. In recent years, our ability to solve the governing equations
accurately has improved dramatically due to superior numerical algorithms and
the widespread availability of computational resources. Yet no recent studies
have examined the accuracy of salt water intrusion models by comparison of sand
box model studies with numerical solutions to the problem. Furthermore, there
are some fundamental problems with current salt water intrusion models related
to the underlying dispersion and diffusion mechanisms which couple the fluid
flow equation to the solute transport equation. In this study, we propose to
compare the results of sand box model experiments with numerical models of the
same problem in order to evaluate the accuracy of the standard mathematical
model for salt water intrusion and to develop new mathematical models of the
saltwater intrusion process which better describe the physics and chemistry of
the density-coupled flow and transport process. The sand box model experiments
will serve as a new and unique data set with which to verify the correctness of
the new approach and to validate numerical models of salt water intrusion.
