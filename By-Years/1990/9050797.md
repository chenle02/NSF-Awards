Students are doing computer-based mathematical experiments in a
classroom/laboratory equipped with Macintosh SE computers running Mathematica. A
new calculus curriculum is being implemented in which students are more actively
involved in the learning process by interacting with the computer, the
instructor, and with each other. The institution will contribute an amount equal
to the award.
