Kanade This project is building and deploying an intelligent imaging sensor for
road following. The sensor generates the heading information required to steer a
robotic vehicle by watching the road. On-chip processing is performed by a
neural network trained to drive autonomously on public highways. The circuitry
which performs the neural computations is integrated with a photosensor array in
order to directly sense road-image information. The photosensor array includes
analog signal processing in each cell and binary optics for better photon
statistics, decreased transducer size, and less interference.
