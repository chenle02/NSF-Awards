This award is dedicated to the new research on the analysis of Boolean
functions. Boolean functions (i.e., mappings from n bits to 1 bit) are one of
the most basic objects of study in computer science: they arise in areas as
diverse as cryptography, error-correcting codes, learning theory, and circuit
design. One of the most effective tools for studying Boolean functions is by
considering their Fourier transform and related analytic properties.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has been at the forefront of research on analysis
of Boolean functions over the last decade and will further develop theory and
applications via an attack on three important unsolved
problems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The Fourier Entropy-Influence Conjecture on
how "spread out" the Fourier coefficients of a Boolean function can be. Proving
this conjecture would have important consequences for learning
theory.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture on influences of low-
degree Boolean functions. This conjecture has direct relevance to understanding
the power of quantum computation.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Gotsman-Linial Conjecture on
functions computable by the sign of a low-degree polynomial. This is a major
problem in the field of concrete complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of
Boolean functions has had broad application throughout computer science; it has
also had interdisciplinary application through its use in mathematics,
statistical physics, and economics. The PI will further develop and spread the
impact of the area by writing the first textbook on analysis of Boolean
functions. The textbook will be released freely, in installments on a blog. This
will not only enhance the connection between research and education, it will
foster learning for computer scientists (and aspiring computer scientists)
regardless of status and geographic location. Finally, the PI will continue to
make broader impact through advising and guiding graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers, and through widely disseminating research results.
