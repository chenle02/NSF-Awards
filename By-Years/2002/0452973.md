In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Stephen R. Leone of the University of California -
Berkeley and his graduate and undergraduate research students will investigate
the use of coherent control methods with tailored ultrafast laser pulses to
manipulate chemical events. Studies will range from rotational heating and
cooling of simple diatomic systems to the control of the photodissociation of
polyatomic molecules. The ultimate goal of the research is to learn of ways in
which coherent control may be used to achieve exquisite control chemical
dynamics. The information gleaned from these studies is expected to have broad
impact on a variety of technologies including fiber optic telecommunications,
quantum information, encryption, and data storage and
transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the broader impacts of the
proposed research, Prof. Leone will continue in his efforts at educating young
scientists at all levels - from high school through postdoctoral level. He will
also work on developing curricular materials for undergraduate physical
chemistry students.&lt;br/&gt;
