ABSTRACT EEC-9625245 This "TIE" project is a two-year collaborative research
effort of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for
Engineering Tribology at Georgia Institute of Technology and the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center Machine Tool Systems at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The research addresses the
tribological aspects of fixturing for machine applications, finite element
modeling of the fixture-workpiece system, and experimental verification of
contact mechanics in fixturing. The I/UCRC for Tribology Engineering will study
the behavior of fixture -workpiece contact; the I/UCRC for Machine Tool Systems
will study the finite element modeling of the system; both I/UCRCs will verify
the model. Both Centers are cost sharing this "TIE" Project.
