Eastern Illiniois University has several researchers who would benefit from
access to supercomputers and access to other researchers connected to the
NSFNET. The campus will be connected directly to the University of Illinois
under the auspices of the Computing Services Office with a 56,000 bits per
second communication link. The University of Illinois will provide further
Internet access through their connection to the NSFNET Backbone network. They
will also provide the necessary information services and training. This project
will improve research and instruction effectiveness at Eastern Illinois
University by enhancing and expanding desktop access to all Internet facilities
including the supercomputing facilities at the National Center for
Supercomputing Apllications and the Statewide Library Circulation System.
