This award supports participation in the conference "Equivariant and Motivic
Homotopy Theory" held at Reed College, in Portland, Oregon on May 30-31, 2015.
This meeting will bring together leading researchers, postdoctoral associates,
and graduate students interested in equivariant and motivic homotopy theory to
share recent progress and ideas for future research in these fields during a
two-day research conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on
the interplay between equivariant and motivic homotopy theory. Each field has
enjoyed recent success in resolving a number of longstanding problems, including
the Kervaire invariant one problem and the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures.
They remain relevant to the study of such wide-ranging topics as topological
Hochschild homology, algebraic cobordism, chromatic homotopy theory, and
algebraic K-theory, and both topics are vibrant fields of research. The
conference will catalyze research progress through a series of eight talks by
disciplinary experts and multiple forums in which participants can communicate
and collaborate on topics such as (generalized) infinite loop space machines,
Picard groups of stable homotopy categories, and computations of stable motivic
and equivariant homotopy groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be
