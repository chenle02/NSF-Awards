This award provides support to the Department of Biological Sciences at
Wellesley College to continue a successful summer undergraduate research
program. Participants will be selected from junior Biology, Biological Chemistry
or Psychobiology majors who have serious purpose and definite interest in
independent work, have sufficient course preparation and have shown ability to
think imaginatively and independently. Participants will be selected by the
project director and faculty committee after evaluation of applications forms
designed to recruit the best qualified students for particular projects. The
student will participate in all aspects of the investigation, from pursuing a
literature review to carrying out experimental procedures and observations,
continuing in analysis of data and determination of conclusions. The students
will formally and informally discuss the work with the advisor, and also will
prepare discussions with all fellow participants, both student and faculty, for
weekly group seminars. This will encourage both experience with oral
presentations and exposure to suggestions and criticism of other researchers.
Research reports at the end of the program will involve a written paper, a
poster, and colloquia presentations to students and faculty during the next
academic year. Throughout the summer, seminars will be presented by women
scientists in research careers in academia, industry and medicine; field trips
to biotechnology and chemical companies will be taken.
