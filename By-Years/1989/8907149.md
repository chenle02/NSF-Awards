This research will measure average and time correlated light scattering from
dense suspensions of particles whose refractive index can be made larger than,
equal to, or smaller than the refractive index of the suspending fluid with
modest changes of temperature. This permits examination of a single suspension
having fixed dynamic properties from the transparent or "single scattering"
regime to the opaque or multiple scattering regime. It thereby offers a unique
opportunity to evaluate critically assumptions used in theoretical treatments of
light scattering in dense suspension, in particular the diffusive wave theory
for dynamic light scattering. A theory for scattering will be developed from the
radiative transport point of view. Concentrated suspensions are encountered in a
variety of engineering applications including paints, slurries, fluidized beds,
and ceramics precursors. Non-intrusive optical techniques are needed for product
characterization and control in the processing of such suspensions.
