This research planning grant supports the research of Professor Christ to study
the Stark-Hamiltonian with random potentials over the real numbers. In
particular she will study the spectrum of the Stark-Hamiltonian and their
resonances. Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of
the twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to
address the microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of
action-at-a distance, electro- magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical
foundations for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics,
ranges from detailed analysis of Schrodinger operators, which governs the
dynamics of particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four
known forces into a single theory.
