The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) sponsors over six
hundred research projects per year. For the past seven years, the Summer
Research Program (SRP) for High School Students has filled 107 positions in
these projects with 91 students mainly from GalvestonCounty and adjacent Harris
County. The SRP will provide sixteen participants a "hands on" experience in one
research project and an overview of at least 25 other projects. Participants:
(1) are hired as laboratory Technical Assistants 40 hour per week for 8 weeks;
(2) do projects under the supervision of scientist preceptors; (3) report on
their projects either by doing a slide-talk or a poster exhibit; (4) participate
in a special research seminar conducted for them by faculty who are not
preceptors; (5) discuss possible job choices; (6) participate in various
orientation and social activities with peers, preceptors and staff.
