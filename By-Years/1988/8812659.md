In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in mathematics
between Bogoljub Stankovic of the University of Novi Sad and Thomas Boehme of
the University of California at San Diego, the investigators will study
generalized functions and their applications. The investigators will apply their
theory to solutions of partial differential equations, estimates of error,
problems of theoretical physics, and numerical procedures for solving
mathematics models for singular perturbation problems. This project was approved
by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include
dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav
scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
