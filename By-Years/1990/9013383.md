The objective of the project is to determine the variation in the bulk and
crustal natural remanenet magnetization (NRM) with respect to age of the oceanic
crust. Magnetic anomaly data from MAGSAT satellite and sea-surface measurements
from the North Pacific and North Atlantic will be used. The work will help
resolve uncertainty concerning the mechanism of acquisition of remenent
magnetization within the oceanic crust.
