The ALOHA-93 and CADRE campaigns are centered one measurements of middle
atmosphere dynamics at low and equatorial latitudes. As part of the
ALOHA-93/CADRE campaign, a detailed investigation will be made of the properties
and sources of small scale gravity waves that occur within about 500 km radius
of the Hawaiian Islands. In particular, sequential observations of the OI (557.7
nm), Na (589.2 nm) and near infrared OH emissions will be used to provide a
comprehensive data set valuable for the investigation of both horizontal and
vertical gravity wave propagation, horizontal anisotropy, wind filtering and
wave dissipation. These data will significantly extend the range over which
correlative studies can be made with the airborne measurements and will be
highly complementary to the other ground based measurements. The 2- dimensional
wave information provided by the image data at each emission altitude will be
particularly useful in the investigation of the dominant sources of small scale
gravity waves over the mid- Pacific ocean.
