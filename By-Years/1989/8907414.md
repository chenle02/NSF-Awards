This is a three-year study of convective cloud systems, with emphasis on their
interaction with large-scale circulations and their effects on the Earth's
radiation budget. The cloud types to be studied include cumulus clouds and also
the stratiform anvil clouds and cirrus clouds that are associated with
convective cloud systems The key problems to be addressed are: 1. What is the
nature of the physical couplings between upper- tropospheric stratiform anvil
and cirrus clouds and deep cumulus convection, and how do the clouds and
convection interact with the large-scale circulation?, 2. How can the radiative
effects of convective cloud systems be determine when the cloudiness fluctuates
significantly on unresolved scales?, 3. What are the statistics of convective
cloud systems in the tropics, and what are the spatial distributions of the
resulting radiative and latent heating that drive the large-scale circulation?
The proposed research will address these problems through: 1. analysis of recent
observational results; 2. theoretical studies of the relations among cloud water
(or ice), cloud amount, and cloud optical properties; 3. high-resolution
numerical simulations of mesoscale convective systems and the associated upper
level cloudiness; 4. synthesis of results in the form of a new parameterization
of convective cloud systems; and 5. analysis of the results of GCM simulations
of the interactions of convective cloud systems with large-scale circulations
produced by this new parameterization.
