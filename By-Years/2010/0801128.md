Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;Oliver Collins, University of
Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;Practical Approach Multi-User Channels with Unknown
Fading&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
develop practical and useful communication schemes and receivers for channels
with fading characteristics that are unknown to the transmitters and receivers.
The fundamental approach pursued is iterative estimation and interference
cancellation. Specifically, the research seeks to develop simplified receivers
and estimators so that the techniques can be applied to real
systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This work considers practical
schemes for achieving capacity approaching performance limits for multi-user
channels with unknown fading. Essentially all channels in the physical world
have unknown fading. However, because of analytical difficulties, most work
assumes side information about the fading is available at the receivers and/or
transmitters. Thus, the existing body of knowledge does not accurately account
for the potential dramatic reduction in capacity produced by the fading process
when it is unknown. This research attempts to address this
deficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of the
project include the construction of higher-capacity wireless communications
systems at a much lower cost, and with the ability to provide service to a far
larger area, than present cellular voice and data networks. The research, thus,
has the potential to facilitate mobile and/or rural wideband services, increase
access to emergency services, and improve scientific data collection. The
research also establishes connections between theory and practice that is
essential for attracting new students into engineering. The project aids in
creating and expanding a pipeline for U.S. students to enter advanced
engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;
