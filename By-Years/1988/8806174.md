This proposal is intended for the purchase of state-of-the-art equipment which
will be used at the newly established laboratory for high voltage dielectric and
insulation research at Arizona State University. The equipment to be purchased
are a high voltage multi- test set for generating ac, dc and impulse voltages,
and an impulse analyzing system, which along with the existing facilities will
be used initially for two specific projects described in this proposal. These
projects, selected due to their importance to industry and expertise of the
principal investigators, deal with the scientific understanding of the
principles which lead to the development of better materials and insulting
systems for use in outdoor high voltage transmission and distribution, and space
insulation applications. Graduate students, aiming for an advanced degree (MS or
Ph.D) in electrical engineering, will work on these projects. Thus, this
research program will not only advance the existing knowledge in the field of
high voltage engineering but will also help in the development of the much
needed highly qualified engineers.
