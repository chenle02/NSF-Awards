This project will assess the effects of maternal caregiving on the health and
nutritional status of children in a marginal rural area of highland Mexico. The
relationships of mothering performance to socio-economic and demographic
characteristics of households will be examined through the creation of
statistical models for children of differing age levels in a massive data base
of the Collaborative Research Support Program on Food Intake and Function in
Mexico. Measures of maternal caregiving, household demographic and economic
characteristics, and indicators of child health and nutrition will be derived
from this data. This project is important because it will help us understand why
some children in households have better health and nutritional status than other
children in the same wealth categories. Obviously poverty is not the only cause
of health and well being, and this research will help us understand the parts of
the relationship having to do with maternal behavior.
