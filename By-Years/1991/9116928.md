This project involves geothermal research with two holes that will be drilled
in Moat-fill units in the Creede Mining District in Colorado in the fall of
1991. The objectives of the research are to obtain excellent temperature-depth
data, reliable heat flow values (Q), uranium (U), thorium (Th) and potassium (K)
concentration data, and radiogenic heat production data (A) for both locales.
From the temperature-depth data, hydrologic phenomena in the environs of the
holes can be studied, as may be the fracture systems that are receiving and
yielding subsurface fluids. The vertical distributions of U, Th, K and
radiogenic heat production also will be used to infer present and past movement
of fluids and radioisotopes in the Moat-fill units, and will provide insight
into relations between radioactive heat and hydrothermal activity near both
stations. Considered with Q and A data that exist for mining company holes in
the District to the north, the heat flow and heat production values for the
holes in the Moat will yield reliable estimates for heat sources and
temperatures at depths greater than 1 km in the Creede Hydrothermal System,
information that must be known for future deep drilling in this classic mining
area.
