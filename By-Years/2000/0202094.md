This award funds young mathematicians (graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s)
from the United States to travel to the fourteenth annual Formal Power Series
and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) international conference, being held this
year at The University of Melbourne (Australia), July 8-12, 2002.

This continuing series of conferences bring together researchers from various
areas of combinatorics and theoretical computer science and links them with
leading scientists from allied disciplines in pure mathematics, applied
mathematics and physics. The focus of the 2002 conference is on algebraic and
enumerative combinatorics, again with emphasis on interdisciplinary links to
allied fields.
