Dr. L. Rene Corrales has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Corrales' doctoral degree was from the University of California
at San Diego under the supervision of Professor John C. Wheeler. Dr. Corrales
intends to continue research at the University of Texas at Austin under the
sponsorship of Professor Peter J. Rossky. Dr. Corrales' postdoctoral research
will be the development and application of a general theoretical model to
describe the molecular structure of covalently bonded liquids and amorphous
solids. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
