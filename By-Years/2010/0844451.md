Funds are being provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via
an interagency transfer for a new project on antibiotic resistance and
antibiotic gene annotation in the Bacillus anthracis genome. Bacillus anthracis
is an important pathogen that is sensitive to many antibiotics. Yet it,
curiously, carries genetic coding for resistance to many of these same
antibiotics. Through laboratory experiments, this research will determine which
of the loci identified as penicillin, tetracycline, or macrolide resistance
genes in strains of B. anthracis actually encode a resistance determinant; the
incorrect annotations will be corrected based on the verified data. DNA
sequences upstream and downstream of the resistance determinants will be
analyzed to determine if mobile genetic elements are present. This research will
improve the quality and usefulness of B. anthracis genome annotations. The
potential for developing a resistant phenotype when the organism is exposed to
antimicrobial agents will also be investigated. All corrections to genome
annotations will be made available to the scientific community by submission to
public databases. Data on gene identification, expression, and associated
antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes will be published in appropriate peer-
reviewed journals.

This project will be providing student training in bacterial genetics,
bioinformatics, and molecular laboratory techniques. Validated information on
antimicrobial resistance genes in biothreat agents is of particular importance
to national biodefense. Any potential for resistance must be confirmed and taken
into consideration when selecting an antimicrobial agent for widespread
distribution and for mass treatment of the public. Any diversity detected and
verified in the antimicrobial resistance genes or in the associated DNA
sequences will be extremely important in identifying and tracking B. anthracis
strains for microbial forensics.
