The Josephine ophiolite is a large, complete ophiolite in northwestern
California, which probably formed by a slow- spreading mid-ocean ridge. Previous
work has indicated that magma chambers were episodic resulting in structural
extension and tilting of the entire crustal sequence above an upper mantle
detachment. This continuation will focus on developing criteria for oceanic
faults, including serpentinite shear zones above the detachment, and the
relationships between magmatism, faulting and hydrothermal metamorphism. Results
are expected to provide insights into several aspects of slow-spreading mid-
ocean ridges and their recognition in ancient examples.
