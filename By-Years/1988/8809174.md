In recent years the use of counting arguments has begun to yield results about
the structure of complexity classes. Complexity hierarchies have collapsed and
new class inclusions have been discovered. This project will use counting
arguments to achieve two goals. First, the rival computational paradigms -
deterministic, nondeterministic, unique, counting,etc. - will be compared with
the goal of discovering new class inclusions and strong (relativized)
incomparability results. Second, classes lacking complete languages will be
sought. This will add to the tool kit of the field counting based proof
techniques that allow easy conversion between various types of non-completeness
results.
