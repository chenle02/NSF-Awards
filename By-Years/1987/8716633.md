This award will enable Dr. Alfred Rosenberger of the University of Illinois at
Chicago to collaborate with Dr. Takeshi Setoguchi of the Primate Research
Institute, Kyoto University, Japan on the study of the La Venta fossil primates.
The project will involve (1) describing previously found but as yet undescribed
specimens from the La Venta fossil site in Columbia, and (2) finding and
describing new primate fossils from this important Miocene site. The New World
monkeys represent one of the most puzzling chapters in primate evolution,
largely because their fossil record is so poor. Dr. Setoguchi is primarily a
field paleontologist, while Dr. Rosenberger is an expert on the systematics and
evolution of platyrrhine monkeys. Collaboration of their research teams should
result not only in the collection of a significant number of new fossil
specimens, but also in a better understanding of the relationship of early
species with extant forms.
