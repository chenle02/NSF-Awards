This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by
Professor Kinoshita at Harvard University. She will continue to search for
elementary particles with exotic charge. Etchable solid state track detectors
are used to search for Dirac monopoles and other highly ionizing particles at
two colliding beam accelerators. The continued failure to observe magnetic
monopoles remains a puzzle which impacts the fundamental premises of modern
physics.
