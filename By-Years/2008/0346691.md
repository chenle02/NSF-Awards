&lt;br/&gt;AST 0346691 Sarajedini&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vicki Sarajedini, at
the University of Florida, Gainesville, will undertake a multifaceted program to
study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN), by using variability as a
means to identify and study low luminosity AGN out to redshifts of z~1. The
specific objectives are to 1. Identify galaxies containing variable nuclei at
moderate to high redshifts, 2. To use current ground-based variability surveys
to identify lower redshift AGN in the same luminosity regime for evolution
studies, and 3. To investigate variability timescales that characterize low-
luminosity AGN at a variety of redshifts. This optical survey will complement
X-ray, radio and infrared surveys, and allow for the low-luminosity end of the
AGN luminosity function to z~1 to be explored. At the same time, variability
data will be obtained to allow for an investigation of the central engines of
the AGN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sarajedini will train and support graduate and
undergraduate students. The PI will use a portable planetarium for K-12 outreach
activities that will be used extensively in a variety of modes, with the
assistance of undergraduate and graduate students, along with faculty at the
University of Florida.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
