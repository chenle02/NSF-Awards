The spatial model of electoral competition first proposed by Anthony Downs and
subsequently extended by many authors is a core part of formal political theory.
It has been and is currently used to study a wide variety of electoral processes
and political institutions and its properties under many alternative conditions
are now well known. All of this work, however, maintains the assumption that
voters' preferences are exogenously given and can be treated as fixed while
studying the behavior of competing parties and candidates. This makes all the
resulting predictions conditional on this assumption. Empirical studies of voter
preferences, by contrast, have connected changes in preferences to the platforms
and actions of competing parties and candidates. The proposed research will
connect these two literatures by developing a model of electoral competition
that makes preferences endogenous, meaning that they co-evolve with party
platforms during the election process. The model will then be explored to
ascertain its implications for the existence of stable outcomes, for the ability
to predict these outcomes based on initial conditions and assumptions about
party behavior, and for its dynamic properties. The assumption of fixed
preferences can be treated as a special case of this general model.
