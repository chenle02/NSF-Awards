The purpose of the NSF grant is to support the production of "the Scientist:,
an hour-long film in a six-part television series entitled RENAISSANCE. Designed
to appeal to non- specialists -- the general public as well as high school and
college students -- the film will recreate the ge of the Renaissance by drawing
on a mixture of animation; documentary footage of historic sites and art;
interviews with contemporary figures who represent the continuing influence of
the Renaissance; and actors speaking the words of the period. Viewers will thus
hear the words of great figures; see the results of their work; and be treated
to re-enactments that evoke their lives. Like al the films in the series, "The
Scientist" will trace an important theme of the Renaissance -- in this case, the
birth of modern science -- using all aspects of its society and culture to
convey both a sense of the past and a perspective on the present. 'thanks to the
rich materials of the age, and the lively confrontations it witnessed, a modern
audience will come to understand both the origins of the scientific outlook and
-- through the interviews with contemporary scientists -- how it continues to
shape our world.
