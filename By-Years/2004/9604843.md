IBN 9604843 PI: Reh The development of the eye involves several different
interactions to organize the neural network of the retina and the related non-
neural pigment epithelium. During early developmental stages, cells called
blastomeres have the potential to later differentiate into progeny cells that
can become a variety of different types. Later, the type of cell which can arise
from further cell divisions becomes more restricted. Work on transplanted cells
from various stages has shown that both intrinsic genetic factors and extrinsic
factors in the developing environment apparently influence these cell fates to
some degree. This project uses the techniques of cell culture and molecular
biology to examine the molecular factors that control eye development.
Specifically, the investigators will attempt to understand how extracellular
secreted factors, like FGF and follistatin, control eye development through
their regulation of critical eye determining transcription factors, like pax6.
The results will be important for understanding how cell interactions bring
about the self-assembly of the developing nervous system.
