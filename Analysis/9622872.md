Abstract Chen Chen will investigate problems in two areas: chaotic behavior of
the Lorenz system and the interfacial phenomena in material science. For the
first area Chen seeks to obtain a complete bifurcation diagram of the chaotic
behaviors of the system for all the parameter values and to show the existence
of a conjectured Lorenz attractor. The main tools to be used will be shooting
arguments, homotopy theory, bifurcation theory, and chaos theory on maps. For
the second area the goal is to study certain free boundary problems which
describe geometric motions of hypersurfaces, to analyze the asymptotic behavior
of certain evolution equations, and to connect the solutions of free boundary
problems with the asymptotic behaviors of the evolution equations. The Lorenz
system was one of the very first examples that stimulated the formation and
development of the theory of chaos and later on became a typical example in many
text books of dynamical systems and/or chaos theory. Nevertheless, except for
numerous numerical experiments, there are few rigorous analyses for this system.
The object of this project is to provide such a rigorous foundation. The related
study of interfacial dynamics is of particular importance in material science.
