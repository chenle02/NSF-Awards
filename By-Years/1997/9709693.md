This research in the laboratory of Professor Bo Hong at the University of
California at Irvine is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program under a Research Planning Grant. The research
is directed toward developing dendritic assemblies with transition metal
photosensitizers and to study the surface binding and photochemistry of these
dendrimers. Metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state decay kinetics
and possible intra- and intermolecular quenching pathways within these
assemblies will be studied. This research should facilitate the development of
transition metal dendrimer assemblies as components of photoelectrochemical
systems. Such systems may result in the conversion of visible light to drive
electron-transfer reactions.
