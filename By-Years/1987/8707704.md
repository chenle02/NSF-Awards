Funds are requested to purchase an inductively-coupled plasma emission
spectroanalyzer for the Department of Geology at Florida International
University (FIU). The instrument is to be used for quantitative, multielement
analysis of rocks, minerals, sediments, paleontological materials, and seawater
and groundwater samples as needed in the research and educational projects of
the FIU faculty and those of nearby institutions (the University of Miami
Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, and federal, state and
county hydrological agencies). The proposal was submitted to the NSF program for
Research in Undergraduate Institutions. The geochemical research projects
requiring the analytical capabilities of the spectroanalyzer include studies of
Caribbean sediments, research in water resources and the quality of drinking
water, studies of volcanic and metastudies of Mesozoic black shales.
