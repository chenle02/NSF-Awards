Fundamental research on critical interfaces in thin layered structures formed
from oxide films deposited in-situ on various III-V compound semiconductor
surfaces with silicon interlayers will be conducted. The idea being explored is
that the III-V/Silicon interface states do not pin the Fermi level, and the
Si/SiO2 interface either exhibits a very low density of interface states, or a
favorable energy distribution of such states in the gap, thereby making MOS
structures with III-V semiconductors feasible. The objective is to understand
basic factors affecting interface state density with these materials and to
achieve conditions of sufficiently low(&lt;1011cm-2) values to allow effective
surface potential modulation in III-V metal-oxide-semiconductor(MOS) structures.
%%% This research is expected to provide deeper understanding of--and may also
provide a long-sought solution to--the control and manipulation of electronic
energy states of compound semiconductors at interface regions of layered
structures. The results could be of particular significance to the technology of
large scale, high speed integrated electronic and photonic circuits which
consume low power.
