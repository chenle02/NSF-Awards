A program of research at Texas Tech University has produced indepth
understandings of the structural mechanics behavior of monolithic glass plates,
insulating glass (IG) units and laminated glass (LG) units under the effects of
lateral loads. These commonly used components of window glass systems are now
being used in an innovative new window glass system called "structural glazing."
In this system, the glass component (monolithic glass plate, IG unit, LG unit)
is connected to the secondary structural frame of multistory buildings with a
liquid structural sealant (commonly silicone) so that no mechanical device
extends beyond the face of the outer-most glass plate. This research will
integrate known component behaviors into an evaluation of the integrated
structural mechanics behavior of structurally glazed window systems. Theoretical
formulations using numerical methods will be employed. These formulations will
be verified through experiment. Expected results include an improved
understanding of the complex structure which a designer is asked to place on the
side of a multistory building.
