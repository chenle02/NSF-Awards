Foreman's proposal involves applying tools from mathematical logic to questions
in dynamical systems. Many dynamical systems, while completely determinate,
appear to have elements of random behavior. This phenomenon can be described
explicitly when there is a time-invariant probability measure on the system.
Such a description could state that the system is measure theoretically
isomorphic to a particular known process, such as a Bernoulli process. From this
point of view it is natural to try to attempt to classify dynamical systems
measure-theoretically. The hope would be to have a "library" of possible measure
preserving systems and be able to describe an arbitrary system measure
theoretically as one in the library. This project, while very successful in its
early stages, runs into insuperable obstacles for deep logical reasons.
Foreman's previous work with his co-authors showed that the isomorphism problem
for ergodic measure preserving systems is inherently too complex from a logical
point of view to admit a classification. Foreman's proposed work involves
extending these anti-classification results to differentiable systems on compact
manifolds and to identify those systems for which the isomorphism problem is
tractable.

Many natural systems evolve over time according to definite rules. Much of
science involves discovering these rules and describing them, perhaps by a
system of equations. These rules discuss how individual points in a system
behave, and are often completely deterministic. However, what can be actually
observed (for example due to round-off error) in these systems are sets of
points. At this level the qualitative behavior of a dynamical system can be
apparently random. This led to the project of classifying the possible behavior
statistically so that the qualitative behavior of natural systems could be
catalogued. There were many successes in the program in its early stages.
Recently however, it turns out that there are reasons related to mathematical
logic that the program cannot, in principle, work. Foreman's proposed research
explores extending the impossibility results to concrete settings and finding
large collections of systems for which there are good classifications of their
statistical behavior.
