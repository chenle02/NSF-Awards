The emergence of a class of computational hardware with both graphics and near
supercomputer capability, available to the chemist at a relatively modest price,
is a recent phenomenon. Such instrumentation allows chemists to effectively
carry out projects that involve both large scale computations and algorithm
development as well as projects in which interactive graphics are essential. The
Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University will use this award from the
Chemical Instrumentation Program to help acquire a mini-supercomputer system
with advanced work stations. The acquisition will enhance chemical research in
the the following areas: 1) X-ray crystallographic studies 2) Reactive
intermendiates in organic reactions 3) Development and testing of nonlinear
optical materials 4) Gas phase dynamics of chemical reactions 5) Self-consistent
field approximations for vibrational dynamics 6) Electronic structure studies of
photochemical reactions.
