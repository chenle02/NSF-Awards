Funds are provided to analyze seven long cores recovered from the Bermuda Rise
in the North Atlantic Ocean, a key location where the physical and geochemical
properties of exported North Atlantic Deep Waters are set by mixing between the
northern and southern abyssal water masses. The research aims to create an
abyssal type section of deepwater circulation for the last glacial-interglacial
cycle.

The research plan includes detailed stratigraphic investigations of piston cores
and the initial measurement of several first order proxies of deep water
circulation and surface water conditions for the last 160,000 years. The
collaborative work plan includes a suite of analyses that include scanning x-ray
analyses, radiocarbon and stable isotopic analysis, trace and minor element
analysis, Uranium series analyses, and compiling Neodymium records from
sediments.

The broader impacts involve the education and training of graduate and
undergraduate students, and a high school student. Results from this research
will be adapted for coursework and lectures. The data will be archived and
available for future paleoceanographic and paleoclimate studies.
