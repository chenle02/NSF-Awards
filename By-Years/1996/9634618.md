The most natural means of human communication is multimodal, involving a mixture
of speech, hand and body movement, facial expression, and eye motion. A
multimodal framework is developed where several interaction modes are explored
as a means of manipulating a 3D virtual display. The main focus of this project
is exploring the use of free hand gestures for manipulating virtual objects in
an effort to advance the goal of developing the fundamental theory behind hand
gestures as a way of manipulating graphical objects together with speech, gaze
direction, scene content, and graphical feedback. Existing multi-user virtual
reality setups are used as experimental testbeds for validating the usefulness
of methodologies for building useful multimodal human-computer interfaces for
virtual reality. Since the development of natural human-computer interaction
techniques are perceived to be a major hurdle in a greater impact of the
information revolution, the results of this projects have wide-reaching
potential applications.
