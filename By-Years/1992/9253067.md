The Emeritus Foundation plans to network volunteer retired scientists,
engineers, and mathematicians with approximately 700 elementary school teachers
in the Washington D.C. schools over a three year period. Building on an existing
program, the project will enable retired professionals to supplement science and
mathematics offerings at the elementary level by working closely with teachers
and students both in and out of the classroom. Activities include classroom
hands-on demonstrations, field trips, mentoring, and workshops for both teachers
and volunteers to maximize the effectiveness of the other activities and to
design instructional activities and materials. In addition, manuals will be
created to assist with the training of new volunteers for the program. The
project is designed as a model which can be replicated in other urban areas
which have large populations of underrepresented students.
