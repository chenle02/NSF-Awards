Water exerts a strong influence on the physical and chemical properties of
magmas. In order to understand dynamic processes associated with magma chambers
and volcanic eruptions, it is therefore crucial to document variations and
evolution of magmatic H2O contents through the stages of crystallization,
differentiation, degassing, and eruption. This project has as a central goal to
develop a new method for estimating magmatic H2O by determining experimentally
how the element hydrogen (H) is partitioned between the ubiquitous feldspar
minerals and silicate liquids, or magmas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new
technique to be developed in this study will complement existing methods such as
melt inclusion studies, constraints from phase equilibria, and albite-anorthite
(Ab-An) hygrometry. The team will conduct experiments over a range of
temperatures, bulk H2O contents, and oxygen fugacities. The experiments will
focus on plagioclase (An25-An90) and coexisting basaltic-rhyolitic melt
compositions. The experiments will be supplemented by analyses of natural
plagioclase/melt inclusion pairs from Mt. Hood and Mt. Mazama, Oregon. These
samples provide a test case for this method because they have already been
studied using melt inclusion and Ab-An hygrometry. They will analyze hydrogen in
both experimental and natural samples by SIMS, using a newly developed
calibration for feldspars. At the same time, they plan to use new electron
microprobe (EPMA) analyses to provide new constraints on thermodynamic models of
Ab-An hygrometry. Broader impacts of the study include providing opportunities
for direct participation by undergraduates in the research process,
collaboration with Phil Ihinger at UW Eau Claire (a principally undergraduate
research institution), and development of feldspar standards as part of this
project that will be disseminated to SIMS laboratories in the Earth Science
community.
