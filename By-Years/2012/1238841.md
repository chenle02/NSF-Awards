The targeted infusion project of Claflin University has as its goal to enhance
the scientific teaching and research infrastructure in the Department of
Chemistry at Claflin University. This will be achieved with the upgrade and
redesign of several chemistry laboratories and incorporation of summer and
academic year undergraduate internships. As a result, Claflin University is
expected to improve student retention in several gatekeeping chemistry courses,
enhance the critical thinking skills of chemistry students and increase the
overall retention rate of chemistry and biochemistry majors by 15%. Ultimately,
the activities proposed for Claflin University will not only expose students to
cutting edge research in the chemical sciences, but will also improve their
capacities to compete for highly coveted undergraduate research opportunities.
As such, it is expected that a significant percentage of Claflin students will,
subsequently, matriculate into STEM graduate degree programs, thereby
contributing to the diversification of the US STEM workforce.
