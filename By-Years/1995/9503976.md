9503976 Dietterich The goal of this research is to develop and prototype methods
for the automatic calibration and validation of computer models of complex
systems. The platform for this research is an ecosystem model called MAPSS
(Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System). The purpose of the MAPSS model is to
predict the biosphere impact of global climate change. This project aims to
improve the development, maintenance, calibration, and accuracy of MAPPS by
combining and extending ideas from three areas of computer science: (a)
declarative programming, (b) parallel computing, and (c) machine learning.
Together the proposed methods will provide model developers with significant
speedup through a more efficient representation and parallel implementation, a
system for automatic model calibration, and a system for model validation
designed to maximize predictive power. These methods will improve the efficiency
of model development as well as help to ensure that the finished product is as
accurate as is possible. Further, these methods should generalize beyond the
MAPSS project, providing a set of tools for the development of many computer
models of complex systems.
