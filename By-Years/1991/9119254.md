9119254 Goodman This grant is for construction and operation of the MILAGRO air-
shower detector that will be used to detect cosmic-ray showers at energies
between 100 GeV and 1000 TeV. The instrument is an innovative application of
Cerenkov radiation produced in a pool of water 5000 square meters in area by 8
meters deep. It will be sensitive to cosmic-rays that arrive at any time from
any direction above the detector. Its angular resolution will be sufficient to
identify sources as yet undiscovered. The grant funds collaborative activities
of four university-based groups. ***
