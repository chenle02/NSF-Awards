The proposal is to investigate a predictive model for the behavior of wet paper
pulp under the action of wet compression rolling. Necessary physical parameters
characterizing the material will be determined from separate experiments to be
performed in conjunction with industry. Optimum conditions for removal of water
are to be sought, which is of interest from the point of view of subuequent
energy usage in drying. The main emphasis, however, is on the development of a
rationally rather than empirically based model for the compression, motion, and
water expulsion in the roll gap.
