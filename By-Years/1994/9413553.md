ABSTRACT Acquisition of an X-ray Area Detector P.l. Robert J. Fletterick An
area sensitive X-ray detector system is requested for X- ray crystallographic
data collection for high resolution structure analyses of proteins. The new
instrument is to augment the UCSF structural capability which is currently
vastly oversubscribed. At present, persons typically wait in turn for one month
to six weeks for time on one of the two existing area detectors. The new
instrument requested is to overcome this rate limiting step in the structural
science. The new phosphor storage technology used in the proposed detector
system makes data collection more efficient and accurate. As structural analysis
moves us to ask scientific questions using many mutations, or using modified
inhibitors aimed at designing improved therapeutics, study of a single protein
system can occupy as much as 50% of the time on one data collection instrument.
Understanding the properties of mutant proteins or altered inhibitory compounds
will require an analysis of structure as thoroughly as for the native proteins.
The speed with which site-directed mutagenesis is accomplished requires rapid
structural analysis for the scientist to remain close to the important
scientific questions. In the following narrative, we list the projects of the
three principal investigators and demonstrate the need for the new communal
equipment. The laboratory to house the new machines will be renovated: a wall is
to be added, plumbing changed, electrical installation and a safety enclosure
will be built. The projects, most supported by NIH grants to the three P.I.s,
are briefly described in narrative form, with references to published work where
possible, and followed by a table. This lists the individual projects by title,
the principal scientists working on the project and the status of the project.
The status provides a brief summary of the current needs for data collection.
