A research equipment grant is awarded for the purchase of a Micromeriticus
Flowsizer Hydordynamic Chromatograph and a High-Resolution Gas Chromatograph.
These instruments will be used in research inheterogeneous polymerization
reaction engineering--the first for determining latex partical size distribution
and the second for determining relative reaction rates and copolymer conposition
during conpolymerization. Measurement of partical size distribution is important
because end-use properties are directly proportional to the polymer partical
size and to the particle size distribution. Hereogeneous copolymetization can
not be followed by simple density measurement; the compostion of the unreacted
monomer and product polymer are both required.
