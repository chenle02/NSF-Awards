The proposed research program will investigate the biochemical mechanisms used
by the extremely thermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga neapolitana to derive
energy from the oxidation of carbohydrates and the reduction of elemental
sulfur. T. neapolitana grows less efficiently in the absence of elemental sulfur
by producing hydrogen as a fermentation endproduct. The regulation of the
switching between this hydrogen-generating metabolism and a sulfur-reducing
metabolism will be studied by analyzing growth responses and protein profiles of
cells grown under different conditions. Other sulfur-containing compounds will
be screened for their ability to act as electron acceptors to identify the
actual substrate of the electron-donating enzyme(s). The sulfur reduction system
will be fractionated to identify its components and determine their location
within the cell. The enzymes involved in glucose metabolism will also be
investigated briefly to identify the source of the electrons used for sulfur
reduction. T. neapolitana belongs to a group of eubacteria that may be the
closest living relatives of the ancestral eubacterium. Sulfur reduction may be
an ancient physiological trait since it is found in Thermotoga species as well
as many archaebacteria. An understanding of this process may reveal how
metabolic processes evolved in early microorganisms. In addition, sulfur
reduction may have biotechnological applications for the removal of sulfurous
compounds from ores, coal and petrochemical products.//
