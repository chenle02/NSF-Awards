This grant will continue operations of the Big Bear Solar Observatory. Some
activities planned include: (1) monitoring images of the Sun in many wavelengths
via the Internet; (2) mapping Yohkoh HXT flare images, comparing with OVRO
microwave images and Big Bear optical and magnetic field maps; (3) investigating
the solar chromosphere and solar spicules; (4) studying the nature and evolution
of solar magnetic fields, particularly in the quiet Sun; (5) studying high-
resolution sunspot phenomena; (6) searching for high tangential velocities in
granulation associated with shock; (7) pursuing smaller programs, student
projects, and special campaigns; and (8) improving instruments, including
installing an additional digital camera, a spot tracker on the 25 cm telescope,
and a computerized dome drive.***
