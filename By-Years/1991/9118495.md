This award supports an investigation of the strata exposed in the Transantarctic
Mountains which were deposited in a major foreland basin that developed adjacent
to the Gondwanide orogenic belt during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic.
Major features include the foreland basin, exposed in the central Transantarctic
Mountains; a hypothetical paleogeographic high; and an intracratonic basin,
exposed in southern Victoria Land. Relationships between these basins and the
high are unresolved due to a lack of data in the area between the Nimrod and
Byrd Glaciers. The proposed sedimentologic and stratigraphic analysis will
identify and correlate units and determine the factors that controlled the
formation, evolution, subsidence and sedimentation in the two basins.
