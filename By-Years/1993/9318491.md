9318491 Horel Recent studies have shown that the National Meteorological
Center's regional forecast model, known as the "ETA" model, does poorly in
predicting heavy precipitation outbreaks over central Arizona during the summer.
The principal investigators believe that this may be due to the way in which
certain physical processes over complex terrain are handled in the model.
Accordingly, they will undertake a systematic evaluation of the skill of this
model over the western United States as a function of synoptic weather situation
and season. They plan to employ observations from a series of recent field
experiments, the Southwest Area Monsoon Project (SWAMP), in this part of the
study. In addition, they will evaluate the ETA model's physical
parameterizations in regions of complex terrain. In carrying out this project,
the PIs will work closely with personnel at NMC and operational meteorologists
in the Western Region of the National Weather Service. This project is supported
as part of the NSF/NMC Joint Program in Numerical Weather Prediction. ***
