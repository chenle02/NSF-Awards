9315340 Gates The objectives of this effort are to prepare uniform supported
metal clusters (close to molecular size), characterize their structures, and
test them as catalysts. Iridium and platinum clusters of systematically varied
sizes on metal-oxide (magnesia or alumina) supports are made from polynuclear
organometallic precursors on the supports; the carbonyl-cluster precursors are
treated under conditions that yield, as nearly as possible, decarbonylated metal
clusters with the same numbers of metal atoms and the same metal framework
structures as the precursors. The structures of the decarbonylated clusters,
such as tetrairidium or hexairidium, are determined using extended X-ray
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, hydrogen chemisorption, electron
microscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). The samples are tested as catalysts for hydrogenation of cyclohexene,
hydrogenation of benzene, hydrogenolysis of n-butane, and dehydrocyclization of
n-hexane. Relationships between catalytic properties and cluster structures are
attempted. Very small (less than a nanometer) particles (clusters) of metal on
supports offer high reproducibility and very efficient use of expensive precious
metals; they may also provide unique catalytic properties. This is a
continuation of the seminal and pioneering effort in this area and offers the
promise of improved performance and higher efficiency in a variety of chemical,
petrochemical, and fuel refining operations. ***
