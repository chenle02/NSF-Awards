This is a renewal proposal for studying "Antiprotons, Mass Spectroscopy and
Recombination". It continues work on the comparison of the antiproton and proton
change-to-mass ratio as a test of CPT invariance. This provides one of the few
accurate tests of CPT invariance for a baryon system. A better comparison of the
charge-to-mass ratios remains the first goal of this research program. The hope
is to compare the charge-to-mass ratio of a negative hydrogen atom with that of
an antiproton to achieve this goal.
