This project awards 24 four-year scholarships to incoming full-time freshman in
the Class of 2007 who demonstrate financial need, show academic promise, and
declare intent to major in one of the eligible disciplines when entering the
College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics
Scholarship (CSEMS) Committee was established to work with Admissions and
Financial Aid staff during the recruitment and application period. The Committee
helped recruit candidates locally with a special emphasis upon increasing
diversity in these majors. The Committee monitors student performance throughout
the program to ensure academic success and continued
eligibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are assigned an advisor in their
chosen disciplines who closely monitors their performance. Other support
services available to students include tutoring, mentoring, and internship
opportunities. Scholars receive a rigorous education in the major field of study
as well as a strong grounding in the liberal arts. &lt;br/&gt;
