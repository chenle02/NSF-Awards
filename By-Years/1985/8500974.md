The Taylor-Aris dispersion method is employed to determine the binary tracer
molecular diffusivities of aromatic hydrocarbon solutes, such as pyrene, 2,3
benzanthracene, fluoranthene and benzo (a) pyrene, in polar and hydrogen-bonded
solvents including diethyl ether, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, and
isopropanol up to the supercritical region. The objective is to provide an
extensive data base to gain further insights into the diffusion process in dense
fluids, particularly under supercritical separation conditions, and to develop
engineering correlations for predictive purposes. The diffusion measurements on
a series of polystyrene standards in supercritical dense n-pentane and a
n-pentane/methanol (95:5) mixture are also attempted. A high pressure (up to
5,000 psig) UV-VIS differential absorbance detector will be procured and put
into operation to expand the capability of existing apparatus.
