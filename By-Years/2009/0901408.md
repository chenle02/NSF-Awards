The project, which involves two secondary school partners and several industrial
partners, is expanding the airframe and power plant aircraft technician programs
to incorporate instruction on compression-ignition, piston-driven aviation
engines (also called diesel-cycle engines). The goal is to integrate instruction
on high-performance aviation diesel engines into the aircraft technician
programs at three institutions in Ohio and disseminate the curriculum
nationwide. The project is: (1) providing faculty professional development for
seven secondary and postsecondary faculty members who will teach the new
aviation diesel engine maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair courses; (2)
developing two new aviation diesel engine laboratories to be used by a community
college and two feeder high school career centers; (3) developing and pilot
testing two new associate-degree level aviation diesel engine maintenance,
troubleshooting, and repair courses; (4) developing and pilot testing high
school level aviation diesel engine maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair
modules; and (5) developing and expanding 2+2 articulations from high school to
community college. The evaluation effort, under the direction of an independent
expert, is using mixed methods to assess learning gains and student and
instructor perceptions about the material. Project materials and results are
being disseminated through presentations at professional conferences, through
wide distribution of a CD-ROM, and publications in professional journals.
Broader impacts include the dissemination of project material and the strong
connection to secondary schools.
