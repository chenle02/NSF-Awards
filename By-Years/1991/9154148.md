This two-week workshop acquaints aerospace engineering faculty with current
airplane design methodology from the conceptual design phase to the
manufacturing phase, including technological, economic, market and manufacturing
considerations. As part of the workshop, the participants design an airplane and
present the results of their design work to an audience of industry experts.
These experts critique not only the designs, but also the way in which the
design results are presented. The participants discuss methods of classroom
implementation of the material learned.
