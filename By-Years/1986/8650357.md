This project will produce a significant improvement in chemistry education at
Rollins College by providing state-of-the-art instructional laboratory NMR
capability. Students will be introduced to NMR spectroscopy by examining simpler
carbon-13 FT-NMR spectra before discussing proton NMR. Acquisition of a 90-MHz
Fourier transform NMR will allow students in Organic Chemistry, Physical
Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Inorganic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and
Undergraduate Research to determine carbon-13 and proton NMR spectra with high
resolution, to perform experiments involving spin decoupling or effects of
temperature, and to gain experience with computer- controlled instrument
operation and data acquisition. The FT-NMR will make important contributions to
the chemistry laboratory program, complementing curriculum development in the
Chemistry Department.
