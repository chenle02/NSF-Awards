9514695 CAREY Language is perhaps the most important conceptual capacity that
separates human beings from our primate cousins. This research will explore the
origins of human language, both evolutionarily and in the developing child. The
focus will be on some of the numerical concepts that play an important role in
the grammars of natural languages, i.e., quantifiers such as "one, another,
some," the distinction between countable entities (such as objects) and
noncountable entities (such as sand and liquids), and concepts of specific
countable entities (such as bottles and books). The research will attempt to
discover which of these concepts are available before the emergence of language
in the developing child, which emerge as the infant learns their expression in a
natural language, and which are available independently of language in primates,
such as rhesus monkeys and cottontop tamarins. The method to be used to probe
the conceptual capacity of creatures without language is simply to show magic
tricks, essentially impossible events, and record when the creature registers
surprise by looking for a long time at the outcome of such impossible events. If
a creature is surprised at the magic trick, we can be confident that he or she
conceptualized the property of the natural world that was violated in the trick.
For example, earlier research has demonstrated that if infants are shown one
object placed behind a screen, and then a second object, (i.e., 1 + 1), and then
the screen is lowered, revealing 2 objects (the possible outcome), they show
little interest. But if the screen is lowered revealing 3 objects or just 1
object, they look reliably longer at these impossible outcomes. This method has
been used for many years to study the concepts of human babies, and recent
research has demonstrated shown that it also yields interpretable results both
with rhesus monkeys in the wild and with laboratory-housed cottontop tamarins.
