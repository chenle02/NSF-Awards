This award supports paleoclimate reserch in Iceland within the framework of
PALE (Paleoclimates of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries). Iceland occupies a key
position in the North Atlantic in terms of both climatic and oceanographic
parameters. The climate of the island is a function of the strength and location
of the Icelandic Low, the strength and character of the freshwater outflow from
the Arctic Basin, and the location of the North Atlantic Drift. These variables
interact to affect the vegetation, hydrology, and glacial history of this area;
Iceland thus well placed for developing longer proxy records of climate change.
