This is a study of entrepreneurship in Hong Kong, administering a survey to a
sample of 600 entrepreneurs. It has three chief aims. First, it seeks to provide
empirical knowledge about who the entrepreneurs are in terms of social origins
and demographics, what kinds of business activities they engage in, and how and
why they engage in such activities. Second, it will investigate how gender,
ethnicity, and immigration status may affect entrepreneurial activities. Third,
it will inquire into the nature of business organization in Chinese family
firms, especially those issues regarding management and ownership control,
training and compensations, as well as to explore possible sources of variation
across firms, in particular, whether firm size, ownership pattern, duration of
operation, industrial sector, technological sophistication, and the persons in
charge of operation (the original founders or their descendants) have any
influence in organizational structures. The collected data will allow systematic
investigation of the differences and similarities among Hong Kong, China, and
the United States in the social composition of entrepreneurs, factors that
hinder or contribute to entrepreneurial activities, and types of entry
strategies. In addition, this survey will provide data to compare the
organizational structures of Chinese family business firms with those found in
the United States, utilizing data assembled in the National Organizations
Survey. %%% This study will be done at a crucial time in the economic and social
history of Hong Kong, immediately before custody of it is regained by the
People's Republic of China. Thus, the research will provide baseline data for
understanding changes that may take place under a new and potentially different
political and economic system. Comparison of the results with those from
existing studies of entrepreneurs in China and the United States will provide
insights into the social sources of growth throughout the rapidly developing
Pacific Rim.
