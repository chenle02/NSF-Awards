Faults in convergent margin environments appear to be important conduits for
the expulsion of fluids during sediment compaction. This process is important in
controlling the alteration and physical properties of the sediment, and may be
significant in determining the nature folding and deformation of sediment
sequences. Little is known, however, about the permeability of sediments along
and across individual fault zones. It is this permeability structure that
ultimately controls fluid movement. The present project will examine variations
in permeability before and after displacement along a fault. Specifically the
project will use experimental and theoretical techniques to examine the change
in hydrogeological properties of mud rich sediments in response to deformation
and will evaluate the consequences this has for the dynamics of accreting
sedimentary wedges. The principal investigator has a distinguished record in
studies of these processes in the field. The present project will extend his
work to the laboratory.
