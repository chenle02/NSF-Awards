The broader impact of this Small Business Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to
reduce methane production in the ruminant livestock industry via the commercial
production of Asparagopsis taxiformis for inclusion in cattle feed. There are
currently 1.5 billion head of cattle on earth, which contribute significantly to
greenhouse emissions via methane release during growth. It has been demonstrated
that the inclusion of A. taxiformis in cattle feed can drive down methane
emissions by more than 80%. However, production capabilities of A. taxiformis
lag behind the market need. A conservative estimate for biomass production
necessary to mitigate methane emissions of 1.5 billion cattle is 264 metric tons
of fresh algae biomass daily. The goal of this project is to optimize outdoor
cultivation practices is necessary to meet this production goal. Additionally,
pelletization of the final product will broaden implementation capacity of this
novel livestock feed additive from small farmers to industrial feedlots, further
increasing the impact of the product by incorporating this novel feed into
standard ranching practices.

This project pursues development of novel cultivation procedures of A.
taxiformis in scaled production operations. Currently, production approaches
focus on low-light, energy intensive, and difficult to scale indoor cultivation.
This project focuses on producing biomass in automated outdoor cultivation
systems, thus overcoming limitations of scaling and associated energy costs of
indoor cultivation. The development of alternative outdoor cultivation systems
specific to the speciesâ€™ needs will improve yield in production to meet industry
needs. Additionally, the industry standard of milling final feed products
results in a lower mass:volume ratio for shipment, driving shipping costs up.
Milled material is problematic for product viability due to moisture absorption
from increased surface area:air ratio. By working with a local feed mill where
the algae are produced, the approach outlined in this project can realize
economic gains by a local entity, reducing the costs of shipping dramatically.
