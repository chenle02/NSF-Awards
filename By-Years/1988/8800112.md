This is a proposal to study the maturation of lysosomal enzymes in
Dictyostelium discoideum. Using a sulfation defective mutant for the project,
and an in vitro system developed in his lab or sulfation of endogenous lysosomal
precursors and exogenous lysosomal enzymes, the investigator will focus on one
of the enzymes, N-acetylglucosaminidase. Since a nearly complete cDNA copy of
the mRNA has been cloned by the investigator, it would be easier to characterize
this enzyme.
