This award provides support for the operation and maintenance of the Millstone
Hill UHF Atmospheric Sciences radar for a program of incoherent scatter
investigations of upper atmospheric structure and dynamics. Radar operations of
approximately 900 hours per year will be carried out with emphasis given to the
multi-radar experiments which constitute the international World Day and CEDAR
programs. Other multi- radar operations as proposed by the radar user community
and as well as single-radar investigations of phenomena specific to Millstone
Hill's location at sub-auroral latitude will be pursued. The World Day program
includes detailed studies of the high and mid-latitude thermosphere and
electrodynamics as well as synoptic experiments which provide a rich data base
for a variety of upper atmospheric research topics. Support is provided for the
related research of the Haystack Observatory Atmospheric Sciences Group, who
staff the radar and direct its operation.
