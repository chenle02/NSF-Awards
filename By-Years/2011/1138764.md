Dr. Dorothy Zolandz and Dr. Katherine W Bowman of the National Research Council
of the National Academy of Sciences is supported by the Division of Chemistry,
the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Division of
Materials Research of the NSF to convene a study to assess the importance and
impact of glycomics and glycosciences research and the status of such research
in the U.S. It will examine strategies to enhance or develop the workforce,
tools, and capabilities needed to advance glycosciences and glycomics in order
to build on knowledge from genomics and proteomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
rapidly increasing amount of research is being undertaken on glycobiology and
glycochemistry, and many of the techniques and lessons applied to one cell type
and system may be applicable to the study of others. The fields are poised to
benefit from the development of a strategic vision for glycoscience and
glycomics that crosses boundaries of funding agencies and research fields,
including tools for characterization and analysis, databases and data
management, and other fundamental infrastructure. The proposed activity will
advance US research in areas such as the conversion of biomass to fuel, biomass
for material application, and cell-cell communication and recognition. The
proposed activity will also help build the infrastructure for chemical,
biological, and materials research.
