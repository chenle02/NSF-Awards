This proposal discusses a major problem, that of restructuring the overall
automatic generation control of power systems in order to provide effective
control of system reactive energy integrated with that of active power, so that
system voltage phenomena are brought under effective control and system voltage
dynamics cease to be disruptive and expensive. It is argued that an effective
first step will be to demonstrate the centrality of local reactive energy
balances (VAr "supply" and "losses") to the maintenance of an adequate system
voltage profile, and to formulation of an effective control objective function.
At the same time, this demonstration will provide immediately an effective means
for establishing on-line operating constraints on energy transfers so as to
minimize production costs while maintaining an acceptable level of system
security. Thus, Phase I, while being of appropriately modest scope, will
demonstrate the feasibility of an effort for Phases II and III that will provide
a powerful and effective tool for dealing with a costly problem, and will also
lay an effective groundwork toward solution of the larger problem of overall
system control restructuring.
