The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Delaware State University seeks to strengthen the
university's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate underrepresented students
in STEM by strengthening the forensic biology program and achieving
accreditation by the Forensic Science Education Program Accreditation
Commission. Outreach activities to high school students and community members
are part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives
to: grow the number of students enrolled in and graduating from the forensic
biology program; improve the placement rates of graduating seniors into STEM
graduate programs or the STEM workforce; and increase the number of criminal
justice majors who choose a forensic science minor. This project will revise and
upgrade the forensic biology courses and curriculum, increase collaborative
efforts with forensic science laboratories and professional organizations at the
local, state, and federal level, and develop sustainable internship and
mentoring programs to improve student retention and placement into graduate
programs and careers post-graduation. The evaluation plan includes a study, that
is both qualitative and quantitative, on the trajectories of students majoring
in forensic biology and those minoring in forensic science, to identify hurdles
that students face during degree completion, and, to put structures in place to
address them, thereby improving retention, and degree completion
rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
