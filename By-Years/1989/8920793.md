Identification of a virus is a two step process, requiring collecting
information about a set of characteristics of the unknown and then comparing
that set to data stored on known viruses. The process of comparison is eased if
different laboratories use well-standardized descriptors and can readily compare
their values to reference data sets. Several different approaches have already
been developed to meet these needs. Now is an opportune time to evaluate each of
these and determine the feasibility and utility of coordinating the development
of an interdisciplinary standard for coding descriptors. Because of its
commitment to maintaining information on diverse viruses, the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) will promote interaction among professionals
interested in this effort by hosting an exploratory two-day workshop including
representatives of several virology societies, nomenclature groups, and
knowledge base developers. This meeting will serve to evaluate current projects,
suggest solutions, and enlist the support of scientific societies. The report of
this meeting will: 1) evaluate the need for standardization; 2) identify the
participants who would be represented in any such effort and 3) serve as one
basis for evaluation of future funding by granting agencies.
