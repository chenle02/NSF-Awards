Several companies have produced excellent CCD detectors with low noise,
negligible dark current, and high charge-transfer efficiency. These devices are
nearly ideal for astronomical observations, with the exception of low overall
quantum efficiency (QE) and small imaging area. At Steward Observatory a post-
manufacture CCD optimizing process has been developed with which commercially
produced devices can be thinned for backside illumination, backside charging and
antireflection coating. This procedure has now been demonstrated successfully on
several devices manufactured at the Loral Aeronautronics Corporation. As a
result of this success, we have undertaken a joint program with the National
Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) to custom-design two CCD detector formats
for use in astronomical spectroscopy. Eighty-eight of each of these two devices
have been manufactured (at NOAO's expense) with potentially 20% of
astronomically useful quality. In this proposal we seek funding for the
thinning, packaging, backside charging, antireflection coating, and
implementation of several of these devices in the spectrographs of the two
largest telescopes at the University of Arizona; the Multiple Mirror Telescope
(MMT) on Mt. Hopkins and the 2.3 m telescope on Kitt Peak. These instruments are
workhorse facility spectrographs routinely used by faculty, students, and
visitors, and will benefit greatly by the improved spectral coverage, higher
efficiency, flatter imaging surface, and lower noise of the new detectors. The
MMT spectrograph in particular will for the first time have a two-dimensional
detector available for blue and near-UV observations. This will open entirely
new classes of observations which can be efficiently made with this large
aperture telescope.
