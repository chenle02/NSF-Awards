This is an investigation of human-machine interaction in a natural language
environment where mistakes leading to misunderstandings can occur. Focussing on
recognition of the plan underlying a user's utterances, the research has two
objectives: (1) to isolate and model the kinds of knowledge that hearers use to
infer speakers' plans and to revise their inferences when they do not fit the
current context, and (2) to develop computational techniques that draw on that
knowledge to revise such inferences. Since speakers and hearers may not have the
same beliefs, perceptions, or goals at each point in a conversation, mistakes
can occur when a hearer interprets a speaker's utterances. This is a problem
that must be overcome if robust natural language processing systems are to be
developed. In this research the problem is addressed by developing a language
understanding framework which is less restrictive than earlier ones.
