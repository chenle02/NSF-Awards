This award supports U.S. participation in the international workshop "Frontiers
and Opportunities in Antarctic Earth Sciences" to be held in Siena, Italy in
August of 2004 following the International Geological Congress. The workshop
will be hosted by the Museo Nationale dell Antartide and is planned as a forum
for information exchange, outreach, and discussion of scientific goals and
outstanding problems in Antarctic earth science. Keynote speakers represent
international/national research initiatives and will address developing
technologies and interdisciplinary approaches. The workshop will provide an
important means of outreach among countries involved in Antarctic research and
will bring together investigators from twelve nations, including young
investigators and scientists not previously involved in Antarctica. Results will
be disseminated by publication of the proceedings in a special issue of Terra
Antarctica Reports [www.mna.it/publications], together with a workshop report on
the conference website, www.mna.it.
