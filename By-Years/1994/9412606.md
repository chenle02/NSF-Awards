9412606 Lambright This project will prepare a case history of the U.S. Global
Change Research Program (USGCRP). The study will combine and use appropriate
social science concepts in a political constructionist approach. This approach
focuses on political and policy processes, examining the roles of key actors in
governmental processes that require networking and strategies. A major issue in
this effort is the negotiation of boundaries between science and policy -- and
scientists and politicians. Recognition of this form of negotiation is the
contribution of social constructionism. The USGCRP is one of the largest and
most extensive research efforts in the federal government. Begun in 1987, it has
grown to have a $1.5 billion budget, spread through at least nine agencies. The
first official "Presidential Initiative," it later became the first designated
multi-agency endeavor intended both to build good science and usefully serve
policymakers. While criticized for weakness in policy relevance, it nevertheless
is also being expanded and used by the Clinton Administration as a model for
other major national research initiatives that cut across agencies.
Understanding the forces that have shaped USGCRP, particularly the mechanism
that governed the program -- the interagency Committee on Earth and
Environmental Sciences (CEES) -- will provide some lessons for national research
policy for other endeavors. Results from this project will include
presentations, articles and a book. ***
