With this RUI Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the research
of Professor LuAnne McNulty of Butler University to study the preparation and
reactions of alkenyl cyclic boronic half esters. Alkenyl cyclic boronic half
esters are readily prepared by transesterification of homoallylic alcohols with
alkenylboronic acids, followed by ring closing metathesis. Alkenyl cyclic
boronic half esters are suitable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling
reactions with aryl halides and beta-halo-alpha,beta-unsaturated electrophiles.
The Suzuki-Miyaura affords products that are capable of undergoing an
intramolecular oxa-Michael reaction to generate dihydropyrans. The optimization
of a single pot tandem Suzuki-Miyaura/Michael reaction will be studied through
the modification of the base beta-halo-alpha,beta-unsaturated electrophiles used
in the coupling reaction. The proposed work strives to provide an alternate
method to the preparation of dihydropyrans, common natural product substructural
units. In addition, the work could allow one to set multiple stereoisomers of
the same dihydropyran by modification of substituents on the precursor alkenyl
cyclic boronate. The educational broader impacts of this project involve
training undergraduate students. The PI will continue her strong history of
mentoring women in synthetic research. Undergraduate students that participate
in this project will gain valuable experience in modern synthetic chemistry,
including organo-boron and transition metal-mediated chemistry, and will have
opportunities to present their work at regional and national meetings.
