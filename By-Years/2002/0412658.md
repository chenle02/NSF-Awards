0412658&lt;br/&gt;McDuff&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Washington's
School of Oceanography provides instrumentation to improve the oceanographic
research capabilities of the research vessels Thompson and Barnes, operated by
UW as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
fleet. The specific items supported with this award include a new towed
magnetometer and two new fluorometers for use with CTD systems. These
improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using these
two ships in their research during 2004 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
