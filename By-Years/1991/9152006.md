The aim of the project is to introduce dynamic operation, control and analysis
into the energy laboratory via a new heat pump experiment that is to be
developed and constructed using a vapor compression cycle. It consists of a 1 to
2 ton refrigeration compressor driven by a programmable variable speed drive,
and arranged so that "heat" can be pumped in either direction between two
identical insulated liquid filled tanks. Valves are provided so that the role of
the evaporator and condenser can be reversed. This allows a rapid cycle time so
that several dynamic experiments can be run during the course of a single two
hour laboratory period. The pressure, temperature, flow, motor speed and torque
transducers will input to a PC via an A/D convertor so that the transient can be
recorded and displayed, and so that data analysis can be performed. The students
can examine how the system responds to changing loads, they can observe the
change in COP during the course of the work cycle, and they can consider several
control strategies in an effort to minimize energy consumption. A synergy of
energy and design related concepts is emphasized in the experimental design.
