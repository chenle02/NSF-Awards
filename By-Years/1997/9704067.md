This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a unique
adaptive system identification (SI) method that will enable reconfigurable
modeling of a complex nonlinear dynamic system. This unique SI method will apply
to a wide range of operating regimes as well as adapt to slow changes in the
system being modeled. The SI method will be demonstrated in an adaptive critic
applied to a difficult real-world problem. It will use an Ontogenetic (variable-
structure learning) neural network to learn to compensate for the difference
between a linear and nonlinear system model, producing results within a given
accuracy of the system's actual performance. Hosted on an Multiple Instruction
Multiple Data (MIMD) neural network processor, it will be computationally very
fast. The SI method will be used in adaptive critic neurocontrol of an
experimental aircraft testbed. Commercial applications of the SI technology
under development in this Phase II program include process control, financial
forecasting, and aircraft flight control.
