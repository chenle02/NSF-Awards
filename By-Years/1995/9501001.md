This award supports a four-day conference on modular representation theory.
Particular emphasis will be on current research related to Alperin's Weight
Conjecture and related conjectures, as well as Puig's Source Algebra Conjecture.
Related developments involving group complexes, Frobenius categories and other
topics will be explored. The principal speakers will include Alperin, Broue,
Puig and Robinson. The conference supported concerns the representation theory
of finite groups. A group is an algebraic object used to study transformations.
Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool in physics, chemistry, computer
science, and biology as well as mathematics. Representation theory is an
important method for determining the structure of groups.
