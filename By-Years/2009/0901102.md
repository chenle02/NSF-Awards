Benedict Gross plans to do research on the boundary between representation
theory and number theory, exploring the implications of the local and global
Langlands correspondence. He expects to extend his conjectures with D. Prasad,
on restriction from SO(n) to SO(n-1), to restriction problems for all classical
groups. This will have implications for the arithmetic of Hermitian and
orthogonal Shimura varieties. Gross also plans to investigate the simple
supercuspidal representations he introduced with M. Reeder. He hopes to
determine their wild Galois parameters in all cases, and to exploit their simple
matrix coefficients in the trace formula.

Benedict Gross plans to work on the boundary between questions in number
theory, such as the representations of Galois groups, and questions in the
representation theory of groups, such as the decomposition of the restriction of
representations of the unitary group U(n) to the subgroup U(n-1). These problems
are quite mysteriously related, via the conjectural Langlands correspondence,
and Gross hopes to explore their connections in more detail.
