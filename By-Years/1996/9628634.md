HRD - 9628634 Gutheil MeHarry Medical College The objective of this proposal is
to expand research capabilities and training opportunities in Biochemistry and
Physiology, with an emphasis on Molecular Biochemistry and Physiology, at
Meharry Medical College. The proposal seeks to improve the research
infrastructure which supports a research and training program focused on the
molecular aspects of enzyme function and cellular communication. The specific
aims of the proposal are: 1. To further develop the opportunities within the
Department of Biochemistry for training in the discipline of enzyme kinetics,
Dr. Gutheil's research proposal will focus on kinetic studies of the bacterial
glutathione dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. 2. To further develop the
opportunities within the Department of Biochemistry for training in the
structure- function studies of flavin monooxygenases, Dr. Atta- Asafo-Adjei's
research will focus on probing the structure and function of rabbit liver
flavin-containing monooxygenase (FM05) by cassette and site-directed
mutagenesis. 3. To further develop the opportunities within the Department of
Physiology for training in the discipline of cellular signaling, Dr. Motley's
research will focus on mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation
in VSMC. The Departments of Physiology and Biochemistry are currently in the
process of expanding their capabilities in the areas of Molecular Biochemistry
and Physiology. The proposed research will provide training opportunities for
under represented minorities in the disciplines encompassed by the proposed
research and allow these research areas within the institution to be further
developed. This objective will be met by providing some salary support for each
of the investigators, by providing support for two minorit y graduate students
for two years, and by providing some support for materials and supplies for the
proposed research projects.
