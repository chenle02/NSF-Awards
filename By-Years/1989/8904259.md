This research is to study the effects of the heterogeneity of elastic constants
on the radiation from seismic sources. Both theoretical studies and data
analysis will be applied to the significance of heterogeneous versus homogeneous
fault zone theory using data from borehole seismograms recorded along the San
Andreas fault near Parkfield, California. The results of this research will bear
on the prediction of strong ground motion, and also for the estimation of source
properties from both teleseismic and near-field data. It is therefore an
important contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
