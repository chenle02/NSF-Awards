This project replaces an antiquated screw powered universal testing machine
(UTM) with a modern UTM with a capacity of 400,000 lbs. in compression and
200,000 lbs. in tension. The UTM is hydraulically operated which offers more
precise control that the mechanically operated screw type. This increased
control makes it easier to control experiments and to improve accuracy when
operating in the lower load ranges. The UTM is equipped with accessories which
provide the civil and mechanical engineering departments the capability of
testing concrete cylinders in compression, unthreaded rods and reinforcing bars,
and flat bar specimens. A flat bed recorder is provided to make hard copy
diagrams of stress versus strain for the materials tested. The new UTM is also
used in demonstration in the Pre-Freshmen Engineering Program designed to
minority high school students to the science and engineering fields. This award
is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
