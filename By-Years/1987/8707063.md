It has been shown experimentally that different alignments of fine-and coarse-
grained magnetite in limestone can be separated by the measurement of Anisotropy
of Anhysteretic Susceptibility (AAS) when a more conventional technique,
Anisotropy of low-field Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) failed to do so. Sediment
depositions will be carried out in an applied magnetic field both in (a)
cylinders simulating depostion under quiet conditions and (b) laboratory flumes
under controlled rated of sediment deposition and shear stress. The results can
be applied to separating grain-size-dependent contributions to magnetic
anisotropy. Results of this research will be applied to Remanent Magnetization
(DRM) from post-depositional chemical alterations and/or strain events and (b)
resolving the contributions of different grain sizes to the magnetic fabric of
sediments.
