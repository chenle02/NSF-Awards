The layered approach to system design has become popular in designing correct
systems because of the ease of visualizing the execution as a sequence of
processes each resulting from the execution of a layer. This research aims at a
lighter-weight approach compared to sequentialization of processes. It defines a
notion of communication speed as it is relevant to distributed systems, and a
hierarchy of communication speeds as an alternative to sequentialization of
processes. It also defines some synchronization abstractions that combine the
concept of hierarchy of communication speeds and some channel primitives. These
abstractions result in the same ease as sequentialization of processes and are
expected to improve the system efficiency in a layered system. They are also
useful for designing concurrent programs. This research has several objective.
1) Develop a framework of thinking based on speeds of communication. 2) Develop
some implementations of these abstractions. 3) Develop a scheme for
decentralized control using hierarchical channel Primitives. 4) Implement a
distributed operating system using hierarchical channel primitives and evaluate
its performance. 5) Develope concurrent algorithms that use and a concurrent
programming environment that supports hierarchical channel primitives.
