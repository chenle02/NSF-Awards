This project consists of two part which are of roughly equal magnitude. The
first part involves empirical research on business fixed investment. The aim
here is to estimate and interpret dynamic models of investment. Models and
solution techniques will be developed for analyzing the response of investment
to movements in interest rates, wages, taxes, and productivity. The model for
investment will be embedded in a larger macroeconomic model, to study the
economy-wide links between investment on the one hand and business cycles and
economics policy on the other. The second part of the project involves
theoretical econometrics, with substantive empirical applications. The main
effort here concerns optimal instrumental variables estimation in the presence
of conditionally heteroskedastic disturbances. The author will develop and
evaluate, via simulations, feasible estimators, applying the estimators to
weekly data on exchange and interest rates. A related but smaller project will
continue ongoing work on inference about out-of-sample predictions, by
developing regression based tests and allowing for a broader class of measures
of predictive ability.
