The creation of intelligent systems that are autonomous, update their own
objectives, and interact with humans in their daily lives, has long been a
driving force in systems engineering, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence.
Example systems include nursing robots in hospitals, self-driving vehicles, and
worker bots collaborating with humans. An explicit ethical awareness in these
systems is recognized as a necessary condition for successful daily interaction
with humans. However, to this day, there are comparatively few algorithms, and
even fewer tools, for designing ethics-equipped Autonomous Intelligent Systems
(AIS), especially when integrated with a physical control loop. This research
develops a computational theory and formal design tools for ethics-equipped
embodied AIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the design tasks of
model-checking, controller synthesis, and constrained learning from data, of
formalized ethical guidelines. Such guidelines take the form of statements of
Obligation (`The robot ought to care for the patient in greater pain'),
Permission (`The robot is permitted to offer a mask to a contagious patient')
and Prohibition (`The robot is forbidden from factoring gender into care
decisions'). The investigators formalize such Obligations, Permissions and
Prohibitions in a deontic logic developed as part of the project. Methods from
software engineering, optimal control, and deep learning, are employed to create
a design pipeline that allows transparent and rigorous experimentation with
different guidelines. An education plan for undergraduate and high-school
students complements the researchâ€™s goal of enabling communities and
professionals from different disciplines to assess the claims of autonomous
systems manufacturers and determine their alignment with community
values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
