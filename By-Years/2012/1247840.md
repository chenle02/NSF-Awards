Opportunities for time-sharing spectrum use could allow for significant
improvements in spectrum efficiency. Two large users of spectrum bandwidth --
radar and remote sensing -- are also two applications that might best be able to
allow time sharing. For example, radar usually sweeps in direction, which may
allow use of the radar frequency in directions not being scanned at any one
instant. Remote sensing applications, which often use Dicke switching to switch
between the observed source and an internal calibration source, could also allow
time sharing during the calibration cycle. The research will investigate the
incorporation of a time dimension to spectral allocations, and will also
investigate relevant market assessments of the value of spectrum made available
through temporal sharing.
