Nonnegative integer invariants provide an important way of understanding
complicated algebraic or geometric objects. Examples include the degree of a
polynomial and the number of holes of a surface. The goal of this project is
develop general methods to obtain a detailed understanding of nonnegative
integer invariants arising in several different areas of mathematics. This may
form the foundation for developments in quantum information theory, knot theory,
physics, and signal processing. In particular, this project offers potential new
insights into the tensor decomposition problem, which is essentially the problem
of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals and has applications
in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.

Positivity problems in algebraic combinatorics ask to find positive
combinatorial formulae for nonnegative quantities arising in geometry and
representation theory. The goal of this project is to develop tools to solve
positivity problems arising in two areas of active research, Macdonald theory
and geometric complexity theory. Macdonald polynomials are a two-parameter
family of symmetric polynomials, which have ties to many areas including
geometry, physics, and knot theory. A major breakthrough in this area came with
the proof of the Macdonald positivity conjecture, which showed that important
structure coefficients related to Macdonald polynomials are nonnegative. It
remains a fundamental open question to give a positive combinatorial
interpretation of these coefficients. Geometric complexity theory is an approach
to P versus NP and related problems in complexity theory using algebraic
geometry and representation theory. A fundamental problem in representation
theory, believed to be important for this approach, is the Kronecker problem,
which asks for a positive combinatorial formula for decomposing the tensor
product of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group into
irreducibles. This project will further develop the theory of noncommutative
Schur functions, a powerful tool for solving positivity problems, particularly
focusing on applications to Macdonald polynomials and the Kronecker problem.
