This award provides funds to the Department of Microbiology at the University of
Alabama for the continuation and improvement of laboratory instruction in two
related courses: Immunology Laboratory, and Cell Culture and Hybridoma
Technology. Both courses are intensive project-based laboratory experiences
designed to demonstrate the underlying principles of many modern laboratory
procedures. The unreliability or unavailability of appropriate equipment
endangers the continuation and improvement of the well- established Immunology
Laboratory and the continuation beyond its initial trial offering of the newly
created hybridoma course. Equipment to be purchased with this award includes:
two cell culture work stations (laminar flow biological safety cabinet, inverted
phase contrast microscope, waterbath) and a double- chambered water-jacketed CO2
incubator for Cell Culture and Hybridoma Technology; and four UV/visible
spectrophotometers, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis equipment, and a low-
speed high- volume refrigerated centrifuge for Immunology Laboratory. The
combination of these two courses will provide students with an introduction to
modern immunologic techniques followed by the applications of these techniques
to the specialized field of production and use of monoclonal antibodies. While
the number of students that will complete this training is relatively low, the
intensity of training is very high. In addition, the equipment will impact upon
a larger number of students in lower division courses through the introduction
of new demonstrations and expanded experiments and will enhance the
undergraduate research program. The grantee is matching this award with funds
from non-Federal sources.
