The award supports the attendance of twelve students to the International
conference on Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI),
to be hosted in San Diego, January 19-21. VMCAI is a successful established
conference that bridges the gap between the various methodologies that are used
for formal verification. VMCAI been a source for much collaboration and cross-
fertilization and has attracted many of the key researchers in the related
fields. Students have much to gain from attending VMCAI like learning state-of-
the-art methodologies, being exposed to novel techniques, and interacting with
senior researchers in their chosen area of expertise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
importance of formal verification is becoming widely accepted. Increasing the
attendance of students in VMCAI will expose more students to the exciting
developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of
expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.
