This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to prepare a
new class of ultrafast, efficient phosphor and scintillator materials. To regain
the competitive edge in displays, the phosphors must be fast and efficient at
low voltages and high currents. The efficient and ultrafast phosphors developed
by Nanocrystals Technology (NCT), will improve the above properties
significantly. The NCT will develop efficient and ultrafast blue, green and red
line-emitting rare-earth doped nanocrystalline (DNC) phosphors. The unique
properties of the DNC phosphors could lead to a cost-effective, flat-slim,
bright display with high-contrast and high-resolution. In addition to display
applications, the ultrafast speed in efficient DNC phosphors can lead to
extremely fast scintillator materials. During the proposed Phase I effort, NCT
will develop and characterize the visible line-emitting phosphors using room
temperature chemical preparative techniques. The extension of this work to Phase
II will include the performance evaluation of these phosphors in display and
scintillator systems.
