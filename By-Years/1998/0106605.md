0106605&lt;br/&gt;Huang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support
of the costs of acquiring a bench-top gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer
(GC/MS) for the organic geochemistry laboratory at the Brown University. The PI,
Yongsong Huang is an assistant professor at Department of Geological Sciences.
In addition to Huang, several other faculties at Geology (Herbert, Prell, Webb,
Clemens, Murray and Schultz) and Environmental Studies Program (Hamburg, Ward)
at Brown University will have access to the GC/MS for their research. This
facility will also contribute significantly to the educational objectives for
undergraduate and graduate students. The addition of a bench-top GC/MS will
allow convenient identification of organic compounds in sediments, soils and
plant samples. The instrument is an important tool for various aspects of
organic geochemical research, particularly those involving compound-specific
isotope analyses. The identity and purity of organic compounds must be
established by structural GC/MS in order for their isotopic measurements to be
meaningful. The instrument will also facilitate research collaboration in and
outside Brown University. The bench-top GC/MS will be housed in a newly
renovated 650 square-foot room, specifically designed to accommodate mass
spectrometers and various peripheral devices. Support for this grant is shared
between the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF) and
the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE).&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
