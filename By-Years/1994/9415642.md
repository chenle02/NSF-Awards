This project is to investigate the problem of deep circulation in the
Caribbean/Gulf of Mexico and the paradox of deep measured flow at the Yucatan
sill. The study will be done by mean of analysis of a collection of historical
hydrographic data. Potential vorticity maps will be used to indicate flow paths
and the (-spiral method will be employed to yield the absolute flow field. The
focus will be on the deep circulation, with particular emphasis on the inflow
and out flow of deep water. The connection between the Caribbean and the
Atlantic will be studied as well as inter-basin exchange.
