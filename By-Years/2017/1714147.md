Electronic chips are susceptible to defects that occur during their
manufacturing as well as their lifetime. As technologies advance, the
susceptibility to defects increases because of more complex manufacturing
processes and smaller feature sizes. Detecting the occurrence of defects is
critical to the correct operation of electronic chips, and the correct and safe
operation of the many products that include them. This project will prepare
students for the challenges of designing and manufacturing reliable electronic
chips in current and future technologies. The PI of this project is a female
faculty member at the Purdue university, and will play role model for women and
underrepresented groups to encourage them for pursuing degrees in the field of
electrical and computer engineering, thus contributing to the much needed
diversity in the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To manage the complexity
and variability in defect behaviors, fault models are used as abstract
representations of defects, and a comprehensive set of tests targets the
detection of faults from different models. However, faults from different models
may have similar tests, and when tests do not exist, defects in certain areas of
the chip remain uncovered. To address the need to detect defects in the entire
electronic chip, in this project, the faults are considered as pieces in a
mosaic, and the goal is to ensure that the mosaic is complete. Completeness is
achieved when every area of the mosaic is covered by a sufficient number of
pieces. In terms of faults, completeness is achieved, for example, by defining a
new fault model to complement an existing one such that tests exist
independently for faults from the two models. The mosaic-based approach will be
implemented as part of an industry-inspired framework that produces information
about likely-to-occur defects, and using commercial tools.
