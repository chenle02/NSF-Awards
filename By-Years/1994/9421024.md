This project supports the research of a linguistic anthropologist from Johns
Hopkins University in a field project studying language usage in Egypt. The
official language is Classical Arabic, a language whose source is the Koran and
which is used in prayer and in all official documents as well as in commercial
uses. Egyptian Arabic is the native language of elite and non-elite Egyptians,
and is the vehicle of communication of daily life, poetry, folklore, songs and
proverbs as well as film and TV. Using participant observation and structured
tests and interviews the investigator will study how average Egyptians relate to
the classical language, distinguishing categories by gender, social class and
age. The usage of classical Arabic as a symbol of pan-Arab Islam will be
studied. This research is important because Islam is a dynamic force in the
world from the Balkans to the middle East and through the former USSR. Increased
understanding of the sources of solidarity and tension of language usage in an
Islamic country will help us know how to deal with reactions of Islamic
societies to encroaching modernism, persistent tradition, and to understand the
differences between `Arab` and `Islamic`.
