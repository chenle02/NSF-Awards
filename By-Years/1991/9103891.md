This award provides partial support for the workshop on the genome of E. coli
to be held on October 16-19, 1991 at Banbury Center, Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory. The workshop will focus on a discussion of the current and future
efforts to sequence the genome of E. coli. Informatics and integration of E.
coli genome sequencing efforts with the general E. coli research community as
well as genome sequencing efforts of other organisms will be major topics of
discussion. The workshop is jointly supported by NCHGR, DOE, NLM, and NSF.
