An important area of sociolegal research is the study of the ways in which law
and culture interact in structuring how people make sense of their world. While
cultural systems constantly change and affect legal systems as well as the
everyday assumptions of people who deal with them, opportunities are rare to
study the nature and sources of change and whether these changes reflect
indigenous influences or more global developments. This study of Islamic law
aims to make such a contribution. The project itself will be centered on the
legal and social system of Morocco where Islamic law is distinctive for the
judge's reliance on a set of common sense cultural assumptions. The research
design calls for examining data on Islamic law collected in the 1960's in
comparison to contemporary data. It is hypothesized that common sense cultural
conceptions of causation, probability, and intent are manifested in legal
interactions where there is a necessity to manipulate and debate these terms
explicitly. Thus, by studying legal proceedings and conversations about such
proceedings, it will be possible to detect gradual transformations in the
culture as a whole as well as in the nature of law in Moroccan society.
Intensive interviews, courtroom observation, and conversational analysis will be
used to consider how conceptual changes are developing and how indigenous
alterations affect social relations, assessment of land tenure disputes, and
modes of characterizing other person's states of mind. This study, by comparing
discourse and action across time, provides a unique opportunity for exploration
of the roots of sociocultural change and the impact of the conceptual changes on
legal systems. The research also promises to have important implications not
only for understanding the changes which have occurred in the societies of North
Africa in recent decades and but also for what is occuring now. As such, the
project will contribute to basic knowledge and theories in both law and social
science and cultural anthropology.
