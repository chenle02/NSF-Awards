The gap between huge data requirements of many applications and limited
capabilities of transmission and storage systems dictated the need for
developing high-performance data compression hardware. This research focuses on
the study and implementation of nonstationary multi-alphabet source coding
algorithms suitable for VLSI implementations, given the current and near-future
technology; the implementation of high-throughput circuits for real-time
applications; and the determination of an optimal tradeoff between the
compression performance and circuit configurations given constrained chip area.
The developed algorithms and circuits are excepted to offer more cost-effective
data compression for communication and storage systems.
