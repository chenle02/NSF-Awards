9355607 Sachse In each of three years eighty teachers through out California
will continue implementation of coordinated science in grades 10-12. Teachers
will be selected from a pool of 40 SS&C Project schools which have received UC-
Office of the President approval of their SS&C courses for college preparatory
coursework. Teams of two teachers from the selected schools will participate in
2-week institutes at either SCU-Sacramento or UC-San Diego. The 2-week summer
institutes are complemented by eight Saturday workshops during the academic
year. An additional two hundred teachers and administrators will participate in
linkage activity workshops in the summer and throughout the academic year. For
example, one administrator, two 11th grade teachers and two 12th grade teachers
from the participating 10th grade teachers' school attend. All teachers are also
linked through CSUNET e-mail. A comprehensive evaluation plan uses: NSTA's
Guideline for Self- Assessment; Course Content and Instructional Analysis
adapted from a NSF study; the CA-Golden State Exam; CA-Learning Assessment
System, and; a daily log to study science content and pedagogy used in the
coordinated science classrooms. The goal of this evaluation is to compare
student success in coordinated science (SS&C) with the traditional layer-cake
curriculum.
