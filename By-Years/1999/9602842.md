This is a program based on the use of x-rays from synchrotron sources in
fundamental investigations of the physical and chemical phenomena of primary
importance to the understanding of core-level processes in atoms and molecules.
The work is an outgrowth of the development of instrumentation to be used at the
Advanced Light Source (ALS), where the team has preferred access to a bending
magnet beamline. Attention will be given to study of a broad range of features,
including x-ray resonant-Raman effects, non-electric-dipole effects, and
polarization- sensitive x-ray emission.
