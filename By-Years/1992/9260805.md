Use of UV dyes is advantageous in many fluorescence detection applications due
to the favorable dye properties (OPA, for example, tags the primary amines with
a fast reaction at room temperature). However, UV dyes can only be excited with
weak plasma sources or bulky and unreliable lasers. What is needed for this
market is a rugged fluorescence detector with the sensitivity of the laser by
the size of the plasma source. We propose to develop such a detector based on
diode laser technology. Our calculations show it will be orders of magnitude
more sensitive than conventional plasma-based detectors, yet significantly
smaller and cheaper than the existing lasers. Our solid-state approach has no
moving parts, and promises a mean time before failure of tens of thousands of
hours. In the Phase I program, we will construct a laboratory model of the light
source and measure the generated UV power. In Phase II, we will construct the
detector, install it in a commercial separation or analysis system, and compare
its performance with the best alternatives.
