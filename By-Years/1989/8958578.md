Rabaey Research efforts are focused on the development of the HYPER high level
synthesis environment. In order to obtain a complete and more functional
environment, extensions and improvements are being developed that provide more
accurate cost and performance predictions, transform (recursive) structures into
alternate forms which achieve maximally fast performance (amongst others), and
incorporate an optimization environment for background memory and input/output
interfaces.
