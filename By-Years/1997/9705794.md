ABSTRACT The proposal seeks funding to co-sponsor with the Gas Research
Institute (GRI) a workshop on submerged combustion in porous media. The
combustion of gaseous fuels in porous media has the potential to result in lower
NOx emissions compared to more conventional combustion technologies. The
objectives of the workshop are to identify technological and economical issues
facing the development of this technology, define the research areas necessary
to resolve the issues, and provide potential researchers and sponsors with
guidelines for evaluating the importance of the proposed research.
