This proposal studies surface alloy segregation in single crystal and
polycrystalline noble metal systems using angle-resolved Auger electron
spectroscopy and variable electron exit angles. Single crystals are oriented
with low index surfaces exposed, and are characterized by low energy electron
diffraction. Process variables include temperature, alloy composition, and
crystal orientation. Of interest are the lattice strains arising from atomic
size mismatch. Calculations using the Embedded Atom Method are used to model the
composition depth profiles. The subject of surface segregation in metallic
alloys is important to properties and behavior. Alloy systems selected should
provide valuable addition to data base on surface segregation.
