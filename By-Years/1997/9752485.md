This project takes place over the next two academic years (Fall 1998 through
Spring 2000). Each year a small group of students (20-24) take part in a
combined calculus and physics course. In the first year the students are
recruited from the physics department and the electrical engineering department.
The project team's initial energies are focused on the development of course
materials. Once the materials are in place, the program expands to a include a
greater number of students. The format of the class meetings follow a studio
setting. A physics course is currently meeting in a studio setting, and the
experience gained during this current semester are used to further develop the
course. The activities that take place this summer concentrate on the
development of the materials for the calculus thread. This development begins by
examining the materials from the current studio physics course, deciding on the
order that the calculus materials are introduced in the course, and developing
the appropriate course materials. The second summer is dedicated to updates and
revisions after the first pilot course is given. Based on the feedback and
evaluation of this first pilot program, changes are made as appropriate. As the
materials are revised we also take advantage of this period by organizing and
cataloging the materials. The efforts to organize and formalize the materials
allow us to offer a workshop during the third summer. The second pilot program
will also consist of a small cohort of students. The experience offers a test
case in order to further refine and evaluate the materials assembled. Again,
physics students and electrical engineering students are recruited for these
sections. During the third summer (2000), a workshop is offered for faculty with
an interest in implementing their own program. The course materials are
assembled and in near final form after the third summer. The materials are
distributed at the workshop. The workshop offers an important method of
disseminati on, and it also allows us a chance to test the materials for clarity
and usability.
