This award is to assist US-based students to attend the 2020 IEEE International
Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom) to be held in
Austin, Texas, March 23-27, 2020. Participation in PerCom 2020 and similar
conferences are valuable and important activities of the graduate school
experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers, and exposes students to leading work and practical industry
practices in this important area of research. This may have an important impact
on career development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference spans five days and
will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, industry presentations,
posters, and demonstrations. It will also feature keynote speeches from leading
researchers and practitioners in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student travel
to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed with preference
given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference and
paying particular attention to diversity and relevance of the student's research
interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
