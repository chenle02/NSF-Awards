AST 9530473 Astrometric Research in the Southern Hemisphere. Dr. Van Altena will
complete observations of a segment of the second epoch of the Southern Proper
Motion Survey. The data are collected at the Yale Southern Observatory base at
the Cesco Observatory at El Leoncito, Argentina. Dr. Van Altena will concentrate
on the region of the Magellanic Clouds and in two specific meridianal planes.
These data will supplement the interpretation of the South Galactic Pole region
proper motions in the context of galactic structure.
