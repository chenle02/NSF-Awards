In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professors Ning Dai and Luis Velarde at the University at
Buffalo are investigating the contribution of atmospheric nitrogen oxides to the
changes in pesticides which reside on leaf surfaces. Due to the widespread use
of pesticides in agricultural and urban environments and their inherent
toxicity, it is critical to develop capabilities to accurately predict the
changes that occur in these molecules on exposure to the environment. This
research project addresses a pesticide transformation pathway that is currently
not considered in the predictive models. The research is integrated with
synergistic educational activities, including training of graduate students,
research experiences for undergraduate students, incorporation of research into
the Environmental Engineering curriculum at the University at Buffalo, and
public science outreach for high school teachers and underrepresented high
school students in the Greater Buffalo region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
identifies pesticide functional groups that are susceptible to nitrogen oxide
reactions in water and organic solvents. The kinetics and products of nitrogen
oxide-induced pesticide transformation are then determined on simulated and
authentic leaf surfaces. The effects of environmental factors, including
sunlight, pesticide formula, and the structure of leaf cuticle wax, on the
reactions are also characterized. Lastly, vibrational sum frequency generation
(VSFG) spectroscopy is employed to characterize the molecular orientation and
tethering of surface-bound pesticides and their transformation products on model
leaf surfaces. This characterizational technique is used to correlate the
pesticide-leaf physical interaction with nitrogen oxide-pesticide reactions.
