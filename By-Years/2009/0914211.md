The ultimate aim of this investigation is to develop computer systems capable of
operating autonomously in dynamic and uncertain environments. The investigation
comprises theoretical and experimental studies aiming at fusing causal and
counterfactual relationships on top of probabilistic information to improve
tasks of diagnosis, situation assessment and decision making in data-intensive
applications. Specific research issues to investigate include developing
algorithms and conceptual tools for diagnosis and situation assessment, using
causal and counterfactual relationships, and developing novel methods of
structure learning using propensity-score estimation and C-equivalence tests,
with applications to epidemiology and molecular biology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical part of this research touches on the core
of human knowledge and scientific inquiry, and is having profound methodological
ramifications in the fields of epidemiology, social science, economics, medicine
and biology, where causal knowledge plays a major role. The practical part
focuses on the development of new algorithms for causal and counterfactual
reasoning, decision making and structure learning, with direct applications in
areas that use graphical methods to encode knowledge.
