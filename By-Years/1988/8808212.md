The objective of this proposal is to analytically and experimentally investigate
the formation of macro-shrinkage/porosity and micro-porosity in alloy
solidification. This is achieved by dividing the research into two steps. In the
first step, a numerical technique, based on the finite element method, will be
developed for the solution of the conduction heat transfer with phase change.
The finite element analysis program which is implemented in this step will be
interfaced with the existing geometrical modeling programs to form a CAD/CAM
package. The second step is to extend the model to calculations of
interdentritic fluid flow in the mushy region during alloy solidification. Both
the first model and the second model will be validated by comparing their
solutions with experimental measurements as well as with available data in the
literature. The metal castings foundry is one of the Nation's oldest industries,
but the fundamental understanding of the processes is lacking. The proposed
research is expected to make significant contributions not only to the
understanding of the formation of macro-shrinkage and micro-porosity of the
castings, but also to the design for casting processes for producing sound
castings at a lower cost.
