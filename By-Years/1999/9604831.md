INT-9604831 Landau This U.S.-Bulgarian Cooperative Research award is on
"Computer Simulations of Polydisperse Polymer Systems." The principal
researchers are Dr. David P. Landau of the University of Georgia, and Dr. Andrey
I. Milchev of the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Bulgarian Academy of
Sciences. The researchers will combine their expertise to perform large scale
Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the static and dynamic behavior of
polydisperse systems of a broad class of "soft" condensed matter systems
generally known as "living polymers." They will place particular emphasis on
understanding the behavior of model systems in confined geometries and under
conditions of shear flow. This research in applied condensed matter physics
fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S.
and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit. *** ??
