The proposed system consists of an optimized large scale microphone array that
allows spatial audio selection. This system can focus in on a target source
while suppressing interferences from a wide variety of locations. In other
words, the proposed system allows users to listen in on selected target source
even though the source may be surrounded by a host of other interfering sources.
The proposed technology achieves significant gains over current microphone array
implementations through joint optimization of microphone placement and
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology can process acoustic and
electromagnetic waveforms to discover both the number and location of sources in
multi-path, noisy environments. The technology separates each source by either
cancelling or attenuating interferences and identifies previously recognized
sources. Additionally the technology works in environments where sources both
move and outnumber the number of sensors. The technology optimizes sensor
placement and processing using state of the art optimization and statistical
modeling techniques.
