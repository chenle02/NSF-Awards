The International Workshop on Conformal Geometry and Geometric PDE will be held
at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR), Beijing,
China, from June 22-July 3, 2015. This is a two-week summer program that has two
parts. The first part is a summer school for graduate students. The summer
school will offer 5 mini-courses taught by leading experts to cover important
background as well as introduce frontier research topics in the field. The
second part is a research conference to facilitate and promote exchanges and
interactions, particularly among young researchers and leading experts in the
field. BICMR, which will host the program, is committed to support
collaborations fostered in this program. The program will stimulate more
research in the field and foster collaborations between researchers from US and
China.

The research in conformal geometric PDE is one of the most active research
fields in geometric PDE. There has been much exciting progress in the field
ranging from important developments in nonlinear elliptic and parabolic PDE, to
the better understanding of 4-manifolds that satisfy conformally invariant
curvature equations like Bach-flatness. This progress also extends to further
investigations on conformally compact Einstein manifolds that are essential to
the mathematical foundation for the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence proposed in
the promising theory of quantum gravity in theoretical physics. To absorb the
impact of such breadth it is clearly desirable to have a program to bring
together leading experts and young researchers to disseminate and digest the
rapid advancements as well as nurture creative ideas for further developments in
the field.
