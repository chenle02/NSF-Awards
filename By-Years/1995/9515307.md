One of the most pressing issues in understanding the sense of smell is to
understand the mechanisms that carry coded information from the nose into the
brain. The peripheral nerve cells, or neurons, form functional contacts called
synapses with central neurons. The first synaptic relay occurs in anatomical
clusters of cells called glomeruli, sharing this fundamental organization across
a wide phylogenetic range animals from lobsters, insects, snails, fish and
humans. These cell clusters of olfactory glomeruli, like the neural cartridges
in vision and cortical barrels in touch, are thought to play an important role
in stimulus recognition, but their role in central olfactory recognition remains
unknown. This project uses physiological, pharmacological and immunocytochemical
techniques on the distinct morphological regions within the glomeruli in the
lobster as a model system. Results will define the odor selectivity of
glomeruli, and determine the extent to which regional post-convergent processing
within and among glomeruli can shape the odor selectivity of a glomerulus. This
study will give new insight into neural integration of olfaction at the crucial
first stage of central processing, and will have an impact beyond simply
chemosensory neuroscience to brain function in general, to modeling of neural
networks, and to understanding how recognition of environmental stimuli is
integrated into behavior.
