This proposal considers problems in the area of optimal choice of observation
times for a random process. Bayesian inference and decision theory provide a
general and successful theoretical framework. Within this framework, the goal of
the proposed research is to seek advances in important application areas. In
particular, goals are: To lay the groundwork for Bayesian dynamic adjustment of
sampling frequency in monitoring a random process for control and other
purposes; to study models for detecting the presence of conditions that do not
manifest naturally; and to study design problems in which the goal of taking
observations is learning about process parameters. Acquiring information about
random phenomena over time is often costly and hard. Efficiency can be
substantially enhanced by careful choice of observation times. The proposed
research examines specific applications in the hope of a) providing solutions to
pressing practical problems; b) indicating general strategies. Examples of
applications include timing of screening exams for the early detection of
cancer; designing tests for improving software reliability; efficient monitoring
in meteorology, seismology and environmental sciences; efficient implementation
of process control and quality control in manufacturing; regulation of airplane
maintenance and others.
