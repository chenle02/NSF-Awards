Need-Based Sponsorship Of Student Travel to the 2008 Information Processing In
Sensor Networks (IPSN) Conference

The Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN) conference is an annual
event co-sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society and the ACM. IPSN
convenes the leading researchers in the field of sensor networks. This includes
the topics of novel network architectures, software systems, coding, data
processing, data storage and management, information and communication theory,
distributed algorithms and reasoning, programming models and languages, and
other topics. Also, IPSN 2008 introduces a new format with two focus areas to be
included in this single-track conference. This includes the information
processing (IP) and the Sensor Platforms, Tools, and Design Methods (SPOTS)
areas. IPSN has traditionally included the vanguard of research in this
community including the highlights in the Networking Technology and Systems
(NeTS) program. Another important feature for the 2008 conference is that this
will be co-located with the new Cyber-Physical Systems Week conference series
including the IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium
(RTAS) and the International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and
Control (HSCC'08). This NSF program is directed to sponsorship of student travel
to IPSN. This will promote the broad impact of including students who will
receive guidance and mentorship at IPSN and would not otherwise be able to
attend. Students will be selected by an application processing that includes
both student application and faculty recommendations.
