This engineering education research initiation grant will investigate how to
implement writing techniques that enable engineering students to develop broad
technical problem-solving skills. Such problem solving is a key outcome of
engineering degree programs. The techniques developed are expected to be easily
incorporated into existing engineering degree programs.

The broader significance and importance of this project will be in the area of
student development, and creation of the engineering workforce. Student
participants are expected to develop both as engineers and future researchers.
This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers
through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and
expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
