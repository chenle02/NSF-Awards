The Araceae are a diverse and highly variable family of tropical plants, and
the evolutionary relationships among its genera (approximately 110) and species
(2,300) are poorly understood. Dr. Michael Grayum has completed a monograph
entitled "External Pollen Ultrastructure of the Araceae and Putatively Related
Taxa", in which he presents a survey of pollen morphology in almost 400 species
representing nearly all genera in the family. The survey uses light and scanning
electron micrographs to reveal the fine structure of pollen grains that
characterize each species. Dr. Grayum's monograph will be published, with NSF
support, in the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden. The proposed monograph
will be an important reference volume for the identification of aroid species
using pollen. The morphological data presented in the monograph will open new
research avenues for establishing the evolutionary relationships within the
family.
