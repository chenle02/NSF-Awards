This project will support a postdoctoral scholar and graduate student?s efforts
to develop radiation hydrodynamical simulations of HII region breakouts of
primordial protostars. These models will also include the effects of
protostellar rotation, WIMP annihilation heating, and disk photo-evaporation,
and are needed in order to better understand how the first stars (Population
III.1) formed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has broader impacts in that some
research results will be integrated into teaching and public outreach activities
of the PI. An upper mass limit of the first stars will be an important input for
models of early universe chemical evolution as well as galaxy and globular
cluster formation.
