This project is to study the chemistry of the antarctic stratosphere with a
focus on those chemical constituents that are related to the annual springtime
depletion of ozone, known as the ozone hole. Visible and near ultraviolet
spectroscopy will be used to measure the total column abundances of nitrogen
dioxide, symmetrical chlorine dioxide, nitrogen trioxide and bromine monoxide
above McMurdo, Antarctica. The variation of the diurnal variation of these
chemicals is of particular value in understanding the photochemical processes
that cause the ozone hole. In addition, a novel technique that uses the moon as
a light source during times of sunrise and sunset will allow the measurement of
vertical profiles and also the rate of photolysis of fast reacting species. This
research is funded by the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory with logistical support
provided by NSF/DPP.
