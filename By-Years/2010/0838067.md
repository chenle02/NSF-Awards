This Small Business Innovation Research project is to develop and apply a novel
nano-crystalline functional material to existing commercial solar cells or
modules, to significantly enhance their energy conversion efficiency, without
incurring much cost or disruption to existing solar cell production process.

By significantly enhancing the efficiency of existing solar cells, this project
could impact the commercialization of solar electricity and benefit the Nation's
environment as well. The proposed approach is economical and easily-adoptable
step to increase output from the current commercial solar modules without
changing the existing production process.
