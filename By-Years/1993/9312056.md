9312056 Bocarsly This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing
Program in support of the research of Professor Andrew Bocarsley. Support is
provided by the Chemistry Division. The general thrust of the research is the
synthesis, electrochemistry and rheological and morphological characterization
of cyanometallate coordination polymers. Three specific areas will be
investigated: (1) Synthesis of cyano-bridged polymers formed by electrochemical
oxidation of a ferrocyanide-Pt(IV) tetrammine. (2) Synthesis of coordination
polymers based on Pd(II) tetrachloride and either ferrocyanide or ferricyanide.
These polymers are hydrogels whose rheological and morphological properties will
be studied. (3) Layers of the cyanide bridged Fe-Pt polymer, placed on a nickel
electrode will be photochemically patterned. This chemistry will lead to
transient optical gratings which will be employed to probe the details of
lateral and perpendicular charge-transfer from the electrode surface through the
polymer layer. Such systems may provide for novel electro-optical switches. %%%
Cyanometallate coordination polymers are relatively unexplored materials whose
redox, optical and rheological properties may lead to a host of novel
electronic, optical and structural applications. ***
