The principal investigator will continue his work in martingale theory and
stochastic integration, with emphasis on the vector-valued and multidimensional
time set extensions of the classical theory. Martingales, originally introduced
as mathematical models of fair games of chance, have found applications in all
branches of classical analysis. Two key methods in the classical theory, the use
of quadratic variation and of stopping time techniques, break down in the
vector- valued and multi-parameter settings, respectively. Thus the challenge
for this project is to determine whether the new tools developed within the past
decade can serve as effective substitutes.
