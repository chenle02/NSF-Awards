The principal investigator will study the intrusion of alkali olivine basalt
dikes into limestones at Killala Bay, Ireland. The nature and extent of fluid-
rock interactions will be determined from measured reaction progress,
supplemented by stable isotope analyses. Rates of fluid generation and transport
will be quantified with thermal history models. Numerical models of the
intrusion will be used to quantitatively analyze grain coarsening of several
minerals, as well as the kinetics of grossularite nucleation and growth, and to
provide a timescale for fluid production and interaction. The study will help
geologists understand the influence of fluids, and the metamorphic kinetics,
associated with the intrusions of igneous rocks.
