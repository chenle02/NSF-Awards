EEC-9700705 ABSTRACT This award provides funding to the University of
Washington, under the direction of Dr. Minoru Taya, for the support of a
Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Electronic Packaging
and Materials." This project's goals are to establish an interdisciplinary
research-curriculum on electronic packaging and materials (EPM) at the
University of Washington. A curriculum of four courses with materials
supplemented by new research results will be designed for teaching advanced
undergraduate and first-year graduate students as well as engineers from local
and regional industries as a part of the existing Televised Instruction in
Engineering (TIE) system.
