This project is concerned with research related to Flag and Schubert schemes.
The principal investigator will work on the following problems: (1) develop a
standard monomial theory for Kac-Moody groups; (2) determine the multiplicity of
a singular point on a Schubert variety; (3) develop a standard monomial theory
for tangent cones at singular points on a Schubert variety; (4) determine the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials P(w,t) for w greater than or equal to t; (5) write
the equations of the conormal bundle of a Schubert variety; (6) develop a theory
of quantum Flag and Schubert schemes in the finite and affine cases. This
project is concerned with the study of algebraic groups. It combines three of
the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics, algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it
is of great interest to physicists working on conformal field theory.
