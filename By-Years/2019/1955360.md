The demand for skilled technicians at manufacturing and construction companies
in the Los Angeles, California metropolitan area exceeds the capacity of local
manufacturing and architecture technology programs. In addition to seeking
employees with technical skills, employers are also looking for graduates who
have strong employability skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem
solving. To increase student enrollment in technology programs at Pierce College
and prepare students for successful technical careers, this project will develop
a program for students to integrate the skills and knowledge from their
coursework with practical applications in a professional setting. The project
will include activities that inform and inspire prospective students about
careers in manufacturing and architecture technology. By increasing the supply
of skilled technicians for the regional workforce, this project will address
industry needs and support the regional economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this project is to establish a recruitment, retention, and internship model
to increase enrollment in career and technical education programs. Recruitment
activities will include the development of a hands-on summer program and
outreach events for high school students in which current students serve as
ambassadors. Traditional technician education often neglects the employability
skills that are needed for career success. This project will assist students in
developing a broader range of career-readiness skills by actively engaging
students in experiential learning through service learning projects, developing
a new internship program established through partnerships with local employers,
and creating workshops that focus on employability skills. These student
learning strategies will be disseminated to the technical education community
through NSF and Advanced Technological Education Program (ATE) events, and
through ATE project centers and the projectâ€™s website. This project is designed
to improve recruitment, retention, and employment for technical students,
providing a pathway to successful technical careers. This project is funded by
the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of
technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
