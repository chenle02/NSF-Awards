The parameterization of air-sea interaction at high wind speeds continues as a
topic of great interest to air-sea exchange. Being able to predict air-sea gas
exchange of radiatively important gases such as carbon dioxide is needed to
project climate scenarios. A previous NSF award (AGS- 1036062; 1036006
Collaborative Research: Measuring Air-Sea Gas Exchange in High Winds for
Improvement of Physics-Based Air-Sea Transfer Parameterizations: HiWinGS) funded
a 4-year project to develop and improve gas exchange measurements. A HiWinGS
cruise to the Labrador Sea was successfully completed in Oct-Nov 2013, yielding
more than 700 hours of coordinated flux and wave physics observations, including
more than 100 hours at wind speeds of 15-27 m/s. This is a unique data set.

Specific goals of the analysis work undertaken here are to: 1) present an
analysis of the observed transfer coefficients for heat, momentum, the trace
gases DMS and CO2 with respect to wind speed, stress, bubble plume
characteristics and sea state; 2) further develop the refined physical
representations for gas transfer at high wind speeds in available bulk flux
algorithms; and 3) engage in a critical assessment of the various CO2 flux data
sets obtained from the HiWinGS cruise.
