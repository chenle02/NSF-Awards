ABSTRACT This proposal deals with manufacturing of coated optical fibers at
high draw speed (e.g. 20 m/s). The quality of the fiber depends on the diameter
and concentricity of the coating, coat layer continuity, smoothness, bubble
inclusion, and uniformity. These characteristics are in turn affected by heat
transfer and fluid flow that occur during the coating process. The Principal
Investigators (PIs) propose a theoretical and experimental program to study the
transport processes and determine the effects various operating parameters have
on the aforementioned characteristics. Numerical simulations that take into
account non-Newtonian effects and variable properties will be carried out.
Experiments will be conducted using different coating applicator geometries,
coating materials, draw speeds, and fiber materials. The experimental results
will be used in conjunction with the simulation results to establish the linkage
between the operating parameters and the quality of the fiber. Validation of the
numerical model will also be performed. The results from this study will be
useful for the design and optimization of coating dies and applications under
different conditions.
