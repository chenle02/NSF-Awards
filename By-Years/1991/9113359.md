Professor Baumgartner will work in combinatorial set theory, on questions
connected to the theory of forcing and generic sets. Areas of research include
problems in the partition calculus involving properties of omega-3 assuming CH,
focusing on properties provable in ZFC+CH together with the necessarily
attendant independence questions; related problems on partition ordinals,
polarized partition relations and partition relations for sets; problems on the
sizes of closed unbounded sets; and problems on "cardinal invariants" connected
both with measure and category theory and with the theory of quadratic spaces.
Set theory lies at the foundation of all mathematics. Important questions
concern the axioms that underly all number systems, algebra, geometry and
analysis, Are certain axioms necessary? Are they irrelevant in certain contexts?
Particularly significant in this regard is the Continuum Hypothesis (CH).
Understanding its role in mathematics has inspired some of the most profound
investigations of the 20th century.
