The Psychology Department has developed an interdepartmental neuroscience major.
Essential to this program is the recently renovated Laboratory of Quantitative
Neuromorphology, for which this project funds new equipment. Educationally, the
overall purpose of the laboratory is to transcend information in textbooks and
lectures by involving students with closely supervised, hands-on research
experience using state-of-the-art equipment to explore the human brain at the
gross and microanatomic level. Furthermore, a fundamental belief behind the
neuroscience program is that knowledge of the brain profoundly affects one's
perception and appreciation of personal, linguistic, psychological, and
sociopolitical phenomena. The long-term research goal is to develop a
quantitative dendritic and spine map of the human cerebral cortex to supplement
qualitative knowledge of the same. Four pieces of equipment are involved: (1) a
Neurolucida system, a state-of-the-art, comprehensive, interactive image
analysis program for three- dimensional morphometry of microscopic tissue
sections; (2) a multihead Olympus microscope, which is an efficient and
effective teaching tool that permits three individuals (i.e., the professor and
two students) to examine stained tissue simultaneously; (3) a Campden Vibroslice
vibratome for sectioning tissue; and (4) a PowerMac computer system for
classroom demonstrations, tutorials, interactive educational programs, and data
analysis/presentations by students doing individual research projects.
