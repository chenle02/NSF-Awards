Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds three conferences that will
stimulate new research in the interdisciplinary area of cliometrics, which
combines economics, statistics, history, demography, sociology, anthropology,
anatomy, and climatology as well as other disciplines to examine core questions
about economic theory and the development of modern economies. The conferences
bring together young scholars, including graduate students, with a group of
excellent senior scholars to engage in workshop sessions that give intensive
commentary on early research results. The goal is to improve research quality,
promote graduate training, and allow young scholars to build deeper research
networks. The result is better scientific knowledge about the evolution and
structural dynamics of the U.S. economy and the international economy. The
conferences advance science, promote the training of U.S. students in this area,
and shed valuable light on how government and business decisions can affect the
U.S. economic competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
