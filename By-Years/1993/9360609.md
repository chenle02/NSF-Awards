9360609 Chen Conventional structural evaluation methods often fail to provide
accurate defect measurement of large civil infrastructures. This project brings
in theoretical and experimental expertise in structural dynamics and experience
in vibration sensors to study innovative slope mode and modal energy transfer
sensors and measuring systems that could make structural behavior evaluation and
health monitoring more feasible and accurate. The ultimate goal is to develop a
series of slope accelerometers, which are not yet available commercially, based
on a newly developed complex energy theory. The objective in phase one is to
develop the accelerometers and calibration systems, to examine methods for modal
energy measurements to perform the vibration signature analysis for medium size
structures. The methodology and transducers considered in this project may have
a significant impact in structural measurements and applications in transducer
industries, bridge and large civil engineering structure inspections. This is an
SBIR Phase I project. ***
