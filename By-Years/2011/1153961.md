The College of Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus
Christi (TAMU-CC), a Hispanic-Serving Institution, with the support of area
community colleges who have high enrollments of minority and female students, is
providing scholarships to academically talented and financially needy community
college students transferring into computer science, engineering, and
mathematics majors at TAMU-CC, to allow them to complete a baccalaureate degree.
"Expanding the STEM Pool with Transfer Scholarships" (ESP) is recruiting twenty-
six college students from regional community colleges with large Hispanic
student populations as ESP Scholars. The five-year project is a recruitment tool
providing each ESP Scholar up to three years of funding, which may be augmented
by other scholarships and financial aid. The project is retaining scholars
through a learning-community cohort experience within an existing infrastructure
of student services (mentoring, academic advising, research opportunities,
career counseling, professional development) augmented by support services
tailored for transfer students, such as an orientation course designed to
alleviate transfer shock. At least twenty-six graduates with B.S. degrees in
computer science, engineering, and mathematics are being produced, many from
underrepresented groups, thereby increasing the diversity of the nation's
professional workforce in these critical fields. All students are being
encouraged to continue to graduate school by leveraging NSF LSAMP and other
undergraduate research programs. Some may pursue doctoral degrees and serve as
role models for future Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
students.
