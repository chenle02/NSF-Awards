A datacube is a multidimensional structure that contains at each point an
aggregate value, i.e., the result of applying an aggregate function to an
dataset of records. The purpose of this project is to develop, implement and
experimentally evaluate techniques to reduce the storage needs in a
multidimensional cube by substituting some of the data by more succinct models
that characterize it. By doing this, errors are introduced when the data is
reconstructed. The tradeoffs between space savings and reconstruction errors are
studied, along with tradeoffs between response time to queries and
reconstruction errors. Understanding these tradeoffs makes it possible to
efficiently design and implement multiresolution systems where query answers can
be incrementally refined as the user looks at them. Finally, the models are a
good starting point to mine the cube data since they show valuable patterns and
associations among the different dimensions. The results of this project will
provide valuable techniques and software to efficiently store and analyze large
multidimensional data sets, such as those that are common in health, financial
and scientific applications. http://www.isse.gmu.edu/~dbarbara/quasi.html
