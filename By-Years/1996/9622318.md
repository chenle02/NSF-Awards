ABSTRACT CATE 9622318 This Interagency Agreement supports activities of the
Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for which NSF has lead
agency role. These activities involve editing and preparation of the camera copy
of the Spring and Fall 1996 and 1997 issues of the Journal, Arctic Research of
the United State. The Journal serves an essential step in fulfilling the
requirements of Public Law 98-373, the Arctic Research and Policy Act. It
contains information on research activities of the Federal agencies involved in
the Arctic and reports and minutes of meetings from the Arctic Research
Commission and IARPC. This action provides support for preparation of the
Journal and documentation of the interagency programs.
