This award by the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, the
Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Department of Defense's (DOD)
"Awards to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research Experiences" (ASSURE)
Program support a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at
Vanderbilt University for the summers of 2012-2014. Ten students will be
selected for the REU program each year. Students will train in the
interdisciplinary, team science environment of chemical biology while
participating in scientific and professional development activities. Students
will be co-mentored by collaborating faculty in Chemistry and the College of
Medicine on one of 22 ongoing research projects. Students will broaden their
horizons though a variety of scientific and professional development experiences
(probe and drug development symposium, ethics (responsible conduct in research],
safety training, reading scientific papers, GRE preparation, and weekly
scientific seminars). Specially trained graduate student mentors will provide
scientific and professional guidance that is tailored to each student's needs.
The objective is to train a select group of 10 rising junior and senior
chemistry, biochemistry/biology majors with high potential for careers in
chemical and/or biomedical research. Applications will be actively solicited
from institutions that enhance the diversity of the REU program. Through
extensive mentoring and authentic research experiences, this program will impact
the student's understanding of the research process and the interdisciplinary
nature of contemporary research.
