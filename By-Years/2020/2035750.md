The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improves patient outcomes in radiotherapy
treatment. Healthcare providers are recognizing the growing imperative to lower
costs and maintain quality of care by harnessing the digital health records
available. In radiation oncology, only a small fraction of the valuable data
produced during routine patient care is leveraged for the care of new patients.
High-dose curative treatments frequently lead to side effects, such as dry mouth
in head and neck cancer treatment, and rectal bleeding in prostate treatments.
An optimized treatment plan could minimize complications. The proposed project
will advance an information system to optimize and personalize radiation
treatments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project leverages radiotherapy
data to optimize treatment plans. Dose to organs at risk (OARs) must be kept low
while ensuring the prescribed dosimetric coverage of the targeted disease.
Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatments require significant
optimization, creating extensive planning processes. This project will advance a
treatment plan database for a data-driven clinical decision support solution
that can predict achievable dose levels to each OAR. These levels can be used as
intelligent optimization objectives by the treatment planning system (TPS) and
as plan evaluation criteria. The system will be built for continuous refinement
through ongoing augmentation with new patient plans, thus improving prediction
performance with ongoing use, and allowing each clinical site to base
predictions on its own data. In addition, integrated peer review tools enable
physicians to efficiently share information and get additional clinical
insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
