Cyberinfrastructure is an essential component of virtually all scientific
research conducted today. As scientific projects have grown larger and more
collaborative, the need to share data and algorithms has expanded, together with
new mandates for open science and public sharing of datasets. The Cybersecurity
Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure (CICI) program at NSF consists of a
portfoloio of projects aimed at improving the security and privacy of
cyberinfrastructure. As CICI has grown in scope and importance, there is a need
to convene researchers in the program in a setting dedicated to CICI concerns.
ASU will lead organize and host a two-day Principal Investigators meeting for
CICI awardees, to be held on the ASU campus in early 2024.

By convening the CICI community, the meeting will foster increased intellectual
interchange across the program, encourage collaboration and cross-fertilization
among projects, strengthen connections to the scientific community, and identify
important emerging trends and research questions. CICI research projects enhance
the security and privacy of cyberinfrastructure, which benefits individual
scientific projects, promotes a resilient scientific ecosystem, and protects
U.S. interests abroad. In particular, the meeting will identify synergies among
projects and gaps in the current project portfolio.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
