9417949 Dixon This award provides partial (one-third) funding for the
acquisition of a Fourier transform infrared microscope system to be installed
and operated in the Department of Marine Geology &amp; Geophysics at the
University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences. The
main application of the instrument will be to determine H2O and CO2 contents in
glass inclusions in crystals and glasses from igneous rock samples collected at
mid-ocean ridges, oceanic islands, and volcanoes. The data acquired with the
instrument will be used to address scientific problems related to the role of
volatiles in volcanic eruption mechanisms. ***
