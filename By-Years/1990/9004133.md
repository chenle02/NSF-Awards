A recently published isotopic study of the precaldera rhyolites of Glass
Mountain, Long Valley, has shown that the timing of differentiation of rhyolitic
magma can be determined from Rb-Sr dating and resolved from the age of eruption
(as determined by K- Ar ages). Furthermore, the differences are difficult to
explain unless the rhyolitic magmas persisted in the upper reaches of the
chamber in stable, stratified zones for long periods, of the order of 105 to 106
years, with negligible mass transfer between the different layers. Such
protracted residence periods are considerably in excess of the estimates implied
by recently published thermal modelling of the longevity of high-level silicic
magma chambers. This project is to extend this research to a comprehensive study
of the mineral-glass Rb-Sr systematics and 40Ar-39Ar ages of the Glass mountain
rhyolites and to develop similar research on other young silicic systems. The
additional volcanic centers which have been selected are Coso (California),
Mineral Mountains, Twin Peaks and Honeycomb Hills (Utah), La Primavera (Mexican
Volcanic Belt) and Naivasha (Kenya). These particular volcanic centers were
chosen because they contain pristine rhyolitic glasses ranging in composition
from metaluminous to highly peralkaline with high Rb/Sr ratios, and have already
been well characterized in terms of field relations, age, chemistry and
petrography.
