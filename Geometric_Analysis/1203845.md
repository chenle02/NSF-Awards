This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
the "International Conference on Several Complex Variables and Complex Geometry"
that will be held from July 2-13, 2012, in the Institute of Mathematics of the
Academia Sinica in Taiwan.

This workshop will highlight recent developments and new research directions in
a number of areas that fall under the general heading "several complex variables
and complex geometry" (e.g., heat kernels for sub-Laplacians on unit spheres in
complex n-space and the Poisson summation formula; equivalence problems for
complex manifolds; holomorphic deformation of compact complex manifolds; the
Fujita conjecture and related topics; smooth and analytic hypoellipticity for
partial differential operators). The program features a slate of mini-courses
for graduate student during the week leading up to the main workshop. The
conference program also provides ample opportunity for graduate students,
postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
