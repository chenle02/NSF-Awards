This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a rapid and reliable point-of-care system for detection of
cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction biomarkers. The biochip
proposed in this work could significantly reduce the detection time while
simultaneously detecting multiple cardiac markers.

The commercial application of this project will be in the healthcare equipment
market aimed at emergency monitoring and care.
