Theoretical Morphology and Spatial Analysis of Trace
Fossils&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roy E. Plotnick&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at

0207194&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trace fossils
represent the preserved interactions of trace making organisms with their
environment. The exact forms of traces result from complex interactions among
the organism's morphology, the behavior being carried out, the organism's
perception of the environment, and the heterogeneity of the environment. The
study of trace fossils thus allows us to study the evolution of animal movement
in 'deep time'. Existing mathematical models for the biological formation of
traces have tended to focus on a limited repertoire of behaviors, such as
grazing. They do not include realistic patterns of environmental heterogeneity,
differences in perception, or multiple behavioral responses. In addition, there
have been almost no attempts to model three-dimensional traces, or traces that
branch or anastomose. New models for grazing and crawling traces will be built
based on current research by ecologists into animal perception and movement
patterns and their relationship to environmental heterogeneity. These models
will explore the interactions of alternative spatial patterns of environmental
heterogeneity with different perceptions and behavioral responses to it. They
will also incorporate recent concepts in the study of artificial life. The new
models could suggest how behavioral patterns for a given trace-making organism
might change as a function of environmental differences, such as resource
distribution. This could be a useful tool for determining such patterns of
spatial heterogeneity in ancient environments.&lt;br/&gt;
