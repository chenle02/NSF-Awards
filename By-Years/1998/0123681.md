Over the past thirty years Spelman College has made great strides in its efforts
to increase the&lt;br/&gt;number of women and the number of African American
students who complete bachelor's degrees&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics and who enter
into and persist in graduate programs in the sciences, mathematics
and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. Those efforts have resulted in a greater
understanding of the academic training and early&lt;br/&gt;professional
development needs, and the support mechanisms required to attract these students
into&lt;br/&gt;the higher levels of academic excellence and academic leadership.
It has also resulted in a cadre of&lt;br/&gt;women faculty who hold leadership
positions throughout the SEM areas in their own disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;The
current ADVANCE project intends to capitalize on past success by pursuing the
following&lt;br/&gt;goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. Use scholarly writings to
disseminate information regarding support structures&lt;br/&gt;aimed at
increasing retention among women in graduate mathematics programs;
and&lt;br/&gt;information on support mechanisms to advance the careers of women
in the scientific&lt;br/&gt;community.&lt;br/&gt;b. Facilitate the transition of
the PI back to a full-time research and teaching position&lt;br/&gt;following a
period of long-term leadership in efforts to expand the pipeline
of&lt;br/&gt;academic leaders in SEM areas.&lt;br/&gt;c. Increase the capacity
of women to assume academic positions in higher education&lt;br/&gt;as
mathematicians and to advance to leadership roles in the science, engineering
and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics academic community, with a particular emphasis on
minority women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF
ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers.&lt;br/&gt;
