This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating
in the 33rd Summer Symposium in Real Analysis to be held June 23-27, 2009 at
Southeastern Oklahoma State University. This conference has been held annually
since 1978, twice in 1982, and is considered to be a major meeting of its type
for the real analysis community. Support will be provided to participants who do
not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for some senior researchers.

The program will feature three invited speakers and a number of contributed
talks. The principal objective of this meeting is to introduce young
mathematicians to the field, as well as to provide a forum for presentation of
the current state of the art of the theory. The organizers intend to actively
involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from
other under-represented groups, to which much of the funding will be directed.
Graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.
