The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists
universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly
increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority
populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska
Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete
high quality degree programs in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florida A&amp;M
University (FAMU), lead institution for the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes
Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) and historically black university
(HBCU), consists of 14 two and four-year institutions in the region. The
alliance consists of three Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), two emerging
HSIs, and four HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the next five years, the
project, Developing Researchers through Innovative and Virtual Experiences
(DRIVE), will continue to increase STEM undergraduate enrollment and degree
production in addition to STEM broadening participation research and evaluation
activities. The project will investigate non-cognitive attributes that
contribute to persistence and degree completion status for populations
historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-
funding of this project is being provided by the Improving Undergraduate STEM
Education (IUSE) program in the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE)
since important aspects of the project align with the overall goals of
IUSE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
