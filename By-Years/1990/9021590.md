Virginia Commonwealth University, acting as the lead institution, has joined
with Norfolk State University, University of Virginia, Virginia Union
University, and J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, to develop a
comprehensive plan which will significantly increase the number and quality of
minority, particularly black, scientists and engineers. Building on extensive
existing program aimed at increasing the number of blacks entering higher
education, the Virginia Alliance considerably enhances these efforts, focuses on
recruiting blacks into science and engineering careers, ensures continuity by
tracking students beyond the short terms of current projects, and provides a
structure that will greatly improve the flow of students among the respective
institutions. The Virginia Alliance will marshal all available resources and
provide a comprehensive plan so that each black student with potential and
interest in science will complete his or her science education and enter the
workforce. We will concentrate on undergraduates with the following programs:
Undergraduate Research Participation; Student Study Groups; Students Summer
Workshops; Curriculum Revision; and Faculty Workshops. Industry and government
laboratory representatives will participates with faculty in a number of these
activities. Additionally, the program will help students through the important
transition points from high school to graduate school by extensive mentoring at
all phases.
