This award to the American Physical Society supports the continued growth and
improvement of the Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP), held
annually since 2006. The conferences have two overarching goals: 1) to give
undergraduate women the resources, motivation, and confidence to increase their
retention in physics and related disciplines; and 2) to increase awareness by
undergraduate women in physics of the wide range of career opportunities
available to them. Regional conferences are held simultaneously to maximize
student attendance by minimizing travel, to increase the excitement of the
participants in a joint national venture, and to allow the interactive simulcast
of a keynote address. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to evaluate
networking effectiveness, self-efficacy beliefs, physics identity, and outcome
expectations of the participants. Through this research and the project
evaluation, there is potential to gain new knowledge about issues facing
undergraduate women in physics, as well as measures of the impact that
conference activities such as these have on their attendees. The project will
advance our understanding of factors that alter the trajectories of female
students -- a population that remains underrepresented in physics -- as they
pursue undergraduate degrees in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
supported jointly by two divisions of NSF's Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate: the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research.
