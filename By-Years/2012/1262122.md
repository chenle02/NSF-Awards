Structural similarity search and retrieval in images that include both printed
text and handwritten text remains a challenging problem, especially with
collections that are noisy, and heterogeneous. Approaches currently in use
generally convert documents before filtering. This work provides triage as a way
to filter very large collections through structural similarity with known
attributes, then new clustering with broader terms and hashing to extend the
scale of collections considered. The work will provide new directions for
document image retrieval, especially in conditions where there is a wide
variation in structure and layout and will be made scalable in cloud
environments. Another approach to scaling, especially in the area of duplicate
detection, will extend multi-level locality sensitive hashing and generalize it
to other analysis indexing and retrieval issues. In addition to including
graduate students, results and software will be made available through Creative
Commons licensing to provide for replication and extension of the results.
