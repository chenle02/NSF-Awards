The first U.S. 5-story full-scale research building which was tested at UCSD
under simulated seismic loads to 1-1/2 to two times the seismic design and
deformation levels, provides in its damaged state a unique opportunity to
develop and experimentally validate new repair technologies. The proposed repair
measures consist of epoxy injection, advanced composite wall and floor overlays
as well as ceramic foam applications in the hollow core plank floors, with
particular emphasis on materials and technologies originally developed and
applied in the defense industry to show their potential for application in the
civil sector. It is proposed to use loading sequences in the retest which
correspond closely to the original seismic load test, in order to get a direct
experimental seismic behavior comparison for the verification of the
effectiveness of the proposed repair measures. The test results will provide
important information about the repairability of damaged reinforced masonry
structures and about the expected behavior of repaired structures under future
seismic loads.
