A series of design challenges will be developed to motivate high school
students of all abilities to study science in the context of practical problem-
solving. Students will research, design, construct and evaluate to practical
problems that intrigue them. The challenges will draw on information from across
the range of traditional science topics. Solutions will arise from group
discussion and information analysis. These materials are to augment and
consolidate science learning and, mode importantly, generate process and
practical skills, transferable to other circumstances, in team work, information
gathering and processing, evaluation, and application of knowledge to practical
situations. Sample assessment strategies for working with groups of students of
diverse abilities will be developed. To help teachers and students obtain
manageable ideas, a "Source Book" will be produced. In addition, a teacher
Resource Guide, suggesting sources of materials, giving technical advice and
linking the challenges to science topics, will be provided.
