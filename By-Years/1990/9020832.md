The question of the limits of predictability of the atmosphere is one of the
more fundamental questions facing meteorologists. Most of the research performed
in this area has emphasized predictability characteristics of large-scale
atmospheric flows. Based on these earlier studies, pessimistic conclusions were
drawn for the forecasting of localized weather events (e.g. heavy rainfall),
termed mesoscale events by meteorologists. More recent work, however, has
provided evidence that forecasting of mesoscale weather may not be as limited as
originally suggested; however, not much research has been done in this area.
Using a numerical model, the Principal Investigator will perform a number of
experiments designed to address the question of predictability of mesoscale
precipitation. Some of the tasks to be undertaken are to determine the variation
of range of predictability of mesoscale precipitation with respect to temporal
and spatial averaging; and to use the concepts of chaos theory and strange
attractors to characterize the precipitation process.
