The Department of Statistics at the University of California at Berkeley will
purchase 18 SUN Ultrasparc workstations which will be dedicated to the support
of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for many
research projects, including: Genetics (Terry Speed) testing for genetic locus
heterogeneity, investigating the power effects of interference, estimating
recombination fractions, modeling crossover interference, identification of
quantitative trait loci, location of disease genes, and estimation of
phylogenetic relationships between species. Wavelets (David Donoho) research
includes basis pursuit, time frequency signal analysis, and digital
communications processing, Biological and Environmental Problems (John Rice)
analysis of ion channel recordings, analysis of oceanographic measurements, and
modeling hormonal profiles ( David Brillinger) analyzing nerve cell spike
trains, trajectories of mammalian dives, motion of meteorological fields, and
seismic risk analysis. Astrophysics(Philip Stark) modeling the structure of the
sun, algorithms for the analysis of satellite data. Methodology (Leo Breiman)
study of the structure of neural nets, prediction of multiple time series,
stabilizing nonparametric high dimensional predictors in regression and
classification, using categorical variables in nearest neighbor classification,
and parallelizing CART over a workstation network. Stochastic Processes (David
Aldous) Monte Carlo experiments in spatial stochastic processes. (Ching-Shui
Cheng) nonregular experimental designs
