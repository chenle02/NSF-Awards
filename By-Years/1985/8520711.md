An advanced laser fluorescence apparatus is developed to determine the surface
or translational diffusion coefficients of fluorescent-labeled probes in
monomolecular films at air/water and oil/water interfaces. This improved
apparatus is based on a simple Moire technique for measuring surface diffusion
using fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR) where the film is bleached in a
periodic pattern. This new experimental technique also permits an extended study
of surface diffusion to interfacial systems previously inaccessible to study by
the radiotracer method. In addition, it is possible to separate between flow and
diffusional transport processes occurring in monomolecular films. This apparatus
is being used to continue previous work on surface diffusion in monomolecular
films, in particular, to determine reliable values of the surface diffusion
coefficient and its surface concentration and temperature dependence within
various monolayer states in order to elucidate the nature of two-dimensional
mass transfer at fluid interfaces. The laser fluorescence apparatus also is used
in other research projects.
