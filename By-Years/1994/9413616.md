proposal# 9413616 PI - Langmuir Current shipboard measurement of ocean CO2 is
extremely expensive and too limited in scope for accurate modelling of Ocean CO2
uptake/release. This STTR project will focus on building an instrument/sensor
system for remote long-term measurement of total dissolved inorganic carbon.
These instruments my be deployed at stationary buoys or ocean platforms for
long-term data acquisition of ocean pH and dissolved CO2. These sensors will be
less expensive and less subject to drift than current proposed fiber optic
devices and currently available electrode sensors.
