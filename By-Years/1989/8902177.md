The principal investigator will investigate two areas of research in time
series analysis: multivariate time series and nonlinear time series. Within the
multivariate time series setting, the researcher will investigate the
statistical inference in using the newly develope scalar component model
approach to model building. This model building approach makes it easy to
specify the underlying structure of a vector linear system. Within the framework
of nonlinear time series, the investigator will investigate issues of model
building. A time series is a collection of observations, ordered by time and
correlated in time. The modeling of a time series represents an effort to
understand the random process which is assumed to underlie the observations, as
well as to predict or control future observations. Time series analysis impacts
fields from economics to geosciences, from the environment to chemical
processes.
