This project comprises the analysis and assimilation of data from the Doppler
radars that will be deployed during the TOGA/COARE Intensive Observing Period
(IOP). The analysis will emphasize the calculation of momentum and heat fluxes
in the marine boundary layer. The assimilation will emphasize the use of data
from all available Doppler radars in combination with newly developed Doppler
radar assimilation techniques to construct the morphology and fluxes by
convective complexes in the TOGA/COARE Intensive Flux Area (IFA). The crux of
the method is the recovery for the full three-dimensional wind and temperature
fields from a judicious blending of Doppler radar data and a dynamical model.
This research is important because it serves as one of the studies of TOGA COARE
that links convective scale physical processes to the larger scales that impact
climate variability in an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the
western Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
