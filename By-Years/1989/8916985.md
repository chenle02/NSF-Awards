This award provides travel funds to the Principal Investigator and her student
to observe with the 100 meter radio telescope in Bonn, West Germany. The
Principal Investigator was a regular user of the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory 300 foot telescope before its collapse. This award will allow some
of the research in progress to be continued.
