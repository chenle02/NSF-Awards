Working with Dr. Peter Galison, Dr. Stump is undertaking a postdoctoral
fellowship to study and conduct research at Stanford University. His research is
centering on methodological issues surrounding new approaches to the philosophy
of science which have arisen since the overthrow of logical positivism in the
1960's and 70's. Philosophers of science are now paying close attention to the
history of science and to current scientific practice. The use of evidence from
case studies can now be taken for granted as central to studies of scientific
methodology. There are, however, competing views on what to do with historical
evidence even among philosophers of science who agree that such evidence is
important and who reject the incommensurability thesis (i.e. that advocates of a
"revolutionary" scientific paradigm cannot meaningfully speak to advocates of
the old paradigm because the theoretical terms they use have radically
different, "incommensurable" meanings) associated with some anti-positivists.
Dr. Stump is examining three methodological positions: Thomas Nickles view,
"local historicism," Larry Laudan's reworking of epistemology, "normative
naturalism," and Ronald Giere's "cognitive science of science." Dr. Stump first
is clearly formulating these positions, paying special attention to the issue of
defining what is meant by "local" or context specific methodological rules. The
second issue he is exploring is how to test general and prescriptive rules from
the historical record and current scientific practice. The deep issue to be
tested is whether any substantial methodological rules are legitimately
universal or if all must remain context specific as the local historicists
claim. He is attempting to settle this question using case studies from the
history of science and current scientific practice.
