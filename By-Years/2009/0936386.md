As the computing needs of business and consumers continue to grow, mega data
centers with tens of thousands of machines are being built the size of shopping
malls that consume tens of megawatts of power. These data centers support
e-commerce, financial services, health care, telecommunications, and a variety
of other services critical to the society. Power and thermal management of
servers in these data centers and the clients using them has become a critical
issue from many perspectives including utility costs, environmental impact,
space usage, etc. Although there is a substantial amount of ongoing research
into these issues in both academia and industry, many of the approaches tend to
be ad hoc and empirical in nature. The purpose of the workshop is to examine
power and thermal issues at a much more fundamental level and thereby bring a
scientific approach to designing, configuring and managing hardware and software
in a way that comprehends not only the power/thermal issues but also the
associated performance and reliability tradeoffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the workshop is expected to be in
terms of guiding future research in this area that is important from
technological, economic and sustainability perspective&lt;br/&gt;
