This proposal is based on an inter-disciplinary collaboration, in the form of a
senior design project, between the Textile Engineering Department and the
Materials Engineering Department. During the course of the project teams of
students will choose a specific product that can be manufactured using textile
composites (e.g. golf club, baseball bat, handicapped walker). This will be
followed by literature review of related topics, material selection, constituent
materials property prediction, engineering design, manufacturing and testing of
the textile composites product. Industrial partners, manufacturing textile
composites (e.g. Tech. Textiles USA), will be invited to provide expertise and
supplies for this project.
