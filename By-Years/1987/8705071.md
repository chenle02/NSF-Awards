A hypercube multiprocessor will be used for research in parallel algorithms and
architectures in the areas of robotics, image processing, logic simulation, and
fault tolerance. These are significant research areas in which the research
group is likely to make significant progress with this equipment. Accordingly,
an award is recommended.
