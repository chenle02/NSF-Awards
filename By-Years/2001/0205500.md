AST 0205500&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Stein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been
significant progress in recent years in our understanding of the physics of the
Sun. In particular the structure of the sun is being revealed from detailed
observations of the solar surface layers and their motions. In a sense the Sun
is a giant echo chamber and careful analysis of all the solar resonant modes and
wave propagation properties tells us what the interior is like. In this research
realistic numerical simulations of the interaction between convection in the
outer solar layers, magnetic fields, and the acoustic oscillations will be
carried out to aid our understanding of the solar interior. The project will
extend our knowledge by studying small scale magnetic fields produced 'locally'
and their role in the formation of supergranulation at the solar surface. The
results will be applied to present solar observations and will provide guidance
to the design of the next generation of high spatial and temporal resolution
solar telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;
