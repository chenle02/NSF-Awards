An ultracentrifuge will be acquired to allow new laboratory experiences for
undergraduates in molecular biology using isolated DNA, viral and plasmid
vectors, and isolated organelles. The hands-on experience in molecular biology
will be integrated into introductory and advanced courses in the biology program
and will enhance laboratory experiences in new interdisciplinary courses.
Students will benefit from the introduction of this technology into numerous
courses and student research programs that develop critical thinking skills. The
major use of this instrument will be to introduce students to the
ultracentrifuge as a tool for the isolation of macromolecules or organelles. The
students will become familiar with the exploitation of the physical
characteristics of macromolecules that are used to isolate those molecules.
Students will also acquire the skills to manipulate macromolecules genetically.
By combining chemical and genetic techniques students will appreciate the
usefulness of multiple approaches to the dissection of biological processes.
