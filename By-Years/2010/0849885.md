This award supports the REU site at the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator Based
ScienceS and Education (CLASSE). This site will involve ten students per year in
summer research projects at the Laboratory. Supported by the NSF, the Laboratory
has a constellation of programs including accelerator physics, synchrotron
radiation research, and microwave superconductivity. Although the research of
this REU is focused on understanding the fundamental physics of beams and
accelerators and the uses of the radiation they produce, the techniques and
technologies utilized are applicable to a much wider range of scientific
careers. The student participants will have full access to the resources of the
Laboratory and University. They will work on a range of projects that advance
the Laboratory's scientific mission, as well as giving the students the
opportunity to experience the excitement and challenge of frontier research,
acquire new skills, and meet researchers at all career stages.
