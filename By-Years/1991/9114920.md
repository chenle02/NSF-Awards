This Science in Developing Countries award supports collaboration between James
Gill of the University of California at Santa Cruz and Eduardo Malavassi of the
Universidad Nacional in Costa Rica. The project aims to test the investigators'
hypothesis that a recently discovered geodynamic discontinuity in central Costa
Rica has a fundamental influence on the chemical composition of magmas there.
Circum-Pacific magmatism causes most of the earth's volcanic hazards and is the
chief mechanism for maintaining and reprocessing the earth's crust. The magma's
origins are poorly understood. The Nicaragua-Costa Rica sector of the Central
American volcanic arc constitutes an important natural laboratory for studying
the nature of and reasons for spatial and temporal variations in the composition
of young volcanic rocks. This project will lead to insights into the magma-
forming process at arcs, a vital topic in volcanology. The researchers will
collect and prepare recent volcanic rocks in Costa Rica and perform labwork in
the United States. The Costa Rican research has expertise in the collection,
selection, and preparation of samples specific to Costa Rica. The U.S.
researcher, a world expert in arc volcanoes, will provide SRF and mass
spectrometry isotope analysis, capabilities which Costa Rica lacks.
