Different regions of the cerebral cortex are functionally specialized to perform
particular sensory or motor functions. Within the visual cortex of humans, and
other animals, areas have been identified that are further specialized for
spatial, motion, and pattern processing. The behavioral correlate for such
functional specializations, or a "division of labor", within auditory cortex is
largely unknown. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to elucidate the
behavioral "division of labor" within auditory cortex and determine the relative
contributions that the different auditory fields make to acoustic behaviors.
This project will examine twelve commonly recognized regions of acoustically-
responsive cortex: four tonotopically organized fields and eight non-tonotopic
areas. Two general classes of tasks will be used to determine if areas
specialized for "spatial and motion" or "pattern and temporal" processing can be
identified. To make these determinations, cooling loops, which induce localized
hypothermia, will be placed in contact with specific regions of the cerebral
cortex to effect temporary and reversible deactivation. The final project will
examine the structural and functional characteristics of cortical projections to
the superior colliculus. The superior colliculus is a midbrain structure that is
critical for the accurate directing of head and eyes to visual and acoustic
stimuli. Therefore, it is hypothesized that cerebral regions involved in spatial
localization of acoustic stimuli will have dense projections to the superior
colliculus. These behavioral results, when combined with investigations of
underlying cerebral connections, will provide evidence for, or refute, which
hierarchical or network theories best explain processing in auditory cortex.
Over the course of these projects, many graduate students, as well as
approximately 50 undergraduate students will be exposed to behavioral testing
and histological procedures. Most trainees involved in these projects will be
female or from groups typically underrepresented in science. Each semester,
students in the lab visit local high schools to discuss their work and make
presentations on brain structure and function to psychology classes.
