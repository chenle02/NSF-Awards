The proposal envisions measures to be taken in order to increase the number and
quality of U.S. mathematics graduate students who specialize in the areas of
Analysis and Geometry. Our immediate goal is to make Princeton a flagship
department in training graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates, who
will be prepared to do high level research on problems which require a large
degree of interaction between various areas of Geometry and Analysis with
relevance to Mathematical Physics and other applications. A more important long-
term goal is to ensure that U.S. research in the areas mentioned above, and
other related areas of science and engineering, remains second to none.
