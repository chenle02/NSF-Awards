This award provides funding in support of the 2023 Groundwork for Operator
Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS), to be hosted at Purdue University, June 5-17,
2023. The conference offers early-career graduate students an introduction to
the basic principles and fundamental techniques of operator algebras, as well as
a glimpse into current research topics. A further aim of GOALS is to increase
the participation of mathematicians from traditionally underrepresented groups
in the field by removing technical barriers and building a strong community of
support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operator algebras is a branch of functional
analysis which has a long-standing dialogue with various fields of mathematics
and physics, including topology, group theory, conformal field theory,
probability, and logic. Although it is a highly active area of research, the
depth and breadth of technical knowledge required to begin working in operator
algebras can present an obstacle to graduate students wishing to enter the
field. The primary aim of GOALS is to help provide early-career graduate
students with this much-needed background and introduce them to a variety of
more advanced topics of current interest. Activities will include lecture series
on the basics of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, problem sessions, evening
discussions on psychological barriers, expository talks about more advanced
topics, and a culminating conference with leading researchers in operator
algebras. The community created at GOALS 2023 will be sustained by providing
financial support for the participants to reunite at major annual operator
algebras conferences such as the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium in May
2024. More details about GOALS are available at https://users.math.msu.edu/users

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
