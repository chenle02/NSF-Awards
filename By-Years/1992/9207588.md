Climate changes projected for ext century will impact ecosystems, yet the
knowledge to foresee the direction and magnitude of these impacts is lacking.
This study will improve our ability to predict these impacts by field
manipulations, using overhead radiators to increase the downward heat flux on
large plots within a subalpine meadow at the Rocky Mountain Biological
Laboratory, CO. The heat flux will be set to match approximately the surface
warming predicted in worst-case climate scenarios for the year 2050. Effects of
this warming on soil moisture and temperature, soil nutrient pools and
transformations, greenhouse gas fluxes, and plant production, species
distribution, and phenology will be measured. Microclimate and nutrient cycle
models, each to be calibrated with data from the control plots and validated
with data from the warmed plots, will extend our knowledge of feedback
mechanisms linking vegetation, greenhouse gas fluxes, soil nutrients, and soil
microclimate, and will provide a basis for generalizing our findings to other
sites. The research will also identify climate-sensitive ecological parameters
that could be targets for geographically widespread monitoring of ecological
symptoms of global warming.
