AST 0206262&lt;br/&gt;Evans, Aaron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost all nearby
massive galaxies are believed to have quiescent supermassive nuclear black
holes. These dense, dark objects are remnants of prior, energetic events which
undoubtedly gave rise to periods of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity
similar to what is observed in nearby radio galaxies and quasi-stellar objects
(QSOs). Further, recently measured correlations between the black hole mass and
the stellar bulge mass in nearby galaxies indicates that circumnuclear star
formation must accompany black hole mass accretion. This research will make use
of optical, near-infrared, (sub)millimeter, and radio technology to study the
star formation and AGN activity in a sample of infrared (IR) luminous radio
galaxies with redshifts 0.02- 0.2. These galaxies are a subset of the infrared
luminous galaxy class, most of which are observed to be closely
interacting/merging galaxies with clear evidence of both star formation and AGN
activity; both phenomena are likely fueled by molecular gas. Single-dish and
interferometric millimeter observations of carbon monoxide (CO), near-infrared
imaging of recombination lines and H2, and VLA observations of the radio jets
will be carried out. This program will elucidate the star formation rate, the
amount of hot versus cold gas in the host galaxies, and the relation of jet
emission to the stellar and molecular gas distributions. Studying these
transitional objects offers one of the best opportunities to explore the
connections between starbursts and active galactic nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
