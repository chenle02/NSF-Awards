This project extends previous studies in complex function theory and its
generalizations to quasiconformal mappings, quasiregular mappings and
Teichmuller theory. All are tied by a geometric point of view regarding smooth
transformations with restricted distortion. The main themes of this particular
activity involve newly developed methods of conformal welding. One of the
primary goals will be to study the uniqueness of conformally welded domains with
complements of zero area. Preliminary results have also been obtained in the
theory of iteration. The object of this investigation is to determine the types
of Julia sets one can expect to get through welding by inner functions. Work
will also be done on the question of whether one can gain insight into the
Hilbert transform on finitely connected domains by maximizing the Fredholm
determinant of the transform to obtain an equivalent domain all of whose
boundary components are discs. Complex function theory encompasses the study of
differentiable functions of a complex variable and related classes of functions
such as harmonic functions and quasiconformal mappings. The subject is highly
geometric; many of the problems concern the properties of various sets under
transform by functions from one of the above classes. Applications of the theory
to potential theory and fluid dynamics is now standard in engineering circles.
