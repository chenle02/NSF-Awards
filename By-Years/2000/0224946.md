ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-9906634&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There
is mounting ecological evidence that the oceanic ecosystem of the central North
Pacific Ocean my be undergoing a shift from a system in which nitrogen limits
primary production to one limited by the availability of phosphorous. Before we
can evaluate this possibility and its oceanographic and ecological significance,
we must first understand the biogeochemical mechanisms working in the cycling of
phosphorous in the oceanic water column. To that end, the principal investigator
on this project will conduct a study of phosphorous cycling and particulate
organic carbon (POC) export in the North Pacific gyre using the naturally-
occurring, short-lived radionuclides Phosphorous-32, Phosphorous-33,
Thorium-234, and Beryllium-7. The P isotope measurements would permit the
estimation of P residence times in the dissolved and particulate pools. The work
would be carried out in conjunction with an already established monthly
U.S.JGOFS-HOT (Hawaiian Ocean Time Series) cruise program.&lt;br/&gt;
