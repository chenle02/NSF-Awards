The Lafayette Natural History Museum of Lafayette, the Louisiana Nature and
Science Center of New Orleans and the Louisiana University Marine Consortium of
Cocodrie jointly are preparing an exhibit with associated educational programs
that focus on coastal Louisiana as part of the Gulf of Mexico as an ecosystem.
The purpose of the program is to enhance scientific and environmental
understanding of young people and adults about basic scientific and
environmental principles and about related economic issues affecting coastal
Louisiana. The travelling portions of the exhibit will rotate among the three
institutions, and parts of the exhibit subsequently also will go to a number of
community organizations. The educational component will include programs for
students, teachers and the general public.
