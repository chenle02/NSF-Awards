Abstract: Sawyer will continue to research areas of partial differential
equations with strong ties to harmonic analysis: e.g., oscillatory integrals and
maximal operators over surfaces, regularity estimates for degenerate boundary
value problems, and Holder regularity for degenerate elliptic equations and the
Monge-Ampere equation. The spherical maximal function arises in the solution to
the 3-dimensional wave equation, and its variants play a role in understanding
more general hyperbolic equations. The PI will continue to investigate L^p
inequalities for maximal operators over convex surfaces, especially in the range
p < 2, with attention to the related problems of multiparameter variants and
L^p-improving convolution operators. He will build on the recent success in
understanding regularity for the oblique derivative problem by applying the
techniques used there to even more degenerate boundary value problems, both
linear and nonlinear. Harnack's inequality and Holder regularity extend to a
large class of equations with rough coefficients in the presence of ellipticity,
the permitted roughness being essential in applications to nonlinear problems.
Sawyer will attempt to obtain sharp estimates in terms of the eigenvalues of the
degenerate operator when ellipticity is relaxed, in order that Holder regularity
of solutions follows. Applications to the Monge-Ampere equation will also be
considered.

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model physical processes,
often in an "idealized" way, but this very simplification usually leads to a
better understanding of the role played by the various complex factors involved.
Harmonic analysis is, roughly speaking, the breakdown of data into simple
components which are easily analyzed under the processes being investigated.
Analyzing existence, uniqueness, regularity and growth of solutions to PDEs
through harmonic analysis has led to increased understanding of wave processes
such as optics and electromagnetism, and more theoretical topics related to
quantum mechanics. The study of averages related to PDEs has application to
tomography as well as to theoretical aspects of solutions.
