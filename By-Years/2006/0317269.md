EIA- 0317269&lt;br/&gt; Hsinchun Chen&lt;br/&gt;University of
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: NSF Workshop: Symposium on Intelligence and
Security Informatics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF Workshop: Symposium on
Intelligence and Security Informatics aims to provide an intellectual forum of
discussions among previously disparate communities: academic researchers (in
information technology, computer science, public policy, and social studies),
local, state, and federal law enforcement and intelligence experts, and
information technology industry consultants and practitioners. The workshop will
bring together noted informatics, computer science, and policy researchers and
progressive leaders in law enforcement and security communities to engage in
productive dialogues and explore avenues of collaboration. The workshop will
help identify promising computer science and informatics techniques and
methodologies for national security applications, and help develop close and
productive partnerships between researchers and local and federal law
enforcement practitioners. The Symposium on Intelligence and Security
Informatics will solicit high-quality research papers of relevance to
intelligence and security research, which will be peer reviewed by both
researchers and practitioners. &lt;br/&gt;
