A major issue in rehabilitation robotics is the fact that motor improvements
following training with a robotic device are not observed in daily life, that
is, when patients are not using the training device. This limited efficacy of
robotic training is possibly due to unnatural human-machine interactions
experienced when patients use the device. This Faculty Early Career Development
(CAREER) Program project investigates robot-assisted motor learning in people
with and without brain lesions. The aim is to improve effective gait
rehabilitation after stroke by determining how to maximize generalization of
learning from trained to untrained conditions. The PI will also use the research
objectives in this project as a means to increase the participation of students
from underrepresented minorities (URM) in science and engineering. Specifically,
the PI will recruit, mentor, and prepare URM students from K-12 and college to
pursue advanced education, with the ultimate goal of broadening the professional
opportunities for URM students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Split-belt walking, during
which the legs move at different speeds, has been shown to induce locomotor
learning in post-stroke patients and subjects without neurological damage. Here
the PI will determine if the learning phase on the split-belt treadmill in these
two populations can be altered to enhance the generalization of learned
movements from the treadmill to natural walking. The research uses a human-in-
the-loop method that manipulates a subject's perceived gait symmetry to create
the illusion of error-free performance during split-belt walking. Through this
closed-loop approach, the PI aims to identify ways to enhance the generalization
of movements learned on the treadmill to non-treadmill conditions. If
successful, the project could have a transformative effect on procedures for
gait rehabilitation after stroke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
