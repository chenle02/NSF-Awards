This two tiered northern Florida junior/senior high school program matches 10
leader mathematics teachers with 20 minimally prepared mathematics teachers, (on
a one-to-two basis) in order to strengthen/broaden the mathematical background
and to improve the teaching skills of all the teachers. The workshops, in the
summers of l987 and l988, will consist of two intense five-week programs running
concurrently and separately, but overlapping in a seminar meeting three times
per week for all teachers and four faculty members. During the academic year
there will be visits to the teachers' classes and two mini-conferences. The
courses (tailored to the mathematical experiences of the teachers) will use the
problem solving approach and include computer/information sciences. The
underprepared teachers will focus on algebra, geometry, measurement, and
probability. Other topics will include logic, linear programming, game theory,
calculus (upon request), and teaching strategies. Moreover, the leader teachers
will develop mentor skills. The University of Florida is awarding 7 credits for
these courses. The teachers will come from Central Crown school districts in
northern Florida. There is significant cost sharing from the Florida Department
of Education and the University of Florida.
