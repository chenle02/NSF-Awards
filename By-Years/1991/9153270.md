The three-semester calculus sequence is being revised to integrate the computer
as an active component of the learning process. A pilot program begun in 1989 is
being expanded throughout the three-semester sequence. A laboratory component is
being introduced in which students will modify computer code written in True
BASIC and apply the programs to a wide range of mathematical problems.
