This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Chemistry supports
Abraham Wolcott of the University of Texas at Austin as an American
Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Wolcott will investigate the
preparation, assembly and properties of one-dimensional type II CdSe/ZnTe
semiconductor nanorods and their possible use in photovoltaic devices. Dr.
Wolcott will synthesize the nanorods, align them vertically on a substrate and
probe their photophysical properties with ultrafast spectroscopy techniques.
Ultimately, Dr. Wolcott will use these materials to build solar cells. Dr.
Wolcott will work in collaboration with scientists at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In his plan
for broadening participation, Dr. Wolcott will work with middle and high school
students in the Austin metro area in hands-on projects designed to teach
students about solar energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr.
Wolcott is aimed at developing more efficient ways of producing solar energy --
a renewable energy source. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued
by Dr. Wolcott are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from
underrepresented groups in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
