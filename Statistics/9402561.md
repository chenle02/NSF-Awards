The investigator proposes to study nonparametric estimation of an unknown
survival function S (=1-F) with interval-censored data. Suppose the survival
time X has a distribution function F. Let (Y,Z) be the random censoring
interval. The observations are (L1,R1),...,(Ln,Rn), which are i.i.d. random
vectors from a population (L,R), where L=R=X if X is not inside the interval
(Y,Z) and (L,R)=(Y,Z) otherwise. Interval-censored data arise quite naturally in
medical follow-up studies or in industrial life-testing. To date, there is no
closed form expression for the generalized maximum likelihood estimator (GMLE).
The investigator, jointly with Wong, is proposing an estimator obtained by a
redistribution-to-the-center method, called the RTCE. The RTCE has an explicit
expression and is a GMLE in many cases. The funding of this proposal would lead
to an explicit expression of a GMLE in a more general interval censorship model
rather than these special cases, and a better understanding of the properties of
the GMLE and the RTCE. These results then lead to a more convenient and useful
estimator than the current procedure derived from a self-consistent algorithm.
Interval-censored data arise naturally in medical follow-up studies or in
industrial life-testing, for example, in a breast cancer chemoprevention study
in which the effect of a chemopreventive agent is investigated. An important
question in such a study is how long a woman can go without taking the agent
before the protective effect of the agent wears off. Let X denote the time
interval from cessation of use of the agent to the loss of its protective effect
qualified as a return to baseline level of an intermediate biomarker. When the
biomarker levels are monitored in scheduled intervals, the exact value of X is
usually not known except that it lies in an interval. The overall technical
objective in this proposal is to carry out nonparametric estimation of the
survival function, i.e., the probability of X>t for any given time t.
