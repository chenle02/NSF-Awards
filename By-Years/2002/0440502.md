Disasters Roundtable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
mission of the Disasters Roundtable is to facilitate and enhance communication
and the exchange of ideas among scientists, practitioners, and policy makers in
order to identify emerging issues related to natural, technological, and other
disasters. The Roundtable is a forum for examining urgent and important issues
related to disaster reduction. It emphasizes the exchange of ideas and
facilitates personal working relationships between the federal agencies and
experts in related fields. In the "roundtable" format, federal officials
participate fully as members, thus engaging them more closely in the process.
&lt;br/&gt;The Roundtable convenes three times a year to provide a forum for
discussion on issues related to the understanding and mitigation of disasters.
It brings together experts in the scientific and technical fields related to
hazards and the relevant social and policy sciences to identify, discuss, and
advance issues that require national or regional attention. The Roundtable is a
neutral meeting ground for scientists, practitioners, and policy makers to
exchange information and ideas. &lt;br/&gt;The Roundtable members identify
topics, create agendas, recruit expert speakers, and assemble information for
discussion for open workshops. Workshop sessions are carefully structured to
feature appropriate presentations and discussions relevant to scientific
developments and timely policy issues related to disasters.
&lt;br/&gt;Government officials who serve as ex officio members are incumbents
of the sponsoring federal agencies that have program responsibilities in
pertinent aspects of the issues before the Roundtable. A steering committee of
approximately 13 members (5 appointed members and 8 sponsoring members) set the
agenda for the workshops, which are all open and free to the public. The
workshops result in summary reports which are posted on the National Academies
website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
