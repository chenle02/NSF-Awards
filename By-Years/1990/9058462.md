Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award - Planets and Asteroids. Dr. Binzel
will use this Presidential Young Investigator Award to continue his multi-
faceted observational and theoretical research on the planet Pluto and asteroids
in the Solar System. For the Pluto-Charon system, Dr. Binzel is attempting to
derive physical parameters, such as diameters, masses, and densitites, from the
rare geometry of the planet and its satellite. Dr. Binzel's asteroid research
involves studying the characteristics of clusters of asteroids which represent
the outcome of large natural collision experiments. Collisional processes are a
significant factor in the evolution of the remnant planetesimals known as
asteroids. By understanding the collisional processing that has occurred, the
original planetesimal population can be characterized and used to constrain
models for the formation of the Solar System. The Pluto-Charon system is
undergoing a once-per-century alignment which results in a series of mutual
eclipses for Earth-based observers. Careful observations of these events could
lead to the derivation of physical parameters of the components of the system.
Dr. Binzel's research will address both the evolutionary properties of
asteroids, and precise physical properties of Pluto-Charon.
