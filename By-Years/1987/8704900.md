Workstations and a file server will be provided for researchers at Cornell
University, for research in the Department of Electrical Engineering. The
central focus of this research is on signal processing and communications. The
signal processing research involves new techniques for digital signal analysis
of non-stationary signals, as well as adaptive parameter estimation and
filtering. New algorithms are being developed for efficient implementation of
signal processing operations. Research in communications includes studies of
coded communication signals, especially for effective data storage on magnetic
tape and disks. The effects of flicker noise and quantization in dynamic systems
are being analyzed and studies of communications in computer networks are
underway.
