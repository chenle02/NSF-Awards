9508597 Wolf The Modern Analysis Group at the University of California at
Berkeley is composed of leading researchers in most parts of modern analysis,
including complex analysis, knot theory, finite and infinite dimensional group
theory, topological vector spaces, quantum groups and mathematical physics.
Because of the diversity and depth of this Group there are unique opportunities
for the training of graduate students and for inter-action between graduate
students, young scientists, and established researchers. The Modern Analysis
Group has a history of close cooperation and considerable success in such
activities. A comprehensive three-year program of support for graduate students
and postdoctoral visitors would enhance the group's ability to conduct seminars,
accelerate the completion of individual Ph.D. programs, and contribute to
further interaction with young scientists near the beginning of their most
productive years. This will make efficient use of existing resources, and it
will enhance the quality of young scientists working in this rapidly growing
area of mathematics. The resources of the Group Infrastructure Grant would be
used to support one half time postdoctoral scholar and several of those graduate
students at the most productive segment of their doctoral training.
