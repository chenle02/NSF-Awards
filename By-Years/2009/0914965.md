This project will employ a cyclical two-step process to develop a computational
model that embeds dynamic expression and socially engaging non-verbal gestures
into talking avatars, and experimentally tests its usability within digital
virtual environments involving human-digital agent interaction. Specifically,
the research objectives of this project include: (1) synthesis of expressive
talking faces and modeling of dynamic facial expressions, (2) synthesis of
socially engaging non-verbal facial gestures, and (3) in-depth usability studies
on resultant avatars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital immersive virtual
environment technology has enormous implications for human-computer interaction.
Many qualities of digital human representations, particularly those of human-
appearing agents, are important for social engagement and social influence. In
particular, non-verbal behaviors play a critical role. Among such behaviors,
arguably the most important are facial expressions of emotion, which are
critical for meaningful renderings of digital agents. To date, computational
models that would permit such renderings are less than optimal. Indeed, an
applicable and systematic computational model for rendering spontaneous, on-the-
fly non-verbal facial gestures and integrating them with speech has not been
created. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this proposed project will remove
a major barrier to the widespread application of useful digital human
representation technology for all applications in which computer-mediated
communication can play a role, including commerce, education, health,
engineering, and entertainment applications. In addition, it will have far-
reaching scientific implications, providing a computationally tractable
mechanism for embedding human qualities into computer-controlled entities that
are used in other scientific and engineering fields. &lt;br/&gt;
