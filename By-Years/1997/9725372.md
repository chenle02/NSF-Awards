9725372 Pollard Fault segmentation is observed at many scales in normal fault
systems and mechanical interaction between the segments appears to influence the
development of the fault system. Understanding this mechanical interaction will
improve understanding of the manner in which normal faults grow and link. A
systematic study of the strong perturbations around normal faults under
different tectonic stress regimes will involve use of the numerical code of Poly
3D. Results will include documentation of stress distribution and strain around
a single normal fault under typical loading conditions and interactions between
two echelon segments. These products will be of interest in seismic hazard
analysis and aspects of resource exploration.
