Under the direction of Dr. Stephen Houston, Mr. Christopher Beekman will
collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue his ongoing
archaeological research in the Atemajac and Tala- Ahualulco-Teuchitlan valleys
in Jalisco Mexico. The region is extremely interesting because during the
Classic period (A.D. 200- 900) it marked the boundary between two large complex
polities, one centered at Teuchitlan the other at the Central Mexican site of
Teotihuacan. What Mr. Beekman wishes to study is the interaction between these
two "states", how they changed over time, and what specific adaptations were
made in the border region between the two. In order to accomplish this goal he
will conduct a site survey and note architectural forms and site distribution.
He will also collect surface materials including both pottery and obsidian stone
tools. Since designs on pottery relfect ethnic affiliation, be will analyze the
ceramics from this perspective to determine whether or not ethnic differences
are clearly defined and how this may change over time. By conducting chemical
analysis to determine clay source as well as the points of origin for obsidian
stone tools, he will also gain insight into economic and trade relationships.
This research is important because it will provide insight into how complex
polities interact and how boundaries are established, maintained and altered
over a long period of time. Over the ca. 700 time interval under study the
relative powers of these two polities changed and it will be possible to
determine how direct contact and relations varied along with this. The work will
provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also assist in the
training of a promising young scientist.
