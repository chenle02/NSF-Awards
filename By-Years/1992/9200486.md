This is a unique conference which brings together academic and industrial
researchers working in VLSI, architecture, CAD tools and theory. It provides a
forum for interaction between people from different backgrounds, with different
priorities and different perspectives. Parallel sessions have been avoided to
allow better sharing of information about different research topics in VLSI. The
conference is designed to contribute to a better understanding of the Nation's
scientific and engineering research base.
