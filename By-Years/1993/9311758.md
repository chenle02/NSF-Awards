9311758 Riley This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky
University in the purchase of an upgrade of their x-ray fluorescence
spectrometer. This upgrade will enhance research in a number of areas including
the following: 1. Determination of major, minor, and trace elements in the
residues from co-firing refuse-derived fuels with coal. 2. Distribution of
major, minor, and trace elements in animal digestibility studies. 3. Prediction
of fusion temperatures and viscosities of ashes from their elemental
composition. 4. Analysis of major, minor, and trace element accumulation in feed
lots. %%% The x-ray fluorescence is a non-destructive physical method used for
chemical analysis of solids and liquids, where the sample is irradiated by an
intense x-ray beam and the lines in the spectrum of the resulting x-ray
fluorescence are related to the elements in the sample identified by the
wavelength of their spectral lines, and their concentrations are determined by
the intensities of the lines. ***
