Howard University, the only Historically Black College and University
classified as a Group I Research Institution, is the recipient of ARI funds to
renovate research and training space in Thirkield Hall. Constructed in 1909, the
building has the distinction of being one of the oldest structures on campus,
and is home to the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Faculty members are
actively involved in ongoing research initiatives that emphasizes atmospheric
science, computational physics, condensed matter physics, magnetism, optical
physics, remote sensing, spectroscopy, and theoretical physics. However,
existing conditions such as the lack of temperature and humidity controls,
severely limit the ability of faculty and students to conduct competitive
research. Renovations will include the following: upgraded plumbing and
provisions for power with filtered and isolated services for specialized
instrumentation; installation of new cabinetry to make existing space more
efficient to accommodate new equipment; installation of new fume hoods where
required; and upgraded security measures for laboratories. This project will
enhance the institution's goal of being the largest producer of African American
physicists at the doctoral level. Improved facilities complement the
Department's mission of striving for national and international excellence in
research and teaching in physics and ensures that students of African American
descent are given the opportunity to achieve their fullest potential in physics.
