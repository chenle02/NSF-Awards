National Musical Arts is requesting a planning grant of $50,000 to conduct
initial planning and research toward the development of a traveling exhibition
and related educational programming on the subject of biomusic -- the musical
sounds produced by living things. The work will be performed by the BioMusic
project, a program of National Musical Arts, in collaboration with the
Association of Science Technology Centers and a national team of informal
science educators. The goal of the project is to develop a 2,500 square-foot
traveling exhibit and related programs targeted to md-sized science centers,
zoos and aquaria across the country.

During the proposed one-year planning phase, the Biomusic Project and ASTC will
work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists, musicians, exhibit developers
and educators to understand the current state of biomusic research; to identify
concepts and phenomena that could make strong visitor experiences; and to
develop initial plans for the exhibit and programs. The result of the work of
the planning phase will include a Biomusic Groundwork Report, a Biomusic Program
presented at the annual ASTC Conference and a detailed Exhibition Prospectus.
