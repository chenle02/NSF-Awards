The Council on Competitiveness proposes to support the establishment of an
independent, 501(c)3 organization, Building Engineering and Scientific Talent
(BEST) to implement the recommendations of the Congressional Commission on the
Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology
Development. The Report of the Commission, released in September 2000, concludes
that broadening the demographic base of the U.S. technical workforce is a
national economic and social imperative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Council will
support the Report's call to action by framing a strategic vision and putting in
place a structure that will enable BEST to engage national leaders at the
highest level. If BEST can define itself as the nation's hub for strategic
insights, proven methods, and actions plan of any community or institution in
the country that wishes to meet the diversity challenge, it will gain the
credibility to have the grass roots and policy impact intended by the
Commission. The backing of this strategy by a prestigious board, a National
Leadership Council, and a Federal Liaison Group will enable BEST to create
strong nationwide, leadership networks.&lt;br/&gt;
