The use of stable isotopes as tracers in environmental, climatic and
paleoclimatic research continues to expand. In particular, the stable isotopes
of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen in carbonates and water serve as "work-horse"
tracers of meteorologic, climatic, oceanographic, geologic, and biologic
processes in the natural environment. Many new paleoclimatic and monitoring
studies now require the analysis of larger numbers of samples because of the
need of more detailed climatic and environmental reconstructions. There is a
clear demand, therefore, for more automated Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry
(IRMS) facilities that are capable of analyzing the greater sample load of new
research projects. This award supports the purchase of IRMS equipment at the
State University of New York at Albany. This equipment will form the centerpiece
of the university's multi-functional isotope laboratory within the new
Environmental Geochemistry-Global Change research and teaching initiative.***
