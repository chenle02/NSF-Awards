This award supports cooperative research on superconductivity and low
temperature physics to be carried out by Orest Symko of the University of Utah
and Paulo Costa Ribeiro of the Pontifical Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro
in Brazil. Arrays of superconducting devices will be developed for biomagnetic
studies and for magnetic fluctuation studies. Superconducting quantum
interference devices (SQUIDS) will be developed for studying the magnetic fields
produced by the heart and brain. In addition, a high temperature superconducting
magnetometer will be developed for studies of the magnetic fluctuations in high
Tc superconductors. The research draws on the experience and facilities of both
groups. Prof. Symko works on Josephson junction devices for data processing and
on studies of magnetism at low temperatures. The Brazil group is involved in
research on biomagnetism and low-dimensionality magnetism. This project will
continue a previously productive collaboration which has included exchange of
students and post-docs and the publication of several papers.
