Voelcker This is a joint project with Herbert B. Voelcker (Cornell University)
to continue the successful research on custom hardware for solid modelling. Duke
is extending and improving the hardware itself, while Cornell is building
software for constructive solid geometry (CSG), integrating the resulting system
with applications, and conducting field tests. The initial 8-processor system is
being upgraded to 256 processors, to allow parallel processing of more complex
objects. At the same time, the numerical precision of the hardware is being
increased, and a tag system is included to allow the processors to keep track of
software-specified properties of parts of objects.
