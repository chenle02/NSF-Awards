This award provides 56% of the funds required for the acquisition of a computer
system required for the research of the geophysics faculty in the Department of
Physics at New Mexico State University. The University is committed to providing
the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The computer system will allow
the researchers to address computationally intensive problems such as the
propagation of elastic waves in heterogeneous media, travel-time inversion from
earthquake data, and other research projects in computational and observational
seismology, potential field studies, paleomagnetism, and neotectonics.
