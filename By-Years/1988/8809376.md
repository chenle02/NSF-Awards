This project proposes to investigate the physics of rapid thermal processing of
GeSi systems and their oxidation mechanisms. Epitaxial regrowth conditions and
the resulting junction properties will be investigated. Thermal oxidation and
the annealing kinetics to reduce interface states will be examined. Device
structures based on these materials will also be studied. These include HJBT for
very fast digital and high frequency analog applications, and heterojunction
MOSFET's for fast and reliable digital applications. The focus will be on their
fabrication and optimization. Device simulators will be employed to explore the
device physics involved. This proposed research can potentially lead to new
method in achieving high speed VLSI circuits.
