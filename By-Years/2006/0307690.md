AST-0307690&lt;br/&gt;Hernquist&lt;br/&gt;This project is a coordinated effort
to study the relationship between the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) and
stars and galaxies. Numerical simulations will address the formation of the
first stars, of pre-galactic objects, and of galaxies, emphasizing the various
forms of feedback connecting those beasties to the IGM (radiative effects,
chemical enrichment, and kinetic and thermal injection of energy). The principal
answers to be expected from this research include the extent to which feedback
affects things, when and how the Universe changed gears between the different
eras (was chemical enrichment a primary factor?), what were the galactic
building blocks - how did they differ from the first stars, do they have
observable consequences - and when and how the IGM acquired its metals. Varying
the resolution and using two different numerical methods will help to validate
the results and ensure convergence, since this is the first attempt to include
the relevant physical effects in a proper cosmological
context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All developed computer programs, including the
different ways of coding the various physical processes, will be released for
community use. In particular, this includes the 'flagship' adaptive mesh
refinement code known as Enzo.&lt;br/&gt;***
