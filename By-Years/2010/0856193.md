This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award
is to explore how different vehicle classes, such as automobiles, buses and
bicycles, interact on large, city-scale transport networks. This is necessary
because previous research has been limited to small-scale systems, such as
individual intersections, dominated by a single mode -- the automobile. The work
will proceed on two parallel fronts. The first will identify the smallest basic
component within a multimodal network for which the governing laws of traffic
can be scaled-up to the larger, city-wide level. The second will study
systematically the cross-modal vehicular interactions that arise on these basic
components. The work will involve both theory and experiment. The latter is made
possible thanks to agreements that have been reached with decision-makers in
various cities, including several cities in the developing world where the need
for efficient multi-modal travel alternatives is especially acute. Anticipated
outcomes include analytical models that describe how different vehicle classes
interact and coexist, and show how to improve network designs and control
methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will address the global climate
crisis and the rising cost and growing scarcity of oil to help cities embrace
greener, more sustainable modes of transport, including public transit, bicycles
and walking. The findings will help engineers and planners devise strategies
that improve mobility for all urban travelers regardless of the mode they use,
and help policy-makers in their efforts to make the greener modes a more viable
alternative to automobiles. The latter will benefit the planet; the former the
local citizenry. It is expected that benefits will flow in particular to those
in society who are least able to own and drive cars. The work will contribute to
scientific education because it will support two doctoral dissertations, and its
findings will be integrated into the curricula at U.C. Berkeley and perhaps
elsewhere.
