This is a project to maintain and augment as necessary, the network of nearly
fifty automatic weather stations established on the antarctic continent and on
several surrounding islands. These weather stations measure surface wind,
pressure, temperature, humidity, and in some instances other atmospheric
variables, such as snow accumulation and incident solar radiation, and report
these via satellite to a number of ground stations. The data are used for
operational weather forecasting in support of the United States Antarctic
program, for climatological records, and for research purposes. The AWS network,
which began as a small-scale program in 1980, has been extremely reliable and
has proven indispensable for both forecasting and research purposes.
