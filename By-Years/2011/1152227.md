The challenges of 21st century science and engineering demand the creation of
effective and efficient distributed, multi-disciplinary, collaborative teams and
virtual organizations. This researcher will manage a workshop to develop a
detailed picture of emerging results, critical research directions, and grand
challenges for understanding the socio-technical processes that underpin virtual
organizations. This program planning workshop will provide an opportunity to
consolidate the new knowledge that has been emerged and identify new directions.
Focusing on research in areas covered by the NSF "Virtual Organizations as
Sociotechnical Systems (VOSS)" program, it will explore emergent and potential
productive research directions and syntheses at the intersection of recognized
and projected VOSS research themes, and objectives. Specific directions that
might be interesting but not yet topical or generally compelling will also be
noted.
