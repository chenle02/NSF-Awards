This project will build a "cool", moderate resolution, 200&lt;R&lt;2000, slit
spectrograph to mate to a near-IR camera at McDonald Observatory. This new
spectrometer (the spectrograph part of which is referred to as CoolSpec) offers
large advantages, both in sensitivity and operationally, compared to the present
near-IR spectrometer, IRGS. The new spectrograph will be flexible enough to take
advantage of new developments in near-IR array technology. Observational
programs that will be undertaken with the new spectrometer are: studies of star
formation in our own and other galaxies, supernova atmospheres, the environment
of planetary nebulae, planetary atmospheres, and reflectance spectra of rocky
solar system bodies.
