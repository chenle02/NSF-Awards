This research project is a multi-institutional scientific collaboration in the
field of magnetism and the magnetic properties of materials. It involves 10 co-
principal investigators representing 8 institutions. This scientific effort
combines novel materials synthesis techniques including molecular beam epitaxy,
advanced structure determination methods, new spin-sensitive spectroscopic
techniques and state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations. The major
focus of this project involves continued development and operation of a spin-
polarized photoemission facility based on high-flux radiation from an undulator
insertion device installed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at
Brookhaven National Laboratory. The primary objective of this research is to
advance our understanding of the magnetic behavior of matter with emphasis on
novel materials including surfaces, ultra-thin epitaxial layers, modulated
structures and superlattices. An equally important object is to train students
and post doctoral associates in multi-disciplinary research activity. The
combination of materials synthesis, spin-sensitive electron spectroscopies and
first-principles calculations in a coordinated program of research offers
outstanding opportunities for gaining new scientific knowledge in a variety of
fields including epitaxial growth, phase transformations, magnetism, and novel
magnetic materials. This project will also serve as a prototype for multi-
investigator research efforts in solid state physics and other disciplines that
require a coordinated team approach, combining scientific talent and resources
that extend beyond what is available at a single facility or institution.
