9421877 Pope This grant supports a program of research in elementary particle
physics with an international collaboration that studies proton-antiproton
interactions and properties of the particles produced in the collisions. The
source is the Fermilab Tevatron colliding-beams accelerator complex. Topics of
interest include top quark properties, precision measurement of parameters
important for detailed investigation of the validity of the "standard model"
theoretical framework and tests of Quantum Chromodynamics. Included is support
for further instrumentation development to improve the capability of detection
apparatus. ***
