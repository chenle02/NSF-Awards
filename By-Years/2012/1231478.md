The US-China workshop on environmental monitoring for public health and disaster
recovery will be held at Yellow Mountains, Anhui, China on August 7-8, 2012. The
workshop will include one keynote speech session, one position papers session,
one panel session, five technical sessions, and one summary session. There will
be approximately 20 US participants and 20 Chinese participants. The objective
of this workshop is to bring together experts in the field of environmental
monitoring from the U.S. and China, and to promote and sustain mutually
beneficial research and education collaboration between the U.S. and China in
this field. Via wireless sensing and network technologies, large-scale
environmental monitoring systems offer major promise to realize these goals.
Workshop topics include foundational sensing, network calculus theory; novel
sensor architectures and protocols; and supporting platforms and technologies
for the above applications. The workshop can foster substantial opportunities
for fundamental research breakthroughs in this field that can bring about
international research and educational impacts. The workshop anticipates
establishing a research agenda for environmental monitoring for public health
and disaster recovery; identify new environmental monitoring research problems,
challenges, potential solutions, and future directions; and form five to seven
teams that will examine unique topics in environmental monitoring. These
theories, architectures, and protocols will enable novel platforms for
proactive, patient-centric healthcare and real-time disaster recovery. All
workshop research topics, discussions, and outcomes will be presented online.
Female and minority faculty are especially encouraged to present their research
at the workshop.
