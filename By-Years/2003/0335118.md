0335118 Gubbins This award supports faculty from several disciplines and several
US universities to participate in a workshop on organizing an international
graduate program to be held at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, Germany on
10-13 June 2003. The workshop will focus on developing a program between North
Carolina State and Vanderbilt Universities on the US side and the Technical
University of Berlin, the Max Planck Institute for Colloid and Interface
Science, and the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin. The fields of study for the
international graduate program will be self-assembled nanostructures, including
surfactant self-assembled structures on solids and in pores, thin films on
metals and semiconductors, and biological membranes. As part of the program, US
graduate students will spend part of their PhD tenure in one or more of the
Berlin institutions (typically for a period of 6 months or more). Workshop
participants will be drawn from the fields of chemistry, physics, biochemistry,
materials science, and chemical engineering.
