A "hands-on" understanding of the techniques and applications of whole-rock
geochemical analysis is an essential part of a student's undergraduate
preparation in Geology. The Department of Geology at Trinity University will
integrate an energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer system (ED-XRF)
into its undergraduate curriculum. All students whose eventual careers might
require the application of geochemical principles will be exposed to the
multiple uses of this technique. The instrument will be used as a tool in
courses and research, with an emphasis on its use in solving geologic problems
including the origin of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks and ore
deposits. Development of the program will be achieved through the acquisition of
an ED-XRF which has capability to produce quantitative, multi-element analyses
of silicate rocks.
