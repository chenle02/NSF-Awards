Abstract Rychlik Rychlik will investigate the following problems: The existence
of special classes of solutions in non-linear difference equations and ordinary
differential equations which correspond to homoclinic and heteroclinic
connections. The existence of algebraic integrals for a class of symplectic
maps. The measure of periodic trajectories in billiard systems. The existence of
traveling wave and breather solutions to PDEs. Development and implementation of
algorithms for dealing with systems of multi-variate polynomial equations with
many parameters that often arise in applications. The problems selected for this
project generally invite the use of techniques from algebraic geometry and
complex analysis. The main objective of the current project is to show that
advanced techniques from these fields are useful in solving problems of
dynamics. A result of this research will be a suite of algebraic and complex-
analytic methods general enough to be applied to other problems.
