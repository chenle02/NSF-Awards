The Ohio State University will initiate an academic year, commuter, Young
Scholars project in Mathematics and Computer Science for 400 students entering
grades 7,8. Technology-Informed Mathematics Education for Underrepresented
Students (TIME for US) serves as a school-year bridge between the annual summer
institutes on The Ohio State University's Columbus campus for talented, low-
income, students from nine Ohio cities. The project provides school-year
mathematics enrichment, career exploration, and mentor activities for 400
students in their own communities. Each participant is matched with a college-
educated mentor and a local college student, and in monthly sessions throughout
the school year students experience the excitement of mathematics through
calculators, computers, hands-on activities, and career exploration field trips.
