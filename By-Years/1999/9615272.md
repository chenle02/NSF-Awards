The main objective of this project is to improve the scalability and
effectiveness of knowledge discovery and data mining systems in order to handle
large, structural databases (i.e., databases composed of parts and relations
among parts). First, a state-of-the-art structural discovery system called
Subdue will be integrated with one or more existing non-structural discovery
systems. Parallel and distributed versions of both Subdue and the integrated
discovery system will then be developed. Distributing both the data and the
processing across several machines will afford the most scalability for the
discovery systems, and distribution is essential for handling large databases.
The integrated discovery system will then be applied to several large scientific
databases. The results will be evaluated by domain experts and disseminated
along with source code releases of all software to the scientific community.
This research addresses a critical need to improve the scalability of existing
knowledge discovery and data mining methods, especially in domains with richer
data representations, will provide scalable discovery systems to the scientific
community, and will increase the state of knowledge in the design of parallel
and distributed intelligent systems.
