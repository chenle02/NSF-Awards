9614208 Johnson This collaborative study is aimed at understanding the evolution
of the lithosphere of the Rocky Mountain transect in the North American
southwest. This transect is located at the juncture of two globally-unique
tectonic regimes, each of fundamental importance for understanding continental
tectonics and together representing an outstanding field laboratory for studies
of continental lithosphere. First, a 1000 km wide juvenile Proterozoic orogenic
belt records rapid accretion of continental materials from mantle sources and
their assembly to southern Laurentia along NE-trending boundaries between 1.8
and 1.6 Ga. Second, the present high elevation of the SW in general and the
Rocky Mountains in particular is the manifestation of Laramide, Tertiary, and
still ongoing modification of Proterozoic Lithosphere that has resulted in a
wide NW-trending mantle boundary zone between old, cold, high velocity mantle in
the continental interior and hotter, lower velocity mantle in the western U.S.
By examining the present-day lithospheric structure across ancient boundaries,
the P.I.s hope to better understand the interplay between "active" and "passive"
processes during lithospheric evolution. Their principal hypothesis is that
lithospheric structures produced during assembly of the southwestern U.S. have
profoundly influenced physical and chemical modification of the continental
lithosphere during all subsequent magmatic and tectonic events, including those
related to the ongoing reorganization of small-scale asthenospheric convection
and replacement of lithosphere by asthenosphere. To test this hypothesis, they
propose an integrated set of multi-scale experiments using state of the art
geophysical, geological and geochemical techniques that, together, are designed
to decipher lithosphere structure and evolution, and processes of lithosphere
formation and deformation. ***
