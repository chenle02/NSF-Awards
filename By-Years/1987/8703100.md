Chloroplast Thylakoid Protein Phosphatase: This project will continue the
characterization of two protein phosphatases associated with chloroplast
thylakoid membranes isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum). Characterization
will include kinetic analysis of the activities, studies on substrate
specificity using endogenous and synthetic peptides, and biochemical analysis of
tertiary and quaternary structures. Antibodies recognizing the phosphatases will
be prepared and used in studies on the location of the phosphatase enzymes
within the photosynthetic membrane network. If antibodies inhibit the enzymatic
activity, they will be utilized to substantiate that phosphatase activity is
involved in the reversal of State 1/State 2 transition, which regulates
photosynthetic energy production. Antibodies will also be used to study the
amphiphilic properties of the enzyme, i.e., the potential to partition between
the thylakoid surface and stromal phase, and the potential of this process to
regulate protein dephosphorylation, thereby complementing known mechanisms of
modulating thylakoid protein kinase activity. Chloroplast thylakoid membrane
protein phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of steady-
state energy production by photosynthesis. The key elements are a protein kinase
whose activity is stimulated when the plastoquinone pool is reduced, and the
light-harvesting complex, thereby differentially partitions between the two
photosystems. This system is thought to govern the photon flux density between
the two photosystems. The protein kinases present in the thylakoid membrane have
been characterized, but the protein phosphatases, which reverse the light-
harvesting complex phosphorylation, are little understood. The results are
essential to a complete understanding of how photosynthetic organisms are able
to optimize their efficiency. Such information may also be useful to engineering
or breeding desirable molecular response traits into commercially useful plants.
