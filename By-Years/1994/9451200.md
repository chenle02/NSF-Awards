The Department of Biology at Emory University is developing a laboratory course
in experimental developmental biology that follows a "project lab" pedagogy. The
innovative project lab concept extends well beyond traditional lab formats that
may accompany courses in developmental biology. Project labs immerse students in
a realistic research lab atmosphere, where they design, perform and analyze
their own long-term experiments. Funding will enable purchase of inverted phase
microscopes, incubators, and tools for molecular biology techniques of the lab.
