The Case Western Reserve University will initiate a four-week, summer commuter
Young Scholars project in Physics and Engineering for 24 students entering
grades 11 and 12. At the heart of the institute is a program of individual
student research projects carried out in the laboratories and under the
direction of physics and engineering researchers at CWRU, NASA Lewis Research
Center, and one other local research facility. A week-long physics content
component strongly emphasizing guided inquiry laboratory work and sessions on
research methodology will precede the commencement of the research projects; the
content sessions attend to both physics fundamentals and topics in current
research. Career exploration activities include field trips to government and
private research labs, a hospital medical physics department, and a nuclear
power plant; guest presentations by academic and industrial science
professionals will offer further opportunities for students to hear career
perspectives from practicing scientists and engineers in both research and
education.
