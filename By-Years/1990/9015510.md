Professor Kamienny will work on extending his recent work on the uniform
boundedness theorem to other fields then Quadratic. He will also be working on
isogenies of elliptic curves over fields of degree d. This project falls into
the general area of Number theory - more specifically the theory of elliptic
curves. Often called "the Queen of mathematics", number theory, is along with
Euclidean geometry, the oldest field in mathematics. Yet, it is one that has
shown its freshness anew in each generation. This has been shown most
dramatically with the astonishing connections of elliptic curves to cryptography
and coding theory.
