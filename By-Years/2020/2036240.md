The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to rapidly generate personalized data
regarding immune health and exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Detection of SARS-CoV-2
exposure is urgently needed to understand viral spread, conduct contact tracing,
provide public health recommendations, prepare for hospitalization or critical
care emergencies, and safely reduce the need for social distancing. The proposed
system will use new technologies to measure chemicals in blood to understand how
COVID-19 evolves after exposure. This approach offers improved speed, accuracy,
ease of use, cost, and ability to deploy in communities where clinical resources
may not be readily accessible. Machine learning can be used to study population-
level data to understand the relationship between immune health and COVID-19
severity. The dataset developed herein can improve the reliability of early
signs of severe pathological COVID-19 progression, improving both quality of
care and efficiency for public health use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development
of a remote or home-based self-monitoring system to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies (IgG and IgM) and inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and IL-6) from finger-
stick blood after viral exposure. Specifically, this technology combines serial
serology, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays, and novel app-enabled
spectrophotometry to evaluate immune health during the course of infection. This
approach will provide novel information and data for large-scale analysis and
mitigation measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
