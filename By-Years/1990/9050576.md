Funds are being used to purchase a high quality microscope with bright-field,
fluorescent, and photographic capabilities. This instrument is to be the focus
of lab exercises in the introductory genetics course, a cytogenetics course, and
an immunology course. It is to be used to a lesser degree in bacteriology,
embryology, and histology courses, and will also be used in independent research
projects. In the genetics courses, attention is focused on chromosomes. Several
laboratory exercises and student research projects have been designed to involve
students in cytogenetics and immunological techniques which require photo- and
fluorescent microscopy. This provides students, many of whom are members of
minority groups, with technical knowledge and expertise in the use of an
instrument fundamental to biological investigations. The university will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
