The aim of this project is to improve instruction in four different courses that
utilize the Materials Testing Laboratory. The equipment includes an Automatic
Testing System, and Electro-Mechanical Testing System, troptometers, strain
gauge, and various fixtures. The microprocessor-based Automatic Testing System
upgrades the existing 200,000 lb. Universal Tester to state of the art as found
by graduates in high tech industries in the area. The Electro- Mechanical
Testing System extends the capability of the laboratory into polymers, ceramics
and composite testing in keeping with the growing importance of these to
surrounding industries and research centers. Experiments taking advantage of
these new capabilities are incorporated the curriculum of several different
degree programs. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
