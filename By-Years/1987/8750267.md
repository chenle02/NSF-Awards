The applications of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to both
"static" investigations like the elucidation of molecular structure and to
"dynamic" ones like the measurement of the rates of physical and/or chemical
processes illustrates the versatility and utility of NMR in spanning the
chemical disciplines from organic to inorganic chemistry. The recent acquisition
of a continuous wave NMR spectrometer by the Chemistry Department at Kean
College of New Jersey allows the application of these techniques in an
integrated and cohesive way across the curriculum, thus providing the students,
twenty four per cent of whom are minorities, with invaluable training and an
intellectually stimulating theme in their scientific education.
