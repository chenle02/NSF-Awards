This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design a
prototype for a rapid-deployment, three-dimensional (3-D), seismic reflection
system for shallow subsurface exploration. Although the 3-D seismic reflection
method enjoys tremendous commercial success in marine applications, 3-D seismic
systems for land-based geophysical exploration have been limited because cost-
effective and environmentally friendly deployment systems have not been
developed. Such a system would be useful to build models of ground water flow,
track pollutants, identify mineral-laden zones, and aid the siting of large
construction projects. The customer base for this seismic reflection system
includes civil and environmental engineers and geophysical contractors.

PFM Manufacturing and Montana Tech propose to design a rapid-deployment, 3- D,
seismic reflection system that employs multiple land streamers with gimbal-
mounted vertical geophones. An industrial, low-impact All Terrain Vehicle (ATV)
is a critical part of the system both to pull the land streamers and minimize
environmental impact. PFM builds an ideal ATV for this purpose. The primary
advantage of such a system is that fewer field personnel would be needed
compared to conventional surveys and data could be collected more efficiently.
