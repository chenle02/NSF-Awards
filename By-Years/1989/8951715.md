A microcomputer laboratory classroom is being created that will support an
expanded and revised curriculum for the calculus sequence and that will also
support curriculum revisions in some upper division courses. Instructors can
generate materials for the laboratory using a computer algebra and graphics
language for MS-DOS computers that was developed over the last five years by the
PI. Instructors are able to create textual, graphical, and executable programs
that focus and direct student exploration. The laboratory classroom is also used
during summers in the College's School and College Articulation Program, one of
whose aims is to attract more minority students to the College. The institution
will provide funds to match this grant.
