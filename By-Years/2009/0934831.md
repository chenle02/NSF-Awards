Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College are collaborating to prepare STEM
teachers for high need school districts. An objective is to determine whether
purposefully integrating a broad range of existing campus student-support and
civic engagement structures together with a strong scholarship program and an
ambitious publicity/recruitment campaign will increase the number of students
who become precollege STEM teachers. Additional new initiatives designed to
enhance teacher success include professional development and induction
components. The program is developing a model for STEM teacher education that is
compatible with the goals and structure of a liberal arts education: students
complete a rigorous disciplinary major during their four years of undergraduate
study and then complete their education requirements during a fifth year. Bryn
Mawr and Haverford Colleges are collaborating with three local, secondary
schools, and with the Math Science Partnership of Greater Philadelphia/21st
Century Partnership Network. Nine Noyce Scholars are receiving two-year
scholarships during the senior and fifth year. The program also is providing
post-certification mentoring and professional development support during their
first two years of teaching. The project's merit involves investigating the
program's impact on encouraging STEM majors in a liberal arts setting to pursue
careers in teaching. The project has the potential to serve as a model for the
development of STEM teachers within the context of a highly selective liberal
arts college.
