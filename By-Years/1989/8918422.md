Professor Joel Keizer is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in the area of statistical
thermodynamic treatment of nonequilibrium systems. This work has a potential for
providing a unifying physical explanation of thermodynamic properties for
systems far from equilibrium, including systems undergoing steady state chemical
reactions. Keizer will utilize both computer molecular dynamics and the
statistical theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to investigate the nature of
molecular fluctuations in shear flows and chemical reactions under steady state
conditions. In related work, he will also extend his analytical calculations of
the effect of molecular forces on the steady state properties of chemical
reactions, including both molecular fluctuations and thermodynamic properties.
