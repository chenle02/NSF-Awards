This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to
investigate the feasibility of manufacturing a Lab-on-a-Film? microarray device
on a reel-to-reel assembly line. Reel-to-reel manufacturing has the potential to
drastically reduce device cost because hundreds of parts per hour can be
assembled. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of
manufacturing valve-less molecular lateral flow cells for gel drop microarrays
using reel-to-reel assembly equipment. At the conclusion of this project, the
goal is to demonstrate feasibility by positively identifying clinical samples
for infectious disease on reel-to-reel manufactured Lab-on-a-Film? assemblies.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project
is the potential to distribute quality diagnostics to an expanded population.
With cost being such an important factor in today?s healthcare system, the need
to investigate new avenues for offering quality diagnostics arises with
increasing urgency. This challenge may become a catalyst for a new multiplexing
paradigm in molecular diagnostics. A range of possibilities apply to this
paradigm such as infectious disease testing for multiple organisms, pathogenic
genotyping, genetic testing, forensics, environmental screening, agriculture
testing, and biodefense applications. Addressing not only the usability of the
end test, but also the manufacturing process is a means to be competitive in a
50 billion dollar global diagnostics market space.
