Hispanics comprise the second largest minority ethnic group in this country and
the fastest growing. The 1980 was the first U.S. census to explicitly track
Hispanic individuals and families as such, distinguishing the largely white
Hispanics from non-Hispanic whites. Yet Hispanics remain the most important
ethnic group not now covered by longitudinal surveys capable of following the
same individuals and families over three or more calendar years. A major cost
posing obstacles to this development is that of drawing the initial sample. This
proposal would take advantage of a sample of 2000 Hispanic respondents, recently
drawn and currently being surveyed about their political participation, by
adding follow-up surveys of the same sample in successive years to the current
and influential Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Intergenerational and
intragenerational social mobility, labor force participation and unemployment,
movement into and out of poverty, usage of welfare, and the changing
demographics of the Hispanic population are among the subjects that can now be
studied over time with this sample.
