This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the University of
Delaware entitled, "Nature InSpired Engineering Research Experiences for
Teachers (NISE-RET)," under the direction of Dr. Kenneth
Barner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NISE-RET site is a collaborative effort
involving five engineering departments, educational pedagogy, technology and
program evaluation experts, and regional school districts. Working in concert,
the multidisciplinary team will provide 30 (10 per year) pre-service and in-
service secondary school Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) teachers serving the mid-Atlantic region with an immersive six-week
summer program. The summer program will feature broad exposure to nature
inspired research in an array of engineering disciplines, guided discovery and
in-depth research in a chosen engineering discipline, and guided development of
research inspired teaching modules to enhance existing standards-based
curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NISE-RET site's broader impact is focused on
the inclusion of participants serving high need schools and an emphasis on the
development of universally accessible teaching modules. A particular emphasis
will be placed on accessible experiments and multimodal/alternative output
formats, such as tactile representations and audio graphs for individuals with
visual impairments. Thus, the NISE-RET site initiatives and outcomes will
directly impact high need students, including those with disabilities.
