This project develops a high vacuum systems laboratory for a 2-year, associate
of applied science degree program in Microelectronics Technology. This unique,
advanced-level technical program prepares technicians for jobs in the wafer fab
in our nation's expanding semiconductor industry. Wafer fab technicians need a
working knowledge of high vacuum systems because high vacuum techniques are so
pervasive in the manufacture of integrated circuits. Unfortunately, few colleges
are prepared to offer high vacuum systems courses because of a lack of suitable
training systems and a lack of appropriate instructional materials. To address
this need, this project is purchasing six miniturbomolecular (high vacuum)
pumping stations and three helium leak detectors to equip a technician-level,
high vacuum systems laboratory, adapt them for educational use, and design
laboratory experiments for these systems. Experiments can be compiled and
published as a laboratory manual for use at other community colleges and
technical institutes. Laboratory experiments include demonstrations of vacuum
fundamentals, operation of the pumping station, gauging and pressure measurement
techniques, and leak detection.
