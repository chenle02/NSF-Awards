9627479 Sack This project is composed experimental studies, theoretical studies
and petrologic applications of sulfosalts/sulfides in the system Ag2S-Cu2S-ZnS-
FeS-As2S3-Sb2S3-S and Bi-, Mn-, Cd-, and Hg- substituted supersystems. The
experimental studies will characterize the net transport equilibria of low
variance assemblages critical for developing an internally consistent
thermodynamic database, and exchange and net transport equilibria critical for
extending the database for Ag2S-Cu2S-ZnS-FeS-As2S3-Sb2S3-S sulfosalts/sulfides
to Mn-, Hg-, Cd-, and Bi-bearing supersystems. Theoretical studies will: (1)
obtain an accurate model for the Gibbs energy of (Zn,Fe)S sphalerites with
explicit provisions for strong short-range order on its metallic sublattice
utilizing a variation of Kikuchi's cluster variation techniques, (2) an
internally consistent thermodynamic database for Ag2S-Cu2S-ZnS-FeS-As2S3-Sb2S3-S
sulfosalts/sulfides from analysis of published calorimetric, crystallographic,
and phase equilibrium studies, thermochemical models previously developed by the
PI, results of activity and of net transport experiments, (3) thermodynamic
mixing properties of Mn-, Cd-, and Hg-bearing tetrahedrite-tennantites and
sphalerites, and (4) non-idealities, activity-composition relations, and
standard state properties associated with the Bi-Sb substitutions in stibnite-
bismuthinite (Sb,Bi)2S3 solutions and coexisting sulfosalts Ag(Sb,Bi)S2
myargyrite-matildites, Cu(Sb,Bi)S2 chalcostibite-emplectites, and Pb(Sb,Bi)2S4
zinkenite-bonchevites. The petrologic applications include the recalibration of
sphalerite cosmobarometer to obtain formation pressures, masses and dimensions
of asteroids parental to IAB, IIIAB and IIICD iron meteorites and for
application to terrestrial sulfide deposits, and application of composite
thermochemical database to develop ore deposition models for zoned polymetallic
base metal deposits involving multicomponent sulfosalts in southern India and
Peru.
