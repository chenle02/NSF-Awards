This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award. The research will
develop speech recognition and auditory scene analysis models that are
probability distributions whose parameters can be trained from data and whose
internal structures are capable of abstracting the perceptual response patterns
of human listeners. Two broad research questions will be explored: (1) Can
probability models representing the pitch, envelope, and timing of an acoustic
source be computed and integrated in a tractable manner? (2) What are the
theoretical and empirical requirements for the partitioning, training, and
recognition scoring of probability models for landmark-based acoustic features?
Landmarks in speech are identifiable points in the flow of sound over time, such
as consonant releases and closures, vowel centers, and glide extrema. The
educational component of this project includes significant curriculum
development at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and a strong
investment in the mentoring of undergraduate and graduate research
trainees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award recognizes and supports the
early career-development activities of a teacher-scholar who is likely to become
an academic leader of the twenty-first century. This is fundamental scientific
research in acoustics and computer science, but it addresses the very practical
problem that computers are still far worse at recognizing speech than human
beings are. Speech recognition technology has already become an important
industry, but it will become far more important in the future as mobile
computing and computer-mediated communications make it necessary for millions of
people to control machines verbally rather than by means of keyboards. The
educational component of this work will train graduate students to be teachers
and communicators, as well as researchers, thus preparing them to help build the
base of personnel needed in this exciting, growing area.&lt;br/&gt;
