In response to a Project Solicitation, the Consortium for Scientific Computing,
representing the John von Neumann Center, submitted a proposal to conduct a
Supercomputer Summer Institute in 1987. This proposal and eight others were
evaluated by a review panel. CSC proposes a three-week Institute for 25 senior
researchers during the period July 27 to August 14. Attendees will provide some
of their own support and will be given an early account on the JVNC Cyber 205
supercomputers for familiarization. Terminals and high-power workstations of
various kinds will be available as well as consulting help and office space.
Lectures in various aspects of advanced computing will be given, with special
emphasis on fluid and plasma dynamics, computational chemistry, and computer
science and supercomputing. 25 additional researchers located near the JVNC will
attend at no extra cost. Reviewers found both good and bad aspects to this
proposal. Students will be expected to have a degree of expertise on
supercomputing prior to attending; the focus will be more on the scientific
aspects of computational science than on the nuts and bolts of supercomputer
usage. With the right attendees, this could be an exciting intellectual forum.
The panel was concerned with the high cost of the proposal, and the need for
support personnel and terminals for so many (50) attendees. The Principle
Investigator has agreed that the 25 local attendees will attend lectures only,
with no supercomputer access or some machines to the JVNC. Finally, the PI's
salary will not be charged to the grant. These savings have reduced the cost
from $163,000 to a more reasonable $63,000. In addition, an undergraduate
component of $7000 has been proposed. The Centers Program recommends support of
a Supercomputer Summer Institute at the John von Neumann Center in the amount of
$70,000.
