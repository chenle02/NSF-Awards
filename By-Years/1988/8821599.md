Although revolutions and revolutionary behavior have been the focus of
attention of numerous social science disciplines, very little attention has been
paid to the motivations for individuals to become involved in a revolutionary
movement. This Doctoral Dissertation research addresses this topic by examining
the circumstances which prompted women to participate in the Zimbabwean
liberation war between 1972 - 1979. The changing composition of the rural areas
of Zimbabwe brought by economic and political dimensions of colonial rule
created the circumstances which led to women's participation in the war. While
most analyses of peasant politics focus on class and exclude age and gender,
this study will incorporate insights from political science, history, and
anthropology in order to highlight the social construction of gender. This
approach raises questions about how gender is intertwined with class and age;
and how different configurations of these factors across geographic area and
time affected peasant women's responses to the liberation struggle. This project
involves a case study of a rural district in northeasten Zimbabwe and utilizes
survey research methods and indepth interviews. The results of this research
promise to be of interest to researchers in several disciplines who are
concerned with rural-based revolutionary movements.
