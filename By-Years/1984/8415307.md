Optical nonlinearity and bistability are active research areas both
experimentally and theoretically. This research concerns the theoretical
understanding of the stationary and dynamical behavior of various solid-state
materials. While the effort concentrates on the multiple quantum well structures
of GsAsGaA1As, because of the wealth of experimental results two other compounds
are also being analyzed. Because the research is leading to large computer
simulations, access to advanced scientific computers is being authorized.
