Interfacial phenomena lie at the heart of many technical, medical and
scientific applications. Any system involving surfaces is not completely
understood with out knowing the nature of adsorbing species and the extent of
coverage, whether the surface active species were purposely added or found as
contaminants. For fundamental studies in adsorption to have an impact on
practical applications (such as strategic metals recovery), new quantitative
methods and new qualitative insights are required. Spectroscopy can
simultaneously provide quantitative and qualitative determinations, i.e.,
speciation. the adsorption processes on oxide at solid-liquid interfaces will be
studied by Infrared (IR) and UV-Visible (UV-Vis) Attenerated total Reflection
(ATR) spectroscopy which can provide molecular-level information. Particular
emphasis will be placed on identification of the species and conditions present
at such interfaces. It is planned to examine a) how the reactivity of adsorbed
species may be different in the interfacial region, due to excess concentration,
steric constraints, and anisotropic polarity; and b) how changes in
conformation, tautomerization, oligomerization, or ionization equilibria will
affect kinetics.
