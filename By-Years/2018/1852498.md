Critical applications are emerging in the interdisciplinary field of Data
Science in the area of community health analytics. Yet despite the high
potential impacts of data science on the community, not enough opportunities for
undergraduate education and research immersion in data science are available.
Supporting communities in the digital age rests on comprehensive data science
solutions from machine learning, artificial intelligence to big data
technologies. With an interdisciplinary team, participants in this project
improve the state-of-art in data science to solve real-world problems from
personalized health and well-being, public health by mental health screening
tools, early alerts for infection spread, to environmental and transportation
improvements. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site helps to
sustain our community's innovation-based economy by training students to acquire
data science skills. This site provides access to data science research
opportunities otherwise extremely limited. A goal is to boost retention of
female students and underrepresented groups such as African Americans in
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professions.
Undergraduate research programs are known to improve students' interpersonal
communication, professional networking, and research skills that they would not
encounter in the classroom, and to encourage students to find their interest and
seriously consider graduate studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is a
continuation of an REU site in Data Science successfully operated by the
Worcester Polytechnic Institute Data Science program since 2016. This new site
offers 30 additional students from a range of geographically diverse locations
around the country access to vibrant scientific research projects and
undergraduate mentorship. Comprehensive support for the REU participants, from
close research mentoring to professional development, are provided. Students
have the opportunity to network with professionals from the data science
advisory board, alumni and industrial partners from companies and organizations
as diverse as Google, MathWorks, and MITRE Corporation, thereby encouraging them
to pursue Data Science in their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
