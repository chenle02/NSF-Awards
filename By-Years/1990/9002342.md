This award supports the research on multivariable hyper- geometric series of
Professor Robert Gustafson of Texas A &amp; M University. Dr. Gustafson has
proposed to develop the theory of hypergeometric series that are very well
poised on semisimple Lie algebras, as well as the corresponding theory of beta
and Mellin- Barnes integrals on compact Lie groups and the associated Lie
algebras. In addition, he plans to relate this theory to the families of
orthogonal polynomials associated to root systems, recently defined by
Macdonald. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is
one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally,
combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical
activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone
beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical
techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had
an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in
communications and information technology.
