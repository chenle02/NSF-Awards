The primary visual cortex of the brain, also known as area V1, is the first
major cortical target for the nerve fibers in the visual pathway. It has been
considered classically to function mainly for analyzing features in the visual
world considered to be "local" characteristics of pieces of objects, such as
spatial orientations and locally contrasting parts of objects. We now know that
it also is involved in much more complex perceptual tasks such as completion of
contours around whole objects, for context-dependent perception of visual
attributes, and for some of the experience-dependent changes in perceptual
performance. Some of these properties are mediated by recently discovered long-
range lateral connections of single cells within V1. This project utilizes new
methods of optical imaging of neural activity, along with physiology,
pharmacology and anatomy, to study responses to visual stimuli containing
multiple local elements that form more "global" visual features. Functional
properties of these horizontal interactions intrinsic to V1 are compared to the
contributions of feedback connections to and from higher order cortical areas,
particularly examining the relative roles of facilitation and inhibition.
Results from this work will lead to a better understanding of the early stages
of visual processing in visual cortex, and also be relevant to understanding how
cortical architecture relates to cortical function in general, which remains a
fundamental issue in understanding the brain itself.
