Air-sea exchange is a critical process in climate, as the oceans are a both a
source and a sink for CO2, CH4, and trace species important in atmospheric
chemistry and radiative transfer. This project aims to enhance our understanding
of small-scale physics relevant for air-sea gas exchange, and to develop an
effective method for using infrared imagery to estimate air-sea gas fluxes.

The objective of the research is to: 1. Determine if surface divergence models
for water-side rate-controlled air-water transfer processes provide an accurate
physical description of gas exchange. 2. Determine if infrared images of the
water surface can provide distributions of the temporal and depth scales
required to use surface divergence models for predicting air-water gas fluxes.

This research will use laboratory gas transfer data collected in a synthetic jet
array tank (SJAT) to test a surface divergence model for air-water transfer of
gas and heat. In particular, it will investigate the ability of the model to
predict the measured air-water transfer velocities and their dependence on
molecular diffusivity under conditions where the exchange process is forced by
either mechanically generated turbulence or wind stress. Near-surface
concentration fluctuations of carbon dioxide (CO2) will be measured using a
laser-induced fluorescence technique and bulk gas fluxes will be measured for
helium, sulfur hexafluoride, methane, and CO2. Infrared imagery will be used to
characterize near-surface temperature fluctuations.

Broader Impacts The project will promote teaching, training, and learning
through such things as mentoring a post-doctoral research associate,
participation of a summer undergraduate research intern, hands-on demonstrations
on air-water gas transfer at venues such as the Earth Observations from Space
Weekend at the Pacific Science Center, participation of the researchers in
various outreach activities ranging from seminars on global climate change to
laboratory tours and recruitment of summer research interns from
underrepresented groups.
