This project will provide a summer residential enrichment experience for thirty
gifted and high potential high school juniors in the central part of the United
States. The four-week project has three components: (1) a two week workshop
concentrating on career exploration, science and engineering ethics, and
research methodology and engineering design; (2) a one week engineering or
science research project involvement; and (3) one week of "shadowing" a
scientist or engineer in industry. The workshop component will use a variety of
instructional methods, including case studies and problem solving sessions.
During the research component, students will apply what they learned in the
workshop to a research setting as part of a research team. Students will
complement the career exploration portion of the workshop with their industrial
shadowing component. Both the research and shadowing experiences will emphasize
the importance of ethics in science and engineering. Academic year follow-up
activities include monthly activities to be completed by students in their
schools, and two group meetings at WSU. Minority and women students will be
recruited for this project though existing high school minority and gifted
student programs offered by the College of Engineering.
