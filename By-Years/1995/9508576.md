9508576 Cumberbatch The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
mathematical sciences. The University-Industry Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
provide two years of support for recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the
mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing to the future
vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will
work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry. The
postdoctoral fellow will work under the dipection of Ellis Cumberbatch at
Claremont Graduate School and Tuncer Cebeci at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. This
research will bring together computational fluid dynamics and computational
structural dynamics so that fluid-structural interaction problems can be
analyzed. The results will be applied to a wing/fuselage/nacelle/pylon
configuration corresponding to a wide-body MD-12 airplane with a supercritical
wing.
