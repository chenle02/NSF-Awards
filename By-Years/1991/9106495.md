A combination of approaches, viz. theoretical and observa- tional analyses and
numerical modeling, are to be used to study a variety of tropical mechanisms and
circulation patterns, particu- larly in the Asia-Pacific Monsoon regions. These
will include large areas of heating of the tropical atmosphere, easterly waves
and tropical cyclones, the globe-girdling narrow belt of equatorial deep and
intense convective activity (the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ), and
the summer monsoon trough over East Asia (Mei- Yu). The purpose is to understand
the dynamic and thermodynamic structure of these flow systems, which range from
the global to the regional and individual-storm scales. This understanding
requires elucidation of the interactions/inter-relationships among them. These
linkages are shaped by the underlying mechanisms which transfer absorbed solar
energy from the tropical upper oceans to the atmosphere and ultimately convert
it to the energy of motion systems of various sizes and lifetimes. The regions
to be studied supply a substantial fraction of the energy put into the planetary
atmosphere, and thus exert a major influence on global weather and short and
long term global climate.
