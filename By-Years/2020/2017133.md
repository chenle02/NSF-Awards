The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of new green and non-toxic technologies for water treatment.
Applications include providing safe tap water and improved water for systems
operating at safe levels but with undesirable aesthetics. The technology can
impact industrial and household applications.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of solvents to fabricate
separations membranes for several applications, including drinking water
treatment and face mask fabrication. The technology uses two environmentally
friendly solvents, methyl 5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate
("PolarClean") and gamma-valerolactone (GVL), as co-solvents to fabricate
polysulfone (PSf) ultrafiltration membranes. Based on calculated solubility
values, PolarClean/GVL co-solvents showed better performance together than
independently. Previous viscosity studies suggest strong performance of this
system. The proposed project will explore translation of this technology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
