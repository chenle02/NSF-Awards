0220554 Abstract Christian Wagner The objective of this faculty's work from
Oakland University is to increase the number of college students entering the
high technology workforce in computer science, engineering, mathematics, and
statistics. Their efforts involve contact with the area high schools and the
city administration of Detroit. Their plan is to give special consideration to
students in the Automotive 2020 program. Their efforts focus on the Detroit
Public system. There are crucial curriculum modifications at Oakland University
designed to support the students in this plan. All the students in this program
will have a required interdisciplinary course focusing on professionalism and
ethics in technology. A student completing his/her program in 4 years instead of
5 or 6 is a goal of the plan. Finally their student population is involved with
summer internships with local industries on various research projects. Oakland
University has partnerships with a number of universities. These are University
of South Carolina, Anna University (India), Hanover University (Germany) and
Cariff University (Wales). Oakland University has partnerships with a list of
technology and industrial firms.
