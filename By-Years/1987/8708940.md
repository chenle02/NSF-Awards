Technical Summary: The objectives of this project are: (1) Identify the sources
of error in existing group-contribution models for the thermodynamic properties
used in chemical process design; (2) develop, using interaction-site potentials,
rigorous group-interaction models for predicting the excess properties of
aqueous solutions of hydrocarbons and organics when experimental data are
unavailable; (3) employ N, p, T Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations
to determine the fundamental limitations on the predictive capability of group-
interaction and group-contribution models; (4) use simulations and molecular
perturbation theory to study the effect of the choice of interaction-sites on
predictions for excess properties and to develop a table of group-interaction
parameters from experimental mixture data; (5) suggest how simplified
engineering equations for activity coefficients can be modified to account for
the influence of intramolecular structure on both the combinatorial and residual
contributions; (6) develop a practical design tool by combining the rigorous
molecular theory with the engineering correlative approach, in particular, use
the new group-interaction models to predict significant physical properties,
such as infinite dilution activity coefficients, at the temperatures of
interest; and (7) use simple activity coefficient models to predict the
composition dependence.
