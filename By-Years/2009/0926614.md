Most of the world?s great earthquakes are shallow events that occur in
association with the tectonic process of subduction. Damage and loss of life
result not only from the earthquakes themselves, but from the tsunamis they
commonly spawn as well. Regions in the U.S. that will certainly experience such
events at some time in the future are Alaska and Cascadia (the coastal region
extending from northern California to southern Canada). Estimating the ground
motions that can be expected from these earthquakes is obviously a matter of
considerable importance. Such estimates depend on the width of the subduction
megathrust that produces great earthquakes ? the seismogenic zone; the nearer
the landward edge of this zone is to the coast, the longer and stronger the
ground motion is likely to be. Deep reflection seismic methods may provide a
means of locating the downdip limit of the seismogenic zone. This project will
test this method by acquiring marine multichannel (MCS) and wide angle
reflection data over a large portion of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. The
reflection mapping results can then be compared with the earthquake rupture
limit defined by existing earthquake aftershock and geodetic data.
