The Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE)
is holding a series of professional development workshops over a four-year
period in undergraduate statistics education. These workshops are accompanied by
corresponding follow-up activities. The purpose of the workshops and activities
is to help colleges and universities develop statistics courses and programs,
and to have a significant impact on infusing the most current successful
innovations in statistical methods, practice, and pedagogy into the teaching of
statistics. The three target groups are: teachers of undergraduate introductory
statistics courses; mathematics and mathematics education faculty who teach
statistics content to pre-service K-12 mathematics teachers; and departments and
statisticians who have or potentially can have undergraduate statistics
programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
