A compilation of paleomagnetic data suggests that the Southern Alaska
superterrane moved with a northerly component of motion of some 24 cm/yr during
the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. The best hypothesis, accounting for this
unusually rapid motion, is to invoke northward transport of this superterrane on
the Kula plate. The purpose of this study is to verify the high terrane
velocity, refine this velocity estimate and test the hypothesis of a Kula plate
transport mechanisms. If the Southern Alaska superterrane was transported on the
Kula plate, a 21 degree - 27 degree shift in paleolatitude is predicted for the
Late Cretaceous. A detailed paleomagnetic study of Upper Cretaceous rocks should
easily demonstrate this latitudinal shift by showing a 30 degree -41 degree
change in mean paleomagnetic inclination over the sampled section. In addition,
a pronounced kink (at 82-85 m. y.) in the apparent polar wander path constructed
from the paleomagnetic data should record the birth of the Kula plate and
subsequent rapid northward motion.
