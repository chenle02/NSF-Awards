A group of faculty at Michigan State University and the University of Tulsa has
organized a pre-competitive, multi-university, multi-disciplinary NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) in the area of
Multiphase Transport Phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Center research will focus
on the further development, evaluation, and deployment of next generation
multiphase models for turbulent and non-turbulent flows as well as computational
methods for rapid design and analysis of process and equipment for a wide range
of applications encountered in, but not limited to, the automotive, chemical,
and petrochemical industries. Funds will be used to promote long-term
synergistic partnerships among industrial members and academic research groups
at the two universities. Specific problem-oriented research projects will be
identified in collaboration with industrial members of the Center.&lt;br/&gt;
