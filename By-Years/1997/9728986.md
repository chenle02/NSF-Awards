9728986 Seidman The principal thrust of this study is examination of segregation
at well-characterized coherent and semicoherent heterophase interfaces developed
in the same alloy system. Specimen preparation is achieved primarily via solid-
state decomposition reactions or internal nitridation to produce precipitates
with atomically clean interfaces. This is followed by low-temperature treatments
to induce segregation of ternary or quaternary elements. Below a critical
diameter the precipitates are coherent, while above this diameter they are
semicoherent, allowing a study of segregation at either coherent or semicoherent
interfaces. The highest resolution techniques available, including atom- probe
field-ion and three-dimensional atom-probe microscopies, high-resolution and
scanning transmission electron microscopies, and spatially resolved electron-
energy-loss spectroscopy, are employed. Among the systems investigated, which
include both interfaces of technological interest and `model' interfaces, are
Al/Al3Sc (Mg) (an aerospace structural alloy); Al(Cu) and Cu(Sn or In)
(interconnects for integrated circuits); Fe/Mo, Fe/Mo(V); alpha-Fe/molybdenum
nitride (Sn); Au/Ni, with and without segregants. Theoretical modeling of
heterophase interfaces addresses the interface structure and the properties of
the segregants at the interfaces. The modeling employs ab initio density
functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations,
and continuum elasticity theory. %%% Segregating atoms play a crucial role in
the physical and mechanical properties of technologically significant
heterophase metallic interfaces. Segregants are important for tailoring
interfacial properties, e.g., by the introduction of selected microalloying
solutes in controlled quantities. Control of the critical transition diameter
from coherent to semicoherent precipitates is technologically important, as it
determines the stability of the microstructure of the m aterial. ***
