This is a study of the rare gas isotope systematics of residual xenoliths from
three islands within the Samoan hotspot chain. The xenoliths occur in post-
erosional volcanics and are apparently the residual mantle remaining after
extraction of the basaltic lava which formed the Samoan shield volcanoes. Rare
gases (He, Ne, Ar and Xe) will be used to determine the evolution of the mantle
source for Samoa and the processes occurring during melt formation and
segregation. Rare gas analysis of individual mineral phases, plus interstitial
glass will employ a variety of extraction techniques, including vacuum crushing,
fusion by conventional step-heating, and laser fusion of individual mineral
grains. The Samoan xenoliths are extremely gas-rich, and accurate He and Ar
isotopic analysis can be obtained on single crystals of &lt; 5 mg. The study
should lead to a better understanding of the processes involved in the
extraction of volatiles from mantle peridotites during the formation of a
basaltic melt.
