This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support the travel of three students from
the United States and one from developing countries to the First School/Workshop
on Instrumentation in Elementary Particle Physics. The School will be held at
the new Center for Instrumentation, located at the University of Michoacan San
Nicolas de Hidalgo (UMSNH) in Morelia, Mexico. Organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff
of the U. of Wisconsin, Madison, together with Professor Luis Villasenor,
Director of the Institute of Physics at UMSNH, the goal of this first workshop
is to encourage instrumentation skills by developing country physicists at their
home institutions, and to foster collaboration between U.S. physicists at an
early stage in their careers with their peers from elsewhere in the world. It is
expected that this first workshop will lead to a regular series of
workshops/schools at the new Center for Instrumentation, which will provide
researchers from the hemisphere with instrumentation skills useful for particle,
nuclear, medical and other subdisciplines of physics
