This CPATH project revitalizes undergraduate computing education at Florida A&M
University through integrating studio-based learning and active learning
experiences into the early experiences of undergraduate computing students.
Through collaboration with Auburn University, the project adapts the methodology
of a successful CPATH project to the Florida A&M setting. The approach is
inspired by a human-language learning metaphor in which humans learn their
natural language by a series of active immersions before writing. Active
learning should increase the engagement of students and develop a community of
learners that provides the social and academic support for students to turn the
challenges of computer science into learning experiences instead of barriers.

The intellectual merit of the project lies in the strong conceptual basis for
the project and the collaborative team of investigators. The project includes
significant evaluation and dissemination that should provide significant
insights into the learning of computing to the discipline of computing
education.

The broader impacts include the production of approaches and artifacts that can
be used widely. The project impacts two communities, computer science majors and
non-majors taking a software-centric literacy course. This should broaden the
pool of students in the undergraduate computing pipeline and the resulting
computing workforce within the nation.
