Previous research has resulted in the development of a family of iron- manganese
catalysts for production of light olefins from carbon monoxide and hydrogen that
is far superior in both activity and selectivity to any previously-known
catalysts. In this extension of the work, the new catalysts will be better
characterized and an attempt made to identify the factors responsible for their
superior performance. Related bimetallic systems will also be investigated. This
work represents a major advance in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and has great
commercial potential.
