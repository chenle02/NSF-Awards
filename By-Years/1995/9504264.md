9504264 Connolly Connolly will be studying obstructions to topological rigidity
such as those provided by the group UNIL of S. Cappell. He will be investigating
the problem of fitting a boundary onto a stratified space with a tame end. He
will also be using these to attack the Quinn Rigidity Conjecture (ICM, 1986). He
wishes to take the new "continuous control" K-theory and use it to create a
Surgery theory which is adapted to these problems. He is also including
4-dimensional smooth manifolds in his project (Gauge Theory). In this project
Connolly will be attempting to show that: Arithmetic Groups are Topologically
Rigid. In less epigrammatic terms, this means that the extreme symmetry
exhibited by some of the fundamental geometries of nature (these geometries are
called Locally Symmetric Spaces by mathematicians and physicists), should
eventually be shown to be based on purely topological properties of their
fundamental groups. In highly oversimplified terms, it means that anything that
is vaguely like a torus (or a Klein bottle) should be topologically equivalent
to a torus (or a Klein bottle). An example of a topological equivalence is given
by a circle and ellipse; they are not congruent figures in the sense of
Euclidean geometry, but they are topologically equivalent, because a little
stretching of the one produces the other. ***
