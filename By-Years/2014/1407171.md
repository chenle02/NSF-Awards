Specialization for life underground has evolved multiple times in mammals as a
strategy for foraging, avoiding predators, storing food and nesting; however,
researchers know very little about burrowing behaviors because it is difficult
to visualize animals as they move through soil. This project focuses on
burrowing behavior in Eastern moles because they are specialized diggers that
have evolved extreme morphological specializations for powerful burrowing and
exhibit two different burrowing behaviors in response to the type of soil they
encounter. This study will investigate how and why Eastern moles change their
burrowing behavior in response to soils of different compactness. This work will
connect morphological specializations for burrowing to burrowing performance,
and set the stage for broader investigations of the convergent evolution of
burrowing in other species of moles and other mammals. In addition, this
research will promote education by providing animations of burrowing useful in
teaching evolution and comparative anatomy at all academic levels, benefit the
general public by providing crucial kinematic data for improving the design of
mole-inspired robots that are used in urban search and rescue, engage the public
by recruiting local community members to help identify mole habitats, and
lastly, will support the researchers continued participation in the Science Cafe
program, which hosts accessible scientific talks for the public that spotlight
local scientists.

In this study, the researchers intend to extend upon preliminary data by asking
how burrowing behavior changes in response to soils that differ in compactness
and how changes in behavior balance the trade-off between force, speed and the
trajectory of force used to displace soils. The researchers hypothesize that
lateral stroke and scraping movements involve different joints and are used with
different frequencies and that lateral strokes are more efficient in displacing
loose soil while scraping movements are most efficient in displacing compact
soil. Bi-planar x-ray video and force plates will be used to visualize and
quantify how Eastern moles change the movements of their limbs in order to meet
the challenges of moving through soft and compact substrates. Force and video
data will be made available to the public through Dryad.org and the XMA portal
(http://xmaportal.org/webportal/), respectively.
