A Banach space is a collection of objects called vectors which can be added
together or multiplied by numbers to form other vectors. There is a concept of
distance between vectors which is analogous to the familiar notion of distance
between the points in the three-dimensional world which we inhabit.
Mathematicians have found that Banach spaces provide the correct framework in
which to formulate major areas of mathematics such as Functional Analysis and
Partial Differential Equations. Banach spaces are also used by scientists and
engineers to model problems in applied areas such as fluid mechanics, signals
processing, and finance. There are an infinite variety of Banach spaces which
can be distinguished from each other by geometrical properties such as
smoothness and convexity. An individual vector belonging to a Banach space is
identified by an infinite string of numbers called coefficients. An important
problem in data compression is to find a procedure, sometimes called a greedy
algorithm, for selecting the most significant coefficients so that the resulting
finite string vector is a short distance from, and hence a good approximation
to, the original vector.

This project will investigate fundamental problems in Banach space theory and
applications to other areas. The methods employed will be those of Functional
Analysis together with new insights specific to each particular problem. These
problems include the Banach Rotation Problem which asks whether Hilbert space is
the only separable infinite-dimensional Banach space with a transitive isometry
group. The new notion of asymptotic midpoint convexity will also be
investigated. An open question to be solved is whether the isomorphic version of
this property is equivalent to the known concept of asymptotic uniform
convexity. Another problem to be solved in the area of nonlinear Banach space
theory is whether $p$-convexity is preserved under uniform quotient mappings.
Applications to other areas to be investigated include open questions on the
convergence of greedy algorithms in Banach spaces, including the important case
of Lebesgue spaces, and related open questions on unconditionality and greedy
convergence, including the open problems of the existence of quasi-greedy
sequences in arbitrary Banach spaces and of the boundedness of the Elton
constants. Other applications include improved explicit constructions of
matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property, and coefficient quantization
properties for bases and redundant systems.
