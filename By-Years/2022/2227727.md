The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential
development of objective technology that could be utilized to potentially detect
different responses to visual stimuli to model the functions of the optic nerve.
This technology may allow physicians to triage patients who present with
headaches or vision losses without the potential need for expensive and often
additional tests only available at advanced ophthalmic clinics. This technology
could also be used to monitor and predict the progression of a patient’s
disease, as it may reduce the intervals with which patients are currently seen
by eye specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
potential development of a vision screening test to evaluate relative afferent
pupillary defects in a head-mounted display that may be affordable, convenient
to use, and capable of generating an assessment of the health of the optic
nerve. The core technology in the product is a tool that may allow physicians to
be more involved with the care of their patients by performing routine eye exams
remotely and at shorter time intervals. Non-specialists (principal care doctors
or emergency doctors) may be among the primary customers of this product.
Doctors could be able to make quick, reliable, and highly accurate measurements
of afferent responses to visual stimuli to monitor the health of the optic nerve
and its function, especially when their patient presents sudden and
unexplainable vision changes or headaches. In addition, the product may be able
to perform baseline tests to predict the patient’s responses to treatment or the
progression potential of their disease which could help reduce the number of
clinic visits and increase doctors’ productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
