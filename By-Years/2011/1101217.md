This award will support participation by U.S. students and junior researchers
the conference CiE 2011 (Models of Computation in Context), to be held in
June/July of 2011 in Sofia, Bulgaria. This meeting is organized by the research
group in Mathematical Logic at Sofia university in conjunction with the
Association for Computability in Europe, a community of more than 700
researchers, including about 100 members from the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference series promotes the
development of computability-related science, ranging over mathematics, computer
science, and applications in various natural and engineering sciences such as
physics and biology. The conference scope also includes the study of philosophy
and history of computing as it relates to questions of computability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computability has played a crucial role in mathematics and
computer science, leading to the discovery, understanding and classification of
decidable/undecidable problems and paving the way for the modern computer era.
Recent new paradigms of computation, based on biological and physical models,
address in a radically new way questions of efficiency and challenge assumptions
about the so-called Turing barrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CiE 2011 will bring
context, multidisciplinary perspective and computability-theoretic focus to a
wide spectrum of disciplines -- including computer science, mathematics and
logic, physics and quantum theory, biology and informatics, linguistics and
philosophy, neuroscience and learning theory.
