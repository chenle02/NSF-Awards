The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new technology for blind and
visually-impaired (BVI) people to use touchscreen devices and explore
quantitative data. Currently there are no commercial solutions for the 285
million BVI individuals and their support networks to access text and graphical
materials. The proposed project will advance software that converts graphical
and text information into a form for BVI users to explore and utilize. This will
enable greater education and work opportunities as well as greater
independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II effort continues development of a novel touchscreen-based
information access software offering multisensory representations of both text
and graphical information in digital media. Information can be efficiently
conveyed with graphical tools such as bar graphs, but BVI users cannot exploit
these methods to synthesize data. This project develops the artificial
intelligence (AI) framework to support automatic conversion of visual graphics
into multisensory graphics and demonstrates its
utility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
