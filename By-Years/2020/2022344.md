The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of
an award for summer internship support. HACU, a national, non-profit
organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship
opportunities via the organizationâ€™s National Hispanic Internship Program
(HNIP). Through HNIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and
Puerto Rico receive quality internship assignments through various federal
government agencies. Participants are exposed to various career options in the
Federal sector that serve to help students make informed decisions and solidify
career objectives. By partnering with the Federal government, HACU has
successfully placed over 11,000 students in internships since HNIP commenced in
1992. To continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation,
a participating government agency, will offer challenging assignments that will
broaden the exposure of students pursuing careers in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM). Internships create a unique opportunity for
the Foundation to actively participate in strengthening the human capital
infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education and developing a
competitive STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
