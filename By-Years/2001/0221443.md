0221443&lt;br/&gt;Lees&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a workshop
in Chapel Hill North Carolina to address problems associated with the subduction
of the Nazca Plate below South America along the Northern Andes. The purpose of
the workshop is to develop a science plan and to organize and coordinate the
diverse research objectives of the NASCAR (Northern Andes Subduction of the
Carnegie Ridge) initiative. The NASCAR initiative involves researchers from a
broad range of earth science (Geology, Geophysics, Geochemistry, Geodynamics)
and coordination of goals and field logistics is critical to the success of the
program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
