The goal of the theory group involved in this proposal is to understand how the
world works at the smallest distances. The group seeks to understand the nature
of the space we live in, of the matter and energy that move through it, of the
vacuum that fills it, of its history since the beginning of the universe and its
fate in the far future, and of the dimensions that might lurk outside it. Soon
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva will begin operating and
looking for various new particles predicted by generalization of the standard
model of particle physics. The group seeks to deepen our understanding of the
new physics we may begin to see at the LHC. The questions that will be addressed
in the group's research include the following:&lt;br/&gt;. Can we see
"unparticles" at the LHC? Research by this group has suggested that the LHC
could produce an exotic state of matter that cannot be described in terms
of&lt;br/&gt;particles with definite mass hence "unparticles." This is provides
a new example of a&lt;br/&gt;very unconventional phenomenon that might appear at
the LHC.&lt;br/&gt;. Can we use topology to understand Black Holes? The group
has recently &lt;br/&gt;shown that purely topological aspects of string theory
can capture highly non-trivial&lt;br/&gt;quantum gravitational corrections to
the black hole entropy. The implications of this to better understanding entropy
and holography will be pursued in the future research program.&lt;br/&gt;. Can
we find the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in String theory? The group
will pursue new directions that may lead to a very natural embedding of the MSSM
in string theory. The broader implications of this research is the hope of
better understanding the fundamental nature of space and time at the shortest
and largest distances. The group is active in broadening participation of
underrepresented groups which include both women and African Americans in
cutting-edge research&lt;br/&gt;
