One hundred and forty-seven countries have outlawed genocide since it became a
crime of international law, and hundreds of thousands of people -- from Cambodia
to Rwanda to Bosnia-Herzegovina -- have been found guilty of genocide, served
prison sentences, and returned home. While much research has assessed why
genocide happens, no studies have examined how those convicted of genocidal
crimes reenter and reintegrate into their communities upon completion of their
sentences. Accordingly, this study will interview people convicted of genocidal
crimes in Rwanda and will follow them for a two-year period as they leave prison
and return home to their communities. Understanding how genocides end and how
peace is subsequently produced and reinforced is vital to preventing additional
violence. Findings will be widely disseminated to academic, governmental, and
public audiences, such as the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention
of Genocide, the International Center for Transitional Justice, and United
Nations Peacekeeping Operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project asks two
main questions to contribute to literature on prisoner reentry and
reintegration, genocide, and disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration
processes in the aftermath of mass violence. First, how do we theorize the
process of prisoner reentry and reintegration in the context of genocide?
Second, what obstacles do convicted genocidaires face as they reenter society,
and what are the individual, family, community, and state-level factors that are
associated with successful reintegration? To address these questions, the
project will employ a case study of Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands of
civilians were convicted of participating in the 1994 genocide and are now
returning home. The PI will interview 250 of these convicted genocidaires at
four times throughout their reintegration processes. This longitudinal design
will enable an examination of the processes of peacebuilding at local levels
over time.
