Abstract CTS-0217595 &lt;br/&gt; Funds are requested for the purchase of a
stereoscopic particle imaging (SPIV) system for flow measurements. Proposed
projects will include flow in a stirred tank reactor, resuspension of bottom
sediments, flows in micro-channels, and stratified flows. These projects will be
carried out by four members of faculty in Civil and Environmental Engineering,
Mechanical Engineering and Architecture Engineering Departments.&lt;br/&gt;
