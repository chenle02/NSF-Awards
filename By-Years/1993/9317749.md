We are requesting funds from the National Science Foundation to purchase an
Analytical Ultracentrifuge. This is to replace our 26-year old Model E
ultracentrifuge, which is nearly impossible to maintain and for which certain
accessories are no longer produced. Also, the XL-A has greatly increased
sensitivity as a result of a very much shorter optical path length and advances
in component quality over the last quarter century. Furthermore, its output is
now fully computer processed, enabling far more rapid and reliable processing of
results. With this instrument, we will be able to obtain molecular weights,
effective partial specific volumes and sedimentation constants. These pieces of
information will allow us to determine molecular architecture of multisubunit
assemblies, more reliably estimate compositions of macromolecular aggregates
which are complex and which may interact extensively with solvent constituents,
and obtain quantitative parameters of protein association reactions.
Specifically, the instrument will be used to obtain "true" (in a thermodynamic
sense) molecular weights of cellulase components, metalloenzymes and redox
proteins from hyperthermophiles, explore subunit interactions in human
choriogonadotropin, measure hydration and salt binding in yeast enolase and
measure complex formation between reactants in the bacterial luciferase
reaction.
