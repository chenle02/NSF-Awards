The subject of this workshop is the application of algebraic geometry to
information theory with emphasis on the theory of error correcting codes. The
workshop is to be held at the University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, during the
time period January 7-12. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together
experts from both areas to learn and discuss the possible new avenues of further
progress. Information theory, especially the theory of error correcting codes,
is used to detect and correct errors in the electronic transmission of data.
This theory is important for high speed communications and computer systems. The
aim of this workshop is to apply the mathematical theory of algebraic geometry
to the information theory.
