1428025 Keen-Zebert

This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant provides partial support
for the acquisition of a Ge detector based gamma ray spectroscopy system that
will support the full on-campus capability for optically stimulated and
thermoluminescence geochronology. The gamma ray spectrometer will be used to
assess the annual dose rate of radiation experienced by mineral phases to be
dated that are resultant of radioactive decay of nuclides contained within the
minerals. The equipment will allow for the complete capacity at the University
of Nevada Desert Research Institute (DRI) to ascertain the burial time of
mineral phases since last exposure to sunlight or temperatures in excess of 300
degrees C with application to Quaternary geoscience and archaeological
investigations. The equipment builds on the OSL/TL reader infrastructure already
housed at DRI which allows for measurement of equivalent dose, or the energy
accumulated in crystal lattice defects as a result of radioactive active decay
of trace nuclides in the mineral that are proportional to the length of time
since last exposure to sunlight or high temperatures, which releases this
crystal lattice trapped energy. OSL/TL dates are calculated based on the ratio
of equivalent dose to dose rate.

OSL and TL dating capabilities at DRI will support fundamental research on
landscape evolution and process geomorphology in both fluvial and aeolian
landscapes over a range of environments from the humid mid-continent to the
Great Basin of North America, mountainous regions of India and New Zealand, and
river systems in the interior of South Africa. The facility will serve outside
users and their students and the PI is actively engaged in local K-12 outreach
activities that teaches students about natural occurring radioactivity and its
useful applications.
