This proof-of-concept NSF CCLI-EMD project, "Integrating Ethics into the
Database Curriculum," is developing a set of privacy modules to be used by
computer science educators in the introductory database theory and design
course. Building on the recommendations of ACM/IEEE Curricula 91 and 2001 and
the NSF-funded ImpactCS project, this project helps to sensitize undergraduate
computer science students to database privacy issues by providing computer
science educators with the resources and support necessary for the inclusion of
ethics coverage in their database classes.

The instructional material under development includes classroom exercises,
student assignments and examination questions that apply ethical theory to the
analysis and resolution of privacy issues that arise naturally at each stage in
the database development process. The modules are to be introduced
systematically throughout the course, providing students with the experience of
addressing privacy concerns throughout the development of a database.
