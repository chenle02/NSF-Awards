This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Dr. Jennifer Arp is "Engineering Optimized Source-Sink
Interaction in Maize and Sorghum." The host institution for the fellowship is
the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr.
Douglas Allen.

As the world population increases, crop breeding efforts will need to increase
yields while minimizing detrimental impacts on the environment. In particular,
understanding how plants acquire and use nitrogen can help determine proper
fertilizer use. Plant nitrogen demands vary in different parts of the plant
based on whether the tissue is photosynthetic and acting as a source of carbon,
as in leaves, or is a sink for carbon and nitrogen as in seeds. Plants with
optimized source-sink relationships could break the inverse correlation between
yield and protein content that is well-documented over the last 50 years.
Training objectives for the Fellow include synthetic biology, genetic
engineering, and metabolic flux analysis. Broader impacts include promoting
plant science through outreach programs with the St. Louis Girl Scouts, ASPB
Planting Science, and Future Trek STEM Careers.

This project will use a genetic approach in maize, sorghum, and the C4 model
species Setaria viridis to investigate the interrelationship between asparagine
cycling in nitrogen metabolism and the C4 photosynthetic pathway in leaves and
seeds of cereals in order to modulate source and sink relationships. New
expression patterns for genes involved in asparagine cycling and C4
photosynthesis will be engineered to optimize expression throughout the plant
life cycle and break the protein and yield tradeoff. Results from this research
will be disseminated at conferences and through publications. Data generated
will be submitted to data repositories: Panzea (http://www.panzea.org), NCBI-SRA
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), NCBI-GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo),
and Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (http://www.maizegdb.org).
