This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
innovative technologies for smart infrastructure, and in particular coordinated
wireless sensors and control devices. The first smart wireless devices will
focus on measurement and control of environmental parameters such as temperature
and humidity, although these devices are archetypes for a wider range of smart
components. The behavior of the smart devices will be coordinated by the MetaOS,
a software system developed by Ambient Computing, Inc. to provide traditional
operating system functions to fully distributed collections of smart computing
and networking devices. The system will demonstrate the technical and commercial
feasibility of connected and coordinated smart devices. The early commercial
applications of the proposed work will focus on improvement of energy
consumption and personalization of environmental parameters. Existing means of
addressing these problems are highly proprietary, difficult and expensive to
deploy, and have limited flexibility. The proposed more advanced systems will
lead to significant reduction in overall energy consumption while providing
personal comfort and financial benefits to consumers.

This effort aims to build some of the missing and necessary pieces for smart
environments, specifically, small and low-cost wireless devices with integrated
computing capabilities.
