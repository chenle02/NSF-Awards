This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will
study the interaction of adsorbed molecules with heterogeneous catalysts, using
solid-state deuterium NMR methods at high magnetic fields. Deuterium and various
deuterated hydrocarbon molecules will be studied, adsorbed primarily on alumina
supported platinum and rhodium catalysts. Questions concerning hydride exchange,
C-H bond activation, charge transfer between adsorbate and substrate, and
adsorbate mobility will be addressed. In addition, very high field low
temperature studies of quadrupolar coupling constants will be carried out. An
attempt will also be made to obtain an NMR spectrum for a monolayer adsorbed on
a single crystal metal surface. %%% An understanding of the structure and
reactivity of molecules adsorbed on the surface of catalytic materials is
essential to the design and use of heterogeneous catalytic processes. This
research program will develop powerful nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic
methods for the determination of the structure of adsorbed molecules on
catalytic surfaces. This structural information will allow the design and
understanding of catalytic systems crucial to the chemical industry and to
pollution abatement technologies.
