The Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) in collaboration with Southern Light
Rail and Southern Crossroads (SLR/SoX) provides advanced networking services for
the research and education (R&amp;E) communities across the Southeastern United
States. This project extends advanced network services and provides
cyberinfrastructure (Cl) access, training and support to researchers and
educators from four historically Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), three of
them from the Atlanta University Center Consortium, plus Tuskegee
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GT works with these MSIs to implement robust
and secure 10 or 100 gigabit networking that enable and support the
computational research and education at these institutions. Furthermore, GT and
SoX are establishing and engaging in outreach activities and are identifying
other researchers in these institutions who are interested in accessing Cl
resources and training. The project addresses MSIâ€™s networking and Cl needs and
enhances their connectivity. By enabling, supporting, and promoting connectivity
and computational research at MSIs, this project has a transformative impact on
these institutions' research and education activities campus-wide. It
strengthens the research ecosystem and network of expertise in the Southeastern
states and expands the range of institutions involved in computational
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The network connectivity facilitated by this
project increases research training and workforce development for students at
four partner Minority Serving institutions and lays the groundwork for project
expansion to other MSIs. Additionally, the project team continues training and
fostering mentoring opportunities for a diverse group of students, including
women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
