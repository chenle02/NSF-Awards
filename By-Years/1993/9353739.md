The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) proposes a
project that will enhance the planning andevaluation of the National Science
Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
This program was established to work with states that compete least effectively
for federal academic R&D funds. The objective of the AAAS project is to develop
a clearer understanding of the concept of state "competitiveness" in research by
developing criteria for assessing competitiveness over time. The project will be
organized (1) to review and examine state EPSCoR programs in terms of objectives
and subsequent accomplishments; (2) to examine across disciplines the
assumptions underlying "competitiveness" of university research; and (3) to
conduct a workshop of scholars to define and build consensus around
"competitiveness" criteria relative to the objectives of EPSCoR. An advisory
committee constituted by the AAAS Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public
Policy will oversee the study. Reports will be prepared summarizing the results
of the study. ***
