This is a proposal to create two professional development courses, with both on-
site and online versions to build capacity of middle school teachers of
mathematics and special educators and their administrators to enable students
with disabilities to be successful mathematics learners. During the five years
of the project, one eight-session course for classroom teachers and their
special education colleagues and a six-session course for school administrators
will be developed, tested and disseminated. Training Institutes for course
facilitators will be developed to prepare cohorts of facilitators to teach these
courses locally and nationally and to receive ongoing support through a
Facilitaros online learning community. A dissemination strategy is planned with
an anticipated target of 6,000 teachers and an initial cadre of 172
facilitators.
