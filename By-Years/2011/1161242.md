The research objective of this project is to develop numerical tools for solving
polynomial and tensor optimization models arising from engineering applications
such as design of radar waveforms in signal processing, information extraction
in magnetic resonance imaging, and gene expression data analysis in
bioinformatics. An integrated approach for polynomial and tensor optimization
models will be studied and tested in this project. The key components of the
integrated approach include relaxation techniques, approximations to optimal
solutions, randomized sampling techniques utilizing known structure of the
model, and disciplined local improvements of feasible solutions. Numerical tools
to be developed under the framework of the integrated approach will be
investigated experimentally and validated using the data obtained from practical
engineering applications including signal processing and bioinformatics.
Performance of the algorithms developed from the project will be measured and
compared against currently existing benchmarks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the results of this research will enhance the effectiveness of
methods for solving nonlinear optimization models where polynomial functions are
found in the objective as well as in the constraints. In particular, such
algorithms will lead to substantial practical improvements in radar waveform
design, image processing, and data co-clustering analysis. As polynomial
functions are known to be pervasive in the context of engineering design and
decision making, success of the project will lead to broad societal benefits.
Moreover, the proposed research addresses fundamental challenges in optimization
theory, because most current research has not gone beyond polynomial models of
degree 2; thus, results extending the theory beyond these models would
constitute a major advance on the theory side, as well.
