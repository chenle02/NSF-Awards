0968984 University of Oklahoma; Floyd Grant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University
of Oklahoma (UO) seeks to join the existing I/UCRC "Electromagnetic
Compatibility" consisting of the Missouri University of Science and Technology
(MST), the University of Houston (UH). And Clemson University (CU).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is an essential
feature of virtually all high speed digital electronic assistants and home
entertainment centers to essential control and information processing systems.
EMC is the ability of these electronic systems to function reliably without
causing interference to other electronic systems, being overly sensitive to weak
signals generated by other electronic systems, and generating signals in one
part of the system interfering with the operation of another part of the same
system. The proposed research projects include both experimental and simulations
and also include projects which aim to improve predictive and modeling
capabilities so that future generations of devices can be designed to more
effectively deal with this problem. The projects range from broad and ambitious
(e.g. EMI effects on humans) to targeted and near-term (e.g. the design of a
less "noisy" inverter for hybrid vehicles). The University of Oklahoma operated
an NSF IUCRC Wireless EMC for several years and virtue of this experience, the
University can contribute significantly to the management of the proposed
site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will encourage collaboration
amongst the four institutions, and is committed to providing a skilled and
diverse workforce in the area of EMC as required by industry. The research will
expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects to the
industry. The close collaboration with various industry partners will help
establish a strong research base to enable development of consumer electronics
and control and information systems. The proposing institution has the
Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) designed for the recruitment and
retention of students who contribute to the diversity of the College of
Engineering. The program provides services primarily for under-represented
minority population.
