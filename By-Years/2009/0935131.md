This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education
research award to the University of Florida in collaboration with Virginia
Commonwealth University will employ researchers to develop interactive virtual
reality modules with haptic feedback to improve learning and promote interest in
nanotechnology concepts. The modules will be used to support active learning for
both normally sighted and visually impaired students with low-cost haptics
providing feedback that does not rely on vision. Nanotechnology and nano-scale
physics concepts are difficult for students to grasp, and use of these modules
by high school students will increase interest in this important and rapidly
evolving area of technology. In addition, the assessment of the benefit of
haptic feedback in virtual reality simulation modules can lead to new
understanding of the educational use of feedback that is not vision-based. This
will have application to a broad range of the engineering curriculum and can
increase the number of successful engineering students who are well prepared for
engineering jobs.&lt;br/&gt;
