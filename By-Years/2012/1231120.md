Intellectual Merit:

This RAPID proposal seeks funding to complete the work originally proposed. Due
to ship problems, the first of 2 cruises scheduled as part of this project could
not be completed. The RAPID funding is required to allow the PI's to be ready to
deploy the HOT profiler as soon as a cruise can be fit into the ship schedule.

Broader Impacts:

The HOT profiler project seeks to substantially improve our ability to observe
the ocean on long time scales at locations not serviced by cabled observatories
by supplying power and bandwidth to profiling vehicles. If successful, the
technology will greatly benefit both of these groups. Additionally, the
scientific knowledge gained will likely improve our understanding of the
seasonal cycles of internal waves, which are of great import to the improvement
of circulation models.
