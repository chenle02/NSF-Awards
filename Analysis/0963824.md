This award supports US participants of Thematic Program: Dynamics and Transport
in Disordered Systems at the Fields Institute in Toronto, Canada in the Spring
2011.

It has been known for a long time that heat flows from hot bodies to cold ones,
that differences in voltages generate currents. Even if macroscopically this is
well studied in many contexts, it is not easy to understand these phenomena at
the microscopic level.

Several mathematical models have been proposed for the phenomena. Some of them
based on probability theory and some of them are classical and deterministic. In
recent times, there has been very good progress in both classes of models the
mathematical phenomena discovered are eerily similar sometimes. The main goal of
the special semester is to bring together specialists in both types of models to
find common ground and to make sure that there are students who get trained in
both points of view.
