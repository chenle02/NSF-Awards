A large earthquake imposes a sudden change of stress in the earth's mantle. Its
post-earthquake deformation is observed by GPS at the earth's surface. This
project is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the material
behavior of the deep earth in response to large earthquakes. The results can be
implemented in computer simulations for better understanding of the earthquake
cycle and its role in the spatial and temporal distribution of the earthquake
hazard.

The material behavior of the earth's mantle when it is subjected to a sudden
change of stress by a large earthquake will be examined through laboratory rock
deformation experiments. The theoretical model extrapolates from the laboratory
to the earth in numerical simulations. This research will enhance understanding
of post-seismic relaxation and postglacial rebound. More generally it will
enhance understanding of the earthquake cycle, one of the most important
problems in geophysics. The research also has potential applications in
materials science.
