The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to facilitate faster and safer transactions
for manufactured goods. Current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions are
based on relatively old technology. The proposed project develops a new platform
for the supply chain to operate efficiently using blockchain technology for a
scalable, secure, and interoperable solution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SBIR
Phase I project addresses three principal technical challenges of a blockchain
commercial solution, namely scalability, security and interoperability. For
scalability, the core technical requirement is to provision, maintain and
periodically rotate hierarchical and deterministic public/ private key-pairs
used to sign transactions and usable by non-technical users. Security research
will focus on providing each organization/ participant the ability to provide
granular access to field-level data to others in the ecosystem. The project will
use an Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol to encrypt each field with
its own key-pair. The system will use a blockchain smart contract to provide
trustable decryption based on access control policies set by the submitter. The
projectâ€™s interoperability will focus on the ability to share data between
different blockchain networks as well as between traditional ERP systems and a
blockchain network by developing an interoperability protocol that securely
transfers the record and ensures that double-spend type attacks are not
possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
