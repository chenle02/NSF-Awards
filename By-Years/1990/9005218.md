Measurements of the density field of the ocean are necessary to understand the
circulation. One of the principal instruments for this measurement is a
Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (CTD) device. This proposal will provide an
upgrade of the sensor suites on instruments to be used in the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE). In addition, a van for measurement of oxygen and
salinity in situ will be constructed.
