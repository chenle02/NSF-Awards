In the United States there exists an abundance of unreinforced masonry
buildings. During past earthquakes, such buildings have suffered major
structural damage and often collapsed. Current repair and rehabilitation
techniques for unreinforced masonry buildings are generally costly and disturb
the occupancy and architectural features of the buildings. This research project
will examine a repair and rehabilitation technique that eliminates the above-
noted problems. In the research, unreinforoed brick masonry walls are
strengthened by coring or drilling holes through the center of the unreinforced
brick masonry walls followed by the placement of reinforcement in the drilled
hole, and filling the hole and adjoining voids with various types of grouts.
This research will concentrate on fullscale field tests to determine structural
and economic feasibility. The research will aid in future development of needed
technology in the rehabilitation and strengthening of both historical and non-
historical buildings against future seismic loads. The principal investigator is
highly qualified to conduct the research project and an award is recommended for
the first year of the two-year complete project. The institution provides
excellent support facilities.
