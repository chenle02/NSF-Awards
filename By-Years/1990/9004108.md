To study thermodynamic properties of multilayer films of various adsorbates on
uniform surfaces of graphite and other substrates. The technique, currently used
by them and by one group in Germany, combines ellipsometric measurement of
coverage with vapor pressure measurement by conventional capacitance manometers
or by modified manometers operating at low temperature adjacent to the sample.
Among the phenomena which will be studied are surface roughening and surface
melting behavior of krypton, xenon, and methane films on graphite, including
detailed examination of the layer critical points and inverse critical points
which occur in fourth and higher layers, at least for krypton; exploration of
the phase diagrams of neon and hydrogen in the same thickness range; and wetting
and layering behavior of other interesting systems, such as carbon monoxide on
graphite. Other substrates will be examined besides graphite, including TiS2,
TaSe2, and other layered dichalcogenides, cleaved surfaces of ionic crystals
such as LiF and MgO, and gold films evaporated on mica. A number of improvements
in the experimental apparatus will allow better precision in coverage and
pressure measurement.
