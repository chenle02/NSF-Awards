This award provides funding for the National Academy of Sciences' Government
University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the Federal
Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among
university research administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives.
FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 154 academic institutions,
10 federal agencies and professional societies, offers a forum for members to
improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline and
standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the current
phase, FDP will develop and expand upon targeted demonstrations that address and
provide guidance for several activities including: the implementation of
streamlined data collection efforts associated with the Digital Accountability
and Transparency Act; uniform guidance implementation planning on research terms
and conditions and procurement standards to maintain effective stewardship of
federal research; and the expansion of the Financial Conflict of Interest
Clearinghouse that allows recipients of federal funds to verify compliance as
part of the award process. FDP continues to improve the relationship between
federal agencies and the research community, ensuring the efficiency and
integrity of STEM research and education administration.
