This project is awarded under the Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond
competition, with support by multiple Directorates and Divisions at the National
Science Foundation as well as by the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative of the
Semiconductor Research Corporation.

The proposed research will explore the interactions between candidate QCA
molecules bound on a surface and employ the well-developed theory of electron
transfer in mixed-valence compounds, focusing it on the particular problems
presented by the molecular QCA paradigm. An interdisciplinary team of scientists
and engineers from the University of Notre Dame will use a combination of
synthesis, theory, measurement, and device architecture engineering to study
classes of mixed-valence compounds designed for QCA operation. Candidate
molecules will be synthesized and deposited on surfaces, shifts in the charge
distribution of one molecule due the interaction with neighboring molecules will
be imaged directly, and methods for querying and integrating these molecular
systems into electronic devices will be developed. The interdisciplinary nature
of this work will impact the education and training of students at all levels.
Outreach efforts will include introducing scanning microscopy to the K12
classroom and continuing to develop a MATLAB project to energize high school
science and math students by putting real programming power into their hands. At
the graduate level, the fusion of chemistry and electrical engineering cultures
will produce a broader perspective for students and overcomes disciplinary
linguistic and conceptual barriers.

Computing using molecules has the potential to generate ultrasmall devices that
use little power; however, many significant technical hurdles must be overcome
to realize the benefits of molecular level computing. This work will further our
understanding how molecules can communicate via their charges, which could lead
to computer circuits that do not use the flow of electrical current to transmit
information. Such work could impact industries that use microprocessors in their
products, including computer, consumer electronics, automotive, etc.
