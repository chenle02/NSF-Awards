With this continuation of DMS-8716037, Dr. Stanley will explore problems in
Disabled Forcing, minimalizing the universe without constructing Zero-sharp, a
converse to Morley's Omitting Types Theorem, and Iterating Mathias Forcing
beyond Aleph-two. These are topics on the frontier of modern set theory, a
subject which underlies all of mathematics.
