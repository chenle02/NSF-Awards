This is a joint project between Brown and Rutgers to build a large microphone
array with associated processors for beam forming. Applications are direction
finding, echo cancellation, and speaker differentiation in telconference
systems, multimedia educational systems, and large conference centers. Groups of
microphones share microphone modules that perform A/D conversion and low-level
processing. The microphone modules are linked over a high speed serial network
(possibly optical) to a multiprocessors signal processing system for the higher
level processing. The resulting system is being evaluated in an experimental
teleconferencing facility.
