This project has two main parts. The first concerns automorphism groups of
right-angled Artin groups. Right-angled Artin groups are finitely presented
groups whose only relators are commutators. They may be viewed as interpolating
between free groups and free abelian groups. Thus, their (outer) automorphism
groups interpolate between Out(F_n) and GL(n,Z) and provide a context for
understanding the similarities and differences between these groups. The goal is
to generalize techniques used in the study of automorphism groups of free groups
---such as the construction of a contractible "outer space" with a proper
Out(F_n) action - and use these techniques to study properties of automorphism
groups of arbitrary right-angled Artin groups. The second part of the project
concerns more general Artin groups associated to infinite Coxeter groups. The
project will address a number of questions regarding the coarse geometry of
these groups.

Geometric group theory may be viewed as the study of symmetry groups of
geometric objects. A particularly rich class of geometric objects are cubical
complexes with nice local structure. These complexes serve as models for a
variety of problems in robotics and have applications to other areas of
mathematics. Right-angled Artin groups arise as groups of symmetries of certain
cubical complexes. Moreover, the groups themselves have interesting symmetries
known as automorphisms. This project will investigate properties of these
groups, their automorphisms and the associated geometries. In addition to right-
angled Artin groups, the project will study the large scale geometry of more
general Artin groups. Some Artin groups, such as braid groups, are well
understood and have important applications to topology, cryptography, and other
fields. Other Artin groups are much more mysterious and some of the most
fundamental problems in group theory, such as the "word" and "conjugacy"
problems, remain unanswered for these groups. By studying their large scale
geometry, the project aims to gain insight into some of these more mysterious
groups.
