This planned center site at Oklahoma State University for the I/UCRC for
Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (CEMC) intends to leverage the institution?s
scholarly contributions that have been of value to aerospace, naval, and space
design applications that have focused on the ability of an external
electromagnetic threat to couple current onto wire structures carrying command,
control, and communication data. Recent work has been focused on establishing
methodologies useful to industry related to enhancing shielding effectiveness of
cable assemblies and gasket materials, determining effective absorptive
materials to reduce overall available power in an enclosed environment, and the
application of absorbing materials to reduce emissions from enclosures
containing apertures. The planned site intends to leverage its measurement
expertise associated with reverberation chamber applications to complement the
CEMC's current capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electromagnetic system
interference is an increasingly pronounced problem in electronic systems as
system frequencies continue to escalate. The planned site?s personnel have
already been successfully engaged in providing translational research to
industry (including the use of graduate level internships). The use of
"engineering ambassadors" will provide an energetic connection to the
applications of engineering that will be making a difference in the lives of
people. A Student Leadership Council (SLC) will provide ongoing formative
assessment of the program through regular SWOT analysis of student related
outcomes connected with industry (internship quality) and research (mentoring
quality). OSU is in a unique position to reach Native American communities in
conjunction with Project Lead The Way and the strong CareerTech Programs
throughout the state.
