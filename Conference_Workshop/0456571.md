STATISTICS ABSTRACT

The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) helps to illuminate
promising research directions for the statistical sciences by defining and
launching workshops and studies of importance to the community. Recent
activities have included broadly cross-disciplinary workshops on Statistical
Analysis of Massive Streams of Data (December, 2002) and on Visualization of
Uncertain Information (March, 2005). The former of these led to a special issue
of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (December 2003) and to
a workshop proceedings published by the National Academy Press. Planned
activities include a cross-disciplinary workshop on Statistics on Networks,
planned for September 2005, and oversight of a study to establish an improved
research foundation for fingerprint analysis. Because of its position within the
National Academies, CATS is well situated to strengthen connections between the
statistical sciences and other fields. It has ready access to the leaders in all
fields of science, engineering, education, and medicine. This access gives CATS
a unique capability for assembling leaders in a variety of fields, including
statistics, to address technical and policy issues in a cross-disciplinary
fashion. In addition, the Committee's position within the National Academies
gives it access to leaders in federal agencies and public policy, which enables
CATS to identify emerging issues of national importance that require input from
the statistical sciences community.
