While many of the alongshore coastal ocean currents are explicable in term of
wind forcing, the cross-shelf currents have posed problems for theoretical
models. This proposal will consider the fluctuations in the alongshore wind
field at small scales as forcing elements in the generation of cross-shelf
currents. Wind data from aircraft used in the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment
(CODE) will be analyzed for the wavenumber- frequency content, and the output
used to force a linear ocean of the coastal regime.
