This award provides partial support for the 27th Texas Symposium on Relativistic
Astrophysics, to be held in Dallas, December 8-13, 2013. This meeting will mark
50 years since the original Texas Symposium in 1963.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Texas Symposium has gained a reputation as one of the major international
meetings on topics in relativistic astrophysics, including the physics of
compact objects, high-energy cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei, the early
universe, and observational and theoretical cosmology. The awarded funds cover
registration, travel, lodging, and subsistence expenses to support 10 graduate
students to attend the meeting. Broader impacts of this funding are clear in
terms of support for the careers of young astronomers and physicists.
