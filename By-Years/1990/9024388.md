The Second United States-Asia Conference on Engineering for Mitigating Natural
Hazards Damage (EMNHD-2) will take place on June 17- 22, 1991, in Jakarta,
Indonesia. The focus will be on extreme winds, floods, earthquakes, landslides,
other ground failures, and volcanoes. The EMNHD-2 will be one of the many
activities taking place during the International Decade for Natural Disasters
Reduction (IDNDR) that emphasizes the need for national, regional and
international efforts for diminishing life and economic losses, and for
mitigating the damages produced by natural extreme events. Keynote speeches,
lectures, papers and panel discussions will highlight regional and local natural
hazards problems, engineering research and practice addressing these problems,
research needs, transfer of knowledge, and possible cooperative projects between
the United States and the Asian Countries. Proceedings of the conference will be
published and the final report with recommendations for research will be
distributed to researchers, practicing engineers, planners and appropriate
government agencies.
