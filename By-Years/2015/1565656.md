The development of low-latency, energy-efficient, and reconfigurable on-chip
wireless interconnect infrastructure has the potential for reducing the carbon
footprint of electronic systems. This research will be integrated with the
graduate-level courses on design of VLSI and Nano-electronic devices to be
taught by the PI at her institution. The dissemination of open-source software
generated in this research via nano-HUB facilities at Purdue University is
expected to provide significant impact by serving a broad community of students,
researchers, and engineers. Further, the software generated in this research
will be used for in-class projects and assignments providing students with a
unique opportunity to learn about Exascale computing without abstracting the
fundamentals of device physics. Undergraduate students will be advised through
the undergraduate summer research program at NYU School of Engineering.
Participation of the PI in National Center for Women in Technology program at
NYU will facilitate involvement of underrepresented minorities in the research
program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this research is to
make major advances in the design and optimization of on-chip communications
infrastructure by exploiting plasma waves in graphene to implement waveguides
and nanoantennas. By marrying disparate technologies - CMOS electronics and
graphene plasmonics - a new heterogeneous architecture is proposed to enable
terahertz-band communication between several computing elements within a range
of 10 cm. The project will develop an analytical model-based benchmarked design
space exploration of the interconnect architecture covering implementation
aspects (area and energy) and network-level consideration (number of cores and
network architecture). Overall, this research will drive connectivity to the
full potential of scaled CMOS by improving communication bottleneck in a
heterogeneous computing environment.
