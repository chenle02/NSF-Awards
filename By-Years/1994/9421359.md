Visual behavior is performed by an animal in its environment using its eyes,
its brain, and locomotion. The horseshoe crab, Limulus, provides a powerfully
simple system for investigating vision. Although there is a classic quantitative
model for how the lateral compound eye of Limulus works, the neural coding that
mediates visual behavior remains unknown. This project investigates the role of
identifiable single nerve cells in processing visual information that lead to
simple motor behavior, such as turning toward an interesting target. Behavioral
studies in the field allow estimates of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and
object recognition. Novel methods for nerve cell recording in the natural
underwater environment allow alalysis of optic nerve responses during behavior
to see what information might be carried to the brain. Intracellular recording
of identifiable nerve cells in the brain during visual activity allows analysis
of how the brain processes information coming from the eye. Results from this
remarkably integrative study will clarify how sensory signals relate to
behavior. Findings will have an impact not only on visual neuroscience and
neuroethology, but also on computational neural modeling, evolutionary and
comparative biology, and robotics.
