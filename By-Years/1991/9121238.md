Many of the processes that shape the development of the nervous system and
behavior occur during the early neonatal period. Dr. Moore has shown that
perineal stimulation provided by mothers to their developing offspring during
the course of a specific maternal behavioral pattern, has long-term consequences
on their adult behavior. She has also shown that this maternal stimulation also
produces changes in the central nervous system. Using an exciting and highly
innovative approach, Dr. Moore will investigate how interactions between
environmental stimulation and the hormones produced by the developing young work
jointly to produce the enduring changes in the both central nervous system and
behavior. She will concentrate on a sexually dimorphic nucleus in the lumbar
region of the spinal cord. Using state-of- the-art anatomical techniques, Dr.
Moore will investigate the role that cell death plays in regulating the observed
differences in neuron number following variations in maternal stimulation. By
systematically varying the mother-infant interactions in ways similar to those
experienced naturally by the offspring, the effect that early stimulation has on
individual differences within males and females, and sex differences can be
examined. At present, little is known about the role of sensory input in
development of sexual dimorphisms. Her systematic focus on external stimulation
and normal sensory input is an excellent opportunity to weave functional,
anatomical, and developmental questions togethers in a meaningful and mutually
useful way. The outcome is likely to redefine our ideas about the sexual
differentiation process than is now currently being accepted.
