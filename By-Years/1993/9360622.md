9360622 Webb Innova Labs proposes to extend photonic band gap materials fro the
microwave frequency band into the millimeter wave frequency band. We have
identified potential new practical fabrication techniques for making these
material with photonic band gap near 100 Ghz. the materials would embody a
hierarchical structure consisting of a high index of refraction composite with
fine microstructure on the scale of microns which is fabricated into a coarser
structure having a periodic variation of index of refraction on the scale of a
millimeter. The project is to investigate these fabrication techniques and t
characterize the electromagnetic properties of the resultant materials. Photonic
band gap materials have been shown to have extraordinary properties for
applications in the microwave range. If these properties can be extended to the
millimeter wave range, they would make possible millimeter wave systems in which
the designer has an unprecedented degree of control over radiation. It will
allow dielectric waveguide technology and MMIC techniques to be employed at
millimeter wave frequency. The result would be practical systems with greatly
improved capabilities and with the potential for having considerably lower MMW
component cost.
