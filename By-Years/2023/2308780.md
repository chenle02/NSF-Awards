This grant supports participation of graduate students and postdocs to attend
Midwest Numerical Analysis Day (MWNADay) at Iowa State University on April 29,
2023. MWNADay is a small regional conference held annually in the Midwest and it
typically attracts 60-80 participants. The intent of the conference series is to
offer a platform for computational and applied mathematicians in the Midwest to
gather and exchange research ideas. This conference will offer a forum for
researchers at all stages of their careers to exchange ideas in numerical
analysis, scientific computing, and related application areas with the goal of
growing regional interest in computational mathematics.

The focus of MWNADay 2023 at Iowa State will be on mathematical and
computational methods in the context of physical and data sciences. Topics of
interest include but are not limited to high-order numerical PDEs, interface
problems, numerical gradient flows, scientific machine learning, and optimal
control in data science. Three plenary talks will be given by leaders in the
field, and there will be mini-symposium sessions comprised of a mixture of talks
given by faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from
universities in the Midwest region. This meeting provides a unique opportunity
for in-depth technical discussions, exchange of ideas, and exploration of new
collaborations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
