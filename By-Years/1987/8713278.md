A high performance data collection system for x-ray crystallography has been
implemented, although it has not reached a final stage of development. Current
work will involve x-ray crystallographic data collection on intact gap
junctions, intact invertebrate muscle, collagen structure and relaxed and rigor
muscle, topomyosin, lysozyme, TMV protein disk aggregated, fibrinogen, polyoma
minichromosomes, and incoherent scattering from protein crystals. In addition,
the equipment and experience used in building this tv detector will be used to
develop an area detector for synchrotron radiation, initially for use at
Brookhaven National Lab's National Syncrotron Light Source (NSLS). The detector
system will make possible a substantial improvement in the rate of data
collection and in the accuracy of the data. Consequently, this also extends the
range of experimental problems in structural biology that can be studied.
