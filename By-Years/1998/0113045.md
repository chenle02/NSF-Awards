This project will use new techniques from computational optimization to design
radiation therapy planning for cancer treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiation
therapy applies ionizing radiation to cancerous tissue, damaging the DNA and
interfering with the ability of the cancerous cells to grow and divide. This
also damages healthy cells, but they are more able to repair the damage and
return to normal function. The therapy planning problem is to specify the shapes
of the applied radiation beams, times of exposure, etc., to deliver a specified
dose to the tumor but not an excessive dose to the surrounding healthy tissue.
New medical devices allow much control over the characteristics of the
radiation, thus allowing much scope for the therapy planning. However, the full
potential of these devices to deliver optimal treatment plans has yet to be
realized due to the complexity of the treatment design process. By using
advanced modeling techniques, state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, and
implementations on parallel computing platforms this project will provide
radiation oncologists with important new computational tools for treatment
planning. These tools will be flexible enough to adapt to the varying priorities
of different planners and different patients and robust enough to give good
solutions to the most difficult planning problems. The project involves
collaboration between three researchers whose collective expertise encompasses
radiation oncology modeling, optimization algorithms, and parallel
implementations. It builds on previous collaborations of these researchers on
treatment planning and on NSF-funded work on algorithms for solving large
optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The institutions involved in the
project are the University of Wisconsin, the University of Maryland School of
Medicine, and the University of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
