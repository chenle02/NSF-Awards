The Smoky Cascade Geometry Conference will be held at the University of
Tennessee at Knoxville March 19--21, 2014. The conference will feature ten
plenary speakers with plenty of time between talks to encourage discussion and
the interchange of ideas. The key areas represented in the conference will be
Metric Geometry, Geometric Flows, Ricci Solitons, Minimal Submanifolds, and the
Geometry of Partial Differential Equations. The overlap between these areas
makes very real the possibility for cross-collaboration among the participants.

The Smoky Cascade Geometry Conference features important areas of geometry and
geometric analysis with leading researchers as speakers. The funding helps to
involve early-career mathematicians (including graduate students and postdocs).
Particular attention is paid to identifying and supporting women and other
members of underrepresented groups.
