During the past decade, the quantitative analysis of random processes has led
to dramatic advances in the design of efficient algorithms for fundamental
computation problems. The PI is continuing research on the application of these
ideas, as well as beginning to investigate new paradigms based on nonlinear and
cooperative processes. Specifically, the project focuses on the following
directions: (1) the analysis of mixing rates of Markov chains, with applications
to efficient algorithms for problems in statistical physics and combinatorics;
(2) the study of computational complexity of counting problems, and their
classification with respect to efficient approximability; Algorithmic
applications of nonlinear random processes, in particular quadratic dynamical
systems; (3) the theoretical and experimental study of general randomized search
heuristics in combinatorial optimization, including Metropolis algorithm,
simulated annealing, and cooperative processes.
