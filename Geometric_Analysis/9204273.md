The principal investigator will continue his study of problems in complex
differential geometry and functions of several complex variables. In particular
he will attempt to prove cohomology vanishing theorems under weak positivity
assumptions. He will use curvature methods, positive currents, estimates for the
d" operator, and some ideas from the work of Mok and Demailly. This award will
support research in the general area of differential geometry and global
analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between the
geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis
is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a space by
piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of mathematics
in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
