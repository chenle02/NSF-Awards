This award supports the mathematical research of Professor Chih-Han Sah of the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. Dr. Sah intends to continue his
investigations in topics con- nected with the classical problem on scissors
congruences as well as various related mathematical questions that have arisen
in such disparate fields as mathematical physics, number theory, and functional
analysis. This very interdisciplinary project connects physics with several of
the most active areas of modern mathematics: algebra, topology, functional
analysis. In one of the bridges that Dr. Sah has constructed between mathematics
and physics, he found that a space curve related to the 4-state self-dual chiral
Potts model in physics was precisely the degree-4 Fermat curve, of genus 3, long
known to mathematicians and extensively studied by algebraic geometers. In
another, related development, Dr. Sah has been active in explaining the
"polylogarithms", mysterious functions arising as integrals of logarithms, which
have been appearing both in physical and algebro-geometric research.
