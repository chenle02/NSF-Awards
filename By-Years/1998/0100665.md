This work is directed toward the goal of generating maximally entangled photonic
states, either by use of a four-wave mixing device operating in a nonlinear
regime or by coupling a pair of interferometers via a Kerr medium. Both methods
require media with large nonlinear susceptibilities. Methods will be developed
to generate such susceptibilities using the techniques of electromagnetically
induced transparency.
