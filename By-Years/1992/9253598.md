This project addresses the problem of high capacity PCN design in man-made
environments. The work is in two areas: (1) radio propagation measurements and
modeling, and (2) communication system design. The research combines these two
areas into a unified approach to system design. The research combines the
effects of local average channel characteristics with modulation, access,
coding, and user traffic patterns in order to study the effects of cellular
layouts and handoff methods for capacity improvements in high density wireless
PCNs. In view of the high cost of radio spectrum and the necessity to conserve
it, the work could provide research results and design tools which will be very
valuable to the U.S. communications industry through efficient spectrum usage
and automated wireless system deployment.
