This dissertation research project examines how law can affect marginalized
populations in a contemporary and historical context. The modern legal system
introduced by British colonial rule shaped state regulation of citizens' private
lives. Two current legal reform efforts in postcolonial India are examined in
this project: a campaign to repeal the anti-sodomy law and the campaign to
decriminalize adult prostitution. Using mixed methods in a three-phased design,
the investigator addresses multiple research questions. First, the project
utilizes archival analysis to examine how post-colonial legal regulation in
these areas was shaped by the colonial state. In the second portion of this
project, the co-PI uses an ethnographic comparative study of local and national
groups in New Delhi to understand how contemporary resistance takes form in both
legal reform movements. Third, the project draws on interviews and document
analysis to examine how globalization, concerns over AIDS, and human rights
regimes have shaped the development of these legal reforms in India. In this
respect, the insights from this research will inform transnational efforts to
bring global perspectives to these national legal issues.
