Two campaigns to measure transient tracers in the Atlantic Ocean (TTO/NAS and
TTO/Equatorial) were funded by NSF during the period from 1980 to 1985. A
complete data base for modelling this ocean basin would include a South Atlantic
Study to: 1.Determine CO2 transports and their influence on world climate,
2.Constrain models of major ocean currents in this area, and 3.Confirm an
observed 5-fold increase in the addition rate of new carbon to the thermocline.
Eight components of such a study (SAVE) will be performed by investigators from
LDGO, Princeton, University of Washington, WHOI, and SIO. The track record of
these scientists is well established by successful completion of previous
studies in the Equatorial and North Atlantic. They will provide physical and
chemical expertise which will be directed toward a cooperative effort to reach
the goals of the geochemical study. This component integrates historical
physical oceanographic data (GEOSECS, IGY, Discovery, and Meteor) with physical
and chemical data from SAVE to evaluate ventilation mechanisms in the South
Atlantic. Specifically, tracers will be used to complete the physical model of
interbasin exchange, thermocline ventilation, water mass formation, and water
mass spreading. The historical intercomparisons could have considerable
relevance to the earth's climatic cycles. Variability of water masses less
voluminous than deep water masses known to cause large decadal- scale changes in
Co2 levels will be assesed.
