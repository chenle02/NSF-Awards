Through this project, the Electrical Engineering (EE) Department establishes an
undergraduate fiber-optics communications and photonics laboratory. This new
facility is unique in the region. The communications area of the EE curriculum
is enhanced by this project. A total of 11 experiments are taught in a new one-
credit laboratory course, EE 472, concurrent with the Fiber Optic Communications
course, EE 471. The laboratory is also used for extra individual projects
assigned under Special Topics, EE 493, or under Senior Design Projects, EE
464/465. The objectives of this laboratory are to (1) optimize students'
learning by using a practical framework with hands-on, integrated, and inquiry
experiences to reinforce classroom theoretical concepts of basic photonics and
optical fibers; (2) provide students with practical skills needed for handling
and testing fiber optic systems; and (3) stimulate students' curiosity and
eagerness to pursue research and independent study in the area of fiber-optic
communications, photonics, and sensing. Interdepartmental ties also enable the
facility to be used by Engineering Physics and Electronics Engineering
Technology students. This facility also provides a resource that may have long-
term and far-reaching effects through outreach programs and workshops targeting
precollege students, school teachers, and the engineering community in the
vicinity. A laboratory manual, including a revised set of experiments and
necessary equipment, can be published and made available to interested faculty
in other institutions. A comprehensive assessment for the project will be
administered by a panel consisting of the Office of Academic Evaluation and
Assessment at the university, an external evaluator, and the faculty
participating in the project. *
