This project continues the scholarship fund that will enabled an additional 29
talented, low-income&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates per year to pursue baccalaureate
degrees at the University of Washington in the&lt;br/&gt;College of Engineering,
departments of Computer Science and Mathematics, and the Applied and
Computational Mathematical Science (ACMS) program. This scholarship fund
significantly expands the amount of financial assistance available to these
students, thereby increasing their retention, as well as their competitiveness
for permanent job placement or enrollment in graduate degree programs.
Scholarship recipients are linked with an existing integrated network of
successful student support programs where they receive advising, mentoring, and
professional development and leadership training. Another benefit, that cannot
be underestimated, is that it maximizes the existing integration between the
College of Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, and ACMS, as well as the
University of Washington's (UW) student support structure.&lt;br/&gt;
