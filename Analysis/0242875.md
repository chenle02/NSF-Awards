ABSTRACT PI: E. B. Saff/M. Neamtu Prop: 0242875

Conference `Advances in Constructive Approximation'

The proposal is primarily for the support of graduate students and recent
Ph.D.'s to participate in the international conference "Advances in Constructive
Approximation," which will be held May 14 -17, 2003 at Vanderbilt University.
The general theme of the meeting concerns the interactions of approximation
theory with several areas of classical, functional, and numerical analysis, with
applications to data fitting, computer-aided geometric design, wavelets and
signal processing. The conference is expected to attract a good mix of academic,
industrial, and government researchers.

The estimated attendance is about 120.
