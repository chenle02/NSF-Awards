Wireless sensor networks play an important role in a wide variety of
applications such as environment monitoring and battlefield surveillance. The
basic function of a wireless sensor network is to monitor its deployed region
and transport sensor data to certain designated nodes. Therefore, coverage,
capacity, and connectivity are three most fundamental properties for the
operation and performance of a wireless sensor network. A deep understanding of
these properties and their interrelationship is of great importance for the
network planning, algorithm design, and performance of wireless sensor
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to establish a strong
theoretical foundation and design practical protocols to provide high
performance coverage, capacity, and connectivity in wireless sensor networks.
Wireless sensor networks have many unique characteristics differing from other
wireless networks, including heterogeneous sensing, communication, and mobility
capabilities of sensor nodes, limited infrastructure and power supply, and
traffic pattern where data mainly flow from sensors to data sinks rather than
between peer nodes. This research integrates the concepts and techniques in
wireless communications, stochastic modeling, geometry, and combinatorial
optimizations to construct analytical models and develop practical
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes include: (i) fundamental
limits of the coverage, capacity, and connectivity under various network
scenarios; (ii) efficient algorithms for robust coverage, connectivity, and data
transportation; (iii) a test-bed to validate the analytical results and evaluate
the performance of algorithms via real experiments. This project also includes a
strong educational component that promotes teaching, training, and learning
through the active involvement of research students.
