9713983 Tubbesing This award provides partial support for the Sixth National
Conference on Earthquake Engineering. The conference will be held in Seattle,
Washington and will provide an opportunity for researchers and professional
practitioners, in all disciplines in the earthquake field, to come together and
exchange research results, design practices, and organizational and policy
perspectives on earthquake preparedness, mitigation and recovery. In addition,
future research needs in the field will also be discussed. The conference
proceedings provide a valuable repository of information critical to the
advancement of earthquake engineering. ***
