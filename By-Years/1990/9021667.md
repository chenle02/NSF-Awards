Auburn University requests support from NSF for connection of its campus network
to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United
States where Auburn University is located. SURAnet will provide operations
management and information services and it will give Auburn a high speed
connection (1.5 milliion bits per second) to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. Auburn University needs
greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers,
libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more
reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.
This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative
educational resources.***
