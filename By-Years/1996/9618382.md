The contributions of Isaac Newton to the development of modern science and its
methodology were epoch-making. Yet in his lifetime Newton chose to publish only
two books and a few papers. Only in the past generation, with the publication of
his Correspondence (1959-77) and Mathematical Papers (1967-81) has even a
portion of the vast quantity of his surviving papers have become known and
studied. These unpublished works have been of great historical value,
significantly enriching and modifying our interpretation of his life and works,
as well as that of early modern science. During his career Newton treated a
broad range of optical topics, including color and refraction, interference
phenomena, the construction of optical instruments, and the nature of light.
Because Newton's optical investigations are so fundamental to his own scientific
development, and to an understanding of the development of science, it has been
widely recognized than an edition of his optical papers is sorely needed. In
1984, with support from NSF, I published the first volume of a three-volume
edition of The Optical Papers of Isaac Newton, and the current project will
prepare volumes 2 and 3 for publication. ╣│%Á¢ /&gt;┤ / ▓??, ┴╝╣¥¥Á&gt; Â?╝ /
