The investigator intends to extend the investigation of the principal-agent
model in the context of oligopolistic firms that contract with retailers. The
retailers provide services to the (oligopolist) firm in the form of advertising,
maintenance or the provision of warranties. Because the firm cannot observe the
level of effort that the retailer expends, nor does the firm have direct access
to information about demand and retailing cost, the problems of moral hazard and
adverse selection can be studied. Some important questions in industrial
organization are studied in the context of this model. Specifically, it will
look at how the form of competition among retailers affects: the willingness of
the firms to delegate decisions to the retailers, the incentives of firms to
monitor their agents, the marketing efforts of agents and the profits of firms
and retailers. In the context of this same model, the issue of vertical
restraints are analyzed. The study will see how the restraint selected depends
upon the degree of differentiation among products, the relative efficiency of
retailers and firms, and the relative precision of the information known only to
the retailers.
