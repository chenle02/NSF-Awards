The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technologies to help deepen transportation electrification and
widely implement renewable clean energies for decarbonizing our society to
achieve sustainable prosperity. The success of this project will further
accelerate technology transfer, increase economic competitiveness, and help the
United States remain a leading position in new energies. There is an urgent
desire worldwide on transportation electrification. The key lies in a robust
high energy rechargeable battery to power electric vehicles, which is expected
to satisfy the following requirements: a high energy density for a driving range
of â‰¥300 miles, an affordable cost, reliable safety free of fires and explosions,
and a long lifetime. The proposed technology has the potential to meet all these
requirements and surpasses the current lithium-ion battery technologies.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of high-energy anode-free
lithium-metal batteries, which consists of an anode current collector and a
lithiated cathode. The high performance of this battery is based on the
innovative atomic and molecular layer deposition technology of the team for
novel functional nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are applied onto the anode
current collector and the lithiated cathode and result in remarkably improved
performance. Lithium-ion batteries have changed our lifestyles in many aspects
but are approaching their energy limit. They also suffer from some other issues
related to cost, lifetime, and safety. Consequently, all these drawbacks of
lithium-ion batteries have stimulated new battery concepts while anode-free
lithium-metal batteries are among the most compelling ones. Anode-free lithium-
metal batteries have the potential to maximize battery energy density, minimize
battery cost, and remarkably improve battery safety.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
