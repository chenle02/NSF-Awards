This is a study of Fischer-Tropsch-type reactions over iron nitride in the
presence of ammonia. It has recently been discovered that nitrides and amines
can be produced in this way, and this finding has commercial possibilities. The
present study looks at the mechanism of the process using a variety of advanced
surface characterization, bulk characterization, and kinetics techniques.
