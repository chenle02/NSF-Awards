9409413 Messner Friction modeling and friction compensation will be studied for
ball bearings operating in regimes of rapid lubrication and friction changes
which have not previously been investigated. Specifically addressed will be the
conditions where a disk drive actuator bearing is undergoing high frequency/low
amplitude oscillations in track-follow mode immediately after rapid deceleration
from the high angular velocities associated with the track-seek mode. Adaptive,
learning, and nonlinear controllers which incorporate the derived friction
models will be designed and tested. ***
