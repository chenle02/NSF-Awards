Abstract

Award: DMS-0911292 Principal Investigator: Gilbert Weinstein, Gregory Galloway

This award provides partial support for US participants in a session on
mathematical relativity within an international conference entitled Complex
Analysis and Dynamical Systems IV (CADS IV) to be held in Nahariya, Israel
during May 2009. This is the first time that the CADS conferences have included
a session this topic.

Einstein's equations have received renewed attention in recent years, in part
due to connections between them and other geometric partial differential
equations, and in part due to the emergence of powerful new techniques for such
equations. The special session aims to gather specialists and junior researchers
in mathematical relativity and geometric partial differential equations to
discuss the wealth of problems and recent results in these areas, in order to
promote new collaborations and further progress. The participation of graduate
students, junior PhDs, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is
particularly encouraged. For more information see the conference web site,
