Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) studies will be conducted on heavy water
swollen dense portions of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. The SANS results will
provide an indication for the existence or non-existeence of pores. If pores
indeed exist, it would be possible to calculate the sizes of the pores from the
SANS results. The SANS experiments will be conducted at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. Ultrathin membranes will be deposited on the quartz windows of the
SANS cells. Three membranes are to be studied: Osmonics membrane, cellulose
acetate, and charged membranes. The results of this study will provide new
information on the structures of RO membranes. The experimental technique can be
applied to other membranes.
