Abstract ATM-9613772 Flatau, Piotr University of California, San Diego Title:
Atmosphere and Ocean During TOGA-COARE: Study of Multiscale Interactions Between
Convective Systems, Ocean Temperature, and Intraseasonal Oscillations The
research supported by the grant helps in understanding what mechanisms controls
the movement of the eastward propagating tropical cloud clusters and
precipitation regions. These moving large scale precipitation patterns are some
of the pronounced signals in the tropical climate. They are associated with what
is know as Maden-Julien Oscillation (MJO) which is an intra seasonal oscillation
in the tropical circulation. The research proposed is to study the mutual
interaction between the equatorial convection and the Sea Surface Temperature
(SST) on intra-seasonal time scales. The hypothesis labeled ASCII to be tested
is that the SST gradients generated in response to atmospheric convection,
influence the propagation and development of cloud clusters associated with the
MJO.
