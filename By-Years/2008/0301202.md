This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "In-lab evolution of bacterial
metabolism: costs of specialization and the contribution of genetic exchange
between organisms." The evolutionary dynamics involved in the maintenance of
specialized bacterial metabolism and the role of horizontal gene transfer is
being examined using experimental evolution. Physiological analyses and attempts
to identify the beneficial mutations in the evolved strains are being performed
in order to gain insight into their increased fitness.
