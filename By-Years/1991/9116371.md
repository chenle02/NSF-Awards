This project is an airborne field investigation of the physical characteristics
of leads in arctic sea ice using a lidar and multi- frequency radiometers to
remotely probe the ice surface, as well as of the emission of dimethylsulfide
(DMS) from the ocean of its effects on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the
structure and radiative properties of arctic haze and stratus clouds. The
project will make use of an instrumented C-131 aircraft owned by the University
of Washington, and will be a component of the Arctic Lead Dynamics Experiment
(LEADEX) and the Arctic Gas and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP-IV). Although
leads, or areas of open water in the sea ice cover, account for only a few
percent of the Arctic Ocean, they play a major role in the turbulent transfer of
heat to the atmosphere, and in the transfer of volatile biogenic material. This
project will concentrate on the flux of oceanic DMS, which is an important
contributor to the atmospheric sulfur budget and, through oxidation to sulfur
dioxide and sulfates, is a primary source of cloud condensation nuclei in the
marine atmosphere. The principal investigator will also study the effect of DMS
on arctic haze, which is an atmospheric phenomenon considered to be important in
a variety of arctic processes. It affects the radiation budget directly by
modifying the albedo and the thermal infra-red flux at cloud top levels, and
indirectly through the modulation effect on cloud radiative properties by cloud
condensation nuclei. If it can be shown that local Cloud Condensation Nuclei
concentrations depend upon DMS emissions, it may be possible to identify a
biological control of the arctic marine stratus albedo. It may also be that
deposited trace elements from arctic haze contribute significant fluxes of
contaminants to sensitive arctic ecosystems.
