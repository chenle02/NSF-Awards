Cordes, James 95-28394 Dr. Cordes will address a wide range of topics which
concern neutron stars and their uses for probing the interstellar medium.
Specifically, he will improve the Talyor-Cordes distance model, construct a
model radio pulsar beam to determine pulsar parameters and distances, search 150
pulsars for the presence of planets and asteroids by analyzing their pulse
timing, study the initial velocity distribution of pulsars, search for new
pulsars, and continue to analyze white dwarf companions of new millisecond
pulsars looking for pulsar wind nebulae. ***
