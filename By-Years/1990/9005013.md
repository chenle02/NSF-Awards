This research is to advance the knowledge of three dimensional structure of the
Earth's mantle. The improvement of P- and S- wave velocity models will be
accomplished through expansion of the following observations: augmentation of
the waveform data bases using data from many new broad-band digital stations
deployed after 1984, expansion of absolute and differential travel-time data
sets measured from digital seismograms, and development of a new "summary travel
time" data base from ISC Bulletins containing seismic station-source region
anomalies. Acquisition of this data base will be followed by a joint inversion
of waveforms and traveltimes; in the past these data were treated separately. In
addition to this primary objective, the acquired data will allow the examination
for large scale anisotropy and lateral variations in Q.
