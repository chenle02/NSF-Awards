In 1994, Japan changed the electoral system used to choose members of the lower
house of the Diet. Single member districts replaced local multi-members
districts. Nine new regional proportional representation constituencies were
also established. Japan's first election under the new system will occur in
1996. This unique historical event provides a laboratory for the study of first-
order effects of institutional change in a major industrial democracy. Japan has
long had a strong "personal vote" tradition which many believe resulted from the
competition between candidates from the same party in multi-member districts.
Others believe the personal vote reflects political culture moreso than
established electoral institutions. By examining the party, candidate and voter
behavior during the election, this project will determine if and how
institutions matter. The study will also investigate the effects of reform on
attitudes toward democracy in Japan. Much as in the American case, there exists
a prevailing deep mistrust and apathy that affects whether people vote and how
they make electoral choices. Whether reform can make a difference in the way the
Japanese relate to their government can be an important component of
governmental stability in one of the world's most important democracies.
