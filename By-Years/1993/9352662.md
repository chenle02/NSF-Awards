9352662 Hart The purpose of this project is to introduce science students to the
use of personal computers and transducers as laboratory measuring instruments.
The students are encouraged to explore setting their own parameters for the data
acquisition procedures and then to explore in greater depth problems which
particularly interest them. The project is being implemented in the two semester
General Physics class, which is taken by all Physics, Chemistry and Biology
majors. Each pair of students provided with a computer interface setup which
consists of a Macintosh LCII computer and a Vernier Universal Lab Interface with
the appropriate transducers. These setups are being used in new experiments to
study the details of collision dynamics, phase change, Newton's Law of Cooling,
and waveform analyses related to the Doppler shift and electromagnetic
induction. These setups are also being used to improve existing experiments on
moment of inertia and the pendulum. This project is significant because it
provides the only opportunity in our curriculum for science students to gain
experience with data acquisition by computers. Some of the new experiments also
contain innovative elements which may be incorporated into laboratories at other
schools. ***
