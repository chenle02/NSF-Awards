In support of the NSF's gravitational wave observatory LIGO which is currently
under construction, this project aims to produce models of binary compact object
systems by numerical solution of the Einstein gravitational equations coupled,
when appropriate, to fluid matter. Compact object here refers to neutron stars
and stellar mass black holes. When closely coupled in pairs revolving about each
other these systems can lose energy by radiating gravitational waves. This has
been seen to occur in the binary pulsar system through the observation and
analysis of the motions. But more tightly bound and rapidly moving systems are
expected to evolve to the point where the radiation would be detectable by the
LIGO facility. Under this grant Prof. Charles Misner of the University of
Maryland will engage in a collaboration, to produce detailed computer generated
models of such radiating systems. These models would allow the gravitational
wave signals from such exotic systems to be more reliably recognized and
interpreted.
