9514585 Jayne There is currently no broad comparative understanding of the
neuromuscular basis of locomotor movement of the hind limb of vertebrates
because of a lack of information for amphibians and reptiles which generally
have a "sprawling" limb posture unlike the "erect" limbed birds and mammals.
Lizards are by far the most diverse lineage of vertebrates with the ancestral
sprawling limb posture, and the proposed research will quantify the movements
and in vivo patterns of muscle use in the hind limbs of this vertebrate lineage.
Experiments with a generalized lizard species will test for differences
associated with different speeds and locomotion up and down inclines. Three
other lizard species with different specialized hind limb postures will be
studied similarly allowing quantitative interspecific comparisons of motion and
muscle activity. Upside-down locomotion will also be studied for two species of
climbing specialists. Overall, the experiments will determine the extent of
behavioral diversity in this system and address whether or not major innovations
in motor pattern occur either for different locomotor tasks within a species or
for similar locomotor tasks among species with differing morphology. It is
hypothesized that intraspecific variability in motor pattern of a generalized
species performing different tasks may encompass intraspecific variability in
motor pattern among species with specialized limb posture. Understanding the
functional basis of lizard locomotion will also complement their ecologically
and evolutionarily-oriented studies which attempt to relate morphological
variation to variation in locomotor performance and habitat selection. ***
