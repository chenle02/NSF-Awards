0129303&lt;br/&gt;Frank&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Curtis Frank and students
from Stanford University in a collaboration with Brigitte Voit of the Institute
for Polymer Research in Dresden, Germany. The aim of the international project
is to study a range of activites that are central to the overall goals of the
NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at Stanford/IBM/UC Davis
and the international collabortion will receive support both from the German
DAAD and from the Insititute for Polymer Research itself. The specific goals of
the collaboration include increasing the characterization and processing tools
beyond those currently available for nanoparticle synthesis, providing a
framework for exchange of researches, especially junior researchers, allowing
undergraduate students the opportunity o patcipate in an international research
project. The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate and
undergraduate students in the international travel and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
