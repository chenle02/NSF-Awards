9529950 Sitharam This project funds the speaker and participant costs for a
special session, titled ``Foundations and Mathematical Aspects of Computer
Science'', of the Central Section of the American Mathematical Society, Kent
State University, November 3 -- 4, 1995. The purpose of this special session is
to encourage interaction between mathematicians and the more theoretical
computer scientists. Such interaction is currently rare, and would benefit both
communities: the process of formalizing and solving many challenging problems
that arise in computer science theory not only benefits from the mathematical
formulation but often requires the development of new and deep mathematics. The
aim of this session is to create awareness of these special connections and
problems, and to open communication channels with mathematicians attending the
AMS Meeting. In fact, both the formal session (with talks that outline problems
in such areas as algorithms, complexity theory, computational learning theory,
computational geometry, parallel computing models, probabilistic and randomized
computation,and computer security and cryptography), and the planned open
problem sessions (for an interchange of solution techniques and problems) should
facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians and computer
scientists. There are three NSF programs which are split funding this project:
Theory of Computing Program of CCR, Computational Mathematics Program of DMS,
and Algebra and Number Theory Program of DMS. ***
