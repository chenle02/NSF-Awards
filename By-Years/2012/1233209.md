This award funds the travel of 15 US student to travel to the 21st ACM
International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC 2012).
HPDC 2012 is to be held, along with nine workshops, at the campus of the Delft
University of Technology in Delft, The Netherlands on June 18 through June 22,
2012. HPDC is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on
the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing,
collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HPDC 2012 will build on the success of its predecessors,
which date back to 1992, and which have typically drawn 150-250 participants
from among the academic research, national lab, standards, vendor, and user
communities in the field of high performance distributed computing. HPDC seeks
to increase student participation in the symposium as well as the field in
general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will facilitate participation of
unfunded student authors, and encourage participation of students from
traditionally underrepresented groups, underfunded institutions, and
undergraduates.
