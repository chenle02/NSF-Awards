This grant provides partial support for a Chapman Conference that is intended to
bring together volcanologists, geophysicists, and marine geoscientists with
interests in the formation of clastic volcanologic successions of the modern
seafloor and in ancient successions, and in the processes and significance of
explosive subaqueous eruptions in seafloor settings.
