This research is aimed at organizing complex design projects in order to perform
faster product development. A variation of Steward's design structure matrix is
used to represent both the sequence of and the technical relationships among the
many design tasks to be performed. These relationships define the "technical
structure" of a design project. Analytical techniques to find alternative
sequences and definitions of the design tasks will be developed, offering
opportunities to speed development progress by improved coordination and
information transfer. These algorithms will consider the technical structure of
a project in order to identify which tasks should be resequenced and which tasks
should be redefined or split into smaller sub-tasks to avoid development
bottlenecks. These techniques will be developed into a strategy for design
management which can significantly reduce the overall project complexity by
reorganizing the few critical tasks. It is expected that this research will
benefit not only new design tasks that have never been structured before but
also long-standing, often repeated design tasks that may have drifted into poor
organization patterns over many years.
