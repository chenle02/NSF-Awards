ABSTRACT: Computer interfaced experiments are being introduced into the general
chemistry and physical chemistry laboratories. Six experiments are being
introduced into general chemistry involving computers interfaced with sensors
for the gathering of experimental data. Temperature probes, colorimeter
interfaces or pH meter interfaces designed by project SERAPHIM staff are being
used. Lotus 1-2-3 and Lotus Measure are serving as templates at the introductory
level. Experiments include chemical kinetics; calorimetry and heat of reaction;
molecular weight from freezing point depression; computer driven titration to
measure equilibrium; gas chromatography; and statistics and error analysis. In
physical chemistry the students are doing advanced aspects of some of these same
experiments as well as using the computers for analysis atomic and molecular
orbitals through display of wave functions and the consideration of changes in
bond length. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
