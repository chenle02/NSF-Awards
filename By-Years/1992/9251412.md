A computer laboratory is being established to support the training of pre-
service elementary teachers. Students in the computer literacy and geometry
segments of the teacher preparation program will gain hands-on experience in
using computers and educational software. The computer languages BASIC and LOGO
will be used to develop computer literacy and reduce computer anxiety in
prospective teachers. Via the GEOMETRIC SUPPOSER software packages, students
will be able to explore geometric concepts interactively in the proposed
laboratory. Students will be more actively involved in their own education and
will develop confidence in their ability to use this and other software in their
classroom teaching situations after leaving the university.
