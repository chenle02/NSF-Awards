9627460 DeWitt B. DeWitt from the University of Texas will study methods to
develop a quantum theory of gravity and elementary particles without the use of
`ghost fields', local fields which have traditionally been incorporated in the
field theory description of high energy physics. Ghost fields were originally
included in order to preserve as much symmetry as possible in the theory, since
this allows ease of calculation. A ghost-free description will be useful in
providing us with a theory which only involves physical degrees of freedom at
all stages of the calculation. This work is part of a successful program to
bring gravity and elementary particle physics on a more equal conceptual
footing, thereby enhancing our deeper understanding of both fields. ***
