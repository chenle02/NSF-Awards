This project proposes to continue an REU Site offering undergraduate students
the opportunity to participate in computer systems security research at the
University of Connecticut. Computer systems have been integrated into our daily
life and work, as well as every part of our national infrastructure. Thus, they
are an obvious target for those who intend to corrupt the systems for financial,
political or other reasons. While security in the context of general-purpose
computing and communication has been studied extensively, research on embedded
systems security has only gained attention recently. The vast number of embedded
devices and their wide-spread usage in all aspects of or daily life and work
make their security vulnerabilities much more dangerous and costly than
traditional software vulnerabilities. The resource constraints (in processing
capabilities, memory, battery) of embedded systems and the ever increasing range
of attack techniques targeting embedded systems (including software, hardware,
side-channel attacks) pose many challenges to embedded systems security. A
primary national need is research and researchers who can address the security
of embedded systems. Introducing embedded systems research to undergraduate
students in the early stages of their academic careers will spark their
interests, creating next-generation computer systems security researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU project is to equip undergraduate
students with skills in computer systems security research, with a focus on
embedded systems security research. The project offers an intensive 10-week
summer program to undergraduate students, particularly those in underrepresented
groups and those that may not have the opportunities to participate in research
activities. Students will attend a series of training seminars conducted by the
PIs to learn the basics of embedded systems security research as well as general
skills required in graduate school such as technical writing and presentations.
From day one until the end of the 10-week REU program, each student will work
with the project staff on one research project selected from a wide spectrum of
topics, including computer systems and hardware auditing, provable secure
embedded systems, secure processor architectures, secure mobile computing,
secure voting systems and chip piracy resilience. In addition, students will
have the opportunity to participate in a professional conference related to
computer systems security to broaden their vision and witness research projects
conducted worldwide.
