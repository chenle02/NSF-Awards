In the lightwave field several institutions have growing efforts which are
having a substantial impact upon the area. Each tends to have its own specialty
ranging from optical computing to signal processing. The University of New
Mexico has made impressive strides in the development of its effort in this area
and in particular in the investigation of materials of importance to the future
growth of the field. It has established a first class facility for research in
semiconductor optics, sources and opto-electronic integrated circuits which can
be expected to impact the field both in terms of fundamental research and
education.
