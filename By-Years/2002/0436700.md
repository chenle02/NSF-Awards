This project will provide the first quantification of the role of heavy ion
ionospheric outflows in the dynamics of the magnetosphere during magnetic
storms. It will use the 2-fluid code developed at the University of Washington
to follow ions from their launching out of the ionosphere, through to their
energization in the magnetotail and finally their injection into the ring
current. The research will determine the solar wind and ionospheric conditions
that lead to the strongest O+ enhancements. The project will also identify the
spatial extent and relative concentration of these outflows in the magnetotail,
and the simulations results will be calibrated using data from the High Energy
Neutral Atom (HENA) imager on the IMAGE satellite.
