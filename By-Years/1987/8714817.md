Dr. McMillan, at the University of Arizona, has designed and brought into
operation an instrument to accurately measure small changes in the line of sight
velocities of stars. The instrument was constructed specifically to find planets
around other stars than the sun. In addition there are numerous possibilities
for serendipitous discoveries of stellar phenomena. Dr. McMillan will use this
grant to continue his search for planets. The presence of planets around other
stars than the sun is an obviously important astronomical and philosophical
question. Currently only one system, our own solar system, is known to exist.
Several scientific groups are carrying out observations with a variety of
techniques with the goal of detecting planets around other stars. Dr. McMillan
and his colleagues with their specially designed, state-of-the-art
instrumentation are among the leaders in this field.
