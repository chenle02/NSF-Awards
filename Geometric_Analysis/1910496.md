The proposed research focuses on minimal surfaces, which are surfaces that
locally minimize area. Classical examples of minimal surfaces can be obtained
physically by immersing a wire frame into a soap solution and forming a soap
film surface whose boundary is the wire frame. The theme of minimization
permeates all of the natural sciences and minimal surfaces are thus an important
model for several phenomena in nature. They have been linked to molecular
engineering, materials science, and to the theory of black holes in general
relativity. The proposed research aims to understand how such surfaces can be
locally minimizing but not globally so and, moreover, how this can reveal the
shape of the space they live in.

Minimal submanifolds are critical points to the most fundamental variational
problem in the geometry, that of minimizing area. They have been an essential
object in mathematical research since the work of Euler and Lagrange, and many
of the ideas developed in their study turned out to be key in the development of
calculus of variations, nonlinear PDEs, and mathematical physics. In addition,
minimal submanifolds have also been a crucial method in understanding curvature,
yielding many striking applications to geometry, low-dimensional topology, and
general relativity. Recent advances on the existence theory of minimal
hypersurfaces suggest that this is a very exciting time for the field. A major
component of the proposed research is to investigate new Morse index estimates
in light of the new existence results. One goal is to study what are the
geometrical and topological properties of the new minimal hypersurfaces produced
by the theory, which in turn can lead to several applications.
