9528503 Bennett This research project explores fundamental aspects of the
interaction of metals with silicon surfaces using advanced surface
characterization techniques including 'hot STM' which provides in situ, real
time observations of processes on an atomic scale; synchrotron X-ray diffraction
which allows observation of buried interfaces; and Low Energy Electron
Microscopy(LEEM) for video rate observations of thin film and surface reactions
at high temperature. Materials systems of practical importance in silicon
microelectronics are emphasized, particularly Co/, Ti/ and Au/Si. The long range
goal of this research project is to establish a connection between surface and
bulk phenomena for silicide reactions. Prototype systems will be studied as they
progress through various stages of reaction from submonolayer precursor
adsorbates or buried interface structures to reacted silicide structures to high
temperature phase transformations. %%% The objective of this research is to
develop a fundamental understanding of crystal growth in ultrathin film systems
that are relevant to advanced silicon metallization schemes needed for next
generation microelectronic devices and circuits. The research will contribute
basic materials science knowledge at the fundamental atomic level of
technological relevance to several aspects of advanced microelectronic
circuitry. Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this
research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the
performance of advanced devices and circuits used in computing, information
processing, and telecommunications by providing a fundamental understanding and
a basis for designing and producing improved materials. An important feature of
the program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
