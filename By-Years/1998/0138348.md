AST-0138348&lt;br/&gt;Lee, Adrian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A millimeter wave
bolometric receiver will be built for the 12-meter diameter Atacama Pathfinder
Experiment (APEX) telescope in transition with Max Planck Institute for
Radioastronomy (MPIfR) in Bonn, Germany. This receiver is a 300-element
bolometric receiver for observations at 150 and 217 GHz. The bolometers will be
horn-coupled, spider-web devices with superconducting transistor-edge sensors
(TES) each using SQUID ammeter readout configured for 1024 elements. This
receiver will be used to discover and study galaxy clusters via the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at millimeter wavelengths. Data recorded with
optical and x-ray measurements, when correlated with data recorded by this
receiver promise to 1. reveal the formation history of galaxies, 2. Probe the
nature of dark energy by measuring its equation of state, and 3. measure
cosmological parameters including the mass energy density and the Hubble
constant. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
