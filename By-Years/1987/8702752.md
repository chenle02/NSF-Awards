The equivalence problems for various types of finite transducers, pushdown
automata, and pushdown transducers are being investigated. The research being
done on these problems is expected to contribute to the eventual solution of the
famous equivalence problem for deterministic pushdown automata. Two entirely
different techniques for proving the decidability of equivalence problems are
being used. The first one, called the "test-set approach" has already been
successfully applied: the principal investigator in collaboration with J.
Karhumaki used it to solve the (previously open) equivalence problem for two
classes of finite transducers. The second method based on the "synchronizability
conjecture" is intended for DPDAs and deterministic pushdown transducers. The PI
is also continuing his investigations in cellular automata and systolic systems.
The PI is a leading world figure in the solving of difficult decidability
questions. He has recently produced solutions to related problems and is as
likely as anyone to solve the difficult problems proposed.
