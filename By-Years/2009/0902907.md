This project contributes to the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Focus Group
on the early stages of the onset of a magnetospheric substorm. It will
systematically analyze the plasma instabilities of the pre-onset, near-Earth
plasmasheet substorm events. The plasma sheet conditions will be reconstructed
using magnetohydrodynamic simulations with the OpenGGCM MHD code. Once the
plasmasheet configuration is known, it will be possible to examine the stability
of the configuration to macroscale instabilities such as ballooning, kink, and
tearing modes. Both analytical eigenvalue methods and MHD simulations will be
used in the stability analysis. The project will examine the signatures and
consequences of the plasma instabilities and compare the results with
observations made by the NASA THEMIS mission. The linear and early nonlinear
instabilities of the plasmasheet during substorm growth phase are the keys to
understanding the initial stage of the substorm expansion onset. The accuracy of
the stability analyses relies on the detailed knowledge of the plasma sheet
configuration model. THEMIS substorm observations will provide more input
conditions and constraints that will enable the OpenGGCM simulation to
reconstruct a sequence of accurate and realistic plasma sheet configurations
during the substorm growth phase. The stability analysis will help resolve many
remaining controversies on the onset process and bring in new perspectives on
the substorm onset problem. The project will help provide quantitative
interpretation of THEMIS substorm events, and will bridge the gap between
theory, analysis and observations.
