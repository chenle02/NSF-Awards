This project is creating a scholarship program for Computer Information Systems,
Engineering and Industrial Technologies, and Mathematics majors at the associate
degree level. Faculty and staff are working together across institutional
divisions to meet students' educational needs and facilitate their success. The
program builds upon a current Sinclair NSF project aimed at increasing
participation in engineering technology programs: Image and Marketing of
Engineering Technology Education (DUE 0071103).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program
is increasing the number of students obtaining associate degrees or transferring
to four-year institutions in the areas of computer science, computer technology,
engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics (CSEMS). It also support
students entering the workforce in CSEMS disciplines. The program has three
primary goals:&lt;br/&gt;1. To increase the success of CSEMS students through
scholarships and the provision of&lt;br/&gt;support services that promote full-
time enrollment and the attainment of Associate&lt;br/&gt;Degrees in CSEMS
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;2. To assist student transfer to four year institutions
to continue their education in a CSEMS&lt;br/&gt;discipline.&lt;br/&gt;3. To
increase the participation of low-income, academically talented students in
CSEMS&lt;br/&gt;careers, especially students of underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is meeting a growing demand for entry-
level technicians in computer science and engineering disciplines. It is being
led by a collaborative team of faculty from the Computer Information Systems
Division, the Division of Engineering and Industrial Technologies Division, and
the Mathematics Department. To support these efforts, these faculty are drawing
upon the expertise of four Senior Personnel of the Financial Aid Office, Student
Support Services Program, and Academic Counseling Services.
