The PI's will have access to extensive drilling technology in the newly
developing Coso geothermal system. Water samples, cuttings, and cores will be
studied to understand the nature of fluid/rock interaction in this system, which
is relatively undisturbed and can provide a close approximator to natural
circulation of fluids. The metamorphic/igneous basement rocks differ from the
sediment hosted Salton Sea Geothermal field, and as such will have distinct
effects on fluid compositions and evolution. Among the PI's objectives are
determination of (1) fluid circulation paths and sources, (2) thermal evolution
and age of the geothermal system, (3) veining mineralization, and (4) history of
fracturing and cementation of the hydrologic system.
