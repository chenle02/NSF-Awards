Abstract McLaughlin

This award is in partial support of a conference spanning a broad range of
mathematical topics, tied together by Random Matrix Theory and Integrable
Systems. The goals of this conference are (1) to bring these groups together to
discuss their common interests and challenges, and to share their research tools
and techniques, (2) to provide for junior researchers a vision of the breadth
and depth of the community actively advancing the boundary of knowledge in
random matrix theory and integrable systems, and (3) to positively impact future
research, particularly of active young researchers, by identifying challenging
research problems and, more generally, important new directions of research. The
majority of the funding is to support young investigators.
