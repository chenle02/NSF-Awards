The Blue Mountains province of northeastern Oregon consists of five terranes of
oceanic affinity, however, the translation histories of these terranes are not
well established. This paleomagnetic study will evaluate the potential of
establishing quantitative values for paleolatitudes associated with paleonto-
logically developed faunal realms for some terranes and to determine tectonic
relationships between the Blue Mountain terranes, Wrangellia, and the North
American craton. Results will help define the process and timing of terrane
migration and accretion to the pacific northwest collage.
