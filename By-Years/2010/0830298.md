Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms are used in a variety of scientific fields.
Typical applications of such methods rely on heuristic methods to test
convergence, and hence there are no guarantees on the accuracy of the subsequent
calculations. This project strives for rigorous analysis of some important
applications of MCMC methods, to devise new MCMC algorithms for notable open
problems, and to explore connections between the efficiency of MCMC algorithms
and phase transitions in Statistical Physics. Our work will focus on the
following aims: analyzing the Glauber dynamics which is of interest in
Statistical Physics and connections therein to phase transitions, analyzing MCMC
algorithms used for phylogenetic reconstruction in Evolutionary Biology, and
designing an efficient algorithm for randomly sampling contingency tables which
is important in Statistics. This project is interdisciplinary in nature, and a
focus of this project is on the application of tools from Theoretical Computer
Science to analyze algorithms of use in Statistical Physics, Evo- lutionary
Biology, and Statistics. Moreover, by exploring connections between the
efficiency of certain local algorithms and phase transitions we will contribute
to increased synergy between researchers in Statistical Physics, Discrete
Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. Our work on the analysis of MCMC
algorithms for phylogenetic reconstruction will contribute to the theoretical
underpinnings for the study of the tree of life, which is a central goal in
Biology.
