9616855 The traditional advection-dispersion theory for miscible contaminant
(solute) migration through soil in reality represents a limiting case of the
more general coupled-flow theory in which the coupling terms (e.g. water flow
due to chemico-osmosis) are assumed to be zero. While this assumption is
generally acceptable in the case of miscible contaminant migration through
relatively high permeability materials, the accuracy of this assumption in terms
of the relatively low-permeability, fine-grained materials typical of pollutant
barriers has not been formally evaluated. The goal of this study is to evaluate
the significance of chemico-osmosis and electro-osmosis on the migration of
miscible contaminants through engineered clay barriers used for waste
containment and in situ remediation. The following objectives will be addressed:
* coupled flow parameters (e.g. hydraulic, chemico- osmotic, and electro-osmotic
conductivity; electrical conductance; and osmotic efficiency coefficient) for
clay soils will be measured under several different test conditions (stress,
compaction, solute concentration and type); * parameters expected to dominate
solute transport under low-flow conditions will be measured independently for
the same soils, solutes, and test conditions; * measured migration rates of the
solutes through laboratory soil columns will be compared with predicted rates
using analytical models based on both the coupled flow and the advective-
diffusive modeling approaches; and * a finite difference model will be developed
and used to evaluate the potential effect of volume change on solute mass flux
for both coupled flow and the advective-diffusive modeling approaches. ***
