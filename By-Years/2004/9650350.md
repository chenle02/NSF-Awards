Despite the strategic role of semiconductor manufacturing in American industry,
teaching of courses related to optoelectronic devices is not popular in
undergraduate curricula. These courses often appear either too theoretical and
abstract or too skill oriented, with students receiving only vocational
training. Most laboratory courses at best reiterate some theoretical concepts,
but mostly test rather than fabricate devices. This scenario is particularly
troublesome for nontraditional students, including those in community colleges
and midcareer or experienced workers intending to update their skills. For both
groups, these courses appear theoretical, with little relevance to the
manufacturing process. In response to these needs, a course has been developed
that has two unique major features: it proposes an integrated approach to the
teaching of optoelectronic devices whereby students design, fabricate, and test
a device of their choice and it enables nonhomogeneous groups of students
consisting of nontraditional, associate degree, undergraduate, and graduate
students to work in teams responsible for all aspects of design and fabrication.
The scenario played out in this course is a replica of concurrent engineering in
the work place. What holds the team together is the product, the device, and
what separates them is their responsibilities and backgrounds. All the equipment
and supplies necessary for the fabrication of the devices are provided to the
students in the microfabrication clean-room facility. Through this project, the
department is acquiring equipment for testing the devices that students
fabricate. These instruments enable the students to probe and test the
electronic and optical response of their products.
