This project is devoted to studying deterministic and random cellular automata
models of growth processes, with the emphasis on several new directions. The
first field of study are nonmonotone growth models; the investigator aims to
study their growth shapes and space-covering properties by extending renewal,
rescaling and perturbation techniques from probability, as well as various
geometric methods. Also being developed are new analytic and computational
approaches to higher dimensional and long range models, and to connections with
differential and integral equations. An important example of a high-dimensional
space is the hypercube, where the investigator uses combinatorial and
probabilistic methods to understand the effect of uncorrelated and correlated
random environments on basic growth processes.

In a broad scientific context, the aim of this project is to understand
principles by which various physical systems propagate disturbances. Among
instances of such growth dynamics are growth of snowflakes and other crystals,
spread of epidemics, propagation of waves, competition between species, and
genetic diversification. The investigator's research sheds light on how
microscopic properties of a growth process influence its space-covering ability,
on the effect of perturbations in the environment and in the dynamics, and on
the role of dimension and range of interaction. For example, simple mathematical
metaphors for neutral mutations, incompatibilities and harshness of the
environment contribute to understanding the onset of genetic diversity. The
project has an essential computational component and is developing a variety of
efficient computer algorithms for simulation and visualization of complex
processes. Finally, ample opportunities for undergraduate involvement in
studying complex and random dynamics help to popularize mathematics and its
applications.
