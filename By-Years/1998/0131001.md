In this award funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Rice will study the theory for the active control of the
evolution of quantum many-body systems in order to establish conditions under
which active control of a unimolecular reaction can be achieved in a dense
liquid phase. The principal focus in these investigations will be on developing
new variants of methods that use coherent excitation of states with or without
adiabatic transfer of population. A main focus in on the development of new
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) laser excitation schemes for both
gas phase and solution phase reactions. Other promising methods as well as
refinements and extensions of previous implementations of active control of
molecular dynamics will also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selective control
of product formation in a chemical reaction has been sought persistently
throughout the evolution of chemistry. Using such control of a reaction would
allow one to generate a particular product mostly or completely. Control has
been accomplished at the macroscopic level by manipulating external factors such
as temperature, pressure, solvent character, etc. With the advent of the tunable
laser, it was hoped that product selectivity could be controlled at the
microscopic level, and that individual bonds within a molecule could be
selectively broken. It was very quickly found that energy absorbed by a molecule
was not easily localized in individual bonds, but preferred to redistribute
throughout the molecule. More recently, however, the concept of laser selective
chemistry has had a rebirth, and theories developed by Rice and others have
shown that energy could be localized by carefully choosing a complex sequence of
laser pulses of prescribed shapes. If this theory can be put to practice
experimentally, it will be possible to realize the goal of microscopic selective
control of chemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;
