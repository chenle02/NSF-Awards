9561606 Torti This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will explore a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensor which utilizes
discrete counting electrodes and a suspended slider. Precision displacement
sensors have a multitude of uses in industrial processing, the operation of
linear and rotary machines, robotics, and the semiconductor industry. However,
for well developed technologies such as cap-acitive sensors, factors like cost
per channel, limited range, and sensitivity to gap medium inhibit their use. The
range of this sensor is limited by the linear extent over which dimensional
tolerances can be met on the die. Resolution is constrained by the fraction of
the minimum feature size that can be interpolated with the processing
electronics. With the slider-to-target gap positioned electronically, variations
in refractive index can be compensated and active guarding is obviated. This
design should increase resolution while reducing drift and decreasing cost. It
utilizes a three-layer nickel construction with a monolithically attached, tall
facing electrode, fabricated with deep plasma etching. Force attenuation is
electrostatic. With the electronics and MEMS integrated onto a common substrate,
commercial devices could be manufactured inexpensively and compactly. Phase I
will identify promising geometry's, sensing and drive electronics will be
designed, and test structures will be produced. A full scale prototype is
expected to be made in Phase II.
