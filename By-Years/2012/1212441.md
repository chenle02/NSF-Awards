This award by the MSN Chemistry Program supports work of Professor Marina A.
Petrukhina at the University at Albany, SUNY, to explore multiple electron
uptakes by bowl-shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbons (also known as buckybowls or
fullerene fragments). In this program, buckybowls mapping onto the surfaces of
fullerenes and representing the end-caps of nanotubes are utilized as effective
models for a diverse range of carbon-rich nanosize materials, thus providing an
excellent opportunity to study the redox properties of curved and strained pi-
systems at the molecular level. Specifically, the effects of charging pi-bowls
with multiple electrons on their molecular geometry, metal binding abilities and
self-assembly will be broadly investigated. As a result, this program should
improve our understanding of the redox behavior and electron transport of
carbonaceous nanostructured materials. It should assist in elucidation of alkali
metal ion intercalation in between non-planar pi-carbon surfaces, which is
important for search and design of prospective carbon-based anode materials for
Li-ion batteries.

This fundamental program should overall advance the materials chemistry
applications of curved carbon-rich polyarenes, including buckybowls, fullerenes,
and nanotubes in several emerging fields ranging from electronics to energy
storage. This program will also make its major impact on the enhancement of the
educational and research experiences of graduate and undergraduate students at
the University at Albany by engaging them into a modern cross-disciplinary
research program, and thus improving their future career prospects in the highly
competitive global marketplace.
