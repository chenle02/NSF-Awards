9713990 Taylor PROJECT SUMMARY The interior ice sheets of the continent of
Antarctica have always been assumed to be devoid of indigenous organisms. While
plants, protozoa, and bacteria are present at the fringes of the continent, the
combination of low temperatures, long periods of darkness, and the absence of
liquid water make the interior extremely hostile to life. However, recent
examination of snow from the South Pole indicates the presence of microbes which
contain DNA and photosynthetic pigments. Snow samples were collected at South
Pole station in January 1997 and flown immediately to the Crary Lab at McMurdo
Base. Examination of snowmelt using epifluorescence microscopy showed the
presence of rod shaped particles approximately 1 X 2.5 um in size and a
concentration of 130 (sd=64) cells per ml. The particles fluoresced orange under
blue excitation light and reddish-orange under green excitation, indicating the
presence of phycobiliproteins and chlorophyll. These fluorescence signatures
combined with the particles' shape suggests that they are cyanobacteria.
Subsequent analysis using fluorescent DNA stains and scanning electron
microscopy confirmed the presence of DNA containing microbes identical in shape
to the autofluorescing particles seen with epifluorescent microscopy. Further
research will confirm whether these microbes are indigenous to the Antarctic
interior and investigate their biology and ecology. The discovery of organisms
capable of survival in interior Antarctica would provide us with new insight
into the adaptability of life. Their biomolecules and metabolism must be unique
and could have great value for molecular engineering research.
