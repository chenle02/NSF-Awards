This Presidential Young Investigator Award will allow Prof. John Tooby to expand
his seminal work in the area of "evolutionary psychology;" an integration of
evolutionary biology, anthropology and cognitive psychology. To date his work
has led to a deeper understanding of the evolution of the genome, the evolution
of sexual reproduction and insights into the evolution of hominid behavior. In
his most recent writings, Tooby makes the case that one must first understand
the psychological mechanisms that underlie cultural practices, their generation
and transmission, before one can understand the practices themselves. The wide
breadth of his pursuits indicates his encyclopedic knowledge of what had been
disparate fields. Because evolutionary psychology is currently forming through
the integration of other intellectual endeavors, there are few opportunities for
funding; the PYI will foster the maturation of both the individual and the
paradigms of the field. This is turn may lead to the development of new
fieldwork techniques.
