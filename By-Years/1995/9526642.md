9526642 Campbell The goal of this proposal is to re-evaluate the potential of
fluid inclusion dating by building upon the knowledge from previous attempts and
applying a refined experimental 40Ar/39Ar technique to ideally-suited samples
obtained from the mineralized zones within the Capitan pluton, central New
Mexico. This project will advance 40Ar/39Ar technique towards a wider
applicability to dating ore deposits in general and enhance the fundamental
understanding of the role fluid inclusions play in the general application of
argon geochronology.
