Werner-Washburne 9630545 The long-term objective of this research is to gain
insight into the molecular events involved in the process of entry into,
survival during, and exit from stationary-phase growth in yeast. The goal of the
research is to increase our understanding of developmental regulation of signal-
transduction pathways in stationary phase: first, by studying the regulation of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase and, second, by identifying other pathways and
targets of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase that function during stationary
phase. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase is extremely dynamic as yeast cells
enter stationary phase and down-regulation of the kinase activity is essential
for survival in stationary phase, since strains carrying mutations in the
regulatory subunit have been characterized that lose viability specifically in
stationary phase. Although stationary phase is the most common state for
microorganisms and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is one of the best-studied
kinases, we know very little about this time in the life cycle or how kinase
activity is regulated in stationary phase. The aims of this research are to
extend the studies on the regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in
stationary-phase yeast, identify and characterized proteins that interact with
the kinase, and identify other pathways that act positive regulators of the
stationary phase state in yeast. This research will, therefore, help us to
better understand how microorganisms function in nature. It will also have
possible benefit in the culturing of microorganisms at high cell concentrations,
as is done in biotechnology applications of cell culture.
