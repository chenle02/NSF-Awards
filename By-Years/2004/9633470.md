9633470 Gordon This is a collaborative project to develop a regional,
prognostic, three-dimensional numerical model of the Indonesian Seas Archipelago
to investigate circulation and mixing, particularly related to the exchange
between the Pacific and Indian Ocean. The overall goal is a model capable of
describing both the steady state and time variations of the circulation for a
given external forcing. Specific objectives include investigation of the effects
of inter-ocean pressure differences and local forcing on transport and
thermohaline characteristics, the role of bottom topography in partitioning the
throughflow, and the influence of tidal oscillations on turbulent mixing. The
Blumberg-Mellor model will provide the basis for the modeling effort. The team
at Princeton will provide the model, along with the expertise to apply it to the
specific region. The team at Columbia University will provide the expertise for
analysis of the available data and model output.
