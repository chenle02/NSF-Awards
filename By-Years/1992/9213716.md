Ramanathan A major limitation of real-time distributed computing systems is that
communication latency between tasks on different nodes can be large. This
research is directed towards alleviating this limitation using three methods.
First, algorithms for assigning deadlines to information transfers between tasks
are being developed. Second, partitions of information transfers into messages
are being investigated. Third, routing and delivery strategies are being
developed. The result is a set of solutions which can be used to design real-
time communications systems.
