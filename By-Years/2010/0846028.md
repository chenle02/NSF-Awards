Abstract for&lt;br/&gt;?CAREER: Secure Communication via Source and Channel
Randomness?&lt;br/&gt;Current cryptosystem design depends on two main kinds of
algorithms: secret-key and public-key algorithms. Secret-key algorithms are
simple and efficient but have key management difficulty. Public-key algorithms
are simple in key management but are computationally costly and vulnerable to
the man-in-the-middle attack. This research investigates the emerging physical
layer security approaches, which either achieve secure communication without
keys, or simplify key management by generating keys using powerful coding
techniques. This research aims at facilitating implementation of the physical
layer security approaches to practical wireless communication systems, and
stimulating interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers in mathematics,
computer science and electrical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;This research provides a
comprehensive framework to solve the problems of keyless secure communication
and key agreement (key generation and distribution) for a variety of
communication environments including noncoherent communication, channels with
compound states, fading channels, noisy eavesdropping, and multihop networks. To
be specific, this research investigates robust secure communication under
channel uncertainty and delay constraint, fundamental tradeoff in multi-key
agreement for different terminal pairs, key agreement algorithms by jointly
using source and channel randomness, and key agreement protocols in multihop
networks by exploiting network coding. This program is strongly coupled with
educational and curriculum development at the University of Hawaii, and involves
development of an advanced monograph on the topic of physical layer security to
help disseminate the progresses in this active area in and outside the
communication society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
