The research proposed here will investigate the quantitativegenetic basis of
brain and body size variation in randombredlaboratory mice. The magnitudes and
correlations of two kinds ofgenetic differences will be examined: those caused
by anindividual's own genes, and those caused by its mother's genes,through the
prenatal and postnatal environments that she providesfor her offspring. These
will be assessed by examining therelationship between observed and theoretical
similarities amongrelatives. Knowledge of these components could help
resolvedifferences between current models of evolution of brain and bodysize,
and maternal genetic variance may play a key role in life.history evolution.
Also, measurements of these and other traitsfor many mammals will be used to
determine evolutionary patternsat different taxonomic levels, and relate these
to differences inprenatal, postnatal and other components of growth that might
beinfluenced by direct and maternal genetic effects. Geneticevolutionary
mechanisms that can produce these patterns will bemodeled. The results will
provide new information about the relativeimportance of maternal genetic
differences to growth of offspringbrain and body sizes. Also, the research
addresses thefundamental biological relationship between genetic
differences(maternal and offspring), individual growth, and evolutionarychange.
Other areas that depend upon knowledge of genetic andenvironmental influences on
growth, such as animal improvement,might also benefit from the basic research
proposed here.
