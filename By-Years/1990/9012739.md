This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program will
enable Dr. Joseph W. Bruno of the Chemistry Department of Wesleyan University to
study the mechanism of reactions of ketene complexes, using complexes in which
an unsymmetrically substituted heteroallene is bound to the metal. Four
reactions will be investigated: (1) cleavage of the C-O bond in coordinated
ketenes; (2) intramolecular isomerization of ketenimines and ketenimidates; (3)
reversible C-C cleavage of coordinated ketones; and (4) stereoselective addition
to coordinated ketenes. These studies have relevance to Fischer-Tropsch
chemistry, industrial processes which utilize syn-gas (carbon monoxide and
hydrogen) to produce a variety of hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and
ketones. Dr. Bruno has previously prepared vanadocene and niobocene ketene-
hydride or ketene-alkyl compounds which are anticipated to undergo bimolecular
eliminations with early transition metal alkyls, hydrides or amides. The
resulting species are expected to exhibit ketene C-O cleavage reactions to
produce oxo-vinylidene species. In the ketenimine project, emphasis will be
placed on determining the bonding mode of the intermediate in isomerization
reactions. During the C-C cleavage reactions of coordinated ketones, formation
of metallaenolate has been suspected. Spectroelectrochemistry techniques will be
used to confirm the presence of this species. In the last project,
cyclopentadienylmanganese complexes will be studied.
