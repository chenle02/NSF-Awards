The Department of Chemistry is acquiring graphics-based workstations for
students at all levels to explore such chemical concepts such as molecular
structure, quantum mechanical energy calculations, energy minimizations and,
simulate/predict reaction mechanisms. Beginning with the general chemistry
course and continuing throughout the upper division sequence, computations and
molecular descriptions of increasingly greater complexity are being performed.
In both the organic and biochemistry courses are students are comparing and
contrasting the results of the calculations with those obtained in the
laboratory on the same systems.
