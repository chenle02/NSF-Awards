The National Science Foundation's (NSF)Inclusion across the Nation of
Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and
Science (NSF INCLUDES) program supports models, networks, partnerships and
research to ensure the broadening participation in STEM of women, members of
racial and ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented, persons
of low socio-economic status, and people with disabilities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Akron will convene a two-day conference
to develop a backbone organization to support the preparation and advancement of
underrepresented minorities K-12 through careers in the biosciences, a high
growth area for engineering (biomechanics, biometrics and biomaterials). This
conference draws on the expertise of a wide range of organizations, professional
associations, K-20+, community based organizations, industry and museums. The
intent is to strengthen the network among participants and leverage learning on
how to engage youth in the biosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
first conference will be a white paper that will be disseminated to several
professional societies that outlines a backbone infrastructure for addressing
both short-term and longer-term aspects of an NSF INCLUDES alliance centered on
bioengineering, biomechanics, biomedical engineering and biomaterials.
