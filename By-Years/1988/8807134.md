This action is for the acquisition of a mobile 20 ton Cone Penetration (CPT)
and Flat Plate Dilatometer (DMT) system for in-situ geotechnical site
exploration studies in soil dynamics and earthquake hazard mitigation. This
equipment is being used on at least six current research projects at the
University of Michigan, namely: (1) Reduction in stiffness of cohesionless soil
due to dynamic loading. (2) Studies on partially saturated sands. (3) Small
strain shear modulus by flat plate dilatometer. (4) Seismic in-situ testing. (5)
Evaluation of soil treatment and constructed earth barriers. (6) Soil-pile
interaction. This mobile system provides a capability for the rapid acquisition
and processing of high quality geotechnical site exploration data. This
information is used in research projects, and to validate the results from in-
situ site exploration using more conventional or novel techniques.
