Research concerns analytical/experimental studies of the plasma sintering
processing of high-tech ceramic materials. The work includes the develoment of a
basic understanding of the plasma heat transfer process as well as the
establishment of correlations between heat transfer and properties of sintered
materials. Plasma-sintered ceramic components may find applications in the
following areas: structural materials for advanced heat engines, burner nozzles
and heat exchangers; cutting tools and bearings; insulators fo electronics
products, piezoelectric devices, transistors and solar cells; infrared
transmission windows; heating elements (for example, SiC); and, artificial bones
and dental implants. Although ceramics are already used for many selected
technical applications, the development of new techniques for making such
materials will help make them feasible on larger commercial scales.
