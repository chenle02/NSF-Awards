Abstract Dai 9626891 This award will partially support a conference at the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte that will focus on the theory of
wavelets from an operator theoretic view point. This is a very recent
development in what is itself a very young subject. The participants will
include investigators for Texas A & M and Washington University who are among
the leaders in the area. The basic idea in the theory of wavelets is to
represent a given function - say a radar signal - as a combination of basis
functions belonging to a specified set with well known analytic properties. By
choosing the correct basis functions, one hopes to get a good approximation of
the given function by just a few basis functions. In this case, the function can
be described well by just a few non zero coefficients.
