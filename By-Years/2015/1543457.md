The Southern Ocean plays a key role in modulating the global carbon cycle, but
the size and even the sign of the global ocean flux terms of the atmospheric
burden of man-made CO2 are still uncertain. This is in part due to the lack of
measurements in this remote region of the world ocean. This project continues a
multi-year time series of shipboard chemical measurements in the Drake Passage
to detect changes in the ocean carbon cycle and to improve the understanding of
mechanisms driving natural variability and long-term change in the Southern
Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a continuation of collection of
upper ocean measurements of the underway surface partial pressure of carbon
dioxide (pCO2), using frequent ferry crossings of the Drake Passage by the RV/AS
LMGould, the USAP supply ship. Overall, more than 200 transects over the past
decade (since 2002) have now been accumulated of pCO2 profiles, along with
discrete samples for other parameters of interest in studying the ocean
carbonate system such as total CO2 (TCO2) values, isotopic (13C/12C and 14C/12C)
ratios in surface TCO2. The Drake Passage data are made readily available to the
international science community and serve as both validation and constraints of
remotely sensed observations and numerical coupled earth systems models.
