As part of the Foundation's Biotechnology Initiative, the Division of Ocean
Sciences has been advocating an initiative in marine biotechnology. The
conceptual framework and tools of contemporary molecular and cellular biology
have led to great advances in modern life sciences from biomedical and
developmental biology to taxonomy and evolutionary biology. These concepts and
technologies will yield significant advances in environmental sciences
(biological oceanography and ecology), but the transfer of technology/training
is only slowly proceeding. As part of the development of marine biotechnology,
the Division seeks advice from both the ocean science community and from leading
innovators in environmentally relevant molecular/cellular biosciences on how
best to accomplish the transfer of meaningful and effective technologies to the
pursuit of questions in ocean ecology. This workshop will gather representatives
from industry, academia, and government agencies to address this transfer of
knowledge and the need for enhanced support of marine biotechnology.
