An REU Site will be continued in the Physics Department of the University of
Massachusetts-Lowell. Undergraduate students will be given a rich experience in
physics research that will provide sufficient means for them to seriously
consider a research career in science. The students will carry out their own
research in the setting of a research group composed of other undergraduate
students, graduate students, and faculty. This will foster both student- student
and student-faculty interaction. Each student will have a faculty mentor. The
students will be fully integrated into the research groups and thus contribute
significantly to the research effort. The major goal of the program is to expose
the students to a research environment and have them develop some of the skills
necessary for carrying out physics research. Another aim of the program is to
attract those students who would not normally have a chance to do research and
women, minority members, and the disabled, groups who are typically
underrepresented in physics. A supplementary ethics program that may be offered
will sensitize the students to the ethics involved in scientific research.
Students will be housed on campus and be offered a number of cultural,
community, and recreational activities.
