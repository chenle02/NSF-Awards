Experimental investigation of magnetic graphite intercalation compounds. These
systems provide advantages for exploring physics in 2D and 2D-3D crossover
phenomena. In bi-intercalation compounds, different magnetic layers can be
arranged in an interleaved periodic stacking sequence, giving rise to spin
frustration effects along the c-axis. Other intercalation compounds form ideal
2D random systems, and are suitable for study of in-layer frustration effects.
Techniques to be applied are (i) in-situ X-ray scattering to investigate
intercalation kinetics, and (ii) neutron scattering, and AC and DC
susceptibility measurements of magnetic properties.
