The existence of irrational numbers has fascinated mankind since antiquity;
their approximation by rational numbers is of great importance in both theory
and applications. The Markoff Diophantine equation arose in Markoff's
fundamental work (in 1879) characterizing those irrationals that are badly
approximable. The equation arises in several fields of mathematics. Its integer
solutions have a tree structure, and investigation of the arithmetic properties
of these Markoff numbers (the first of which is associated with the golden
ratio, in a sense the most badly approximable irrational number) leads to
important questions in graph theory. This research project investigates the
connectivity of graphs related to the Markoff tree. In addition to its
importance for number theory, this investigation has deep connections and
applications to, among other topics, the product replacement algorithm (the most
prevalent but still poorly understood tool in computational group theory) and
expander graphs in computer science.

Investigation of the arithmetic properties of Markoff numbers leads to the
question of whether the graphs obtained by the modular reduction of the Markoff
tree are connected (strong approximation). Superstrong approximation is the
assertion that these graphs are in fact highly connected, that is to say form a
family of expanders. The past decade saw a remarkable explosion of activity in
the area of superstrong approximation for thin groups (Zariski dense subgroups
of infinite index). Much of the research was driven by development of the affine
sieve. In the case of thin groups with Levi factor of its Zariski closure
semisimple, the strong and superstrong approximation and their applications in
affine sieve are by now well-understood. On the other hand, the tori pose
particularly difficult problems, both in terms of sparsity of elements in an
orbit and their Diophantine properties as well as in terms of strong
approximation, which in this case amounts to Artin's primitive root conjecture.
This research project will investigate strong and superstrong approximation in a
setting that is intermediate in level of difficulty between that of tori and
that of thin linear groups, namely, that of nonlinear actions on a surface
defined by the Markoff equation as well as in the context of other surfaces of
Markoff type. Superstrong approximation results for thin linear groups will play
an important role in this investigation, as will techniques and methods related
to progress on Lang's conjecture and to the classification of algebraic Painlev√©
VI equations.
