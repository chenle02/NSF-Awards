9309771 Margoliash One of the most exciting and fruitful model systems in
neuroethology is learned bird song. Adult male songbirds have unique song
repertoires which they use to defend territories and attract mates. Production
of these songs is under the control of an elaborate system of brain nuclei whose
development parallels the emergence of crystalized (nonplastic) song. These
developmental processes are influenced by auditory feedback and steroid
hormones. This NSF grant will enable Dr. Margoliash to purchase equipment to set
up a novel method of tracing the connections between these brain nuclei. Using
these novel techniques he will be able to determine how auditory information is
transmitted from the sensory nuclei to the executive system that patterns song.
This information will be important for our understanding of the development of
complex behaviors, sexual differentiation and the design of feedback controlled
neural networks and robotics systems.***
