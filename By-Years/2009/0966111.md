This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented but financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars to ensure their success and
eventual graduation. Recruitment efforts are targeting community college
students who are transferring to the university and seeking baccalaureate
degrees in mechanical engineering. Support structures for participants include
mentoring of scholars by research faculty, interdisciplinary engineering
research seminars, and summer research opportunities. The goals of the program
are to recruit, mentor and graduate increased numbers of students in mechanical
engineering, with special emphasis on underrepresented minority students; to
incorporate research in the undergraduate education experience; to provide
students with opportunities to identify paths to employment and to graduate
school; and to formalize a relationship between University of Maryland Baltimore
County (UMBC) and Montgomery Community College of Maryland to increase the
number of community college students transferring to the mechanical engineering
program at UMBC.
