The development of insects is controlled by cerebral neurohormones that when
released at precise times evoke a cascade of endocrine events that culminate in
molting and metamorphosis. The principal neurohormone in this process is the
peptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PPTH), which based upon size exists as two
families of peptides. This research is involved with understanding the chemistry
and physiology of one of these families, the small PTTHs. Knowledge gained from
this research on a simple cerebral neuroendocrine system will contribute to our
understanding of the development and functioning of the fundamental neuronal
type, neurosecretory cell, that through its production of neuropeptides
regulates most of the life processes of an organism. Additionally, insight into
the mechanisms by which neurohormones control insect development and
reproduction could lead to the development of environmentally innocuous and
specific strategies for insect control.
