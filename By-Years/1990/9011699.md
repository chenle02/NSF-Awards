Biosensors employing enzymes or antibodies are capable of measuring a vast
number of simple molecules as well as macromolecules involved in industrial
bioprocesses. However, this capability cannot be tapped readily for bioreactor
monitoring because enzymes and antibodies lose their activity during steam
sterilization. By making use of sterile fabrication methods and remote sensing
technology, this proposal seeks to design and fabricate a prototype biosensor
which can be used in bioreactors without the steam sterilization requirement.
