9619168 Robinson A secondary school implementation program is established for
the five comprehensive mathematics instructional materials development projects
funded by NSF. These projects are: Applications/Reform in Secondary Education,
Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications; Core Plus Mathematics Project,
Western Michigan University; Interactive Mathematics Program, San Francisco
State University; Math Connections, Connecticut Business and Industry
Association; and Systemic Initiatives for Montana Mathematics and Science,
University of Montana. The structure incorporates a central coordinating site
together with five satellite sites, one for each project. The central site
informs various constituencies about these innovative curricula, aids school
districts in the first general phases of implementation, and coordinates
requests for additional information and assistance. The satellite sites assist
in the development of successful implementation strategies which are project
specific and tailored as much as possible to the implementation locale and
assists schools in employing these strategies. A listserv and Web site are
maintained for distributing information and coordination is maintained with
various systemic initiatives supported by NSF.
