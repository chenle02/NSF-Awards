The goal of this project is to build and calibrate two new mass spectrometer
(MS) prototypes: 1) A small, high-impact tolerant rotating field MS (RFMS) that
can measure gases and fluids in a small, hand-held package, allowing this device
to be used for real-time analyses in the field, and 2) An extremely high-
resolution multi-bounce time of flight (MBTOF) MS of moderate size, but with
the&lt;br/&gt;capability of measuring a wide range of light isotopes in addition
to specific heavy&lt;br/&gt;isotopes. For the first (RFMS) prototype, this
existing design suffers from signal to noise (SNR) issues associated with the
ionizer or the momentum filter. The team will use off-the-shelf (OTS) ionizers
to track down the issue and correct the problem. For the second system, the
existing design will be calibrated against a wide range of chemical compounds,
to illustrate readiness for measurements. Specific tasks for the second (MBTOF)
prototype will include: integration of a higher speed and sensitivity ETP Hybrid
MCP-discrete dynode detector appropriate for isotope measurements, and
calibration and sensitivity testing against a suite of chemical compounds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates the fundamental ion physics
associated with new implementations of sophisticated mass spectrometers that
could be used in a wide range of scientific and commercial disciplines, in a
wide range of environments, from ice boreholes that reveal the history of
climate to effluent gas monitoring stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt
