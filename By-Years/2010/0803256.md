Abstract Recent progress in bioinformatics, natural language understanding,
computer vision, information retrieval and other areas has been significantly
enabled by "conditional random fields" (CRFs)---machine learning models of
structured outputs, such as sequences, trees and grids. However, many of the
fundamental problems in these application areas involve not just fixed
structures, but structures that must be inferred. This structural ambiguity
arises from interacting choices at different levels of representation (e.g. from
character sequences to meaning, or from pixels to scene interpretation). The
project will move conditional random fields (CRFs) beyond fixed graphical
structures to structures that are constructed dynamically during inference. Such
a capability will be key to building next-generation systems that solve, not
just an individual piece of a problem, but complex multi-step problems, as found
in natural language understanding and computer vision, in a unified way.
