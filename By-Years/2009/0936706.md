The Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, working with the Computer
Science Teachers Association, is establishing an ongoing working relationship
between scientists and technicians and practicing teachers through a series of
activities. One hundred K-12 teachers who work with under-represented
populations of students will attend the 2009 Grace Hopper Celebration and
participate in open forums and presentations. Other products include a white
paper designed to instigate a discussion of equity and computer science
curriculum; create knowledge sharing opportunities on concrete solutions
grounded in teachers' articulated, specific needs; and disseminate these
solutions to a broad audience of teachers, STEM practitioners, and interested
stakeholders. In addition, the PIs have made provision for evaluation to
determine the effectiveness of these solutions in classrooms that serve under-
represented student populations.
