The 2015 Barrett Lectures will be held May 13-16, 2015 at the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. This year's conference, entitled, "Stochastic
filtering, Computations and Applications" will focus on exciting developments of
stochastic filtering and its computational implementations and applications.
Stochastic filtering has experienced a rapid development in recent years due to
its flexibility to engage modeling predictions based on pertinent dynamics with
experimental data. Moreover, complex physical phenomena and formidable
engineering problems related to big data lead to an urgent need for new
theoretical establishments of filtering and novel computational implementations.
The conference will feature, Dan Crisan, Tom Kurtz and Boris Rozovsky, who will
each present three expository lectures within the realm of the thematic topic of
the Lectures. Additionally, invited plenary talks by a dynamic group of
international researchers at different stages of their career development and a
poster session will take place. This project utilizes NSF funding to support
travel and other participant costs for approximately 40 participants, giving
high priority to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career
faculty members.

The 2015 Barrett Lectures will be the 45th installment of a highly regarded
lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H.
Barrett, head of our Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969.
The Lectures are one of the longest-standing series of mathematical lectures in
the country delivered by distinguished speakers. The focus of the 45th Lectures
is the interdisciplinary impact of other mathematical methods into traditional
topics of probability, and the increasing interdisciplinary penetration of
complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big
data. A dynamic group of auspicious and prominent researchers will deliver talks
and engage in discussions to deepen our understanding of the new stochastic
filtering methodologies and theories which need to be further developed in order
to meet the challenge of new complex scientific and engineering problems of the
21st century. The link of the conference will be available at
