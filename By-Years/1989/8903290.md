Two main themes highlight this mathematical work. The first is a continuing
joint effort to analyze properties of the Laplace operator for compact
Riemannian manifolds. It is the natural differential operator which would be
used to describe the motion of the manifold under vibration. The eigenvalues of
the operator can be viewed as the fundamental frequencies. The sum of negative
powers of the eigenvalues is the associated zeta function and the derivative of
this function (evaluated at zero) is defined to be the logarithm of the
operator. The manifold is defined by means of a metric, and the logarithm is
called the height of the metric. The analysis of the height as a function of the
metric is the main objective of this component of the research. Typical of the
questions still unanswered is that of finding the hyperbolic structure of a
manifold for which the height is a minimum. Closely related to the these
questions is the fundamental isospectral problem of showing that an isospectral
set of closed surfaces or plane domains is finite. The height function was the
basic tool used in showing that isospectral sets are compact. Some type of
rigidity result must now be established to go from compact to finite. The second
theme concerns a generalization of the Schwarzian derivative to conformal
metrics and conformal mappings of higher dimensional Riemannian manifolds. This
derivative measures precisely when a function defined in a disc must be
univalent. A new definition for Riemannian manifolds has been given as a
symmetric tensor which yields a criterion for locally univalent maps from the
manifold to a sphere to be globally univalent. Some technical assumptions must
prevail. The principal remaining goal is one of showing that the injectivity
condition satisfied by the Schwarzian is also necessary.
