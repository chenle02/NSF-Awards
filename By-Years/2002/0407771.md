The purpose of the Improving Instructional and Informational Technologies to
Enhance STEM Education project is to develop and expand training and educational
opportunities in math, science, and computer technology skills. This project
will allow the college to greatly enhance and strengthen the STEM courses it
provides as well as its ability to reach and attract a larger group
of&lt;br/&gt;potential students, even at the high school level, who will have
had a greater exposure to technology as an area of study and a possible career
choice. The project provides a well- constructed implementation plan as well as
a thoughtful process for monitoring progress, relying on the input of many
stakeholders for guidance and support, and including a multi-layered process for
evaluating performance.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. To
enhance STEM curriculum at SWC&lt;br/&gt;2. To expand SWC's Computer Systems
Technology curriculum&lt;br/&gt;3. To strengthen the IT infrastructure at
SWC&lt;br/&gt;4. To provide community outreach
opportunities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project can have a profound impact in
providing a local pool of trained professionals dedicated to the growth and
development of their home community.&lt;br/&gt;
