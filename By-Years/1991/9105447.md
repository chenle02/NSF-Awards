In humans, progesterone secretion occurs during the estrous cycle and early
pregnancy. Two hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), bind to specific LH receptors on cells in the ovary and
promote ongoing hormone release by this gland. Similarities between human and
sheep luteal cells make the ewe an excellent model system for studying LH
receptor function. The goal of this project is to examine the organization of
the LH receptor complex on ovine luteal cells in the non-pregnant animal to
learn whether receptor organization affects LH receptor function. Laser-optical
techniques will be used to determine hormone binding to the LH receptor leads to
receptor self- association or association with other receptors or with other
membrane proteins. We will then examine the lipid environment near the LH
receptor. As the corpus luteum ages and eventually ceases to function, changes
in the lipid environment may result in organizational changes in the LH
receptor. These experiments will use a light-activated protein crosslinking
agent to explore changes in protein concentration within protein-rich regions of
the membrane. //
