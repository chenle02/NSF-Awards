This project will develop a cross-national data base that will enable social
scientists to analyze the role that mass values and attitudes play in sustaining
democratic institutions, and in providing support for environmental protection
policies. It brings together public opinion survey data from more than 40
societies representing 70 percent of the world's population and covering the
full range of variation, from societies with per capita incomes as low as $300
per year, to societies with incomes one hundred times that high; and from long-
established democracies to recently emerging democracies and authoritarian
states. It will also integrate these data on mass attitudes, with societal level
social and economic indicators such as income levels, literacy rates, and
presence or absence of democratic institutions. This unique data base will make
it possible to analyze the impact of mass attitudes on stable democracy; or
between economic development and worldviews of the respective publics. Because
key questions in these surveys have been asked repeatedly over a period of many
years, these data will also make it possible to analyze trends over time.
