Interdisciplinary (99) This project is adapting learning resources from a number
of sources, including an existing program in bioinformatics at Wright State
University (EIA-0122582), and work undertaken at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information and the Human Genome Project, for use in a core upper-
division bioinformatics course under development by a computer scientist and
biologist. Four teaching and learning modules suitable for both biology and
computer science students form the basis of the course. These include a set of
lesson plans incorporating in-class assignments, computer lab and biology lab
exercises, and a set of hands-on group projects. Inquiry based teaching and
learning and cooperative group projects are planned for encouraging interaction
between students from different academic backgrounds.
