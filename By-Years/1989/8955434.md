The University of North Carolina at Greensboro will initiate a two-week,
commuter, Early Alert Initiative project in mathematics, physics and computer
science for 36 eighth grade girls. In each of two cycles of the project, the
students will complete a case study on mathematics and physics topics during the
academic year, and one of six research projects (in number patterns, statistics,
computers, astronomy, energy sources, and physics of toys) during the summer.
The girls will meet once next Fall for follow-up discussion of the work. They
will learn content, research techniques, and philosophy and ethics of physics
and mathematics. They will explore careers through meeting five staff women,
five visiting women, and five undergraduate and two graduate women student in
mathematics and physics.
