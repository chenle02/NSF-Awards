This study will to examine the causes and temporal signature of changes in
permeability induced by moderate to major scale earthquakes. Almost all previous
work on examining earthquake related changes in hydrology has focused on the
time period immediately following the earthquake. This work attempts to obtain a
more definitive understanding of the coupling which exists between earthquakes
and hydrology by examining the pre-seismic, co- seismic and post-seismic
behavior of surface and ground water flow. We will examine the response of the
San Lorenzo drainage basin to the Loma Prieta earthquake (10/17/89, M 7.1) and
its major foreshocks. Because of the density of stream gaging stations in the
basin and the number of water wells in the region, this study will provide an
opportunity to examine earthquake induced hydrologic changes in detail. We
propose to examine the historical relation between stream flow and rainfall in
the region, the groundwater hydrology of the basin in detail (by chemically
sampling and hydraulically testing existing wells), and the state of stress in
the near surface sandstones and shales in the northern portion of the basin.
