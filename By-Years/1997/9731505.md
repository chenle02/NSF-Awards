The goal of this work is to understand, explain and justify the methods by which
we learn from experiments in the face of uncertainty and error. Standard
statistical methods (that involve significance tests, confidence intervals, and
the like) are in widespread use in science. But despite their widespread and
successful use in science and other spheres, such methods have been subject to
enormous philosophical controversy and criticism, giving rise to the popular
subjective Bayesian way in philosophy of science. This stark contrast between
effective research practice and philosophical analysis demands close scrutiny.
The PI will do this by applying a framework for analysis which she has developed
in the course of several publications. Briefly stated, this framework views
experiments as efforts to learn from error, with statistics contributing a
disciplined way to model patterns of irregularity that allow errors to be
distinguished from background noise. By weaving together strategies and
techniques for learning from error that are employed in fields as diverse as
statistics, engineering, physics, biology, and psychology, the PI is uncovering
strikingly similar patterns of learning from error-patterns overlooked in the
leading philosophical accounts of scientific inference.
