Edelman 9319905 This project involves a cultural anthropologist from Yale
University in a set of interviews with representatives of peasant organizations
from six central American countries: Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El
Salvador, and Guatemala. By getting information about the concerns and
experiences of members of these peasant groups, the investigator will evaluate
three theories of collective action: the historical-structural, resource
mobilization, and new social movement theories. The main hypothesis to be tested
is that the peasant movements were influenced more by grass-roots concerns than
by foreign donor influences. This research is important because emerging
connections between peasant groups, across international borders, makes a
regional perspective necessary in understanding political developments in
Central America. This project will combine in- depth anthropological knowledge
to advance our understanding of issues concerning peasant organizations with
increased knowledge of regional differences and similarities in this important
area of the hemisphere. ***
