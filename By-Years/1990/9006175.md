This award is for a minority postdoctoral fellowship to be conducted at the
University of California, Irvine. The research will identify potential
mechanisms by which peripherally acting agents affect brain processes involved
in modulating memory storage. This research holds great promise to advance our
understanding of the way that our bodies prepare our brains to learn information
that may have survival value. This postdoctoral fellowship will allow a bright
young minority student to expand his experience in neuroscience.
