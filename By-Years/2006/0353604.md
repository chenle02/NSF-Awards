This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program
at Wellesley College for 10 students in a 10-week program for 3 summers. The
program will focus on the exploration of the social roles of women, and will
expand the current undergraduate research program to include students from other
institutions. Undergraduates will collaborate on research projects with faculty
from all the social science departments (anthropology, economics, political
science, psychology, and sociology), the Women's Studies Department, and members
of the Wellesley Centers for Women. The students will engage in research
projects with faculty in which they collect and analyze data from various
sources, and prepare reports. They will present the results of their work at
weekly seminars. The students will also attend a series of workshops on
statistical analysis, obtaining and presenting electronic data, public speaking
and poster presentations, and participate in a campus-wide poster session at the
end of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will advance our knowledge
of the role that gender plays within our society. The Wellesley faculty has led
the way in providing insights on the many ways that gender affects social
dynamics. The secondary impact of the program will be the development of the
students' critical thinking and research skills. The acquisition of these
intellectual skills will complement their classroom experiences, and broaden
their ability to work independently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes
to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
