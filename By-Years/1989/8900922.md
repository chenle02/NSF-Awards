The principal investigator will conduct research on certain topics in matrix
theory. The research will concentrate on problems in generalized numerical
ranges and numerical radii; matrix norms; and linear preserver problems. This
research is in the general area of matrix theory. A matrix is a rectangular
array. Matrices can be used to represent a wide variety of situations in
mathematics, engineering, statistics, physics, economics and the life and social
sciences.
