County&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: Collaborative Research:
Integration of Data and Interfaces to Enhance Human Understanding of Government
Statistics - Toward the National Statistical Knowledge
Network&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support collaborative research with
several Federal statistical agencies to develop better statistical data models,
to explore the use of SML, to develop better map-querying tools and to integrate
other available tools for manipulating, browsing and visualizing tabular data.
The goal is to develop better human/computer interfaces for expert users to
novices, to increase general statistical literacy, and to provide seamless
access to data held by multiple Federal agencies and agencies at other levels of
government, in particular state and local data.&lt;br/&gt;
