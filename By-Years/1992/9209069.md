Unsteady aerodynamic loads are of fundamental importance in the modelling of
such phenomena as aerodynamic flutter, forces during high angle of attack air-
craft maneuvers, loads due to gusts, and unsteady forces on high speed rotor-
craft. Methods of analysis vary in accordance to the time dependence of the
forces involved. For example, the forces on a slowly oscilatting airfoil can be
adequately determined using a simple quasi-steady model. More dynamic problems,
involving high angles of attack, require numerical methods accounting for shed
vorticity (characteristics of the wake downstream of the airfoil). During the
course of study leading to a Ph.D., Mr. Diaz, under the guidance of his advisor,
Jewel Barlow, will apply a numerical method on unsteady aerodynamic research
projects currently underway at the University of Maryland. This research is
expected to ultimately lead to a better understanding of unsteady aerodynamic
effects. A two year continuing renewal award is recommended.
