The PI will develop a tool for computations in geometric topology to be called
TopDrawer. This program allows one to input and manipulate geometric diagrams.
The project also involves several Mathematical packages which are incorporated
into some calculations. The motivation for this program is the investigation of
surfaces in four dimensional space.
