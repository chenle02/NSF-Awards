IBN 94-12275 Marler & Partan Abstract Animals often communicate using both sight
and sound. Analysis of this use of two modalities presents substantial
procedural difficulties. In her doctoral dissertation research, Ms. Sarah R.
Partan will take a very exciting new approach to this problem by using TV and
audio tape. This offers the enormous advantage of allowing experimental control
over the presentation of information in the two modalities both separately and
simultaneously. This will allow Ms. Partan to begin to determine how information
is combined across modalities during the process of animal communication, thus
making an important contribution to the study of animal communication..
