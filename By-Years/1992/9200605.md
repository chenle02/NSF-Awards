This project is a feasibility investigation as outlined by the Small Grants for
Exploratory Research (SGER) program. The purpose of the project is to
investigate new concepts for masonry units and systems with consideration given
to structural behavior, field constuctibility, durability, thermal performance,
and all other performance attributes which contribute to the sufficiency,
reliability, and economy of masonry structures.
