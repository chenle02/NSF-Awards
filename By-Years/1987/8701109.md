This research program is concerned with the stability, accuracy and
effectiveness of fully discrete schemes which result from the application of
certain time-differencing schemes to semidiscrete versions of the Navier-Stokes
equations describing incompressible flow and Burgers' equation. The emphasis is
on semidiscrete approximations which are derived via the Galerkin method. The
analysis part of the research will clarify the essential features that
admissible numerical solution schemes should possess. The algorithms developed
will enable scientists and engineers to solve many technical problems in
incompressible fluid flow which cannot be solved by current techniques.
