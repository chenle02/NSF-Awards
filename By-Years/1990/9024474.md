Prof. Ault is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to isolate and characterize the important chemical intermediates which
are produced during chemical vapor deposition processes by trapping them in an
ultracold solid argon matrix and identifying their molecular structure using
spectroscopy. These studies are important to the understanding of the mechanisms
involved in chemical vapor deposition, one of the primary techniques used for
growing thin films and coatings used in the semiconductor industry for the
fabrication of microelectronic devices and in solar energy conversion
applications. The unique capabilities of the matrix isolation technique will be
exploited to isolate and characterize important chemical intermediates present
during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. These results will enhance our
knowledge of the chemical structure and bonding of these important, unusual
chemical intermediates and will lead to an increased understanding of the
homogeneous gas phase processes which are part of the reaction steps involved in
CVD. The reaction pathways and intermediates will be examined for thermal and
laser-induced CVD in III-V and II-VI semiconductor systems and also amorphous
silicon. Techniques auxiliary to matrix isolation will be employed as well,
including cryogenic thin film formation, slow warmup spectroscopy, and gas phase
infrared spectroscopy.
