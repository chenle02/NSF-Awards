This research project is directed on fundamental problems of the theory of
random matrices and random polynomials and their applications, and on related
problems in statistical physics. The cornerstone of the problems is different
conjectures of universality, which state that as the size of a random matrix (or
the degree of a random polynomial) approaches infinity, the correlations between
properly scaled eigenvalues (or zeros) approach a universal limit. In the
current project the PI continues his studies of the universality in random
matrix models, random polynomials, and statistical physics. This includes: (i)
The Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to double scaling limits in random matrix
models. (ii) RH approach to random matrices with external source. (iii)
Semiclassical asymptotics and RH approach to multi-matrix models. (iv) RH
approach to the six-vertex model of statistical physics. (v) Scaling limits and
universality in non-Gaussian ensembles of random polynomials and random
algebraic varieties.

The project has an interdisciplinary character and it lies on the frontier
between physics and mathematics. The problems of scaling and universality are
central in many areas of modern science: theory of critical phenomena and phase
transitions, statistical physics and quantum field theory, theory of quantum
chaos, nonlinear dynamics, etc. This project is directed on development of
powerful mathematical methods to the problems of scaling and universality in the
theory of random matrices, random polynomials, and related topics. It involves
different areas of mathematics: analysis, theory of integrable systems,
probability theory, semiclassical asymptotics for systems of differential
equations, complex analysis, etc. The research project under consideration has
direct applications to various physical problems: combinatorial asymptotics
related to quantum gravity, exactly solvable models of statistical physics, spin
systems on random surfaces, theory of critical phenomena and phase transitions,
quantum chaos. Possible further applications include theory of knots and links
and related problems in molecular biology, growth models, statistical data
analysis, and others.
