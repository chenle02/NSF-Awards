Access to supercomputing resources has become essential to research in a
variety of disciplines at Southern Illinois University. This proposal provides
for access through a midlevel network, CICNET, to the NSFNET Backbone Network
which in turn provides high speed access (1.5 million bits per second) to all
NSF sponsored Supercomputer Centers. The grant will cover costs of
gateway/routing equipment. The midlevel network, CICNET, will provide
communication lines to its backbone and the university will provide necessary
support and technical expertise for the operation and maintenance of the gateway
node on campus as well as information services for the scientific users at the
university.
