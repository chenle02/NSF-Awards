2008 EAPSI Fellowship&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a U.S. graduate student to
conduct an individual research project at one of seven locations in East Asia
and the Pacific region (Australia, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore,
Taiwan). The research project will provide the student with a first-hand
mentored research experience, an introduction to science and science policy
infrastructure, and an orientation to the culture and language of the location.
The primary goals of the East Asia Summer Institute program are to expose
students to science and engineering in the context of a research laboratory, and
to initiate early-career professional relationships that will foster research
collaborations with foreign counterparts in the future. &lt;br/&gt;
