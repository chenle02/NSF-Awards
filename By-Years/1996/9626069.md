This action funds NSF - Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Molecular Evolution. Gnetales, the presumed sister group to
angiosperms, have many angiosperm-like characteristics, including flower-like
reproductive units. This study focuses the evolution of the flower by
determining the expression pattern of plant homeotic genes in the Gnetophyte,
Welwitschia. It addresses the origin of flowers, the evolution of gene
expression and the molecular-developmental basis of morphological change.
