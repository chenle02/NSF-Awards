9712381 Dibble This project uses laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and quantum
chemical calculations to determine rate coefficients for the isomerization and
dissociation reactions of alkoxy radicals. These unimolecular reactions are
poorly characterized, yet alkoxy radicals commonly dissociate or isomerize
rather than reacting with molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. The competition
among these three reactions has important implications for ozone formation
throughout the troposphere. Data obtained in this study will help improve our
understanding of alkoxy radical chemistry, and aid in the study of many other
crucial atmospheric reactions involving alkoxy radicals. LIF will be used to
probe transient concentrations of alkoxy radicals. LIF in the near UV has
demonstrated enormous utility for spectroscopic and kinetic studies of alkoxy
radicals. It possesses the sensitivity and time resolution necessary to carry
out direct determination of absolute rate coefficients for isomerization and
dissociation reactions. In this study, the LIF spectra of alkoxy radicals
possessing at least four carbon atoms will be determined. The technique can
distinguish between isomers of the larger alkoxy radicals. For those alkoxy
radicals which are not amenable to study by this experimental approach, quantum
mechanical calculations will be employed to estimate the effects of structure on
reaction rates for isomerization and dissociation. Benchmark studies on species
for which experimental data is available will be used as a reference to estimate
unimolecular reaction rates not yet established by experiment.
