9314779 Guignard-Spielberg This Americas Program award will support Dr. Monique
Guignard- Spielberg, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Andres Weintrab,
of the University of Chile, in a research collaboration to design efficient
solution methods for management problems in North American and Chilean forests.
Medium to long range integrated management decisions, such as timber cutting,
building of access roads, timber transportation, and others, must be made in the
presence of environmental constraints such as wildlife habitats and cutting
areas. Research results will provide foresters with better tools for devising
efficient solution methods in the face of these constraints and will advance the
state of the art in solving hard combinatorial programming problems. Efficient
management of natural resources is becoming increasingly important around the
world and in Chile in particular, with its strong forestry industry. For this
project, the Chilean side will focus on heuristics and the design and
development of special codes intimately bound to the forestry environment, while
the U.S. side will concentrate on efficient modelling, obtaining tight bounds on
the integer optima via Lagrangean techniques and designing Lagrangean
heuristics. ***
