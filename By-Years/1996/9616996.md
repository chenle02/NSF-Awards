This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the Very High Performance
Backbone Network Service (vBNS). Applications include scalable extended
computing environments, remote sensing data analysis, brain mapping, automatic
target recognition, numerical simulation of nematic liquid crystals, digital
cardiography, teleconferencing technology, and virtual reality user interfaces.
Collaborating institutions include Cornell Theory Center, Pittsburgh
Supercomputer Center, several NASA facilities, Naval Research Laboratory,
California Institute of Technology, University of North Carolina and University
of Utah.
