The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project lies in the diversion of
fats, oils and grease (FOG) from landfill disposal to be reused as fuel in a low
cost and environmentally friendly approach. The use of the technology will also
potentially reduce sewer pipe blockage. Presently, approximately 4 billion
pounds of trap grease and 2.7 billion pounds of used cooking oil are produced
each year which can potentially yield nearly 500 million gallons of fuel. This
is a significant addition to the total current biodiesel production of roughly
1,200 million gallons per year. This technology will greatly reduce waste
disposal costs for commercial food processors, restaurants and fat rendering
facilities. It can also offer biodiesel producers a low cost
feedstock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-corps project will explore the commercial
potential of a solvent-free extraction approach which can overcome the
challenges of fats, oils and grease (FOG) emulsion, namely the impurities and
high moisture content of the sewer grease. The approach does not use chemicals
or solvents new to the current biodiesel process. Separate moisture removal
processes are needed unlike other competing technologies. As a result of these
two advantages, this process is expected to have lower energy consumption and
lower costs than existing processes.
