This award supports the improvement of instrumentation and techniques that can
be used for measurement of movement of cell membrane proteins based on time-
resolved phosphorescence anisotropy and fluorescence depletion anisotropy.
Improved instrumentation will result from introduction of a high pulse rate
diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser, low rearm-time digitizers, two-channel data
acquisition and improved electronics. Improvements in detector gating for time-
domain measurements will be explored by a combination of direct optical gating
and low after-pulsing strategies for photomultiplier gating. This is expected to
permit examination of rotational relaxations occurring within a few
microseconds. The implementation of frequency-domain and "continuous" versions
of fluorescence depletion anisotropy will be explored for examination of weakly-
expressed cell surface proteins. Improvements will be evaluated by measuring
protein rotation on a consistent test system, namely the Type I Fc receptor on
2H3 mast cells. Improvements in the ability to measure the dynamics of membrane
proteins should provide greater understanding of the function of membrane-bound
receptors and other proteins whose ability to move within the membrane is key to
their role in intracellular signaling and other important biological processes.
