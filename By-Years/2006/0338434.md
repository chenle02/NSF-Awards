The PI's propose to develop a new sensor suite which will be capable of
measuring key chemical and biological/bio-optical variables that will complement
physical data currently collected. The sensors will be designed to allow them to
be interfaced with a variety of autonomous sampling platforms (e.g., moorings,
offshore platforms, towers, AUVs, gliders, drifters, and profiling floats) and
for real-time and near real-time data telemetry. The PI's will develop and test
the proto-type sensors on existing testbed moorings.

The Multi-disciplinary Ocean Sensors for Environmental Analysis and Networks
(MOSEAN) project will focus on development of new technologies to increase
observations that are essential for solving interdisciplinary oceanographic
problems. Examples include: biogeochemical cycling, climate change effects,
ocean pollution, harmful algal blooms, ocean ecology, and underwater visibility.
