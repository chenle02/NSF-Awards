An astronomy concentration is being developed for majors within the Physics
Department, and an astronomy minor is being instituted for other students. The
centerpiece of this program is a new observatory being built just south of the
main campus. This project involves the purchase a 16" telescope, a CCD camera
and photometric filters, and a video printer for the new obsertatory. This
equipment is being used to establish a modest research program to observe
variable stars. In addition to providing useful data, this program is serving to
train students in modern astronomical research techniques and telescope
operation. Future plans for the observatory include the expansion of the
observing program into the infrared for upper-level undergraduate research
projects, and the addition of an array of small telescopes for the introductory
astronomy courses and laboratories.
