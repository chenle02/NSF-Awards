The University of California at Davis has been awarded a grant to evaluate
Stress-Induced DNA Duplex Destabilization (SIDD) in Microbial genomes as a means
to identify and analyze regulatory regions in the DNA. It will analyze all fully
sequenced prokaryotic and archaeal genomes and determine the associations
between SIDD sites and known regulatory sites. In particular, (1) destabilized
regions will be computed for all known microbial genomes; (2) these regions will
be compared with experimentally verified promoter regions, and the roles of
destabilization for a variety of regulatory process assessed; (3) the
relationship between destabilized regions and gene expression will be analyzed;
(4) candidate regions for binding-induced transmission of destabilization will
be computed for E. coli and other model organisms for a number of regulatory
binding proteins, and (5) SIDD will be used to develop a method to predict
promoter sites and replication origins and to identify small functional RNA
genes locations.
