9315108 Richards In some short-period Algol binary star systems, a stream of
material falls from the secondary onto the primary star. This effect is
observable as emission in various spectral lines. The investigator will continue
investigating this effect using profiles of the H-alpha line obtained at the
National Solar Observatory. The observations indicate the existence of a rapidly
rotating component, a high temperature accretion region, a high density region
between the stars and an accretion disk around the primary. ***
