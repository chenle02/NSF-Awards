Number theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with studying the integers,
and more specifically, the primes. The Prime Number Theorem (which describes the
distribution of the primes among the positive integers) was proved in 1896
independently by Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin by understanding certain
properties of the Riemann zeta-function. The Riemann zeta-function and its
generalizations, called L-functions, are ubiquitous yet mysterious functions in
number theory. These functions can be defined in association with a plethora of
mathematical objects, including Dirichlet characters, number fields, and
elliptic curves. Understanding the location of the zeros of L-functions is a
central problem in all of mathematics. While we cannot presently prove the
Riemann Hypothesis, posed by Riemann in 1859, there are many fruitful
investigations to pursue to better understand the zeros of L-functions. In
particular, the vertical distribution of the zeros of L-functions has deep
connections to two other central problems: the class number problem, which has
its beginnings in the work of Gauss, and the possibility of a special type of
counterexample to the (Generalized) Riemann Hypothesis. These hypothetical
counterexamples are called Landau-Siegel zeros, and presently their existence
cannot be ruled out.

More specifically, this project will pursue problems in the intersection of
analytic and algebraic number theory. It will study applications related to the
Chebotarev density theorem for families of L-functions, the vertical
distribution of zeros of L-functions, and class numbers of number fields. The
activities of the project will also have broader impacts in terms of mentoring
both graduate and undergraduate students in a liberal arts setting.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
