This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will develop in situ,
steam sterilizable, amperometric sensors for bioreactor control in the
pharmaceutical, food/beverage and fermentation industries. At this time, in situ
sensors for bioprocessing applications are not commonly available. Glucose
concentrations can change drastically within minutes in bioreactors. In situ
real time monitoring will provide the missing tool for effective bioprocess
control. In Phase I a prototype in situ sensor was shown to monitor reliably the
glucose concentration in E. coli fermentations. Importanty, the sensor housing,
consisting of a stainless steel holder and an autoclavable membrane, was
demonstrated to be capable of monitoring sterility for severa1 days and was
highly resistant to fouling. In Phase II, the sensor chemistry will be made
robust, its structure and components manufacturable at low cost, its range of
analyses expanded to include, in addition to glucose, lactate and glutamate.
Moreover the sensor will be tested, in addition to E. coli fermentations, in
fermentation of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Streptomyces, a mycelial
organism. Membranes and monolithic, injection molded insert structure will be
designed for high reliability and manufacturability. At the end of Phase II,
prototype sensors for beta testing will be available for testing by the
biotechnology industry.
