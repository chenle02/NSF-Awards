Title: Nonlinear stability of multidimensional structures in Fluid Dynamics

ABSTRACT

The first goal of the project is to investigate the small viscosity limit for
the Navier-Stokes equations. A long-standing question in shock wave mathematics
is to show that curved multidimensional shock solutions to the Euler equations
can be obtained as limits of smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.
Another goal is to study the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions
(like strong detonations) to the Chapman-Jouget and ZND models of combustion,
and to clarify when and how well solutions to these simplified models
approximate true exact solutions of the full Navier-Stokes-combustion system.
The proposed research will also examine the neutral stability regime for both
shocks and vortex sheets, and in particular will attempt to provide a rigorous
foundation for the theory of Artola and Majda which describes the development of
kink modes leading to roll-up in supersonic vortex sheets.

The proposer intends to carry out a rigorous investigation of the existence and
nonlinear stability of certain important multidimensional structures arising in
the mathematical study of compressible fluids. These structures include shock
waves, detonation fronts, and vortex sheets. There is a vast applied literature
on these topics, but until relatively recently they have resisted rigorous
mathematical analysis, particularly in the multidimensional case. In recent work
by the proposer, his collaborators, and others new tools have become available
that permit a rigorous study of the highly singular perturbation problems that
arise in investigating the stability of such structures.
