Recent theoretical and observational studies by the principal investigator and
others support the view that cyclogenesis represents the rapid transient growth
of favorably configured, or "optimal", perturbations of atmospheric flow.
Results suggest that elements of this theoretical model may have wider
application, namely, to the origin of synoptic scale waves and the maintenance
of their variance in simple flows. This also could extend to the role of spatial
and temporal flow inhomogeneity in organizing variance into storm tracks. Dr.
Farrell will employ the stochastic dynamic equations associated with the
barotropic and quasi- geostrophic models for this investigation. In addition,
Dr. Farrell will continue his investigations into the limits of predictability
of atmospheric flows using optimal perturbation techniques. He seeks to clarify
the role of the background flow in determining the rate of perturbation growth
(and decreased predictability). This area of research has important implications
for, and potential to improve, weather forecasting.
