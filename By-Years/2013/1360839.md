A fundamental mission of the Documenting Endangered Language Program is to
create digital infrastructure that provides scientists and endangered-language
community members access to threatened language data. Countless extant records
of endangered languages worldwide are in need of curation with input from
linguists and the speaker-communities. April Counceller and Alisha Drabek of the
Alutiiq Heritage Foundation will work with a strong team of community members,
linguists, archivists, and museum curators to build a comprehensive database of
one highly endangered language, Kodiak Alutiiq spoken in coastal Alaska (Alaska
Peninsula to Prince William Sound). This database will include existing audio
recordings with enhanced metadata, additional data from 33 remaining speakers,
and a speaker registry recording when and how each speaker acquired the
language. A major part of the project will be to educate Alutiiq speakers on
metadata terminology so that materials can continue to be curated and located
with ease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key to improved language documentation and
linguistic discovery is access to language data from a variety of genres, ages,
and styles since each data sample provides a different view of language
structure. The proposed Alutiq database, created using the innovative Mukurtu
Content Management System for endangered language data, will be a model for
other communities on how to create a rich corpus for linguistic analysis and
community use and how to curate data. It will provide data access and search
capabilities. The project will fill gaps in the database by recording missing
genres or interaction-types from speakers. The database will be easily
accessible through the Alutiiq Museum and the Alaska Native Language Archive
websites.
