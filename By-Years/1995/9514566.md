9514566 Dytman Studies of near-threshold pion production in nucleon-nucleon
collisions will be carried out at the IUCF cooler ring. These experiments
concentrate on measurements of analyzing powers utilizing a polarized proton
beam. The data will quantify the s- wave strength in the production process,
thereby permitting theorists to test their models of heavy meson exchange and/or
off- energy-shell effects in nucleon-nucleon interactions - a topic of
significant current interest. The group will also continue to play a leading
role in the construction of the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)
detecter, with the construction of the Region I drift chambers. They are also
leaders in defining the physics of the nucleon resonance program at CLAS. Upon
completion of the CLAS detector in 1997, the Pittsburgh group will be major
contributors to the production and analysis phase, both as spokesman and as
collaborators. They are scheduled to run for 168 days of production. ***
