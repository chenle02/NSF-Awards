In this EAGER proposal, the investigators seek to discover factors that affect
developmental learning processes when children begin to acquire concepts of
basic biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators hypothesize that
individual differences in children's learning of intuitive biology are partly
due to differences in their executive function (EF) abilities. EF includes the
set of general cognitive processes, such as working memory, conflict monitoring,
and inhibition. The research will include testing young children's and elder
Americans' knowledge of natural selection as well as their executive functioning
capabilities. The hypothesis will be tested by administering a battery of
cognitive tests (to examine differences in EF) and through interviews with
children ages 5-8 and elder adults about basic biological concepts such as the
life cycle and properties of living things. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this
hypothesis proves to be true, it would suggest a new or competing explanation
for how misconceptions are formed and possibly be "corrected" throughout the
life span. The project is potentially transformative in its position relative to
the research literature and in terms of the implications it may have for
instructional materials, teaching, and learning.
