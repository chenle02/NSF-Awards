This award supports cooperative research in amorphous metal alloys as catalysts
for fuel cells to be carried out by A.J. Appleby, S. Srinivasan and O.J. Murphy
at Texas A&amp;M University, aided by R.B. Schwarz and A. Redondo of Los Alamos
National Laboratory, and W.E. Triaca and C. Giordana of the National University
of La Plata in Argentina. In addition, the U.S.-Argentina cooperation will be
extended to a trilateral effort with Brazil by including E.R. Gonzalez and L.A.
Avaca at the University of Sao Paulo. Together, they will investigate the
effects of crystalline orientation and morphology on the electrocatalysis of
fuel cell reactions. The work will focus on oriented surfaces of platinum as an
electrocatalyst for aqueous electrolyte and solid polymer electrolyte fuel
cells. Amorphous metallic alloys, a new class of materials with promise as
stable catalysts will be prepared and characterized and electrode kinetics will
be investigated. A multidisciplinary approach to this work is required,
including electrochemistry, surface science, materials science and theoretical
chemistry. At Texas A&amp;M, special high-vacuum systems will be used to
synthesize the materials, while the electrochemical studies will be pursued in
both Argentina and Brazil. In this way the facilities and personnel of all three
institutions will contribute to this truly collaborative project.
