CTS - 9622473 Eva Marand Virginia Poly. Inst &amp; State U. ABSTRACT The project
deals with the development and characterization of polymer-ceramic composite
membranes. A highly cross-linked titanate network will be incorporated into a
polyimide matrix via in-situ polymerization of titanium alkoxide. The formation
of hydrogen bonds in the composite enhances thermo-mechanical stability and may
improve selectivity at higher temperature. Gas transport properties will be
correlated to membrane fabrication properties. Thermal, spectroscopic and
microscopic methods will be used to characterize the membranes in terms of
stability, microstructure, fractional free volume and specific molecular
interactions. Potential applications of the composite membranes include high-
temperature gas separations and catalysis for chemical manufacturing.
