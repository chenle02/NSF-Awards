This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes
to solve a critical problem in the world of mission critical computing: the
problem of data storage. The goal of this project is to design a fundamentally
new distributed data storage system that improves the reliability and
scalability, while driving down the cost, of mission critical systems. This
project will design an interlocking data storage mesh that is self-organizing,
self-healing, and self-managing. This project will build on research into the
design of distributed systems that led to the development of a fundamentally
new, mission critical computing technology called Hive Computing.

The prices of commodity computers have fallen to such a degree that in many
cases it makes the most sense to regard them as disposable, not precious. The
problem is that, while this trend is beginning to drive down the cost of compute
power, it has not yet affected the world of data storage. As a result, only a
relatively small number of businesses and other organizations can afford the
high costs of reliability and scalability. The development of the Hive data
storage system will solve this problem and produce a number of significant
benefits, one of them being that now more businesses would be able to afford the
cost of reliability, leading to dramatic reductions in downtime and significant
productivity improvements. More scientists would be able to scale their systems,
increasing the number and types of questions they could ask and the problems
they could solve.
