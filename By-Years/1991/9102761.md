This project will produce theoretical and numerical results on interior point
methods for linear programming and other mathematical programming problems.
Specific objectives include: a) Development of a primal-dual algorithm that not
only possesses the currently best optimal complexity bound but also the best
achievable asymptotic convergence rate. b) Development of techniques that can
effectively utilize available information at each iteration and overall
efficiency, and c) Development of techniques that effectively handle the
singularity at non-vertex or degenerate vertex solutions. The methodology for
this research will constantly combine numerical experimentation with theoretical
analysis, and will study primal-dual interior point linear programming
algorithms from the point of view of solving a nonlinear system of equations.
Results of this project shall have a significant impact in the design of
telecomunication networks, large scale logistic planning, and scheduling.
