This award provides partial support for the purchase of a confocal laser
scanning microscope (CLSM) with spectral imaging capabilities, and an image
analysis system to be housed in the Division of Biological Sciences-Microscopy
and Imaging Facility at the University of California, Davis Campus. The
instrument will enhance several research projects in basic and applied plant
biology, including: (i) Elucidation of the molecular constituents that comprise
the unique plasmodesmata-based non-cell-autonomous translocation pathway of
plants, (ii) Characterization of the pathways involved in establishing cell fate
in Arabidopsis organs, (iii) Identification of the Arabidopsis genes required
for gametogenesis and embryogenesis, (iv) Molecular basis of ovule development
and evolution, (v) Analysis of Aux/IAA degradation in plants, (vi) Regulation of
compound leaf development. (vii) Phytochrome engineering in living cells, (viii)
The role of molecular motors in the phragmoplast and during cotton fiber
development, (ix) Identification of endogenous and viral component involved in
plant systemic infection, (x) Analysis of signal transduction pathways
underlying the operation of a tonoplast transport systems involved in plant
response to salt stress, and (xi) Kinase signaling in the XA21-mediated plant
defense response.
