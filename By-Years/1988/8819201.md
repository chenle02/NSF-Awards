The primary objective of this U. S.-Romania cooperative research project
between Dr. George Palade of Yale University and Dr. Nicolae Siminonescue of the
Institute for Cellular Biology and Pathology, Bucharest, is to study the
mechanism of transport of glycated proteins across the continuous endothelium in
various tissues. Using glycation, a non-enzymatic chemical modification in
circulating blood plasma of diabetic animals, endothelia cell proteins will be
evaluated and characterized. The intent is to identify modified proteins on the
endothelial plasmalemma of different vessels. Results of these efforts should
contribute to our basic knowledge of normal as well as abnormal endothelial
functioning and findings may have bearing on future research addressing vascular
lesions associated with diabetes. This project in cell biology fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
