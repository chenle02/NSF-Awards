Grinnell College is establishing a laser facility with equipment necessary to
integrated the study of lasers and modern optics into the physics curriculum.
The physics department is equipping a laser facility with simple, reliable laser
systems whose capabilities can be fully used by undergraduates. The equipment
includes multi-color and open-frame helium-neon lasers, optical spectrum
analyzers, power meters, optical mounting hardware, and materials for building
two general-purpose diode laser controllers and a carbon dioxide laser. With
this equipment the department is developing lecture demonstrations that will
interest and motivate introductory (and non-science major) students to learn
about basic laws of light, color, and vision; developing laboratory experiments
to be carried out by students in intermediate and advanced physics courses to
examine lasers and their properties; and providing the opportunity for advanced
students to engage in independent study and laser-construction projects that
will help to prepare them for graduate study of careers in industry. The
equipment allows three levels of instruction, from observation of demonstrations
through use of lasers in the laboratory and study of the laser itself and thus
gives beginning students some background in an important area of physics while
allowing advanced undergraduates to understand lasers as a basic piece of
scientific instrumentation. The college is matching the award with an equal
amount of funds.
