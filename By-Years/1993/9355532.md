9355532 Baxter Integrating Science Concepts enhances the scientific literacy and
teaching of K- 8 teachers in Eugene School District 4J. Teachers develop skills
in creating and presenting constructivist, activity-based instruction that
integrates science with other disciplines. The first year 16 master teachers
participate in a 15 day summer workshop with project staff, Willamette Science
and Technology Center and Oregon State University experts in pedagogy, and
University of Oregon scientists. In the following years these master teachers
and project staff work with an additional 72 mentor teachers to develop the
skills and knowledge to teach peers. Workshop activities include hands-on
scientific investigations focusing on particular science concepts, critical
analysis of exemplary concept-based science curricula, and participants' design
of concept-based science units to use in classrooms. Regularly scheduled follow-
up sessions support teachers in implementing these units.
