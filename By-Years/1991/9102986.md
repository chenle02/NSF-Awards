This research project examines two areas where ion implantation can be employed
to improve surface properties, oxidation of nickel- chromium alloys and
corrosion of stainless steels. It is believed that the implantation creates a
one-thousand Angstrom layer that is amorphous on these alloys. Implanting
yttrium ions into nickel- chromium alloys improves the resistance to oxidation,
and the mechanisms of this improvement are under investigation. Phosphorous ion
implantation of stainless steel produces an amorphous layer over a very narrow
range of fluences. The extent to which the improved corrosion resistance depends
on homogeneity of the amorphous phase and on small amounts of second phases that
form is under study. Transmission electron microscopy is used in both instances
to examine the structure of the implanted layers, recrystallization tendencies,
chemistry, and defect structures. %%% Ion implantation can be used to create
microstructures and chemical distributions not attainable by other means. This
project should clarify the mechanisms by which surface ion implantation can be
employed to improve oxidation and corrosion resistance of metal alloys.
