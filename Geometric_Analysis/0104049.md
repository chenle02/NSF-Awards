Abstract for NSF proposal DMS 0104049 (Leon Simon \& Brian White joint P.I.'s)

Leon Simon plans to pursue various questions related to the structure of the
singular sets of minimal submanifolds and energy minimizing maps, including the
extension of his recent work on construction of singular examples of minimal
hypersurfaces. A current aim is to construct examples of minimal submanifolds
with singular sets which include ``gaps'' and other phenomena, the possibility
of which is left open by his previous general work on the structure of the
singular set. He is also proposing to complete work on the singular set of mod-2
currents to show that, in all dimensions, the top-dimensional part of the
singular set locally lies in a finite union of continuously differentiable
submanifolds. Simon also proposes to pursue several questions related to
asymptotics on approach to singularities. Brian White plans to study how
regularity properties and singular structure for minimizing chains with
coefficients in a metric group depend on the group and its metric. This includes
study of immiscible fluid interfaces as a special case. He also plans to
investigate singularities in the mean-curvature flow. He will continue his
investigations of 2-dimensional minimal surfaces, in particular concerning
branch points and concerning total boundary curvature.

An understanding of singularities, and how singularities are formed, is a
fundamental element in our overall understanding of many physical and geometric
phenomena. For example, in cosmology singularities of space-time (e.g. ``black
holes'') play a fundamental role. Likewise in the study of the ``canonical''
objects which arise naturally in topology and geometry, singularities arise in a
very natural and unavoidable manner, and the understanding of these
singularities is an absolutely fundamental problem. As with most non-linear
phenomena, there is not a single general theory which applies in a wide range of
different contexts. Rather, each different context has its own collection of
effective techniques, and it is the development and application of such
techniques in the context of the geometric calculus of variations which is the
focus of the present research proposal. Specifically, Simon and White propose to
continue their efforts toward a complete understanding of singularities, and how
they are formed, in the context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy
minimizing maps. Such techniques are likely to be applicable to the study of
other objects of geometric and physical significance---for example to the study
of immiscible fluid interfaces, soap-films, and the equilibrium free surfaces of
fluids.
