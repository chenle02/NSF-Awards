This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Western Washington
University supports the research of Professor David L. Patrick. The research
focuses on measurement of microscopic properties of lipid vesicles and related
membrane systems. A new method is under development which would enable direct
measurement of chemical and physical properties of free-standing bilayer and
multilamellar lipid films. The approach combines atomic force microscopy with a
micropipette-based technique to enable simultaneous measurement of microscopic
and macroscopic properties on unsupported films. The approach for study of free-
standing lipid films could be extended to other systems, including biomembranes
and amphiphilic films at oil/water interfaces. This research provides
information on nanometer-scale structural, mechanical, and chemical properties
of lipid films, helping to forge links in our understanding of the connection
between microscopic phenomena and the large-scale behavior.
