9318568 Miller Many studies have detected enzymes in fungi (fungi that are
symbiotically associated with the roots of trees) that may decompose organic
matter in laboratory studies. Other studies imply that these symbiotic fungi are
not capable of such decomposition in the field even though they may outgrow true
saprotrophic fungi in the soil. Several possibilities exist for this apparent
contradiction. The symbiotic association may alter the behavior of mycorrhizal
fungi so that enzyme production is not possible. Another possibility is that
ectomycorrhizal fungi may only be able to decompose organic matter during times
when sugars produced by their host are not being produced in sufficient
quantities. At such times, the saprotrophic machinery of mycorrhizal fungi may
be able to obtain energy along with required mineral elements from organic
substrates. A third possibility is that at least some reports of enzymatic
activity in the laboratory are subject to criticism because the research has
been accomplished under conditions that are very different from what would most
likely be encountered by these fungi. We propose to examine the mechanisms of
ectomycorrhizal fungi that may allow them to better compete with saprotrophic
fungi. We will accomplish this by conducting experiments in the laboratory using
specially designed root chambers that allow growth and manipulation of a portion
of the fungus separate from the roots and rooting substrate while still in
symbiosis with the tree. This approach will allow us to investigate the
saprotrophic reposes by ectomycorrhizal fungi at a level that heretofore has not
been achieved. ***
