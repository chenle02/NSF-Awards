This research program is concerned with the general area of numerical solutions
for partial differential equations. At this time the program is focussed in
three areas within the general field: 1. Vortex methods. 2. Domain
decomposition. 3. Random choice method for flows in porous media. The research
results will have applications in fluid engineering and petroleum engineering.
