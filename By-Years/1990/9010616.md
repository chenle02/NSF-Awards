This is a RUI proposal to involve undergraduate engineering students in
neurophysiology research. The project is to record from cells of the hippocampus
of freely-moving rats during the preweaning and postweaning periods. The
responses to paired electrical stimulation will be used to characterize the
development of facilitatory and inhibitory modulation of the studied cells. The
proposed project is unique in that neurophysiological correlates of behavior can
be obtained by the use of unanesthetized and freely moving animals. The research
will lead to an improved understanding of the basic physiology of maturation,
and it will also involve engineering undergraduates in significant life sciences
research.
