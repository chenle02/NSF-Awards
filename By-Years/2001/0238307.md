This project addresses fundamental materials science issues relevant to
potential utilization of organic semiconductors in thin film electronics. In
addition to structural factors, such as defect density and domain boundaries,
charge carrier mobility is the primary figure of merit in these ma-terials, and
is ultimately determined by the electronic band structure and carrier
localization dy-namics. The central scheme of this proposal is to use
femtosecond two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE) to establish electronic
band structure and electron localization dynamics in organic semiconductor
crystals, thin films, and at their interfaces with metals, and to probe struc-
ture-property relationship in these systems.&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The
project addresses fundamental research issues associated with organic electronic
materials having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is
the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education.
This project will support graduate, un-dergraduate, and post-doctoral
researchers providing training in an exciting and interdisciplinary field
spanning materials science, chemistry, solid-state physics, and laser
spectroscopy. Addi-tionally, the academic and industrial collaborative nature of
the project provides special opportu-nities for students.&lt;br/&gt;***
