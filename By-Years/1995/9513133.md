9513133 Grossman This award supports a three year cooperative research project
between Dr. Arthur Grossman of the Carnegie Institution of Washington at Palo
Alto and a group led by Dr. Hideaki Usuda at Teikyo University in Tokyo. This
project brings together two groups with very different disciplines. Usuda and
his group are using physiological tools to examine changes in metabolic
processes during the acclimation of a unicellular green algae to phosphorus
limitation. Grossman's group is more focused on molecular technology and how
that technology can be used to define the molecular details of acclimation to
nutrient limitation. Grossman and two graduate students will visit japan to help
initiate molecular work at Teikyo University and acquire the skills for
quantifying physiological processes. The project brings together workers with
complementary skills. There will be a valuable exchange of both technical and
conceptual information that will be important for both short and long term
interactions. Therefore, this collaboration fulfills the objectives of the
Program by promoting the exchange of scientific knowledge and promising to
result in a long term productive interaction with the Japanese scientific
community. ***
