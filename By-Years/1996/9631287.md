ABSTRACT 9631287 This award will provide funds for an enhanced applied
mathematics PhD program at the University of Delaware by incorporating an
internship at a suitable government laboratory or industrial site. The applied
mathematics group at the University of Delaware is eager to develop its
relationships with industrial contacts more fully, both to tap a rich source of
ideas and problems and also to enhance graduate education. With real practical
experience in an industrial setting, graduate students will have better training
and increased flexibility of employment. The Principal Investigators plan an
industrial internship program with some key industrial contacts who have agreed
to accept suitable interns and help develop the program. The bulk of the funds
to be awarded will finance enough graduate interns to allow the program to
demonstrate its viability by establishing a reputation and portfolio of
successful projects. The goal is to have a vibrant and self sufficient program
that can expand to include students from all the applied mathematics faculty.
This award is consistent with the GOALI activity, in that the funding awarded is
centered on the activity of graduate students who will be in real industrial
settings.
