This proposal will support the improvements of and further developments for
computer programs that apply maximum likelihood (statistical) techniques in the
area of quantitative genetics. The specific goals will be the simplification of
the program's use, improved convergence behavior of the program, and expansion
of general capability for statistical testing. By greatly facilitating
quantitative genetic studies, this work is likely to have a broad impact in the
biological and behavioral sciences.
