This research examines the utility of several validity assessment techniques for
differentiating between children's accounts of true and false events. Several
techniques have been developed to assess the validity of people's accounts of
events, however most of these techniques (a) have been developed for use with
adults and not children, (b) have not been extensively tested with children, and
(c) do not incorporate relevant principles of cognitive development. This
project tests the hypothesis that with children, validity assessment techniques
are more successful at discriminating between accounts of familiar versus
unfamiliar events than between accounts of true versus false events. Two studies
will be conducted to test the utility of several validity assessment techniques
for discriminating between true and false events with events that are familiar
or unfamiliar to children. In the first study the event recalled is one
experimentally introduced to the participants. In the second study the event
recalled is a forensically relevant one -- a stressful and invasive medical
procedure that has been experienced by each participating child or not. This
research will contribute to the development of theories of cognitive development
that apply to a wide range of memory tasks that operate during every-day
cognition. More immediately, the proposed research will help researchers, legal
professionals, and social service agents discriminate between children's
accounts of real-world events that did occur versus those that did not occur.
