This project will develop free, open-source software to support the workflow and
administration of electronic research journals. Even though the Web has made is
easy to disseminate scientific journals, there are still very significant
barriers and costs to producing electronic scientific journals. These costs,
which are primarily administrative, include managing the workflow involved in
receiving articles, responding to authors, recruiting reviewers, etc. Currently
there is a lack of free, open-source software to support these critical
administrative tasks. This project aims to fill that void. The fresults of this
project have the potential for significant broader impacts on science through
its enabling the timely and frictionless dissemination of new scientific
knowledge.
