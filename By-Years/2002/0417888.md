The 6th International Symposium on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy will
be held on May 16-21, 2004 in Cocoa Beach, Florida. This conference will be
unique in its focus on the experiment technique rather than upon specific
applications. Impedance spectroscopy has been used in a rich area of
interdisciplinary scientific research related to corrosion, electrochemical
kinetics and mechanisms, electronic and ionic conducting polymers,
semiconducting electrodes, semiconductors, solid electrolytes, electronic
conductors, batteries, fuel cells, and biological or biomedical systems. New and
improved techniques are being developed which allow advanced measurements and
interpretations of data. Topics will include corrosion-resistant coatings,
electrodeposition, energy storage, fuel cells, bio- and solid-state systems,
conducting polymers, mechanisms and kinetics, and instrumentation. The objective
of this proposal is to subsidize participation of graduate students. This
special opportunity will allow students to benefit from discussions with experts
in areas outside their own research emphases.
