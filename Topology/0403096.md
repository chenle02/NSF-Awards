Abstract

Award: DMS-0403096 Principal Investigator: Selman Akbulut

The Gokova Geometry-Topology Conferences are a series of annual conferences held
in Gokova, Turkey since 1992. The international scientific committee selects
topics over a wide range of geometry and topology. Many of the participants are
junior researchers or graduate students, often making their first international
presentations.

This award supports U.S. participants in three years of meetings. Up to date
information on Gokova Conference programs and schedules is available at
http://www.math.metu.edu.tr/~gokova/.
