This project will continue studying descending tidal layers. The PI intends to
study the composition of layers and how the composition changes as the layer
descends in altitude. The layers should also be information sources on the
dominant tidal modes of the lower thermosphere. Specifically, he wishes to
question: (1) conditions required for formation of the layers, (2) how and when,
during its descent, metallic ions enter a layer, and (3) how climatological
representations of descending layers compare with the theory of tides in the
lower thermosphere.***
