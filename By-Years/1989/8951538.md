The Oceanography course for non-science majors will be improved through the
purchase of up-to-date oceanographic equipment. Students will participate in a
weekend cruise on an oceanographic vessel. Using two ships per day, four field
trips per course, 200 students can benefit. The equipment request includes
salinometer-temperature-depth meters, electrodeless salinometers, a precision
digital thermometer, a current meter, and three types of sediment samplers. On
shore, students will analyze their data to understand relationships among
chemical, biological, geological, and physical processes in the oceans. The
equipment will also be used by majors in upper division oceanography courses.
The university will provide 50% matching funds.
