9510082 Roberts This work is supported by a Research Planning Grant for Women
Scientists and Engineers Award. Appropriate Volterra equation formulations for a
variety of new problems will be examined with tools from applied, functional and
asymptotic analysis. This research seeks, for example, sufficient conditions for
the onset of the phenomena, lower and upper limits for the critical time, the
behavior of the solution in the key limit and the nature of the blow-up
(quenching, absorption) set. The National Science Foundations mandate to ensure
the vitality of the Nations scientific enterprise includes concern for the
quality, composition, distribution and effectiveness of the human resource base
in science and engineering. Within this context, the Foundation is committed to
enhancing the current rate of participation of women in science and engineering
careers, in general, and as active participants in all of its programs. Research
Planning Grant awards are made: (1) to help increase the number of new women
investigators participating in NSFs research programs; and, (2) to facilitate
preliminary studies and other activities related to the development of
competitive research projects and proposals by women who have not previously had
independent Federal research funding. Research Planning Grants are one-time
awards that may be used for preliminary work to determine the feasibility of a
proposed line of inquiry, and/or for other activities that will facilitate
proposal development.
