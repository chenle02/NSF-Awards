9613698 Noakes This project will fund researchers at the Center for Applied
Isotope Studies (CAIS) to improve the state of the art for instrumentation and
techniques used to assess the environmental impacts of sediment-associated
contaminants. This research will enable rapid, large-scale surveys of
contaminated distributions to be conducted in conjunction with detailed process
studies of contaminant pore water- sediment partitioning and seafloor-bottom
water exchange. The result will be a rapid and cost-effective approach to
investigate relationships between the fate, distribution, and bioavailability of
sediment-associated contaminants that can be performed over geographic regions
having a broad areal extent. The first phase of the research is to create an
experimental model for laboratory and field testing and evaluation. During the
second year of the project, the experimental systems will be field tested and
evaluated for performance at a site in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. ***
