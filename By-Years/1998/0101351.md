This project will extend the results of the PI's previous model for energetic
electrons at geosynchronous orbit to cover the entire inner magnetosphere from
3-10 R. It will also determine the physical basis of the correlation between the
solar wind speed and electron flux enhancements. The magnetic storm events
chosen for detailed study by the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program
campaign on the Inner Magnetosphere and Storms will be used to compare the
results of the modeling effort to the measured data. Particular emphasis will be
placed on the question of whether the transport and energization of the
electrons can be accounted for as a result of diffusion or whether other
mechanisms are required.
