Under this award the PIs will investigate the accretionary, structural, and
thermal evolution of slow-spreading crust, at the Atlantis Bank oceanic core
complex, east of the Atlantis II transform on the Southwest Indian Ridge. They
will determine the timing and processes of crustal growth and accretion at very
slow spreading ridges, and place constraints on the processes of detachment
faulting and uplift of oceanic core complexes, and transverse ridges. They will
undertake thermochronometry and geophysical modeling. The thermochronometry will
include: 1.Single zircon U/Pb dating to define the emplacement age of gabbro and
associated felsic veins found throughout the Atlantis Bank region, and 2.
(U-Th)/He chronometry on apatite, zircon and sphene to constrain the timing and
rate of cooling/denudation resulting from normal faulting. The geophysical
modeling will consist of: 1. Processing new magnetic and gravity data collected
in 2002 in order to constrain more accurate plate spreading rates, the timing of
past changes in plate motion, and the derivation of a crustal thickness map, and
2. development of both a regional and local 3-D thermal model in order to fully
interpret the thermochronometric data.
