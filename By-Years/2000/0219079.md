ITR: Comparative Genomic Analysis of Signal Transduction in Prokaryotes

Whole genome sequencing projects revolutionize our understanding of biology and
open up new opportunities for fundamental research and its applications to
medicine, agriculture and environment. Accumulating genomic data generates the
need for rapid biological interpretation of genome sequences and integration of
this knowledge into databases of genomic information for immediate use by
biomedical and environmental scientists. Proteins comprising signal transduction
networks control most vital functions in any given organism, beneficial or
harmful. However, current interpretation of genomic data for signal transduction
proteins fails to provide sufficient information for understanding their
biological role. The goal of this research project is to significantly improve
prediction of biological functions for signal transduction proteins and to
unravel potentially novel signal transduction mechanisms and pathways in various
beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. This will be achieved through a
systematic computational approach, which integrates in-depth analysis of
functional elements (domains) of individual proteins and evolutionary and genome
context information. The results obtained will be incorporated into primary
databases and will allow automated detection of biologically important proteins.
The research proposed in this project will contribute to a better understanding
of the organization and evolution of signal transduction systems (fundamental
aspect). This, in turn, will assist experimental scientists in identification of
targets for antimicrobial drug design in pathogens and in improving beneficial
capabilities of microorganisms used for biofertilization and bioremediation
purposes (applied aspect).
