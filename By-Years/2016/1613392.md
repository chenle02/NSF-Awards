The selection of mates and subsequent production of offspring are key components
of the evolutionary process, but what behaviors do animals employ to access
mates? In this dissertation project, the co-PI will investigate the aggressive
and affiliative strategies that young male chimpanzees use to mate with females
and how these strategies change during development. Results of this research
will clarify our understanding of the development of coercive behaviors in male
chimpanzees and may provide a perspective on the evolutionary context of this
behavior. In addition, this research will contribute to the conservation of
endangered chimpanzees and other wildlife through educational outreach efforts
at the research site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Male animals frequently compete for
mates. As they do so, relatively large, strong, experienced, and old males are
typically favored in competition and consequently sire offspring. Prior research
conducted at Ngogo in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, however, indicates that
young adult and adolescent male chimpanzees, who are socially and physically
immature, father many offspring. Adolescent males father infants born to
adolescent females, while young adult males sire the infants of adult females.
In this project, the co-PI will collect behavioral and morphological data on an
large cohort of adolescent and young adult male chimpanzees at Ngogo, to
investigate the strategies young male chimpanzees employ to mate with females
and how these strategies change during development. Specifically, she will
examine whether young male chimpanzees use aggression to coerce females to mate
with them and whether sex differences in body size affect their ability to do
so. In addition, she will determine whether young males improve their
evolutionary fitness by affiliating with adult females during infancy and
juvenility when males are still dependent on their mothers or later during
adolescence by forging strong social bonds with adolescent female peers.
