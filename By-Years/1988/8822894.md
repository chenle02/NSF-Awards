This proposal on "Ceramic Technology in Ancient Northwest Syria" between Dr.
Gordon J. Bronitsky of the University of New Mexico and Dr. Abraham van As of
the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, is approved by NSF under the US-
Netherlands Cooperative Science Program. ZWO has made a separate award for Dr.
Bronitsky's subsistence. At Leiden, Dr. Bronitsky will implement a brief pilot
program of ceramic analysis and develop the framework of a long-term collabora-
tive research program employing methods of clay workability testing, thermal
shock and impact resistance measurement, and thermal measurement, which he has
developed for research on ancient North American ceramics, and apply them to a
sample of Tabqa ceramics.
