Many interesting and new phenomena are predicted to occur for a three
dimensional electron gas where scattering by the background of point charges is
absent. Strong magnetic fields in the quantum limit are predicted to induce
collective charge- or spin- density wave states with novel transport properties
analogous to the quantum Hall effect. With their collaborator, A.C. Gossard,
they have developed means of producing spatially uniform layers of elctron gas
using wide remotely doped parabolic gallium arsenic/aluminumxgallium1-xarsenic
wells, which can be thick enough to approach the three-dimensional limit. The
parabolic potential, created using parabolic grading of the average aluminum
concentration, appears to the electrons as a spatially uniform positive
background charge. They propose to investigate magnetotransport in strong
magnetic fields at dilution refrigerator temperatures in order to study the
changes which occur in the quantum Hall effect as the electron layer becomes
thicker, and to search for new collective phenomena. These heterostructures will
be characterized using optical and far- infrared measurements of the quantum
excitation spectra of electrons, as well as measurements of Shubnikov de Haas
oscillations in the magnetoresistance.
