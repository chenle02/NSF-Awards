This award supports the development and implementation of a workshop for
prospective and&lt;br/&gt;current female professors in science and engineering
fields as part of the NSF&lt;br/&gt;ADVANCE Leadership Awards Program by a group
of researchers from the George&lt;br/&gt;Washington University and Gallaudet
University who have collaborated for the past five&lt;br/&gt;years on projects
to increase the numbers of women and other underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minorities
in advanced Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) careers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using experience from earlier efforts to bring together
students from different institutions, large and small, local and far away,
specialized communities (e.g. women's colleges, historically black colleges and
universities (HBCUs) and comprehensive, to consider and be prepared for
graduate&lt;br/&gt;school in science, engineering and math (SEM), the PIs
propose to develop and run a similar&lt;br/&gt;workshop for potential and
current female faculty members in SEM. The proposed activity will benefit from
the pipeline created by the FORWARD program: participants from this program
started in 1997 will be reaching graduation and the stage of securing a faculty
position within the&lt;br/&gt;proposed timeline of the award. Participation will
be solicited from across the country&lt;br/&gt;and will feature speakers from
successful programs and careers in SEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program
is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering
workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in
academic science and engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;
