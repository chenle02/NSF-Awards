This project covers the concept and technical details of maintaining and
operating (M&amp;O) the IceCube Neutrino Observatory upon the completion of
construction and deployment of the 86-string array under the MREFFC project. The
University of Wisconsin (UW) offers their proven approach to providing M&amp;O
for IceCube based on their experience from both constructing the detector and
starting its partial operation. Learned lessons that shaped this project include
the need for: (1) resources for both distributed and centrally managed
activities, and (2) additional accountability mechanisms for "in-kind" and
institutional contributions; both are necessary to ensure that the detector
maintains its capability to produce quality scientific data at the level
required to achieve the detector's scientific discovery objectives. The project
exploits a balance between the Core M&amp;O tasks that are centrally funded
through UW-Madison, and the "in-kind" tasks that are supported through the
IceCube Collaborating Institutions. The success of the IceCube research will
enhance scientific and technological understanding on many levels through broad
dissemination of data and discoveries. The proposed distributed model of the
IceCube M&amp;O and scientific data analyses results in educational
opportunities and mentoring at all levels, from undergraduates to postdoctoral
researchers, and in a broad set of disciplines including operations, management,
engineering, computing, and scientific research. IceCube is a unique detector
that inspires innovative capacities of a new generation of scientists and
engineers to solve the most vexing scientific problems by applying new knowledge
about the Universe.
