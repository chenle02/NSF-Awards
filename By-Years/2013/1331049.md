This is a multi-sited ethnographic study of a small startup pharmaceutical
company with an elite international scientific board, which focuses on drug
discovery for neglected infectious diseases. The focus is on the global networks
engaged in the training of African scientists, specifically in the US and UK.
The ethnography will include extended oral histories, observation at lab
meetings and at scientific advisory board meetings. Results of this study should
offer suggestions on how to best train, support, and enable an emerging cadre of
well-trained scientists working in this area. Results will be disseminated via a
book and a web-based interactive narrative for high school and undergraduate
students in the US and Africa.
