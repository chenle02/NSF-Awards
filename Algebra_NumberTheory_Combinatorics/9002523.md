Professor Hughes will apply work of Ricci and Stein on oscillatory integrals to
singular perturbation problems arising in quantum mechanics. In addition Hughes
will consider the solution of the time dependent Schroedinger equation with
singular time dependent interactions. A unifying theme will be the use of the
interaction representation for solutions of the Schroedinger equation. This work
involves the mathematics of quantum mechanics. Professor Hughes will apply new
mathematical techniques to understand the behavior of interacting quantum
mechanical particles.
