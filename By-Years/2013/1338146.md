MRI funds will be used to acquire a multi-collector inductively coupled mass
spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS), equipment that will be critical to establishing a MC-
ICP-MS laboratory at New Mexico State University (NMSU). This award leverages
NSF funds, state funds, and a private gift to build a regionally, nationally,
and internationally recognized and utilized, multi-disciplinary facility that
will support a range of currently funded and future collaborative projects
spanning a wide range of research in the earth sciences, and train highly
qualified personnel to fill future technical positions across the US. The lab
will focus on cutting-edge geochemical techniques applied to the geological
sciences but these same techniques will enhance scientific inquiry in the fields
of biology, wildlife and conservation science, plant and soil science,
engineering, and chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to expanding the
research infrastructure of NMSU, both in- and out-of-house student research
opportunities will be enhanced with new interdisciplinary degree options
introduced at NMSU. Graduate and undergraduate students at a Hispanic serving
educational institution will have opportunities to gain invaluable hands-on
experience using modern mass spectrometry techniques and reconstitute the pool
of well-qualified users to run newly established labs nationally and
internationally. PIs, senior personnel, and students from underrepresented
groups in the sciences will gain new opportunities to use modern equipment and
expand their research interests and impact of results.
