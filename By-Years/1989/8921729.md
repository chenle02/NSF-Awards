The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor Hanson in an
experimental investigation of the various decay channels following soft x-ray
excitation of atomic inner shell vacancies in simple gaseous molecules. Basic
information is being obtained on the competing energy dissipation processes
occuring in these highly excited molecules, especially correlations between
electronic decay channels and the resulting chemical transformations. The
results may provide guidance to important considerations in the design of x-ray
lithography equipment. Tunable and monochromatic soft x-ray radiation from the
National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven is used to excite gas phase
molecules in the region near the K edge of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine
or the L edge of silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, or chlorine. Following this very
selective internal excitation, information is extracted on the various decay
processes using electron spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence
techniques, both singly and in coincidence.
