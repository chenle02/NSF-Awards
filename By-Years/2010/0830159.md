This pilot program will provide undergraduate students with unique research
opportunities by combining the mentorship of a research university faculty and
an enthusiastic group of scientists recently retired from the chemical or
pharmaceutical industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students recruited both
nationally and from Lehigh University will be engaged in all aspects of research
aimed at the discovery and communication of new scientific knowledge. The summer
experience will provide these students not only practical experience and the
possibility of publishable results, but also the insights of both academic and
industrial mentors.&lt;br/&gt;
