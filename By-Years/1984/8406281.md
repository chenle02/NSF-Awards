There is a great deal of interest in visible wavelength III-V semiconductor
diode lasers. The research involves study of the growth of the III-V alloys
InGaPAs and InGaA1P by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and the
development of visible laser diodes from these materials. This program involves
three steps: development of the MOCVD growth process for In- and P-compounds,
development of conventional double heterostructures lasers grown on commonly
available GaAs substrate, and initial development of quantum well
heterostructures.
