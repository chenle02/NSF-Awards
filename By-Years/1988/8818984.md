This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of main-group organometallic chemistry. The chemistry of new
types of complexes of transition metals with phosphido and arsenido ligands will
be investigated. Some of the new compounds to be synthesized have relevance to
key processes involved in the preparation of microelectronic materials. The four
main areas of work for the project will be: 1. Investigation of complexes with
bulky phosphido and arsenido ligands. 2. Synthesis of complexes which feature
functionalized phosphido and arsenido groups and the use of these in the
preparation of new classes of metal containing polymeric materials. 3. Synthesis
of complexes of cyclic phosphido ligands in which the group 15 element forms
part of a cyclic ring structure. 4. Synthesis of compounds of transition metals
with ligands which contain both a group 13 and a group 15 element.
