The development of coastal areas is a source of economic growth but also the
cause of human and economic losses due to storm surges and hurricanes. The
possibility of sea level rise increases the vulnerability of these zones, and
governments and private agents making decisions regarding investments in
community and commercial infrastructure will need high quality forecasts of
future sea level conditions and coastal climatology. The project will develop a
framework and methodology for determining the value of improved sea level and
regional climatology information for land use and investment decisions in
coastal areas, and illustrate the methodology considering a set of alternative
data collection and research activities for global and local sea level and
regional climatology. The results of this research will benefit decision makers
responsible for coastal zone development.
