A dual laser beam technique involving laser evaporation of a liquid target will
be developed to deposit thin films of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) on Silicon. ITO is
excellent for use in high speed electronic devices, while silicon is an optimal
substrate due to availability of high purity, low cost, large area wafers.
Attempts will be made to understand the physics of laser evaporation that will
facilitate the production of structures with a spatial order of nanometers.
Processing will be investigated as a function of the power density. The as-
deposited microstructures will be characterized and correlated to the process
variables. The use of lasers also enhances the probability of either computer or
robotic control in the development of a rapid growth process for depositing ITO
on Si.
