This project is a continuation of work which investigates the wave and particle
dynamical properties associated with ULF magnetic waves in the Earth's
magnetospheric and magnetopause plasmas. Objectives of the proposed work are to
(1) develop a gyrokinetic- MHD hybrid code to simulate excitations of ULF waves
by energetic ring current protons; and (2) perform extensive simulations using
realistic magnetic field geometries and plasma parameters to develop new
theoretical insights and unerstandings on the ULF wave and instability
properties; (3) derive quasilinear equations due to ULF/MHD waves including
effects associated with realistic magnetic field geometries, plasma equilibria,
and finite ion Larmor radii; and (4) investigate the implications of quasilinear
diffusion on instability saturations and wave-induced transport on the dayside
magnetopause.
