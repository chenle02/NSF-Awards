9601151 Bennett One key to accumulating knowledge in the social sciences is the
regular testing of theories against one another to determine when a new theory
has superseded previous ones. However, while political science has numerous
theories that claim to explain novel facts, these theories are rarely compared
systematically. In this project the researchers perform a broad and inclusive
comparative statistical test of the major theories of international conflict.
The test is applied to both the initiation of militarized disputes between
countries and the escalation of those disputes to war. Such a broad comparative
test is useful and necessary for accumulating scientific knowledge about
international conflict. The researchers will find that information from multiple
levels of analysis is necessary to accurately model conflict behavior. The
researchers use a series of relative power tests to show which theories account
for more international conflict outcomes than others, suggesting the relative
importance of tested theories. ***
