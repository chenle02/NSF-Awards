This award provides funds to purchase equipment for the Department of Sociology
at Memphis State University. The equipment will be used to improve the
undergraduate social research curriculum in sociology and to increase the number
of women and minorities choosing careers involving social research. The
undergraduate social research curriculum will be revamped beginning with the
required courses dealing with methodology and techniques of scientific inquiry
and later changing the research component of substantive courses. Courses will
be changed to emphasize the development of analytic and critical thinking skills
instead of rote memorization and cookbook learning. They will also be revised to
incorporate the analysis of substantive research questions of special relevance
to women, minorities, working class, and Southern students (the least
represented groups in social research fields). The funds will be used to
purchase 16 microcomputers and special software to equip a laboratory capable of
providing simultaneous hands-on education in sociological research methods and
statistics to as many as thirty undergraduate students in each of six classes in
the first year. The software to be purchased includes two statistical and two
data base packages. These packages will facilitate the development of critical
thinking and analytic skills by enabling students to work jointly on instructor-
guided research activities as well as to conduct individual research projects on
topics of special interest to women, minorities, working class, and Southern
students. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from
non-Federal sources.
