In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Rich Carter of Oregon State University is developing proline
sulfonamide-catalyzed methods for the synthesis of stereochemically rich
building blocks and applying these in natural product synthesis. Proline
sulfonamide-based catalysts enable chemists to avoid the use of toxic metals to
access important chemical building blocks. Co-principal investigator Paul Ha-
Yeon Cheong is exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of these reactions
computationally. Natural products being synthesized through this award expand
the chemical strategies available to the scientific community and lead to
efficiency gains in the construction of terpenes. An impact of this research
includes the founding of a company, based in part on this work, which provides
opportunities for student training. The research provides a unique training
environment for students through a highly collaborative research program that
integrates organic synthesis and computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
focuses on the development of novel organocatalytic reaction pathways to access
disubstituted cyclohexenones. The widespread presence of stereogenic quaternary
centers in natural products has made their construction a central focus of
organic chemistry; however, practical methods continue to be critically needed.
The development of this chemistry features a close relationship between
computation and experiment that reduces reaction time development. Methodologies
developed and studied in this proposal will be utilized in synthesizing the
natural products obtusanal A and wortmannin.
