This award helps support a conference entitled, "Just Climate? Pursuing
Environmental Justice in the Face of Global Climate Change Conference," in Ann
Arbor, Michigan on March 26-28, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the
award provides participant support for approximately ten students to participate
in presentations and discussions that examine the scientific and social aspects
of climate change impacts and their affects on social systems. The conference
participants, who include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students,
will investigate the interplay of society, economics, human health, culture,
globalization, infrastructure, and natural and anthropogenic climate
variability. Among the organizer's objectives are: 1) bring global change
researchers, climate change scientists, and societal leaders together in focused
dialogue; 2) discuss the elements of a research agenda that are missing from
current studies; and 3) publish a record of the proceedings of the conference
that can be disseminated widely.
