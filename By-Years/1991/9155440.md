The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science requests support for a project in
informal learning in the physical sciences in the Discovery Room at the North
Carolina Museum of Life and Science which will be coordinated with the local
middle school's 6th grade science program. Among the anticipated activities are:
(1) mentoring through pairing of the students with participating private sector
scientists; (2) two 40-hour teacher in-service institutes on use of the
resources in the Discovery Room; (3) replication of eight Discovery Room
activities for classroom use throughout the Museum's greater region; and (4)
development and dissemination of materials that will permit replication of
Project Scientifica by other institutions. The partnership will bear about 58%
of the anticipated project costs.
