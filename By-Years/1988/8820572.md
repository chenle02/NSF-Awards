The activities to be carried out include: a study of very rare kaon decays
(Brookhaven AGS experiment 791), a program of muon diffusion and capture (PSI
experiment R-87-08), and a new muonium-antimuonium conversion experiment (LAMPF
experiment 1073). In addition, design studies for a parity violation experiment
at CEBAF will be carried out.
