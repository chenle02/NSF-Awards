ARI-MA: From Ce:YAG to Ce:GGG for High Energy Resolution High Efficiency Gamma
Detection - A Novel and Powerful Class of Scintillators

The objective of this research is to transfer and strengthen knowledge of
intrinsic defects linked to a material's performance as a radiation detector in
cerium doped yttrium aluminum garnet and other garnet materials. Defects will be
linked to the crystal growth process in a fully integrated process from crystal
growth, furnace temperature profiling, doping schemes and post-growth treatments
to the characterization of detector performance. Neutron detection capability
may be implemented during the latter part of the project. The intellectual merit
of the project is the anticipated academic foundation for significant
improvements in compounds through "defect engineering". It is anticipated that
the advances will lead to a dramatic improvement in the energy resolution of
garnet scintillating radiation detectors, competitive with the best crystal
materials available, while superior in chemical and mechanical properties and
easier to fabricate. The proposed work will also provide crucial understanding
of microscopic defects. There are several anticipated broader impacts of the
research. The project will educate expert crystal growers, a skill in dire need
for the US economy and national security, and materials scientists who will
understand the tight correlation of growth conditions to the quality of the
crystals in applications. Students will also be exposed and educated in the use
of a broad range of diagnostic tools. Open houses and general presentations to
potential students and visiting high school classes are envisioned to increase
the visibility of high quality crystal growth in academic and non-academic
communities. Research experiences for undergraduates will also be incorporated
in the project. Finally, the expected insights from "defect engineering" will,
hopefully, also bring about new applications in other fields such as nuclear
medicine and diagnostics through positron emission tomography.
