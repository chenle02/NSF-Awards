An interdisciplinary research project is proposed to test the hypothesis that
groundwater-fed wetlands may be used as paleoclimatic indicators in equatorial
East Africa. The study will integrate geochemical, biological and
sedimentological data from a large modern freshwater wetland (Loboi Wetland,
near Lake Bogoria, Kenya) and compare these data to nearby Pleistocene Loboi
Silts and Kapthurin Formation that may contain ancient wetland sediments. The
link to paleoclimate will be made by locating repetitive alternations (cycles?)
of lithofacies that record wet-dry cycles within a datable ancient stratigraphic
sequence. The two Pleistocene sites that we have selected show great promise.
The field work, laboratory analyses and preliminary integration of the results
from modern and ancient environments will be carried out over a one year period.
