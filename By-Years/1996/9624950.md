With funding from the Organic Dynamics program of the Chemistry Division of NSF,
and within the Faculty Early Career Development Program, Professor Miguel A.
Garcia-Garibay of the University of California, Los Angeles, will study
photochemistry in crystals of organic compounds. The study will emphasize the
selection of crystalline precursors which upon photolysis will produce
biradicals within the crystals. Since the biradicals will consequently be in
highly constrained environments, unusual structure-reactivity behavior is
expected. The magnetic properties of the biradicals will also be determined. A
new Physical Organic Chemistry course will be developed, as will a new approach
to General Chemistry for Life Sciences majors. Dr. Garcia-Garibay will place a
special emphasis on mentoring of students from underrepresented groups. Crystals
of organic compounds involve close packing of the molecules, and the consequent
constraints on the structures of products and intermediate species in solid
state reactions are profound. This work will define some of the chemical and
physical properties of an important class of reactive intermediates when placed
under such constraints. Courses will be developed at both undergraduate and
graduate levels.
