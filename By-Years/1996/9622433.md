9622433 Zabinsky This award supports research on the design of composite
structures. The research will address the problem of optimizing the structural
design of a composite panel to minimize cost while including manufacturing
considerations. Specifically, the research will integrate finite-element methods
with new state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms. If successful, this
research will lead to a design tool for anisotropic composites that will enable
designers to optimize structures encountered in many industries. The research
may have significant impact on the aerospace industry (e.g., design of a
composite wing or fuselage), the naval industry (e.g., design of composite
deckhouses or bulkheads) and/or the automobile industry (e.g., design of
composite engine hoods or body panels). Providing engineers with the capability
to optimally design cost-effective composite structures will increase the
competitiveness of US-based industries.
