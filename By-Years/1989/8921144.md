The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program has made a grant to Professor
Charles Johnson. His research work on chemical rates involves the use of strong
electric, magnetic and laser light fields to better understand how molecules
move in solution and at what velocities. The high resolution electrophoretic
nuclear magnetic resonance (ENMR) experiments have been carried out in free
solution on samples with low ionic strengths. The experimental conditions (and
problems) encountered here are similar to those found in electrophoretic light
scattering. The preliminary work indicates a host of intriguing applications to
be explored. It will become a major branch of NMR for the study of aqueous
solutions and suspensions. This study outlines some initial applications of
ENMR. In addition to the ENMR work, Professor Johnson will continue his studies
in holographic Rayliegh scattering (HRS). The HRS spectrometer with high
frequency phase modulation represents a major advance in instrumentation for
transient grating spectroscopy. In particular, they will explore the Soret
effect for macromolecules in laser induced temperature patterns.
