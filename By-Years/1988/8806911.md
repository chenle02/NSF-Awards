This conference will be held at Ohio State University June 11-14, 1988. The
topic of the conference is "Almost Everywhere Convergence in Probability and
Ergodic Theory." There has been considerable progress on the problems in this
area in recent years, including Peterson's proof of Bergelson's conjecture and
Bourgain's work on the ergodic theorem for subsequences. Bourgain will be one of
the main speakers. The conference welcomes interested mathematicians, including
graduate students, and inquiries should be addressed to Professor G. A. Edgar,
Mathematics Department, Ohio State University. It is planned to have a volume of
the proceedings of the conference, with the papers in it to be refereed. Almost
everywhere convergence has interest and applications in several fields of
mathematics, including Modern Analysis, Probability Theory, and in particular in
Stochastic Processes.
