9320381 Galton This is a joint "TIE" project on the topic of "Video-Rate A/D
Conversion using Parallel Delta-Sigma Modulators", to be conducted by the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Design of Analog-Digital
Integrated Circuits at Washington State University, the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for High-Speed Image/Signal Processing at the
University of California- Irvine, and the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Ultra-High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems at the
University of California-San Diego. The proposed research will evaluate the
practical viability and limitations of a very fast medium-accuracy analog to
digital converter using a novel oversampled configuration. The practical
limitations and tradeoffs of this architecture will be addressed. This project
is being cost shared with all the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Centers involved. The Program Manager recommends the University of California,
Irvine be awarded $25,000 for the first year of a two-year continuing award to
conduct a "TIE" project with Washington State University, and the University of
California-San Diego.
