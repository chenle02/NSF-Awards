This MacroROA grant, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
in the Chemistry Division, supports summer research by small-college faculty at
the University of Kansas. It is unique in its focus on bioanalytical chemistry.
Continued contact with former participants further encourages improvement in
undergraduate research at these 4-year institutions. %%% Four-year college
faculty will enhance their research skills in the area of bioanalytical
chemistry by participating in this MacroROA program, supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. By maintaining follow-
up contact after the summer's work, continued collaborations, intellectual
support, and networking will be enhanced.
