With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Christopher Daley from University of San Diego and colleagues Mitchell
Malachowski and Robert Dutnall will acquire an X-ray diffractometer. The award
will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas
such as (a) studies of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) using molybdenum and
copper compounds, (b) protein screening, (c) synthetic analogues of enzymes, and
(d) chiral catalysts.

An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry
and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching and
research at the University of San Diego as well as neighboring colleges such as
Point Loma Nazarene University, California State San Marcos and Southwestern
Community College.
