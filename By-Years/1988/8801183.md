This research is concerned with the construction of L- functions of automorphic
representations and of various applications to problems involving the oscillator
representation. Work will be done to generalize the Siegel-Weil formula to the
general case. The goal will be to have a general description of the theta
correspondence of any automorphic form, especially Eisenstein series.
Automorphic L-functions are generating functions of various arithmetic functions
and manage to encode much information in their analytic properties. Obtaining
general theories of how these types of functions behave is the central focus of
this research.
