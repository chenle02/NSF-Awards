This project aims at gaining an understanding of the geochemical behavior and
distribution of isotopes of beryllium (10 Be, 9Be, and 7Be) and aluminum (26Al
and 27Al) in the ocean-atmospheric system. Such an understanding will provide
insight for use of these isotopes as time and process tracers for a number of
oceanographic and geophysical problems such as marine geochronology, ocean
mixing, particulate-trace element interaction, variation of cosmic-ray and
geomagnetic field intensity, paleo-intensity of dust transport to the ocean, and
aerosol behavior. Work in progress includes studies of Be isotopes in aerosols
and rain, in ocean water and its particulate matter, and in sediment pore fluid.
Work is continuing in determining the distribution and degree of isotopic
homogenization of 10Be/9Be in the deep ocean, in evaluating the 7Be/10Be
geochronometry. Continuing efforts will be directed toward the
finalization/summarization of results for publication. An expedition will be
conducted to the Central Pacific to study the 26Al/10Be and 7Be systematics in
the ocean. This will represent the first attempt to measure cosmogenic 26Al in
sea water. It is anticipated that the results of the study will further enhance
our ability to utilize cosmogenic nuclides 26Al, 10Be and 7Be for geophysical
and oceanographic applications.
