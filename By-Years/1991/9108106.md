Ovulation is a universal phenomenon in the animal kingdom. However, this
process is poorly understood. It is known that a hormone, luteinizing hormone
(LH), produced by the pituitary induces a number of changes in the follicular
wall which results in a rupture of this wall and release of the egg or ovum. The
follicular wall consists of a thick matrix which must be degraded to permit
ovulation. To facilitate ovulation, the follicular wall has a specialized region
called a stigma in which the fibers are arranged in a parallel manner. Based on
studies in others species, it is hypothesized that enzymes, such as tissue
plasminogen activator and collagenase, either dissociate or degrade the fibers
in the stigma region. The purpose of this study is to measure the activities of
these two key enzymes in the follicle as it ap- proaches ovulation. Knowledge
obtained from these studies will promote an understanding of the mechanisms by
which LH brings about time controlled changes in the follicular wall so that
ovulation occurs at a predictable time. //
