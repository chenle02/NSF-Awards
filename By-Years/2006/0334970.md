This SGER award is to allow the investigator to conduct preliminary experiments
to test the feasibility of a scheme for creating quantum superposition states
involving a very large number of atoms via the interaction of a single photon
with a tiny mirror. Such quantum superpositions will be more massive than any
quantum superpositions observed to date and will therefore provide fundamental
tests of quantum mechanics in an entirely new regime. If successful, the results
of this effort could lead to a larger scale project that has spin-off to a broad
range of applications in that arena where the behavior of systems, even
macroscopic systems, is dominated by quantum behavior.
