A decade of marine organic geochemistry research has been accomplished since
the publication of the proceedings of the 1975 workshop in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Papers focusing on the challenges of the studies of the biogeochemistry of
organic matter in the world's ocean, atmosphere-ocean interactions, contemporary
and ancient sediments, research areas outlined in the Edinburgh meeting, now
number into the thousands in the subsequent ten year period. Progress has been
substantial, and studies of marine organic have made significant contributions
to our understanding of the chemistry of the marine environment. An
international workshop on "Marine Organic Geochemistry Review and Future
Challenges" will be convened in 1989-1990 to assess progress in marine organic
geochemistry since the last workshop on the topic 1975, and identify key
research problems for the future. Topics to be addressed include biochemical
cycles; DOC, POC and biogeopolymers; early diagenesis/transformation reactions;
molecular paleontology; physical organic chemistry. The conveners plan to
arrange for peer reviewed journal publication of review papers and
recommendations of the workshop.
