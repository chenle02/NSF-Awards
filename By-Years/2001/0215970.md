With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Kent State University will acquire an imaging Fourier
transform infrared (FTIF) spectrometer. This instrument will support research in
a number of areas, including a) the development of IR imaging for monolayers at
the air/water interface and the characterization of phosphoinositide/protein
interactions; b) the investigation of liquid crystal/polymer interactions; c)
the characterization of biofilm formation in the environment; and d) the
development of new methods of multi-dimensional data analysis.

The general effectiveness of Fourier transform spectroscopic techniques in
academic and industrial research has been firmly established. Many advanced
spectroscopic courses now routinely include the teaching of FT spectroscopy.
Imaging technology is extremely important for the characterization of advanced
materials in industrial research, and focal plane array IR imaging is becoming
increasingly popular in industrial analytical laboratories.
