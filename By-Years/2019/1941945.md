Modern technology in genomics, medical research and neuroscience generates
enormous amounts of data, which calls for reliable statistical analysis tools.
While the past decades have witnessed a surge of research activities on the
analysis of big data in statistics and data science, the existing statistical
tools are not adequate to produce reliable results due to the complexity of the
data structure or the manner in which the data are collected in modern
applications. The project will develop novel statistical and computational tools
to address the emerging challenges in modern big data and implement them within
software packages. The project will benefit a broad range of researchers
including biologists, epidemiologists, medical doctors and neuroscientists. The
research is complemented by an equally important education and outreach plan
including designing new undergraduate and graduate courses and recruiting
underrepresented minorities into the summer research program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a novel
computational and statistical framework for high-dimensional M-estimation under
two types of nonstandard conditions. In the first project, the principal
investigator will consider high-dimensional M-estimation with non-smooth loss
functions (e.g. indicator function). The discontinuity of the loss function
leads to nonstandard theory and requires new statistical methods equipped with
more refined theoretical analysis. In the second project, the principal
investigator will consider M-estimation subject to measurement constraints in
the sense that the outcomes are only collected in a very small subset of a big
dataset. The principal investigator will develop scalable computational
algorithms and statistically valid estimation/inference
procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
