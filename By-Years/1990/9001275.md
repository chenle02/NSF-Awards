Recent attention focused on the accelerating pace of human-induced
environmental change obscures the fact that people have had profound impacts on
natural systems for millennia. In the Western Hemisphere, significant changes
occurred in the wake of European settlement over the last 500 years. Within
central Mexico, the introduction of Spanish agricultural practices resulted in
significant changes in the form and intensity of land uses. This doctoral
dissertation project will examine how such changes have been recorded in the
sediments of the upper Rio Laja valley. Radiocarbon dating will be used to
establish an alluvial chronology of the upper Rio Laja valley; a hydrologic
comparison of modern and pre-colonial rivers will be based on standard
paleohydrologic techniques; rates of soil erosion will be measured in two
tributary channels; and historic evidence of erosion in upland regions will be
evaluated. This project will provide valuable information about the historic
evolution of land-use patterns and related changes in river valley deposits.
Although focusing on a specific locale in central Mexico, the study will yield
broader insights into the complex ways in which human and natural systems have
interacted over the last four centuries. The project also will provide an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop
independent research skills.
