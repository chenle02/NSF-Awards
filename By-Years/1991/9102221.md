A new procedure will be investigated for extracting approximate eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a nonsymmetric matrix from a given subspace. It is assumed that
it is impractical to factor the matrix. The procedure is related to the
Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, but it gives better estimates for interior eigenvalues.
It can improve convergence rates for the Arnoldi method, for preconditioning
methods such as Davidson's method, and for other methods. These methods will be
tested and compared.
