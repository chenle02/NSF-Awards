The purpose of the project is to provide funding for the scientific analysis of
data collected as part of the Tropical Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE). TIWE
is a multi-institutional program aimed at an improved understanding of the
dynamical and thermodynamical transfers that occur between these waves and the
background currents. The field work commenced in the central equatorial Pacific
during the spring of 1990. The University of South Florida portion consisted of
a five element array of subsurface-moored acoustic Doppler current profilers,
monitoring currents over the upper 250 m of the water column from May 1990 to
June 1991. A 100% data return was achieved, the data have been edited, a data
report has been disseminated and scientific analyses are underway. These
analysis bear upon the kinematics, dynamics, energetics, and thermodynamics of
the instability waves and their interaction with the background currents.
Additional analysis aims at an improved understanding of the evolution of the
three-dimensional flow field on the equator in the central Pacific.
