This action funds Tyler James Volkoff of University of California, Berkeley to
conduct a research project, entitled "Numerical studies of static and dynamical
properties of liquid helium in aperture arrays," during the summer of 2012 at
Konkuk University in Seoul, South Korea. The host scientist is Yongkyung Kwon.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project drives from the use of numerical
simulation to analyze a dynamical phase transition in liquid helium when driven
through an array of nanoscale apertures by an external driving force. A Monte
Carlo algorithm is used to sample estimators of relevant thermodynamic
quantities and an order parameter for the transition is derived and interpreted.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
