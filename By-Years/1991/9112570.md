Inorganic phosphate and ATP are involved in more chemical reactions on the
earth's surface than any other compound except water. Phosphate entry into
eukaryotic cells and into their organelles is catalyzed by at least two distinct
types of transport system, one, a Na+/P transporter and the other a H+/P
transporter. Past work supported by NSF resulted in the identification of the
H+/P transporter as a 32-35 kDa protein, its purification, reconstitution,
cloning, sequencing, expression in E. coli, and import into isolated
mitochondria. Future Specific Aims during the grant period are 6-fold and will
be to. %%% Establish whether the functional form of the H+/Pi transporter in its
native membrane environment is a monomer or a higher ordered oligomer. Express
functionally the full length cDNA of the H+/Pi transporter and verify its
membrane topology. Introduce both site directed and random mutations in the
functionally expressed transporter in order to identify candidate amino acids
involved in transport. Initiate studies which may prove valuable in supplying
3-Dimensional structural information about the H+/Pi transporter. Determine to
what extent homologous H+/Pi transporters are expressed in plant and animal
cells. Compare the regulatory events involved in the expression of H+/Pi
transporter Gene(s) in plant and animal cells.
