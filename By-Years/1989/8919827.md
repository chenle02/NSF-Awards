ABSTRACT Almost all semantic investigation of generic sentences in natural
language (e.g. "Cats chase mice", "Snow is white") examines languages which,
like English, do not have a systematic, explicit formal means of marking generic
vs. non-generic interpretations. However, a good many natural languages do have
such means, almost always as morphology associated with the verbal system (such
as an affix on the main verb, or an auxilliary). But very little is presently
known about how generics are expressed, and especially about the territory of
meaning that overt generic marking encompasses. In part, this is because
linguists do not have a standard methodology for classifying generics; but more
importantly, no extensive investigations limited to the phenomenon of genericity
itself have been undertaken. It is the purpose of this project to investigate in
detail the ways genericity is expressed in natural language, and the possible
range of meanings that may be so expressed through examination of grammars, use
of questionnaires, and direct work with speakers of relevant languages. The most
immediate consequence of this research is to provide a linguistic basis for a
comprehensive theory of generics, with direct implications for theories of the
relationship between semantics and morphology.
