This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is designed to
reduce uncertainties about the causes of variability in N. pachyderma (s) Ã¤18O
using a series of sediment traps and real-time hydrographic observations to
better understand: 1) the seasonal production and isotopic chemistry of N.
pachyderma (s) in the Arctic, 2) the relationship of the presence of this taxon
to the amount of sea ice cover, and 3) the degree to which the smaller N.
pachyderma (s) shells may be affected by lateral transport processes from the
wide Arctic shelves into the deep basins of the Arctic
Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sediment traps are located in the Beaufort Gyre
and have been deployed as part of the Beaufort Gyre Observing System. An initial
sediment trap deployment sampled the 2004- 2005 annual cycle and four others
sampled the 2007-2008 annual cycle. The sediment trap samples are complemented
by a complete set of standard hydrographic measurements (temperature, salinity,
depth, and current velocity), taken approximately once a day and spanning the
water column from 50 to 2000 m below the surface. The moorings include upward-
looking echo sounders to provide a record of sea ice concentration and thickness
above each site. Ice Tethered Profiling Systems also transited the study area
during the sediment trap deployments, providing quality records of sea ice
thickness and hydrographic properties from the surface down to about 800 m
during the winter periods of complete ice cover. These sediment trap samples and
complementary hydrographic data will be used to evaluate the relationship of N.
pachyderma (s) to changes in sea ice and low salinity.&lt;br/&gt;
