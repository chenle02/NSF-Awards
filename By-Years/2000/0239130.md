Abstract (CMS-0239130) Shaofan Li University of California, Berkeley

The objectives of this CAREER project are: to develop theoretical foundation and
numerical algorithms for multiscale meshfree computational methods, and to
implement these methods in training and higher education.

The proposed research focuses on (1) developing a micro-mechanics based meshfree
variational multiscale computational framework, and (2) use of meshfree spectral
or wavelet interpolants for a subgrid method for adaptive numerical simulation.

A new protocol in engineering higher education for computational mechanics will
be created by integrating the meshfree multiscale research into the system. This
protocol will include: a freshman seminar course, a video series, and the
creation of a network of partnership among industries, national labs, and
research universities.

This is a new CMS CAREER award.
