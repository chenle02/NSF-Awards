This project examines disability categorization in schools in order to
understand the potential dynamics of racial bias in &lt;br/&gt;organizations.
Drawing on a large dataset from an urban school district, the study examines
whether or not schools assigned&lt;br/&gt;disabled white students to previously
low status disability categories, and as a consequence, infused these categories
with prestige and resources during the period of federally ordered school
desegregation. The project tests the changes in the likelihood of specific
disability categorizations over time for different racial/ethnic groups under
conditions of segregation, desegregation, and resegregation. &lt;br/&gt;This
study broadens understanding of the potential racial bias in disability
categorization and the challenges in reducing it.&lt;br/&gt;It can stimulate
better preparation of educational professionals and provide an organizational
lens for compliance monitoring. The findings will be of broad journalistic and
societal interest and may result in appropriate treatment and beneficial
academic and social outcomes for students.
