There are 71 genera of palms known to occur in the New World, but only about
one-third of these genera are well collected and well known taxonomically. This
is unfortunate because palms are important components of tropical forests and
savannas, and are also widely used as crops. Drs. Andrew Henderson and Michael
Balick of the New York Botanical Garden are conducting field work in South
America along with herbarium and laboratory studies to determine the species
composition and geographical ranges of two poorly known genera, Euterpe and
Prestoea. Prestoea contains an estimated 35 species, while Euterpe contains
about ten; both are widely distributed in Central and South America. Euterpe is
economically significant as a source of palm "hearts." Their taxonomic studies
will be based on morphological and anatomical analyses of flowers, fruits,
leaves, and stems. Material will also be sent to Cornell University for
molecular studies by Drs. Doyle and Uhl on the palm family and its evolution.
Field work will be conducted with the collaboration of the Colombian botanist,
Dr. Gloria Galeano- Garces.
