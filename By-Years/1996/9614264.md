9614264 Brannon The proposed work seeks to improve on the isotopic methodology
for dating ore-stage mineralization in Mississipi Valley-type (MVT) Pb-Zn
deposits in order to provide necessary constraints for understanding the
mechanisms of ore formation. The proposed study will concentrate on: (1) the
radiometric dating of two North American MVT ore deposits (Illinois-Kentucky-
Fluorspar and Pine-Point Zn-Pb deposits) for which conflicting ages of ore
formation exist at the moment; (2) dating of ore-stage calcite and sphalerite
from mines of the Tri-State (Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma) MVT district; and (3)
dating two Proterozoic MVT deposits in South Africa, thought to be among the
oldest deposits of this type currently known. In addition to dating, the Rb-Sr
and U-Th-Pb isotopic systematics will be used as tracers of the ore-forming
fluids. Information on the source of fluids is necessary to assess models of ore
genesis in the various localities and to construct a better genetic model for
MVT's worldwide.
