The research involves a multidisciplinary team, already working together, with
heavy experience in control systems, artificial intelligence, power systems,
human performance, neural networks, and vision/CAD systems to design a Generic
Framework for Flexible Agent-Based Intelligent Control (IC). This objective will
be accomplished via three goals: 1. Defining the requirements for an IC
framework based on the common themes across existing UTA testbeds in
manufacturing material handling, power systems simulation, human
performance/telerobotics, automated surface finishing, flexible real-time
digital control implementation, and autonomous vehicle navigation and control;
2. Development of a generic IC framework applicable in all these testbeds to
confront design and control problems involving complex nonlinear systems,
hierarchical levels of abstraction and time scales, cognitive modeling and
learning, human interface at several levels, man-in- the-loop, coordination of
multiple agents, sensor fusion, real-time control system reconfiguration, and
failure recovery. The framework will be object-oriented, modular, and agent-
based; and 3. Evaluation of the generic IC framework by: application to the
testbed areas, verification of ability to support current architectures (e.g.
NASREM, NGC), and development of a case-study- based graduate course in
intelligent control. Extensive industry involvement will be provided through
existing Industry Advisory Committees and company membership programs at ARRI
and HPI, ongoing industry contracts, and other UTA programs. //
