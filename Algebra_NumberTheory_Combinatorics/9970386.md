The proposed project concerns zeroes of L-functions. We intend to investigate
the fine structure of these zeroes for families of L-functions. They are
intimately connected to random matrix theory and symmetry groups, and for
certain families, arithmetical questions such as ranks of Abelian varieties.
Some of what we set out to establish has been discovered through computer
experiments.

Our general area of research is number theory and related topics. Also entering
into these works are some ideas from mathematical physics, in particular
symmetry properties and universalities associated with random matrix ensembles.
