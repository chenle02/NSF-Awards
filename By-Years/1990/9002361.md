The Liblice Conferences aze international meetings held every three years and
devoted to both basic research and applications of molecular theories of
liquids. They are sponsored by the Chemical Physics section of the Czechoslovak
Academy of Sciences. A possible counterpart in the US is the biennial Gordon
Conference on the Chemistry and Physics of Liquids, which is a national and
somewhat international forum on experimental work on and molecular- level
modeling of dense fluids phases. The Liblice conferences, however, draw a wider
segment of their audience from the European continent, including, of course, the
Eastern European countries. The Third Liblice Conference will take place from
May 28 to June 1, 1990 in Bechyne, Czechoslovakia, is intended to provide an
effective opportunity for personal contacts and exchange of ideas, with emphasis
on discussions, in addition to formal presentations. The meeting should also
present a state-of-the-art picture of the achievements and challenges in both
the fundamental and applied aspects of the discipline. It is an event of
significant and the US presence is critically important.
