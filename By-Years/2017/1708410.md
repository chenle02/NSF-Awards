Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Polymer-like molecular networks are softer
than common solid-state materials. When a molecular magnet is chemically
attached to a photoactive molecular network, changes of temperature and
irradiation by light generate strains on the magnetic domains near the
interface. This single investigator award allows for the study of these
processes in new, nano-scaled environments that are not available in macroscopic
crystals. The results provide a basis for exploring light-controlled, magnetic
devices for new applications in spintronics. The research is interdisciplinary
and international in scope, and junior researchers, comprised of undergraduate
and graduate students, are trained in a wide-range of experimental, theoretical,
and computational skills while working with a diverse team. An international
team in Slovakia is intimately involved in the experiments, and this productive
collaboration provides scientific and cultural exposure for everyone. Organized
outreach activities focus on K-8 students and teachers, and hands-on activities
are designed to enhance the science content knowledge of all
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The properties
of molecule-based magnets can be tuned by synthesis protocols and controlled by
external stimuli such as temperature, electric/magnetic fields, pressure/strain,
and irradiation by light. One goal of this single investigator research is to
investigate the mechanisms governing the photocontrol of the magnetic response
of nano-sized heterostructures of coordination polymers, where one magnetic
component is mated to a photo-active constituent. Spin-polarized small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) techniques are well-suited to detect and measure the
changes of the magnetic profiles at and near the interface between the two
components of these heterostructured nanoparticles. Another goal is to shift the
photoactive states of spin-crossover complexes placed in nano-textured,
metastable morphologies. By restricting the molecules to a nanophase environment
and tuning the influence of the substrate, the cooperativity of the nano-scaled
domains is modified to allow photo-switching at higher temperatures. Scanning
tunneling spectroscopy is the main tool for these surface studies, and the
experimental results are interactively shared with an in-house computational
team that is focused on the in-silico design of new materials. The results
directly impact future investigations to define photo-switchable nano-scaled
molecular arrangements suitable for spintronic applications.
