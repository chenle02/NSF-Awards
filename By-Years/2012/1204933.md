Kennebec Valley Community College (KVCC) is partnering with local employers,
secondary schools, Career and Technical Centers, and the University of Maine to
develop and implement a two-year, problem-based learning Energy Services and
Technology (EST) Associates Degree program to meet Maine's growing need for
energy technicians who can install, maintain, and troubleshoot high-efficiency
heating, ventilating, and cooling systems in buildings. The program is giving
technicians a working knowledge of building HVAC system concepts and energy
efficient design principles. Graduates will be eligible for State of Maine
licensing in plumbing, as well as oil burning, solid fuel, propane and natural
gas, and refrigeration technologies. With additional coursework, graduates will
have the licenses and educational background necessary for further career
advancement in renewable and sustainable energy systems, and to pursue a
bachelor's degree in engineering technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve its
goals, the EST project is (1) implementing a new energy services and technology
curriculum that employs problem-based learning, (2) integrating EST's real-world
problems in basic mathematics and science classes, (3) establishing a state-of-
the-art EST learning laboratory, (4) establishing an energy technician pipeline
from area secondary schools to KVCC and to the University of Maine, and (5)
providing professional development for EST college faculty and high school
teachers. An evaluation plan is collecting quantitative and qualitative data to
measure the project's progress towards achieving its goals and objectives,
including success in attaining outcomes pertaining to student enrollment,
retention, performance, job placements and other student outcomes.
