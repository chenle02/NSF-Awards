The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the development of detection
systems for autonomous vehicles. The proposed technology takes advantage of
trends in price, performance, and quality of imagers and processors driven by
the proliferation of these devices in smartphones. The technologyalso provides
key capabilities such as integrated color information, detection over extended
depths, scene segmentation and tracking, and better performance in inclement
weather or under poor visibility. This leads to improvements in three-
dimensional (3D) vision and object modeling that will have significant
commercial impact in accelerating the development and deployment of autonomous
and semi-autonomous vehicle navigation and assistance. This will lead to higher
commuting efficiency, reduced traffic fatalities, reduced traffic congestion,
and reduced pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the technical capabilities and
advantages of passive sensing image-based multi-camera EPI Epipolar-Plane
Imaging (EPI) analysis for autonomous vehicle (AV) ranging. The research
objective is to advance the development of EPI analysis and compare it to Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems. The research will extend an existing EPI-
based module to incorporate new hardware and software to achieve these results,
including accuracy and precision comparable to LiDAR at distances of 200 m and
beyond, feature discernment superior to LiDAR, higher levels of semantics in
presented range information, and operation in inclement weather and discrete
obscuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
