This project will develop three topics concerning long time behavior of
solutions to partial differential equations. First a descriptive theory of low
dimensional attractors of dissipative forced nonlinear PDEs will be attempted in
order to investigate weak turbulence. This theory exists for the damped and
driven sine-Gordon equation in one dimension; the PI will extend it to the
Klein-Gordon equations in higher dimensions and the Ginzburg- Landau equation.
The second topic is the nonexistence of breather solutions to nonlinear
conservative hyperbolic PDEs. The third topic is the stability of solitary waves
for equations describing a bubble cloud and long-wave regularized Boussinesq
equations. These problems will be studied numerically and analytically. Their
solutions will accrue to our understanding of basic mathematical and physical
issues. Atmospheric sciences and hydrodynamics, among others, will be impacted
by the results of this project.
