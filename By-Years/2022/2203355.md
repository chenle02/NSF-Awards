The goal of this project is to have maximal impact on mathematics at all levels.
At the research level, the project introduces new geometric points of view to
our understanding of 4-dimensional spaces. These spaces arise whenever 4
parameters arise, for example keeping track of the 3-dimensional position of an
airplane together with the time it is at that position. The project will develop
new methods to understand symmetries of these spaces, starting with ``K3
manifolds'', a fundamental example arising in physics. The project will also
lead to the training of several PhD students; continue the PI's public outreach
in the media; and contribute to work for diversity in mathematics by continuing
the PI's work with the Math Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to
introduce the Thurstonian point-of-view into the study of mapping class groups
of K3 surfaces. Specific goals include: Thurston trichotomy; Thurston normal
form; Nielsen (non)realization; new beautiful examples/constructions. In a
second direction, the PI proposes a guiding principle, motivated by the
miraculous constructions of algebraic geometry, that produces many natural,
motivated problems and conjectures in geometric group theory, topology and
algebraic geometry, concerning various forms of rigidity for many different
moduli spaces. The PI will also train graduate students and conduct outreach as
part of broader impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
