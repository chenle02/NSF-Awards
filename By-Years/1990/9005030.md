Research objectives are the development of a detailed and semi-continuous
isotopic record for the late Paleozoic Era and the testing of its accuracy, and
2) the application of isotope stratigraphy to paleoenvironmental analysis with
the specific goal of determining the origin of late Paleozoic cyclical
sedimentary deposits. These two objectives are inseparable since understanding
the depositional environment is vital for interpreting the isotopic record. The
study employs stringent measures to avoid sampling diagenetically altered
material. Brachiopod shells are separated from shale matrix, embedded in epoxy,
and thin-sectioned. Photographs of these thin sections are taken under
cathodoluminescence and plane light, and used as a map to sample non-luminescent
calcite from the thin section with a dental pick. Electron microprobe elemental
analysis of select shells is used to confirm the use of cathodoluminescence to
identify altered shell. The study will concentrate on a limited number of
brachiopod species, thereby minimizing or eliminating biological effects on
isotopic composition. Sedimentological and paleontological data will also been
collected, providing independent evidence for paleoenvironmental change. PIs
will analyze brachiopods from late Pennsylvanian deposits in New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri to examine lateral variations in isotopic
composition 1) to test the possibility of using 13C to correlate strata and 2)
to define lateral and temporal gradients in ocean paleotemperature and
chemistry. PIs will also extend the isotope stratigraphy of the late Paleozoic
in Texas to examine paleoenvironmental changes in the epicontinental seas of
Texas and to provide a detailed and accurate isotope stratigraphy which can be
used as the standard for other studies of stable isotopes in late Paleozoic
fossils. Project will apply innovative techniques to analysis of global
environmental change in a period of earth history much like today's. Analyses of
global change in this time of climatic change may reveal information about the
causes, rates and consequences of climate change.
