A new era for particle physics is about to begin. The Tevatron and the LHC are
soon going to start probing the scale where the mechanism of electroweak
symmetry breaking has to show up. In the Standard Model this mechanism relies on
the existence of a fundamental scalar, the Higgs, which should be discovered at
these new accelerators. This project goes in the direction of exploring new and
novel mechanisms that resolve certain difficulties in the minimal model. These
mechanisms all involve a modification of the Higgs sector, either by adding new
symmetries, like supersymmetry, or supposing that the Higgs is no longer a
fundamental object but a composite of an underlying theory. These different
models are studied from both the theoretical and phenomenological point of view
and a particular emphasis will be put on the collider signals in order to be
prepared when new data is available. Because of the new data that is expected,
this project requires also collaboration of experimental and theoretical
researchers, such as that already in place at the University of Notre Dame, and
will therefore have a broader impact on the experimental LHC program. Being able
and willing to communicate the amazing discoveries that we are about to make is
an important part of any scientific work. The PI will collaborate with QuarkNet,
an NSF-funded outreach program for high school teachers and students. This
broader impact will make sure that the high school teachers and students
involved understand the theory that is behind the work they do in QuarkNet.
