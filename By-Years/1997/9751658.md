As part of the department's effort to build an integrated undergraduate earth
science education program, this project is developing an environmental
engineering geophysics field program. This field program provides students in
four different departments at this institution and students at Biosphere 2, in
Arizona, with multidisciplinary, inquiry-oriented, field-based geophysical
experiences. These experiences address local and regional environmental,
engineering, and geological problems. This program and the curricular materials
developed in it are being made available to other earth science departments as a
model. The university is purchasing two conductivity meters (for shallow and
medium depth applications), a magnetometer/gradiometer, a seismic
reflection/refraction system, and two generic Windows/Linux field laptops with
basic visualization software for in-field data analysis and preliminary
processing. This equipment completes the instrumentation pool for the geophysics
field classes. *
