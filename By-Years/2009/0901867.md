"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the research will be
to advance the science and technology of visible LEDs fabricated from columnar
nanostructures that emit at visible wavelengths and with high
efficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Program&lt;br/&gt;A
program of research is proposed to explore nanostructure visible light emitting
diodes (LEDs). The objective of the research will be to advance the science and
technology of visible LEDs fabricated from columnar nanostructures that emit at
visible wavelengths and with high efficiencies. Single and multiple wavelength
emission nanowire LEDs in the InGaN materials system will be investigated for
eventual fabrication on low cost substrates. Modeling of the physical structures
involving new heterojunction designs enabled by the nanoscale columnar geometry
will be undertaken. Reduced strain and use of non-polar and semi-polar facets in
such structures will improve efficiency compared to planar designs.
Understanding carrier transport and recombination in the nanowires and
mitigation of processes that limit the efficiency of nanowires are the goals.
Nanopatterning will be used to control the emission wavelength through control
of physical dimensions and material compositions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact of the Program&lt;br/&gt;To the extent possible, the program will be
carried out by under-represented minorities. Graduate students and two
undergraduate assistants from the USC Merit research program will learn the
inherent interdisciplinary nature of device research. The Center for Energy
Nanoscience and Technology for which the PI is Director will be exploited to
induce interest in LEDs and in energy conservation among young students (K - 12)
and teachers. The results will be included in two courses on photonics at USC.
