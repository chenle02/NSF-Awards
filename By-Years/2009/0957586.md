In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Alexej Jerschow of New York University will
develop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methodology for enhanced
visibility and specificity of sodium ions in soft matter systems. In particular,
recent findings and algorithms of optimal control theory will be adapted for the
optimization of spectroscopic experiments, thus allowing one to probe the ions'
local anisotropy and tumbling motion at the boundary between liquids and solids.

Sodium plays an important function in biological systems by binding to
macromolecules, maintaining osmotic pressure, and neutralizing charge.
Jerschow's studies will provide new measurement capabilities with relevance to
the investigation of metal binding to nucleic acids and proteins, tumor
detection in tissues, quality control in food and materials sciences, and void-
space imaging. In addition to the education of graduate students and post-
doctoral coworkers, the research program will also support continued
collaborations with Pratt Institute in the field of spectroscopy in arts
conservation.
