This research revisits records of Holocene ice rafting (IRD) events in the North
Atlantic that were originally interpreted as evidence that solar irradiance was
an important driver for centennial- to millennial- scale climate changes in that
region (Bond et al., 2001). The research addresses several key issues that have
arisen since the original publication of the IRD records by: 1) replicating the
published Holocene results using the same samples and techniques, 2) generating
new Holocene records from cores throughout the region of interest, and 3)
comparing results with beryllium-10 and radiocarbon records, which are proxies
for solar variability through time. Results bear on the important question of
whether and how small variations in solar forcing can influence climate. Funding
supports a postdoctoral researcher.
