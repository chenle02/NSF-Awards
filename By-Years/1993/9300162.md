This project will bring ten undergraduates to Hunter College of CUNY in the
summer of 1993 for a four week period, to be followed up with a once weekly
academic year experience to continue the work. All students will be from groups
underrepresented in computer science and engineering research. Research topics
will focus on finite algebra and finite geometry, specifically finite projective
affine and subaffine planes and the existence and properties of functions which
are either Sheffer or Sheffer with constants. Additionally, speakers will be
brought in to discuss social and ethical issues involving legal intellectual
property, large distribute systems, and large hardware and software systems.
