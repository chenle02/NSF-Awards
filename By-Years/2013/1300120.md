Combinatorics is an area centered around problems and applications. Some of
these problems arise in the field itself and others come from other mathematical
areas and from applications in other scientific fields. We present problems
which in the interface between combinatorics, geometry and probability with much
input from theoretical computer science and mathematical programming. We will
study, also using discrete harmonic analysis, phase transition phenomena for
combinatorial stochastic models and problems related to the combinatorics of
simplicial and polyhedral complexes arising in geometric problems about convex
sets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research topics were selected to have potential
impact in other areas of mathematics, theoretical computer science, mathematical
programming, and questions regarding social choice. What causes phase transition
for stochastic combinatorial models, and what is the nature of this phase
transition? How to analyze the noise sensitivity of Boolean functions and how it
is related to models of computations on the one hand, and to voting rules on the
other? What can we infer from combinatorics of polyhedra to the performance of
optimization algorithms. These are areas where theory and practice are
surprisingly interlaced, and information as well as inspiration go both ways.
