This individual investigator award supports a project with the goal of gaining
an increased understanding of the hybrid rutheno-cuprates magnetic
superconductors known as Ru-1212 and Ru-1222, by means of measurements of
transport, magnetic, and thermal properties in extreme conditions of magnetic
field and pressure. The crystal structure of these materials is derived from the
structure of the high-Tc superconductor YBa(2)Cu3O(7-x) (Tc near 90 K). A unique
feature of these rutheno-cuprates is that the superconducting state below 45 K
coexists with the weak ferromagnetism established at higher temperatures.
Although these layered materials are quasi-two-dimensional from a
crystallography point of view, both the magnetic and superconducting orders are
three-dimensional, which suggests that the Ru-O magnetic layers couple through
the Cu-O layers, while the superconducting Cu-O layers couple through the Ru-O
magnetic layers. These experiments will permit a better understanding of these
intriguing magnetic superconductors. This project will create unique research,
educational, and mentoring opportunities for the undergraduate and Masters
degree students at this institution.

The goal of this project is to carry out an experimental study of the hybrid
rutheno-cuprates magnetic superconductors, by means of measurements of
electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties in very high magnetic fields and
pressures. These materials are structurally similar to the high-temperature
superconductor YBa(2)Cu3O(7-x), which shows zero electrical resistance below 90
K. A truly intriguing feature of these rutheno-cuprates is that the magnetic
order coexists with superconductivity below 45 K. Although coexistence of these
two phenomena is very rare, studies of such materials have lead to many
important findings in the past. Since the rutheno-cuprates are layered
materials, it is conceivable that the reason superconductivity and magnetic
order coexist is that the coupling between the superconducting Cu-O layers and
the magnetic Ru-O layers is weak. The experiments proposed will permit a better
understanding of these quite unusual magnetic superconductors. This project will
create unique research, educational, and mentoring opportunities for the
undergraduate and Masters degree students at this institution.
