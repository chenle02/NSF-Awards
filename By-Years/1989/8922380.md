This award will fund a conference entitled Representations of Fundamental
Groups. It will take place in the fall of 1990 on the campus of the University
of Chicago. The purpose of this conference is to bring together mathematicians
working in three areas: fundamental groups of Kaehler manifolds, discrete
subgroups of Lie groups, and the fundamental groups of manifolds with large
volume-preserving symmetry group. The timing of this conference is intended to
make it simultaneous with the presentation by G. A. Margulis of the Namboodiri
Memorial Lectures at the University of Chicago.
