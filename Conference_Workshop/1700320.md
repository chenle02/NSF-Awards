This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the "Brazos Analysis Seminar." The seminar will meet semi-
annually with the first meeting on March 25 and 26, 2017 at Texas A&M
University. Subsequent meetings will rotate among Baylor University, the
University of Houston and Texas A&M University. Additional information is
available on the seminar website

The Brazos Analysis Seminar will bring together graduate students and
researchers from the South Central USA who work in the areas of non-commutative
functional analysis and harmonic analysis. The seminar will allow for
participants to meet on a regular basis to communicate their research,
collaborate, and learn about the latest developments in analysis. Many of the
researchers are junior investigators and these meetings should help to catalyze
new collaborations. The format for the seminar provides ample opportunity for
graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigators to present their work.
