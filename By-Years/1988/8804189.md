This proposal requests funds to establish a Macromolecular Structure Facilities
Center having four components: a recombinant DNA facility, a protein chemistry
facility, a mass spectrometry facility, and a protein structure-function
facility. The instrumentation will facilitate research in all aspects of protein
engineering, including protein structural analysis, molecular modeling of
proteins, active site studies of proteins, physical studies of proteins,
molecular cloning of biologically important genes, site-directed mutagenesis of
protein genes, gene and chromosome analysis, and gene control mechanisms. The
investigators are productive and have a history of innovative research related
to methods development and instrumentation. Support is recommended.//
