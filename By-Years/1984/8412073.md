The object of the research is to understand the structure and entrainment in
combustion using a model laboratory complex flow with diagnostics having
expanded capability. The approach employs existing two-color laser anemometry
and thermocouple probes in combination with a fiber optic probe and laser
spectroscopy in a series of experiments which model the characteristics of the
complex flow and concludes with measurements in the complex flow itself. The
fiber optic probe is included to assess the frequency response of the
thermocouple probe. In addition, laser spectroscopy is used to further assess
the validity of the temperature probes, extend the combustor operating condition
under which temperature and heat flux measurements can be acquired, and provide
for measurement of mass flux. The research delineates the effect of reaction and
inlet conditions on the turbulent structure and entrainment of the flow. The
study establishes an experimental data base that can be utilized in testing and
developing mathematical models.
