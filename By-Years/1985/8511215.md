Adsorption of gases on solid surfaces is studied using molecular theory. The
primary focus is on understanding the relationship between effects of surface
structure and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions in adsorption equilibria. Two
complementary thrusts are pursued. The first concerns the development and
application of theories of adsorption equilibria for multicomponent systems. Of
particular interest is the influence of surface structure on non-ideal behavior
in adsorbed solutions. The second thrust is concerned with the molecular based
computer simulation of adsorbed layers. The layers on highly structured
surfaces. This work will be extended to multicomponent systems and multilayer
adsorption.
