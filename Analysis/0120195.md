This award is for the partial support of the International Conference on
Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics. The conference is a part of the
series of conferences that were held six times at the University of Alabama and
twice at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The conference will cover a broad
range of topics, including: analysis of Schrodinger operators, quantum
electrodynamics, fluid dynamics, conservation laws, evolution equations,
spectral and scattering theory, inverse problems and many related topics. The
list of plenary speakers includes many world class established researchers and
young talented mathematicians.
