classification problem (known variously as: pattern recognition, discriminant
analysis, and pattern grouping) seem to be found virtually anywhere and
everywhere. In general such problems involve the need to assign objects to
various groups, or classes. Recent attempts to solve this problem have employed
linear programming methods and, in particular, neural networks. In this research
an approach will be developed that combines linear programming (specifically,
traditional linear programming and/or linear goal programming) with neural
networks an approach that should prove to be a significant advance over earlier
and ongoing attempts toward the development of such combinations. Ongoing
efforts toward neural network design/training via linear programming have failed
to either consider or include an adequately rigorous treatment of the specifics
of hardware replication. The researchers will develop and evaluate a detailed
representation of all pertinent network processing elements and connections in
order that direct replication via hardware ultimately be permitted.
