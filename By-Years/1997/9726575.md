CMS 9726575 Duval Previous research suggests that exposure to a fear-arousing
or negative threat appeal type of persuasive communication can increase level of
earthquake preparedness. In this study a theory of coping with threatening
events referred to as the person-relative-to-event (PrE) approach is used to
generate predictions concerning the impact of this type of communication on
earthquake preparedness. In particular, using PrE theory as a theoretical
framework, the proposed research extends prior findings by determining which
levels and combination of various levels of the variables included in the
content of negative threat appeals are most effective in increasing earthquake
preparedness. The research will be conducted in laboratory and field settings
and will seek to (1) advance the technological base on earthquake preparedness
by determining the conditions that increase individual and household
preparedness and mitigation, and (2) expand the existing data base on earthquake
preparedness by obtaining data on current levels of household preparedness among
two different populations. The outcomes from the research can be incorporated
into existing earthquake preparedness programs and can also be applied to
hazards other than earthquakes, e.g., floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
