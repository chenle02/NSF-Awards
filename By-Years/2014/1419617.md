TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In regard to
Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact the planned symposium on "Recent Advances
in Electrospinning" will cover the recent fundamental and technological
developments in the electrospinning of polynmers and the impact of its fibrous
products in various significant areas which include medical, energy, and
environmentally oriented applications. Attendance at the symposium will be of
significant educational benefit to attending graduate students, postdocs and
young faculty starting in or planning to venture into the field of
electrispinning.
