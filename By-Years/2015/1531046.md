The economic and competitive value of widely available advanced networking has
become well known, with availabity of next generation networking impacting
factors as basic as homeowner property values and housing rents. However,
deployment of next generation networking in U.S. cities and regions has lagged
that of a number of other nations. This project assembles and jump-starts a
growing and sustainable ecosystem of smart gigabit city testbeds which support
applications delivering important new advances in healthcare, education, public
safety, and other national priority areas. These advanced ecosystems leverage
advanced Internet concepts developed by prior NSF research programs that are not
yet available on today's commercial Internet. By leveraging existing multi-
gigabit links to interconnect the cities, and by providing city-based
interoperable application infrastructure the project allows entrepreneurs and
academics in one city to write and trial visually-compelling and ultra-
responsive new Internet applications that can be replicated into other cities
and regions. An important key will be the involvement of citizens and community
organizations in building and experimenting with advanced networking
applications addressing national priorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will: 1) Mobilize and interconnect 12 to 15 cities and regions as smart gigabit
city testbeds and connect to a small number of other volunteers from the U.S.
UCAN community anchor community; 2) leverage GENI technology and deploy a new
community-focused computing infrastructure; support the develop and adapt
national priority and smart city applications that uniquely leverage this
infrastructure and can be replicated in the other cities and regions; 4)
Identify novel unsolved problems that can help define areas for future Internet
research and 5) share information among ecosystem participants. To maximize the
network effects, the project will utilize interoperable advanced wired and
wireless applications platforms, interoperable federation, authentication and
authorization, and built-in security measures and measurement/logging. This
project builds the initial infrastructure upon the distributed infrastructure
pioneered and deployed by the GENI and prior US Ignite projects in the academic
or civic networking infrastructures of 56 cities in the United States.
