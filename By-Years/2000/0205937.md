AST-0205937&lt;br/&gt;Blain, Andrew W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will
develop new understanding of the nature of very-luminous dust-enshrouded high
redshift galaxies recently discovered in the submillimeter waveband. These
luminous distant 'SMGs ' generate a significant fraction of the energy emitted
by all galaxies over the early history of the Universe, and yet are still poorly
understood. This is largely because the angular resolution of even the most
powerful submillimeter-wave survey telescopes is not sufficient to pin down the
positions of SMGs with sufficient accuracy to confirm a single galaxy as their
counterpart in an optical image. This program will determine accurate positions
for the counterparts, and then determine their redshifts and astrophysical
properties. Measuring the redshift distribution for the SMGs is a particularly
important goal. This is the most important piece of information required to
determine the evolution of the population of SMGs, and their relationship with
the larger and better understood samples of high-redshift galaxies detected in
optical galaxy surveys.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
