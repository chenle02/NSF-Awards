This award from the Office of Special Projects of the Division of Chemistry will
enable the participation of twelve young U.S. chemists in the Bilateral NSF-
Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Workshop on Organometallics in
Organic Synthesis being held at Loch Lomond, Scotland, on August 2-7, 1992. This
workshop, convened at recommendation of the NSF Chemistry Advisory Committee,
brings together some twenty-five young American and British scientists who are
likely to become leaders in the field. %%% The formation of carbon-carbon bonds
in a predictable manner is of utmost importance to organic synthesis. In this
context, reactions which proceed through the intermediacy of organometallic
complexes have become increasingly important. Organometallic chemistry bridges
the traditional disciplines of organic and inorganic chemistry by allowing
metals to act as templates for organic reactions. The primary aim of this
Bilateral NSF-SERC Workshop on Organometallics in Organic Synthesis is to expose
young scientists to the wider community of international scholarship and to
build the foundation for long term international collaborations.
