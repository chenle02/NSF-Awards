STOCHASTIC MODELS FOR QUEUEING AND FINANCE NSF Proposal: DMS-0103814 Principal
Investigator: Steven E. Shreve

ABSTRACT

Work is proposed in two areas. The first is the analysis of queueing systems
with deadlines under heavy traffic conditions. Consider a queueing system with
renewal process arrival streams. Suppose that upon arrival, each customer is
assigned a lead time, the amount of time until the customer's deadline for
service elapses. One can model the lead times of the customers in queue at a
station as a counting measure on the real line, the location of the point masses
corresponding to customer lead times. Research will address the convergence of
these measure-valued processes under heavy-traffic scaling. Research will also
be directed to mathematical models for finance. On such model is for an option
on a traded account. For the simplest of these, an account trading one
underlying geometric Brownian motion and a constant-interest-rate money market,
there is a strikingly simple optimal rule: hold the geometric Brownian motion
long when the account value is negative and short when the account value is
positive. For an option on two geometric Brownian motions, there is a
conjectured optimal rule, which is supported by numerical analysis. The proof
appears to require the development of new mathematics. A second mathematical
finance problem concerns the development of a unifying model for risk-neutral
pricing of credit derivatives.

This research has two parts. The subject of the first part, queueing systems
with deadlines, arise in communication networks, especially networks used to
transmit digitized video or audio signals. Data which are too long delayed can
cause unacceptable disruption of the signal. The proposed research will provide
a basis for performance analysis of heavily-loaded communication networks which
take deadlines into account. The subject of the second part, mathematical models
for finance, builds on the revolution in finance begun by the Black-Scholes
option pricing formula. The particular work proposed here is concerned with
proper pricing and usage of financial instruments whose purpose is to insure
against loss, either due to drastic reduction in market value (options on a
traded account) or default (credit derivatives).
