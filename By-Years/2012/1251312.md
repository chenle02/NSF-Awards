Most modern microprocessors support some form of vector operations that allow
the same operation to be applied to small vectors of arguments simultaneously.
Studies have shown that use of these instructions can improve the performance of
many scientific codes by a factor of 2 or more. Unfortunately, the state of the
art in autovectorization falls far short of this goal, only achieving
improvements of 20-30% on the same codes.

While studies have shown that current autovectorizing compilers do not identify
all of the opportunities for vectorization, little is known about why they fail
to do so. Specifically, the project will focus on identifying weaknesses in
compiler analyses that cause failures to vectorize. The goal of this research is
to identify a list of causes that are responsible for the vast majority of these
failures. This research will make it possible to develop better compiler
analysis algorithms that will result in better autovectorizing compilers. The
performance benefits of such compilers will improve the performance of
applications ranging from multimedia software to scientific computing.
