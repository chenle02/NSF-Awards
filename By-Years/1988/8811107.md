The objective of this research is to study the interfacial mechanical responses
of advanced composites composed of chemically modified carbon fibers in
thermoplastic matrix. Electron spectroscopy will be used to identify the surface
composition of various surface treated carbon fibers. Scanning electron
microscopy will be used to probe the modes of mechanical failure of the
resultant composites. Experiments will be conducted in an environmental chamber
and the interfacial failure during tensile testing will be observed in-situ with
a video camera. The results are expected to facilitate the design of superior
polymeric composites.
