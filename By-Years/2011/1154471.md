The Achieving in Research, Mathematics and Science (ARMAS) Scholarship Program
provides $10,000 per year for up to a three-year period to three cohorts of four
New Mexico Highlands undergraduates majoring in biology, chemistry,
environmental geology or forestry. The financial support will enable students to
work off-campus less and focus on attending school full-time during the last
years of their studies. Integrated with financial support, students receive
enhanced academic and career support services, faculty mentorship, and peer
support. Each semester the ARMAS scholars participate in an interdisciplinary,
problem-based seminar that incorporates the acquisition of skills required of
scientists - how to pose questions, delve into the existing literature, design
experiments, find collaborators, use new instruments, develop protocols, collect
and analyze data, and summarize and present results. Throughout the scholarship
period, guidance is provided to ensure a smooth transition into a career or
graduate program in their field. NMHU is an open enrollment institution serving
a large rural population characterized by diverse cultural, economic,
linguistic, and educational backgrounds. The ARMAS Scholarship Program addresses
the needs of these students and the NSF S-STEM goals by improving educational
opportunities and increasing retention for STEM students, consequently
addressing retention and graduation rates in the biology, forestry,
environmental geology and chemistry disciplines at a Hispanic-Serving
Institution in rural northern New Mexico.
