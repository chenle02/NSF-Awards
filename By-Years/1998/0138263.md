Cordes, J.&lt;br/&gt;AST-0138263&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Square Kilometer Array
(SKA) is a concept for a very large new radio telescope with a collecting area
of one square kilometer, covering wavelengths in the meter and centimeter range.
It is being conceived as an international project, with competing designs
emerging in Europe, Australia, China, and the US. This project will develop a US
design concept to be presented to the International SKA Steering Committee in
2005. The Steering Committee will review all submitted designs and choose one
for adoption and further development by the international community. The funded
program will develop the US concept of many thousands of relatively small radio
telescopes spread over a wide area, acting together as an interferometeric
array. The timeframe for completion of the SKA, should it ultimately be funded,
is around 2015-2020. Therefore the proposed work falls in the realm of an
initial concept definition and feasibility study. &lt;br/&gt;The astronomical
community endorsed SKA technology development by listing it high in priority
under Moderate Initiatives in the most recent NRC Decadal Survey report.
