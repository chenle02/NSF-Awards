This project is for U-Th-Ra isotopic studies of young volcanic systems.
Traditionally, these measurements have been made by alpha spectroscopy and the
ability to see into the volcanic system has been limited by the precision and
large sample requirements of the counting techniques. The new Isolab 54 mass
spectrometer at Lamont enable the PIs to make direct measurement of 230Th/232dTh
ratios in igneous rocks. They also plan to measure 226Ra abundances with the
mass spectrometer made by counting techniques. RE/Os isotope measurements should
also be possible with this new machine. Enhanced precision afforded by mass
spectrometric methods yields finer time resolution for magmatic processes,
including partial melting and fluid transfer in the mantle, evolution of crustal
magma reservoirs, and dynamics of volcanic plumbing systems, as well as better
understanding of the transport and fractionation of U/Th in the Earth. They plan
specific work on four well-characterized young volcanic centers, covering a
spectrum of magma type, tectonic setting, and volcanic style.
