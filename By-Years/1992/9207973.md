The eventual goal of Quinn's program is to develop invariants of smooth compact
4-manifolds which, for example, could detect counterexamples to the smooth
4-dimensional Poincare conjecture. The first part of the program (this project)
will be devoted primarily to study of a model problem, the Andrews-Curtis
conjecture on 2-complexes. The invariants under consideration are "topological
quantum field theories" in the sense of Atiyah and Witten. The Poincare
conjecture asserts that any manifold that has certain simple topological
properties in common with a topological sphere must actually be a topological
sphere. It was originally stated for three-dimensional manifolds around the turn
of the century and subsequently generalized to all higher dimensions. Curiously,
all these generalizations have now been settled (in the affirmative), but the
original case for three-dimensional spheres still resists all assaults. The
foregoing remarks apply to topological manifolds. The situation is slightly
different for smooth manifolds. Here both the three- and the four-dimensional
versions of the Poincare conjecture remain open. What Quinn is hoping to do is
to settle the four-dimensional case, using methods inspired by a mathematical
formulation of quantum field theory.
