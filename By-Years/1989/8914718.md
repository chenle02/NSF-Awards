This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Elias Aifantis,
Michigan Technological University and Dr. Joel Lepinoux, Laboratory for Physical
Metallurgy, Poitiers, France. The objective of the project is the study of
dislocation-crack interactions under dynamical situations. Various conditions
including mixed loading modes, as well as the influence of environment and
microstructure will be considered. Two general approaches will be used: 1)
classical dislocation simulations in two dimensions and 2) nonlinear dislocation
dynamics. The possibility of using the cellular automata method will also be
explored. The results of this research may lead to a framework for considering
crack stability and growth, as well as a new fundamental understanding of
fracture toughness related phenomena. This project will benefit from the
complementary expertise of the two investigators. Both groups have been working
for several years on the problem of self organization of disloca- tions by using
two different methods: nonlinear dynamics (US) and simulation with cellular
automata (France).
