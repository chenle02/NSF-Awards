Dr. Andrew Myers is being given the Presidential Young Investigator Award from
the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program to support his research into the
development of new synthetic methodology for biologically active molecules. This
work will provide the information required to synthesize the new generation of
molecules needed by agriculture and industry. Techniques of chemical synthesis
will be developed and applied to the preparation of molecules of biological
importance. In the latter category are designed molecules which are accessible
only through total synthesis. It is hoped that a deeper understanding of these
bioactive substances and their mode of action will be gained through study of
their properties, with emphasis on reactivity. One such molecule under study is
the antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin. Ongoing investigations are aimed at
elucidation of the precise mechanism of action of this DNA-damaging agent.
Synthetic studies towards the antibiotic as well as analog structures are
currently underway. One goal is to utilize the strategic concepts by which
neocarzinostatin targets and destroys double stranded DNA in the design of
completely non-natural mimics. The highly enfolded and complex antitumor agent
Calyculin A represents another target for study. A fundamental goal of this
undertaking is the development of reaction methodology of value not only for the
synthesis of this antibiotic, but for the preparation of stereochemically
complex molecules in general. Again, it is anticipated that through the unique
perspective of synthesis/reactivity that valuable insights into the mechanism of
action of this substance will be gained. In addition to the methodological
studies encompassed by the projects described above, fundamental studies of
greater applicability in synthesis are planned. Transformations which represent
powerful solutions to widespread and general synthetic problems, such as the
preparation of geometrically defined carbon carbon double bonds, are targeted
with the goal of devising new and useful solutions.
