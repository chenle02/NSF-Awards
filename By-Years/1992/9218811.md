One of the most important events that have impact on plant growth, development,
and productivity is the distribution of photosynthetic products, usually sugar
molecules, throughout the organs of the plant. The distribution depends on
regulating sugar transport across the plasma membrane of plant cells. It has
been speculated that this process involves carrier molecules, however, very
little is known about the carrier molecules themselves. Recently, Drs. Grimes
and Hitz and their collaborators have identified and cloned a plasma membrane
protein that appears to possess all the right characteristics to be a sucrose
transporter. In this project, Drs. Grimes and Hitz will further characterize the
nature and role of this protein, called 62 SBP, using various approaches
including membrane physiology, protein analysis, genetic engineering and
immunology. They will also collaborate with a group in Germany who has
identified another membrane protein that appears to play a role in sucrose
transport. It is generally believed that sucrose transport system is complex,
consisting of several components. Therefore, this collaboration is likely to
enhance the opportunity to advance our understanding of the sucrose transport
process in higher plants. The primary experimental system for this project is
soybean cotyledon as virtually all of the cells in the soybean cotyledon are
actively transporting sucrose. Successful completion of this project will
provide a tool to further studies of the mechanisms by which plants distribute
their photosynthetic products, which will ultimately contribute to our
understanding of the mechanisms of growth and development in plants.
