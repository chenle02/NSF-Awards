The research objective of this award is to formulate a methodology and system
for the micro-manipulation of a waterjet serving as a laser beam waveguide
leading to the development of a new multi-functional hybrid waterjet-guided
laser micro-manufacturing process and machine capable of laser ablation, micro-
cutting, surface micro-texturing and modification and micro-incremental forming.
The salient characteristic of the envisioned process rests in the possibility of
simultaneously using thermal and mechanical actions with different attributes in
controlled proportions. The approach will be the use of a controlled
electrostatic field generated by a multi-pole actuator to bend the waterjet
waveguide and, thereby, control the spatial orientation, the position of
impingement, direction of lasing action and the force the waterjet exerts on the
workpiece. The principal tasks will be: (1) waterjet waveguide characterization;
(2) waterjet bending and control through an electrostatic actuator; (3)
waterjet-guided micro-incremental forming process development; and (4)
construction of an experimental prototype machine to serve as a vehicle for
process model and technology verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
this research will lead to a new ability to manufacture three-dimensional micro-
features on metallic and non-metallic parts without relocating the part, which
will lead to enhanced precision. The physical interaction of the waterjet and
laser beam will open process windows for achieving deformation, cutting, and
surface treatment of the workpiece material in a single hybrid integrated
manufacturing machine. Process productivity will be considerably enhanced
because of the anticipated high process bandwidth. The project will provide
training to a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students and
practitioners through research opportunities, course projects and short courses.
