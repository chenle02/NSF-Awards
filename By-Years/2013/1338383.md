This engineering education research project focuses on using bio-inspired design
--i.e. using nature as an inspiration to design--in order to teach innovation to
mechanical engineering students. The research focuses on best practices to teach
engineers to draw on nature for inspiration in design. The research will be
integrated into the curriculum by establishing a certificate program at Texas
A&M University. Students who wish to obtain the certificate take selected
electives, at the cost of one additional credit hour in the program. To measure
the impact on the project on student learning, both quantitative and qualitative
longitudinal assessments are planned throughout students' collegiate experience
and certificate activities. This project should better inform what learning
approaches successfully address innovation, and test whether bio-inspired design
is an effective pedagogy. The project may also make mechanical engineering a
more approachable and attractive subject to students who are traditionally
under-represented in engineering.
