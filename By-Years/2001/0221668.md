Though this TCUP planning award Little Big Horn College, located on the Crow
Reservation, will develop a comprehensive long-term plan for strengthening the
institution's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs.
The project will be divided into four phases: assessment of the current status
of STEM curricula, infrastructure and student support; implementation of a 2-day
planning retreat; development of the detailed long-range STEM plan; and
preparation/submission of a TCUP implementation award
proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The institution feels that the planning process
and the development of a long-term STEM plan will provide it with the potential
to make significant and sustainable improvements in the STEM programs including
better integration and leveraging of information technology. &lt;br/&gt;
