This applicant proposes to study regulation of the system which produces the
protein elastin. More specifically, the work will employ biochemistry and
molecular biology techniques to focus on the effects of cell division stage and
messenger RNA stability on the replication and transcription processes. The work
is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Carl Franzblau at the Boston
University School of Medicine.
