9411980 Hoyt A novel flow visualization technique for large scale flow
structures, with particular application to turbulent eddy flows, is proposed.
The method consists in generating visualizing fluid filaments, of specific
density close to unity, and then using them as tracers. The essential issue is
maintaining the filament coherence and diameter. Long-chain polymer solutions
and specially prepared surfactant solutions will be used for filaments. Dual
exposure photographs, with quantitatively evaluate local flow structures. The
method is simple, cost effective and can be easily applied once the best
composition of the filament has been established. ***
