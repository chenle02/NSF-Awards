Professor Cao plans to continue his research on global Riemannian geometry and
analysis of curved spaces, with emphasis on manifolds of non-positive curvature.
He will continue the use of (possibly singular) differential equations in order
to solve various problems in Riemannian geometry. In addition, the PI continues
to study minimal positive harmonic functions and CR-Einstein equations via
methods from Riemannian geometry and sub-Riemannian geometry. Many of the
important advances in solving differential equations depend on the geometric
understanding of these problems. The PI will continue to work in this direction.
Solving problems in global Riemannian geometry sometimes depends on new tools
from analysis. The PI will use techniques from analysis to investigate various
problems in Riemannian geometry and Cauchy-Riemann geometry.

Together with Cheeger-Rong, the PI intends to use various foliated heat flows
to study the Cheeger-Gromov collapsing theory on manifolds with non-positive
curvature. He hopes to understand the homotopy invariance of so-called
F-structures on non-positively curved manifolds. Secondly, the PI and his
collaborators will continue the study of minimal positive harmonic functions on
open manifolds. In particular, he wants to provide a partial answer to a problem
of Yau on minimal positive harmonic functions (i.e., Martin boundary problem for
manifolds of Ballmann rank one). Thirdly, the PI plans to study the CR-Einstein
equations and the CR-Calabi problem on sub-Riemannian manifolds via various
geometric methods. In addition, the PI plans to continue the study of the
critical point theory for distance function on Alexandrov spaces with curvature
bounded below. He will investigate the relations between generalized Morse
theory for distance functions and the collapsing of 3-manifolds, as outlined in
Perelman's recent work.
