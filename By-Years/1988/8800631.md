This doctoral dissertation award will support a study of the late Quaternary
climatic and phytogeographic history of the Arizona monsoon. The purpose of the
project is to provide information on the timing and extent of the putative
monsoonal maximum during the glacial- interglacial transition. The project will
add to our knowledge of the effects of human activities on climate by
illuminating the long-term fluctuations that occurred prior to major human
impacts. It will contribute baseline data needed to evaluate the variability of
climate in the post- agricultural and industrial periods by establishing a good
record of climate over the U.S. Southwest during the Holocene. The project will
enhance our understanding of potential desertification in this region of the
country as well as of effects of global climatic change.
