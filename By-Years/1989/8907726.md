This research will focus on the analysis of data and publication of results
from measurements of p-pbar collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.8 TeV
made using the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. These measurements were carried out
under the name of Fermilab experiment E735. E735 was unique in that it
accurately measured particle production at relatively low transverse momenta, Pt
&lt; 3 GeV, identifying the type of particle detected as being a pi+, pi-, K+,
K-, p, pbar, lambda, or lambda bar. Charged particle multiplicity was also
measured. E735 is expected to provide important information on the basic
mechanisms of particle production at the highest energies presently obtainable
in the laboratory. The results will be compared to a wide range of theoretical
models, such as those that predict the existence of a new form of matter called
the quark-gluon plasma.
