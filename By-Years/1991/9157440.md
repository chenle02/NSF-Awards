The focus of this research is the investigation of new approaches for the design
and production of catalytic antibodies. In general, antibodies raised to
compounds that resemble transition states of a desired reaction are expected to
use binding forces to lower the energy of a real transition state in the
analogous chemical transformation. Catalytic rate enhancements as high as one
million-fold over background have been observed using this strategy. Exquisite
substrate specificity, including stereospecificity when appropriate, is always
observed, and this specificity can be programmed into the antibody by the
structure of the original immunizing haptens. There are three major projects,
all designed to exploit this programmable specificity of catalytic antibodies.
In each case, standard hybridoma techniques for production of monoclonal
antibodies in mice enhanced by new molecular biology methods will be used. The
first project will probe the use of catalytic antibodies to manipulate chemical
protecting groups during organic synthesis. The second project involves testing
the utility of metal cofactors in antibody catalyzed reactions. The third
project seeks to generate an antibody-based system that can reproduce some of
the essential features of photosynthesis. %%% With this Presidential Young
Investigator Award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division will
support the research of Dr. Brent Iverson of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin on catalytic antibodies. These
antibodies, produced by challenging the immune systems of mice with compounds
that resemble high energy or transition states of desired reactions, frequently
are capable of providing catalytic rate enhancements as high as one million-
fold. Thus these antibodies resemble enzymes in being catalytic proteins, but
function to catalyze reactions for which no enzymes exist.
