General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awareness of ethical issues in experimental
political science is growing. This workshop brings together political science
scholars and research integrity scholars to address critical needs in the
ethical design, review, and implementation of experimental research. Unlike past
discussions within political science, this workshop includes both political
scientists engaged in experimental research and experts in the ethics of human-
subjects research to develop best practice recommendations that will protect
human subjects, researchers, the field of political science, institutions of
higher learning, and the public's investment in
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awareness

brings together political science scholars and research integrity scholars to
address critical needs in the ethical design, review, and implementation of
experimental research. Unlike past discussions within political science, this
workshop includes both political scientists engaged in experimental research and
experts in the ethics of human-subjects research. Invited speakers and
discussants will address in both panel and round table form the following issue
areas: (1) special issues in consent and deceptive research; (2) managing
incidental findings and collateral and community harms; (3) working with
community and industry partners to conduct responsible research; (4) enhancing
community capacity for review and consent in internationally sponsored research;
(5) identifying descriptive and normative baselines when assessing risk, harm,
and exploitation; (6) quantifying psychological harms; and (7) special concerns
when using pre-existing data sets.
