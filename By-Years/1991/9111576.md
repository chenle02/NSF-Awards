Research will be conducted on phase transitions in frustrated systems such as
spin glasses. In addition to studying a number of aspects of the spin glass
problem, application of spin glass ideas to the issue of the existence of a
vortex glass in a type II superconductor with disorder in a magnetic field will
also be pursued. This will determine whether high temperature superconductors
have strictly zero resistance in a magnetic field. Work on phase transitions in
quantum systems will also be developed. In particular, the universal conductance
expected at the zero temperature transition between insulating and
superconducting phases in disordered thin films will be investigated. Since
analytic approaches have turned out to be very complicated for the proposed
problems, the emphasis will be on numerical simulations. %%% Numerical
techniques will be applied to study phase transitions in a variety of systems in
which quantum effects and disorder dominate. Included will be studies of spin
glasses, vortex glasses in high temperature superconductors and the insulator-
superconductor transition in disordered thin films at zero temperature. All of
these problems are of great current interest in condensed matter and materials
physics.
