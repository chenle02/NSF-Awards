This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Antonio Montalban
studies problems in both pure and applied Computability Theory. The problems in
pure computability theory are part of the ongoing program to understand the
structure of the Turing Degrees. As for applied computability theory, Montalban
applies methods from computability theory to study the effective content and
proof-theoretical strength of various areas of both classical mathematics and
foundations of mathematics. He concentrates in problems related to linear
orderings, Boolean algebras, and ordinals, but not
exclusively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Computability Theory is the area of Logic
that studies the notion of algorithm. Its applications are based on the idea
that problems that can be solved using algorithms are simpler than the ones that
cannot. This is used in various ways to measure the complexity of mathematical
objects, constructions and proofs. It is usually the case that this analysis
gives a better understanding of the subject under study.
