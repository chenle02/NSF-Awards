Hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions on hydrocarbons produce valuable
intermediates for the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, but traditional
oxidation processes are energy-or resource-intensive and produce unwanted and
often environmentally hazardous side products. The objective of this research is
to use a highly efficient alkane hydroxylase as the starting point for evolving
catalysts for (1) the conversion of methane to methanol and (2) alkene
epoxidation. Both of these goals are within reach, due to the special properties
of the evolved alkane hydroxylase, which, as a side product of the previous
evolution, acquired sufficient activity on small alkanes and on alkenes for
screening mutant libraries for further improved catalysts. The biocatalysts
discovered can be used in developing practical and clean hydroxylation and
epoxidation processes.
