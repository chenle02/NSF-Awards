The Chemistry Department is reshaping its analytical chemistry laboratory
courses such that students are studying and learning analytical chemistry in the
same way it is practiced by professional chemists. A computer is being provided
at every work station, where the computer is being used in conjunction with an
interface and various sensors to control experiments and collect and analyze
data. This frees the student from much of the drudgery of data acquisition and
allows more time for thought-intensive activities such as decisions on optimal
experiment design and the most appropriate way to treat data resulting from the
measurements made. In addition, because the computer gathers large amounts of
data rapidly and accurately, students are being exposed to experiments which are
more complex and interesting than those previously possible. The changes are
bringing a new and exciting vitality to the analytical chemistry courses. The
equipment being used to achieve these goals includes 16 computers, 16 interfaces
and associated sensors, and four printers to serve a total of 32 students at a
given time.
