9322378 Newman This award provides funds to establish a Research Experience for
Undergraduates site at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) of Michigan
State University. The program will provide undergraduate students the
opportunity to participate in an integrative program in ecological field
research, which is considered an essential part of the education of scientists
with the skills to address complex environmental problems. Students will be
exposed to concepts and techniques from a variety of subdisciplines, levels of
ecological organization (genes to landscapes), scales, and habitats through
weekly seminars led by resident and visiting researchers. Weekly group meetings
will provide a forum to discuss research ideas and approaches, conceptual
aspects of ecology and evolutionary biology, and project proposals. Each student
will develop and conduct an independent project under the guidance of a faculty
mentor, which will include all stages of scientific inquiry: identification and
refinement of questions, experimental and sampling design, field work, and data
analysis and presentation. Results will be presented to the KBS community at an
REU symposium at the end of the summer, and written up in the form of a
manuscript for publication in a scientific journal. ***
