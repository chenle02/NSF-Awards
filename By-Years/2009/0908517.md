One of the recent developments of mathematical image processing is the
introduction of the G-norm by Meyer, which opened the door for handling texture
and oscillations. The investigator further develops these techniques for color
images and blurred texture analysis. The goals of this project are to explore
more sophisticated color models for image decomposition, as well as to correctly
capture the texture in blurry images. The main challenge is to tackle image
blind deconvolution in combination with image decomposition techniques.

The investigator studies the classical problem of image deblurring in a modern
setting of texture and color image analysis. Recognition of detail has become
more crucial for better diagnosis of medical images and for more accurate
recovery of satellite images. This project provides theoretical background for
methodologies and can be applied to solve real imaging problems arising from
digital photo restorations, medical imaging, communications, information
science, and many other applications.
