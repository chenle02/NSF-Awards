9529953 Kastner Fluid and solid samples will be analyzed for Cl concentration
and isotopic composition from six sites in three geologically, sedimentology,
and hydrologically different subduction systems: Barbados, Nankai, and Mariana.
On the basis of previous extensive geologic, mineralogic, chemicals, and
isotopic characterizations, samples of pore waters, sediments, altered basalts,
and their related mineral separates have been carefully selected for this study.
Emphasis will be placed on the important and abundant ocean floor hydrous
silicates, especially clay minerals (e.g., smectite, illite, chlorite), other
micas, serpentine, talc, and amphibole. Potential precursor phases of authigenic
hydrous minerals will also be analzyed (e.g. volcanic arc glass and tuffs). This
new data set will be interpreted in terms of kinetic isotopic enrichment (i.e.,
diffusion), advective mass transport, and fluid-rock reaction models and applied
to processes occuring in convergent margins.
