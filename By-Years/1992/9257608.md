This is an award to provide support for research on simulation and modeling to
visualize the behavior of complex environmental processes as components of
systems that are subject to random fluctuation. He plans to combine
considerations of environmental processes as variable in nature with classical
approaches to environmental hydrology to model the transport of contaminants in
the environment. This award is in accord with conditions contained in NSF
91-112, Young Investigator Awards FY 1992 Program Guidelines for Submission of
Nominations. Factors that control the transport and fate of pollutants in
aqueous systems are of interest because of the role they play in controlling the
movement and fate of the pollutants through aquifers, in treatment process and
natural systems. Results of this research may be applied to engineering design
of approaches to environmental pollution problems resulting from urban storm
runoff, combined sewer overflows and agricultural nonpoint sources of surface
and groundwater pollutants.
