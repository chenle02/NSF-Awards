Professor Benny Gerber, U. C. Irvine, is supported by a grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the dynamics of
molecular reactions in clusters. Gerber will study photochemical reactions in
hydrogen bonded and in van der Waals cluster as well as collision-induced
reactions of atoms with such clusters. Research will be conducted in four areas:
1) The study of possible collective reactions induced by UV excitation of
hydrogen bonded clusters; 2) Differences in reactivity between solid-like and
liquid-like states of clusters; 3) Electronic relaxation of excited atoms and
molecules solvated in clusters; and 4) Photodissociation / recombination on the
electronic ground state of molecules in clusters. A combination of classical MD
and semiclassical wavepacket treatments will be employed. A semiclassical
technique will be used to preserve zero point energy in the molecular dynamics
treatments which employs wavepackets for stiff vibrational modes and classical
dynamics for soft modes. The study of molecular reactions in clusters is of
primary importance as a technique for gaining additional insight into the
effects of solvation upon chemical reactions. Experimental and theoretical
conditions can be varied in a systematic fashion from relatively small clusters
consisting of a few isolated molecules all the way to large clusters which mimic
condensed matter in the bulk solution.
