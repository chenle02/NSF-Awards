The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) supports student attendance at and
development of the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing. The
Tapia Conference series highlights the technical achievements of diverse
researchers in computing. It provides a unique forum to support diverse students
(undergraduates and graduate students) and professionals. The conference
programs include invited speakers, workshops, birds-of-a-feather sessions,
panels, a student poster competition and a doctoral consortium. The programs
allow leadership development activities for the students as well as young
professionals. Moreover, they include significant time for networking about
research collaborations and professional development. This proposal will support
student scholarships for the conference and the doctoral consortium in 2016.
