Retrotransposons are a major component of eukaryotic moderately repetitive DNA.
In Drosophila, many spontaneous mutations are caused by movement of these
elements. Mutant phenotypes result from insertions into both coding and
noncoding regions. Drosophila retrotransposons are developmentally programmed
transcription units, and insertions into noncoding regions introduce
transcriptional control signals that can affect the expression of genes at the
sites of insertion. Some phenotypes resulting from retrotransposon insertions
into noncoding gene regions can be reversed by extragenic suppressor mutations.
The long term objective of this study is to understand how these elements
disrupt the expression of nearby genes and to elucidate the role of suppressors
in modulating the mutagenic activity of retrotransposons.
