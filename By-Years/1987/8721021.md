The research will examine the preservation of the bone matrix protein
osteocalcin (referred to below as OC) in fossil bone and the possible use of
that protein for immunotaxonomy of fossil vertebrates. This research will
constitute the major emphasis of this renewal period. We have found that OC is
preserved in fossil bovine and rodent bone at least 18-30 million years old.
This occurrence was confirmed both immunologically and biochemically. In
addition, we have extracted macromolecules from fossil horse bone (Miohippus,
Oligocene (28 million years old), South Dakota) and have elicited reaction with
antibodies raised against modern horse OC. The discovery of preserved antigenic
determinants and potentially preserved proteins in such ancient materials opens
the possibility for molecular paleontology studies of phylogenetic relationships
among major groups of extinct organisms, something which is not possible with
the usual molecular biological methods applied to modern organisms
(mitochondrial DNA restriction enzyme site mapping, etc.) This new research
could be of major significance in understanding relationships among fossil
vertebrates, including extinct groups. This research is unique in its direct
study of macromolecules extracted from fossils, rather than reconstructing
phylogenetic relationships from data on modern taxa.
