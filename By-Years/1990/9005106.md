The recovery efforts from the impact of Hurricane Hugo on South Carolina will
be examined. The issues presented during the near-tern recovery will be
identified; the influence of past experiences in hurricane recovery will be
scrutinized; and the assumptions and expectations from federal, state, local
public and private organizations made for the formulation of recovery plans will
be compared with the actual recovery actions. The result of this work will
benefit natural hazards researchers, administrators, planners, the insurance
industry, and other professionals dealing with natural disasters mitigation.
