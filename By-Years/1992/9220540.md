This research is being conducted by Dr. Olivier Rieppel, a vertebrate
paleontologist from the Chicago Field Museum of Natural History. Dr. Rieppel is
examining the Sauropterygia, an extinct group of diapsid reptiles. The research
focuses on variation in a host of anatomical features, with a primary emphasis
on understanding the relationships among sauropterygian groups. The derivation
of these relationships are essential to understanding diversification in more
modern diapsids. Another important aspect of this research is that changes in
the limbs of aquatic reptiles can be used as a model for studying patterns of
developmental rates, especially as they relate to changes in the vertebrate
skeleton. The relationships derived from this study will provide the necessary
interpretive framework for assessing these developmental processes.
