This Oceanography Short Course for Instructors of Undergraduate Marine Sciences
is updating instructors from 2- and 4-year institutions in the technologically
impacted ocean sciences. State of the art information in marine research and
applications is being provided, along with hands-on experiences in oceanographic
sample collecting and data analysis and new instructional materials and
techniques. Forty participants selected from across the nation are earning three
graduate semester hours in Marine Studies by participating in a variety of
activities at the University, and at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD),
Grossmont Community College, the coastal nuclear power station at San Onofre,
commercial agriculture facilities and Sea World/Hubbs Research Institute. Field
excursions include data and sample collecting aboard the 125' R/V Gordon Sproul,
site visits to classic exposures of sedimentary marine facies, and a voyage past
the Los Coronados Islands to Ensenada, Mexico, to the University Autonomia de
Baja California Marine Studies facilities. The program is presenting a broad
spectrum of ocean-related information for undergraduate classrooms: cutting edge
scientific information, instructional materials and software, and data on
current marine studies programs and employment possibilities. Funds are also
being provided by the participants home institutions as well as the NSF Block
Grant for the Research Vessel.
