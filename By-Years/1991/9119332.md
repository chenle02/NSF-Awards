The proposed research, jointly supported by the Division of Cellular
Biosciences and the Division of Chemistry, is the continuation of an
interdisciplinary project to understand the action of juvenile hormone at the
molecular level combining the disciplines of chemistry, molecular biology, and
physiology. Major keys include understanding the molecular basis for hormonal
regulation of gene expression in insects (L.M. Riddiford), biochemical and
molecular studies of JH metabolism and synthesis (B.D. Hammock), and use of high
specific activity labeled JHs and JHs (G.D. Prestwich). Three benefits result
from this project. First, the scientific work is directed at a fundamental
problem in regulation of gene expression, and the metamorphosis of insects in an
easily accessible and fascinating model system for this study. Second, the
practical implications of this work may lead to the development of new
biologically specific and environmentally safer insect control strategies for
crop pests. Third, the interdisciplinary training required for the students,
postdoctoral fellow and faculty researchers involved enhances the quality and
breadth of scientific inquiry in each laboratory.
