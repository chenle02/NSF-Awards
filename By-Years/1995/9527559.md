SBR-9527559 Upton/Chattopadhyay This doctoral-dissertation-improvement award
supports archival and field research into the mid-nineteenth-century change in
the reality and perception of Calcutta as a city. Earlier research has allowed
the investigators to propose that the change coincided with socio-economic
changes in the city (namely, the rise of a Bengali middle class) that affected
the urban morphology and image. These changes, in turn, may have affected
subsequent city planning and investment patterns. The research will be carried
out via archival research in London and in Calcutta, using travel journals,
letters, newspaper and journal articles in English and in Bengali, along with
photographs and sketches to provide insights into the natures of the built
environment in nineteenth-century Calcutta. In addition, the research will
entail field observation of historic buildings in representative sections of
contemporary Calcutta. The project should result in a case study of the
interaction of social change, land-use change, and popular image in a colonial
setting. These interactions have relevance to contemporary urban social change
in culturally heterogeneous settings.
