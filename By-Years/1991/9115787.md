This proposal plans to study the structure of borate glasses, and the low
temperature spin dynamics of the boron and oxygen sites, through the use of a
number of techniques including dynamic angle spinning (DAS), magic angle
spinning (MAS), 2D exchange NMR, and low-field nuclear quadruple resonance. The
proposed program plans also to determine the chemical and configurational
orderings in a range of IV-V-VI non-oxide chalcogenide glasses and study the
effect of network connectivity on the nuclear spin relaxation. %%%% This
research will provide information which can aim greatly our understanding of
glass structures. The use of dynamic technique provides the prospect of a
detailed characterization of the disorder in glasses containing quadrupolar
nuclei. This may be especially important when quadrupolar nuclei are the network
forming cations. The dynamic information may be more important in providing link
between general glass theory and the physical meaning of the theoretical
concepts.
