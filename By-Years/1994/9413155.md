This award provides partial support for three political methodology conferences
in the period 1994-1996, organized by officers of the Political Methodology
Section of the American Political Science Association. The National Science
Foundation has cosponsored these summer methodology meetings since 1986. Each
meeting will bring together about three dozen political methodologists, drawn
roughly equally from the ranks of senior faculty, junior faculty, and advanced
graduate students, to present, discuss, and evaluate new work at the
methodological frontier of political science. The experience of the past decade
demonstrates that these special meetings not only provide an important forum for
scientific communication, but also serve to stimulate the production of new
science. In most areas of political science, scholars have a choice of outlets
for presenting their work. But in the field of political methodology, the summer
meetings are the only forum in which a critical mass of technical expertise and
support is available to scholars on a regular basis. The existence of this
critical mass provides a crucial impetus to research at the frontier of
political methodology.
