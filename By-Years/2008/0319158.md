This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop bottom
anti-reflective coatings (BARCs) for production of advanced semiconductor
devices by 157 nm lithography . The NSF Phase I technical objectives are to
demonstrate the feasibility of potential technical approaches to workable 157nm
BARCs. The prototype 157 nm BARCs will be produced and characterized for
critical industry requirements such as low reflectivity, fast plasma etching
rate, and lithographic performance. At least one prototype will be selected and
optimized for use with 157-nm photoresists so that the commercialization will be
projected in the Phase II. &lt;br/&gt; The 157-nm BARCs developed from the NSF
Phase I study will result in a significant step forward for 157-nm lithography
technology and contribute to the future of advanced semiconductor devices
(integrated circuits) fabrication. &lt;br/&gt;
