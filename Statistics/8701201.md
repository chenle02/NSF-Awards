This research will be done by four investigators. The first investigator will
study the consistency, rates of convergence, distribution theory and finite-
sample properties of a class of nonparametric change-point estimators. He will
also investigate the asymptotic distribution theory of degenerate U-statistics
computed from dependent data and compare three nonparametric confidence interval
techniques which are based upon subseries values of a general statistics from a
stationary sequence. The second investigator will study aspects of smoothing
methods, location dependent smoothing, smoothing techniques applied to model
selection, classification, bandwidth and kernel selection and hazard functions.
The third investigator will study several estimators of data transformation to
normality or to symmetry and homoscedasticity, generation of efficient nonlinear
experimental design by stochastic approximation and jointly with the fourth
investigator, he will look at nonparametric sequential age replacement policies.
The last investigator will study the strategic implecations of using the
Ascombe-Colton model for sequential clinical trials, as apposed to the standard
Neyman-Pearson model. He will also continue to study approximation methods for
optimal stopping problemsand distributional questions for some functionals of
Brownian motion, of statistical interest.
