The PI will investigate the dynamical nature of the impact of downward wave
coupling (DWC) on the tropospheric circulation and climate in reanalysis data
and its representation in a state-of-the-art seasonal forecast and climate
model. The goal is to assess the potential impact for seasonal forecasts and
climate prediction in the troposphere. The research will focus on the Northern
Hemisphere where the stratospheric variability allows for a clear separation of
months with DWC and downward zonal mean coupling. The analysis will shed
insights into the dynamical cause and evolution of individual wave reflection
events and composite events to understand (i) the direct impacts of planetary
wave reflection from the stratosphere on the phase and amplitude structure of
the tropospheric wave pattern and (ii) the subsequent impacts of DWC on the
tropospheric circulation both in the mid troposphere and the surface and how
they compare to the impacts of downward zonal mean coupling. Increased
understanding of the dynamical processes by which the stratosphere can influence
the troposphere has the potential to lead to improved seasonal forecasting and
climate prediction, thus leading to significant societal impacts.
