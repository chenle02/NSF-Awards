Natural silks match many of the properties of high-performance synthetic
polymers, yet are processed under significantly milder conditions. High
strength, stiffness and impact resistance are achieved in a polymer that is
precipitated from an aqueous solution at room temperature. Preliminary studies
have already established that a variety of natural silk secretions form liquid
crystalline phases en route to solidifying. This study will develop a link
between the solution properties of proteins and liquid crystalline polymer
technology through a multidisciplinary examination of the molecular and
microstructural changes that accompany the spinning of silk fiber.
