This award is made as part of the FY 2023 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and
training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including
applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring
scientist.

The title of the project for this fellowship to Hannah Knight is “Essential
p-Dimension of the Finite Simple Groups". The host institution for the
fellowship is the University of California – Los Angeles, and the sponsoring
scientist is Alexander Merkurjev.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
