An expert fluid dynamicist at Boston University will develop instructional
modules, which incorporate ideas from modern dynamical systems theory into the
standard introductory calculus course. The purpose of this project is to augment
the calculus with topics of current research interest. Materials can be
introduced early in a calculus sequence so that students receive early exposure
to topics of contemporary research interest in mathematics, computer
experimentation in mathematics, and exciting mathematical visual images. During
this one year planning grant several modules which show how certain topics in
dynamics may be integrated into calculus, and the role of 'dynamical calculus'
in science will be developed. Over one third of the project's cost will be
provided by Boston University.
