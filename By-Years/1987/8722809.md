Design environments that could offer flexible interactive support for different
design paradigms hold great potential for increasing the effectiveness of
designers of large, complex systems. The Brown CISE Institutional Infrastructure
project aims to develop such environments, by achieving the following research
goals: 1. supporting in a consistent way a variety of design paradigms in a
single environment, 2. providing system tools that facilitate the interaction of
teams of designers working on complex tasks, 3. developing and implementing new
paradigms suitable for design problems, 4. testing the concepts and tools in the
problem domains of software development and VLSI design. GARDEN, the prototype
multiparadigm programming environment developed at Brown, will be the central
testbed for the research. Research in object-oriented databases, concurrency
tools, parallel algorithms for graphics, and logic and object-oriented
programming paradigms will also be instrumental in achieving the research goals.
