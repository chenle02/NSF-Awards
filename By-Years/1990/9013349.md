The major goal of this project is to research and demonstrate a new approach
based on neural networks towards the design of process fault detection and
control systems. Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly
include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were
not adequate in efficient and correct trouble-shooting. This project, will
explore a novel method using neural networks that address the important issues
which are central to the development of knowledge-based systems for process
fault diagnosis and control. Our method for developing knowledge-based systems
rests on the important characteristics of neural networks, namely, their ability
to automatically classify and learn associations between input and output data
and to be able to handle noisy data. The P.I. has already successfully tested
his approach on a prototypical case study involving a CSTR and its support
subsystems. He plans to investigate this approach further by experimenting with
larger prototypes of chemical process plants as well as for diagnosing dynamic
process faults. He also proposes to analyze the robustness of this approach to
sensor failures, noisy and uncertain data, and incomplete information on
symptoms. It is also proposed to investigate the use of neural networks for
modeling the behavior process units and their in control. Furthermore, he
proposes to investigate the integration of neural nets with knowledge-based
techniques.
