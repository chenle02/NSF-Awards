The increasing width of vector instruction sets in processors and accelerators
raises the importance of effective vectorization. Although the topic of
automatic vectorization by compilers has received significant attention over the
last few decades, current vectorizing compilers can typically realize only a
small fraction of a processor's peak performance. This project will explore
several compiler optimization approaches for generating high-performance
vectorized code. Advanced vectorization techniques will be incorporated in the
open-source LLVM/Clang compiler through the Polly/LLVM module. A benchmark suite
will also be developed, aimed at testing the effectiveness of vectorizing
compilers.

Production compilers limit their optimization search space in order to control
the time taken to compile programs. This is because the majority of users expect
rapid compile times. However, the developers of high-performance applications
are generally very willing to tolerate a much longer wait for program
compilation, in return for a boost in the performance of the compiled code. A
significant focus of this project will be the development of vectorization
approaches for such users who prioritize high application performance over short
compile times. The project will investigate semantically-driven pattern-based
approaches to vector optimization, a vectorization-friendly approach to tiling,
and aggressive vector instruction scheduling approaches that promise higher
performance at the expense of possibly high compile times.
