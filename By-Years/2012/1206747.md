This grant provides partial support for the International Conference on Science
and Technology of Synthetic Metals in Atlanta, Georgia, in July 2012. The
conference is on the physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, and
technological applications of polymers and conducting organic molecular
crystals. It is designed to provide the US organic semiconductors community with
an international forum to discuss the state-of-the-art regarding not only the
fundamental aspects, but also, significantly, the technology drivers. In
addition, by holding the conference in the Southeast region of the US and with
the support of the Georgia Institute of Technology, there will be a remarkable
opportunity to broaden participation in the topical areas, through a concerted
effort to attract both women and under-represented minorities to the Conference.
All NSF funding will be used to support the registration of women and under-
represented minority researchers or faculty members who are professors at a
minority serving institution and who will bring minority students with them to
the conference.
