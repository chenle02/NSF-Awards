The Board of Regents University of Wisconsin System is expanding a
comprehensive plan for the in-service education of teachers of elementary,
middle and high schools through the establishment of Science Education Service
Centers at seven campuses of the University of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin
Department of Public Instruction will cooperate to develop a network of these
model science education service centers that will be designed to meet the
diverse needs of elementary, middle/junior high and senior high school science
teachers from all parts of the state. The seven sites chosen for the
continuation of the Centers represent different population profiles. Programs
will be held at the following university campus for the following levels: Green
Bay - High School La Crosse - Elementary School Milwaukee - Middle School
Parkside - High School Platteville - High School Superior - Elementary School
Stevens Point - Elementary School Programs at each of the sites include
appropriate content courses, laboratory-based activities and a structured
follow- up schedule insuring support for these participating teachers. A network
will also serve as an initiator for similar Centers at additional campus sites
throughout the state. Cost-sharing equal to 96% of the amount funded by NSF has
been added to the program by the contributing partners.
