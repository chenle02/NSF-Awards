This is an equipment grant for a state-of-the-art sputtering system. This system
well used reactive sputtering of refractory films for semiconductor device
fabrication and for thin film protective layers for IR filters and fiber
materials. This apparatus will greatly enhance the research infrastructure in
engineering programs of URI.
