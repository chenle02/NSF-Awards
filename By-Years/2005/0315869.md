Extreme climate changes, including drought, limit the growth and productivity of
many crop plants. Unfortunately, genetic approaches to decrease water loss in
plants by altering basic metabolic pathways or decreasing gas exchange through
the leaves have often negatively impacted plant growth under optimal conditions.
To selectively increase tolerance to stress, we need a better understanding of
the mechanisms involved in sensing environmental stimuli. Lipids, specifically
inositol phospholipids in the plasma membrane i.e., outermost membrane of a
cell, provide an early sensing mechanism for changes in water potential. The
overarching hypothesis is that by altering the mechanisms plants use to sense
changes in water potential, one can selectively alter a plant's response to
stress without compromising normal growth. This research will identify the
specific proteins that regulate the metabolism of plasma membrane inositol
phospholipids. The project will use a combined molecular, biochemical and cell
biological approach to identify and characterize the genes and proteins
regulating this plasma membrane sensing system. Once genes have been identified
that predict plant responses to osmotic stress a genetic approach will generate
plants with altered lipid metabolism and altered plant responses to drought.

Important fundamental outcomes of this project will be: 1) identification of
selective proteins to target for improving plant responses to environmental
stress such as drought; 2) increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms
by which these proteins function to regulate membrane inositol phospholipids
metabolism during stress response; 3) production of transgenic plants with
predictably altered responses to environmental stimuli; 4) support for
undergraduate and graduate research and training and the production of
transgenic plants to be used as teaching material for undergraduate
laboratories.
