The investigators propose to organize the next International Conference on
"Spectral And High-Order Methods (ICOSAHOM'04)" on June 21-25 2004 at Brown
University. The algorithmic themes addressed in this conference are many and
new, and attract most leading researchers in spectral methods, h-p finite
elements, ENO schemes, high-order finite differences, and wavelets. There are
nine confirmed keynote speakers (selected by voting by the scientific
committee), four of whom are from USA, and two are women. The topics they will
cover are: wavelets, h-p finite elements, singular solutions, electromagnetics,
non-Newtonian flows, inverse problems, uncertainty, ocean modeling, fast
solvers, and high-order finite differences.

Spectral and high-order methods have become increasingly important in diverse
and important applications as aeroacoustics, electromagnetics and optics, ocean
and climate modeling. These methods continue to grow in importance as a
simulation tool and attract global attention. The proposed conference, part of a
long series, continues to be the main meeting where such methods are discussed
and new and exciting applications displayed. Furthermore, emphasis is
traditionally placed on involving many young researchers as well as
underrepresented minorities and women. As a new thing, the conference will
conclude with a round-table discussion consisting of a mix of invited speakers,
minisymposia organizers, and researchers from national labs and industry. The
objective is to discuss and report to NSF the open issues and future algorithmic
and application trends of high-order and other discretization methods and their
potential in applications of national interest.
