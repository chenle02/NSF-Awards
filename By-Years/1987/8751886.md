The Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB) of the National Research
Council is engaged in a multi-year joint project with the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) to provide states and local school districts with
a clear statement of what consititutes excellence in school mathematics. Such
standards could be used for evaluating current programs and determining how they
can be improved. This project would engage many different networks in analyzing
both the NCTM standards and the new MSEB framework that is being developed to
set future direction for mathematics education. Representatives from school
boards, state agencies, school administrators, and parent groups will be asked
to react to the proposed recommendations. This activity will provide feedback to
NCTM on the appropriateness and intelligibility of the standards as drafted and
allow the mathematics education community to focus on possible impediments to
acceptance of higher standards and more dramatic change.
