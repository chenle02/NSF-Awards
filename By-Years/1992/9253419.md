9253419 Campo This planning grant pertains to the understanding of the transport
phenomena associated with the turbulent flow and heat transfer of a radiatively
participating gas inside internally finned annuli. The primary objective of this
work is to use finite-volume techniques to simulate numerically the velocity,
temperature and radiative fields in the fluid medium at high temperature.
Further, this work is intended to present for the first time global results such
as the friction factor and average Nusselt number which are used in the thermal
analysis and design of heat exchange devices. ***
