1126395 Cleaveland-Peterson

This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports acquisition of an accelerated
solvent extraction system (ASE) and a gas chromatograph with flame ionization
detector (GC-FID). The equipment will support PI and undergraduate student
research in paleoceanography and paleoclimatology that relies on analysis of
lipid biomarkers preserved in marine sediments and terrestrial sequences. In
particular the PI seeks to focus on the use of the GC for isolation and analysis
of alkenones from complex organic mixtures found in marine sediments and rock
outcrops as a proxy for estimating past sea surface temperatures. The technique
can offer new information for the study of Cenozoic global climate, its
relationship to orbital forcing and the effects of past atmospheric CO2 levels
on Earth's climate system and implications for glacial and interglacial
transitions. Luther College is an undergraduate liberal arts institution and the
PI is a female early career geoscientist (Ph.D. 2009).
