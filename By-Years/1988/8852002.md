The Civil Engineering Technology Unit at this institution is acquiring new
hardware and software for their Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) Laboratory to
teach a generic approach to CAD. The special objective of this project is to
teach disabled students, with limited mobility, the necessary drafting skills
required in conventional drafting courses. In equipping the laboratory with 16
workstations consisting of an IBM PS/2 Model 50 computer, a color display
monitor, a graphics tablet and mouse, AUTOCAD software and access to an HP
Plotter, the disabled students are offered training on an advanced, industrial
CAD system. The success of this project will potentially create new educational
opportunities for the disabled. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
