This is the 1st year funding of a 3 year continuing award. This research is to
develop a new, model-based, spectral estimation algorithm for recognition of
noisy speech. The new algorithm represents a significant improvement over
previous estimation algorithms because it incorporates more information about
speech spectral distribution. The proposed work improves the estimation by
incorporating information about its dynamic properties and its quasi-periodic
nature. To capture the dynamic properties the research will study several types
of hidden Markov models. An estimation of the position of the harmonics will be
made to address the periodicity properties. From these will be made an estimate
of the spectral energy at any given frequency dependent on its proximity to the
nearest harmonic. Incorporation of dynamics and periodicity should improve
speech recognition performance in noisy environments.
