This project is a study of the design and control of vapor recompression
distilation in order to develop computer models for the isopropanol - water
system. The research project augments the research program of Lehigh
University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Chemical
Modelling and Control (CDR 86-43400). The Center's Industry Advisory Board has
endorsed the project and will monitor the research. The Principal Investigator
is qualified to do the project. Travel funds to study an operational unit in
Chile are being provided by NSF's International program. He will use a student
research assistant in accordance with the Program Announcement for the
Supplemental Funding for Support of Women, Minority and Handicapped Engineering
Research Assistants. I recommend Lafayette College be awarded a grant of $25,608
for one (1) year for this project.
