Photosystem I (PS I), the light-dependent plastocyanin- ferredoxin
oxidoreductase, is a photosynthetic multisubunit pigment-protein complex in the
thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. All cofactors and
electron transfer centers in PS I are associated with three polypeptides; the
role of the accessory polypeptides, (2) study of the requirements and mechanism
of assembly of these accessory subunits into PS I complex. The most feasible
approach to achieve the first objective involves molecular cloning and
characterization of the genes encoding these polypeptides in the naturally
transformable cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and then generating
mutants specifically lacking these genes by targeted mutagenesis. Biochemical
and spectroscopic analyses of PS I from these mutants will be conducted to
assess the effects of loss of individual accessory polypeptides on the assembly
and function of PS I. In vitro reconstitution systems will be used to identify
the physiological requirements for the assembly of these polypeptides into PS I
and to determine the sequence of their assembly. %%% Plants, green algae and
cyanobacteria convert light energy into chemical energy with the evolution of
molecular oxygen by the process of photosynthesis. Oxygenic photosynthesis is
the major source of biological energy and oxygen on this planet and a better
understanding of this process is essential for facing the food and environmental
challenges of the future.
