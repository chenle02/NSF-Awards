;This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported
by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Rosario,
Argentina, October, 2002, on the topic of ferroelectric thin film technology.
Organized by Dr. Orlando Auciello of the Argonne National Laboratory, the
institute will involve approximately 40 students and 17 active researchers in
the field from the U.S. and Latin America. The main goal is to facilitate
extensive scientific discussions and allow students to specialize in this
interdisciplinary activity, which brings together leaders of the ferroelectric
materials field. The design of the program should also help to initiate new
collaborations between the next generation of scientists and engineers from the
region. Lectures and results of the scientific program will be disseminated
electronically via a web site to be developed for the
Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
