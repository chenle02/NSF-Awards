This investigators will apply existing models of the ionosphere,
electrodynamics, and instability growth rates to examine techniques for
developing short-term forecasting of propagation disturbances of the equatorial
ionosphere. The study will make use of the WestPac Project, an NSF-funded chain
of ionospheric stations measuring parameters that control the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability, the source of equatorial spread F instabilities. Equatorial spread
F produces disruption to the ionosphere that affects radio communication and is
thus an important element of space weather. The model developed in this study
will take advantage of the meridional specification of ionospheric conditions to
characterize the conditions under which equatorial spread F forms. The study
will also develop means by which ionospheric data can be assimilated into a
forecasting model that can be run on a low-cost personal computer.
