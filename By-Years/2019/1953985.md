The Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC) will be held in
Minneapolis, MN (2020), Denver, CO (2021) and Ames, IA (2022), building upon
successful NSF-funded workshops from 2014 to 2019. Each workshop will involve
approximately 45 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in an intense
two-week collaborative research experience. Participants will work to solve
important problems from across the modern subdisciplines of combinatorics,
including algebraic combinatorics, graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial
matrix theory and finite geometry. Students will prepare open problems prior to
the workshop under the guidance of faculty mentors from institutions around the
United States. These problems will be investigated by small groups of
participating students, postdocs, and faculty.

The goal of the collaborations at the heart of the GRWC is to produce high-
quality, publishable research on a variety of topics. Another longer-term goal
of the workshop is to help student and postdoctoral participants expand their
professional research networks. A strong research network is often a crucial
part of building a generative and sustainable research program, and establishing
these connections at an early career stage can have a long-term positive effect
on the quality, impact, and depth of a professional's research portfolio.
Participation in the GRWC will allow students to cultivate a large network of
peers from the combinatorics community with whom they will be able to interact
and collaborate throughout their careers. The GRWC will also offer professional
development workshops to help students and postdocs prepare for their future
careers in academia, industry and government. For more information about the
GRWC, including a detailed description of the workshop format, please see the
workshop website at www.combinatoricsworkshop.org.
