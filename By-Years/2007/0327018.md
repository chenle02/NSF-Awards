This is a continuation of an integrated, multi-disciplinary project combining
seismic, petrologic, geochemical, and numerical modeling. The project focuses on
the Galapagos spreading center between 91 and 98 degrees west. The initial work
provided the first complete multibeam bathymetry of the axial region, quantified
variations in crustal thickness, determined the distribution of seismic
reflectors from the top of crustal magma reservoirs, defined along-axis
variations in geochemistry, and modeled these variations in terms of mantle
source enrichment and extent of partial melting. The objectives of the
continuation are to refine models of the relationship between axial thermal
structure and axial morphology, combine seismic and petrologic observations to
constrain variations in magma reservoir properties, and integrate seismic
constraints with new measurement of U-series disequilibria to constrain
variations in mantle upwelling rate, temperature and source
composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
