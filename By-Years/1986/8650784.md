The project will acquaint undergraduate chemistry students at Muhlenberg College
with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and its uses and limitations
in chemical analysis. Several HPLC instruments will be available so that small
groups of students can work on chemical separation problems without
interruption. The problems assigned will be selected from the areas of clinical,
forensic, and environmental chemistry: for example, the determination of phenol
in wastewater, metabolites in blood, and components in over-the-counter drugs.
This will give the students a balanced view of the importance of modern
chromatography in the analytical laboratory, and better prepare them for
graduate study or industrial work. Students will design and discuss experimental
plans for their laboratory work, providing a foundation for future experimental
design and work in the laboratories.
