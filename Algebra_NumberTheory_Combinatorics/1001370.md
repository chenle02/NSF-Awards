The PI will study combinatorial quasirandomness, a subject with maturing
connections to combinatorial uniformity/regularity, numerical integration,
discrepancy, derandomization, discrete harmonic analysis, and Markov chain
theory. "Quasirandomness" is a broad term referring to situations where
combinatorial objects -- e.g., graphs, hypergraphs, lattice walks, permutations,
subsets of groups -- resemble random objects of their class with respect to some
set of statistics. Central goals of the project are to prove tight bounds on the
discrepancy of several proposed quasirandom constructions, explore new
quasirandom analogues of well-known probabilistic processes, and develop theory
to describe implicative hierarchies of quasirandom properties. The investigator
will further analogize and extend the very useful relationships between
quasirandomness and uniformity/regularity already well understood for graphs,
hypergraphs, permutations, and abelian groups. He will also study applications
of quasirandomness to graph algorithms (e.g., network routing), coding theory
(e.g., liar games), and numerical integration (e.g., walk-on-spheres Monte Carlo
simulation).

Probabilistic intuition has been a powerful and influential tool in the past
half-century of mathematics, computer science, and physics. Surprisingly often,
the best known solution to a problem arises from constructions that involve some
amount of randomness. Probability theory has lent a decisive perspective on many
theoretical questions, particularly in discrete mathematics, the realm of finite
objects, relationships, and computations. Despite the extraordinary success of
probabilistic methods, however, such approaches face a few serious shortcomings
when implemented in real-world applications. First, they do not offer explicit
solutions, but only ensure the desired properties with some positive
probability. Second, "true" randomness is costly and time-consuming to obtain,
as the physical universe behaves with consummate predictability on all but the
tiniest scales. Lastly, sometimes, the fluctuations which inevitably accompany
randomness prevent solutions from being completely optimal. One remedy to such
deficiencies is to imitate -- or even improve upon -- useful aspects of
randomness by carefully designed deterministic processes. Constructions which
resemble random ones according to particular measurements are known as
"quasirandom". Research on quasirandomness can provide guaranteed explicit
constructions, obviate the need for randomness, and sometimes yield solutions
that have even better properties than random constructions. The PI will continue
his work on this subject, as well as continuing to mentor graduate and
undergraduate students and organize meetings at the local, regional, and
national levels to share ideas between researchers of related areas.
