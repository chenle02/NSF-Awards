This project will continue work on the development of methods for the formation
of C-C and C-N bonds by facile oxidative reactions. While dimerizations of
phenol derivatives are well-recognized processes, little progress has been made
in the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the formation of chiral
biaryls via oxidative dimerization. Studies to further elucidate the mechanism
of the complex catalytic cycles involved will be undertaken. Hypothesis driven
screening of ligands with transition metal oxidants will be carried out to
identify new useful catalysts. The developed catalysts will also be used to
discover new oxidative reactions.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Marisa Kozlowski of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Pennsylvania. Professor Kozlowski's research efforts revolve
around the development of facile oxidative methods for the formation of C-C and
C-N bonds. Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for
chemical synthesis as oxygen is used as the terminal oxidizing agent. Successful
development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the
pharmaceutical, agricultural, and materials science industries.
