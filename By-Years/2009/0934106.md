The project is hosting a five-day Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDM) working group
in conjunction with the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Science Institute
(SAMSI) Summer Program on Psychometrics. The CDM working group will bring
together researchers from statistics, mathematical psychology, computer science,
and educational psychology, who have worked on diagnostic and related models, to
synthesize different models and approaches to diagnostic modeling and address
major challenges in the field. Three methodological cornerstones will guide the
workshop activities: (1) the design of diagnostic assessment; (2) the analysis
of the resulting data; and (3) the reporting of the results. The workshop will
emphasize issues related to the first and second methodological cornerstones.
The presentations and discussions during the CDM working group will form the
basis for a white paper outlining methodological challenges in CDM and will be
submitted for publication in statistics and education journals.
