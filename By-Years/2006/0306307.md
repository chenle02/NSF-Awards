Free boundary problems arising in shock reflection have been solved for regular
shock&lt;br/&gt;reflection in a model equation; the method will be extended to a
larger set of equations and&lt;br/&gt;other types of shock reflection. Solving a
prototype problem for the gas dynamics equations&lt;br/&gt;is in sight. Other
two-dimensional Riemann problems, such as reflection of rarefaction
waves&lt;br/&gt;at the sonic line, will be considered. A different free boundary
problem, with connections to&lt;br/&gt;new kinds of singularities, occurs in
this case. By constrast with shock reflection problems,&lt;br/&gt;in which the
complicated behavior occurred in the subsonic region and was analysed
using&lt;br/&gt;Holder estimates for degenerate elliptic equations, the
interaction of rarefaction waves with&lt;br/&gt;the sonic boundary involves
study of degenerate hyperbolic eigenvalue problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
has had success, particularly with women graduate students and
postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;visitors, in introducing beginning researchers to her
areas in conservation laws, and in helping&lt;br/&gt;to expand their career
horizons. It is planned to mentor two postdocs (at least one,
already&lt;br/&gt;selected, is a woman), including encouraging their teaching
and professional development in&lt;br/&gt;ways such as writing proposals,
refereeing papers, and participating in conferences.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the
second research topic is strongly interdisciplinary, and the PI's work
has&lt;br/&gt;aroused some positive interest in the multifluid science
community. The PI and co-workers&lt;br/&gt;will attend and make presentations at
engineering conferences, write articles for journals on&lt;br/&gt;multiphase
flow to explain the results, and organize sessions at conferences to bring
together&lt;br/&gt;mathematical, computational and experimental researchers in
multifluid science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
