This award is made in the Office of Special Projects in support of the research
of Professor Stephen Leone at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The goal of
the work is to study fundamental aspects of kinetic energy enhanced neutral beam
epitaxy of electronic materials at low substrate temperatures. Kinetic energy
enhanced neutral atoms will be produced by pulsed laser vaporization of electron
beam-deposited thin films of transparent substrates followed by velocity
selection of the neutral atoms in the 1-10 eV range. Systems to be studied
include cobalt, iron, platinum, tungsten, nickel, palladium, titanium and
molybdenum atoms on silicon (100), cobalt silicide, and the heteroepitaxy of
silicon/germanium. Film growth will be monitored by low energy electron
diffraction, Auger spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Time of flight
ion scattering spectroscopy using He+ and Ne+ will be developed to determine
lattice spacings of the films as a function of film thickness and growth
mechanism. This research will address the fundamentals of metal film deposition
on silicon substrates which are of fundamental importance to interconnects on
semiconductors. Heteroepitaxy studies of the germanium/silicon system induces
lattice-strain which offers the opportunity to control the effective bandgap
structure of optoelectronic devices.
