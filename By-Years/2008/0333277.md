This award provides funds to support travel for approximately ten US lecturers
and students to attend the Grand Combin Summer School from June 16-25, 2003 at
the Conference Center of St. Oyen, a small village at about 1,300 meters above
sea-level in the upper Gran San Bernardo valley, 25 kilometers from Aosta,
Italy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Italian-French summer school on "Fundamental
Problems in Geophysical and Environmental Fluid Mechanics" is organized each
year by the Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC) - CNR (Torino)
and by the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique, Ecole Normale Superieure
(Paris). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the course in 2003 is "Paleoclimate:
Combining Observations and Dynamics" and is directed by Dr. Alain Colin de
Verdiere (Univ. de Brest, France), Prof. Daniel Schrag (Harvard Univ., USA), and
Prof. Eli Tziperman (Weizmann Institute, Israel). The website for information is
http://www.icg.to.infn.it/grandcombin/index.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of the conference is to bring together lecturers with expertise in
both paleoclimate data and paleoclimate theories and mathematical models. The
students will be exposed to the basics of methodologies used to study
paleoclimate proxy records, as well as the theories that are used to explain
these observations. The lecture topics will range from applications of ocean,
atmosphere, and nonlinear dynamics to paleoclimatology to the basic geochemistry
that controls climate on longer time scales. The scope of the instruction and
discussion will include climate variability phenomena on time scales from a few
years (El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the glacial periods) to a few
thousands of years (Dansgaard/ Oeschger oscillations and Heinrich events) to
glacial and interglacial timescales.
