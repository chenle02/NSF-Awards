95-52567 Gordon ABSTRACT: The Education Development Center (EDC) is implementing
the national expansion and institutionalization of the Playing to Win (PTW)
Network. With the goal of working toward universal technology enfranchisement
and prior support from the NSF Informal Science Education Program, the PTW
Network currently links close to fifty agencies in a mutually supportive
community of neighborhood technology learning centers serving people living in
low-income areas who otherwise would have little or no access to computer-based
technologies. The purposes of this phase of the project are: - to increase the
number of affiliates nationally - to provide effective support for their
technology programs and to do so in a planned and thoughtful manner which also
is flexible and responsive to the flows, demands, and unforeseen opportunities
fro community technology center development -- to move the affiliate membership
toward independence and self-governance. Each year of the project, PTW will work
in collaboration with the United Neighborhood Centers of America, the Alliance
fro Community Media, NTIA-funded programs, FreeNets, and others in three to four
target areas of the US to recruitment additional primary affiliates. The goal is
to add 20 additional affiliates annually who will be supported by local
coordinators and another 30 with subsidized telecommunications support. PTW
plans to enrich programmatic content at the centers with special emphasis on
math and science. The network will support an on-line math and science program
consultant and continue to recruit and support affiliates with a math/science
program emphasis. The Co-Principal Investigators for the project will be Myles
Gordon, Director of EDC's Center for Learning, Teaching and Technology, and
Antonia Stone, Founder of PTW and PI for the previous phases of the project.
