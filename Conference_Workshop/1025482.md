The workshop, "Partial Differential Equation Models of Biological Processes", is
being held at the National Center for Theoretical Sciences at Taiwan, December
13-17, 2010. The focus of the workshop is on modeling and analysis of partial
differential equation models from Cell Biology, Physiology and Population
Dynamics. The last ten years witnessed tremendous growth in the area of
mathematical biology, and emerging questions from biology and medicine have
brought new and exciting mathematical questions. Cell Biology, Physiology and
Population Dynamics are three of the areas where partial differential equation
modeling and analysis can play a crucial role. A major goal of the workshop is
to facilitate the initiation of collaborative research projects between
mathematical biologists and traditional hard-core analysts in partial
differential equations as these two groups typically attend specialized
conferences.

By hosting this workshop, communication will be encouraged and facilitated
between researchers not only in different mathematical fields, but also across
international borders. The workshop provides an opportunity for developing new
contacts and for expanding the range of existing collaborations between
mathematicians and biologists based in the United States and Asia. Additionally,
the grant brings a group of young mathematical researchers from U.S.
institutions, providing a venue for graduate students to speak about their own
research, as well as to participate in the workshop activities. Introducing
young researchers to a broader international community is very important, both
to expose them to new research opportunities and to facilitate the scientific
interactions between the younger generation of U.S. mathematicians and their
international peers and international senior researchers.
