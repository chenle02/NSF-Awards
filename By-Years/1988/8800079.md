This project is a theoretical study of the instability mechanisms of zonal
equatorial currents. The PI will use isopycnal coordinates, and investigate
stability in realistic stratifications. Specific questions to be considered
include: 1) conditions sufficient for stability, 2) the energy exchance between
the mean and the disturbances, 3) the predicted modes that result, and 4) their
structure. The particular oceanic phenomena motivating the study is the 21 day
oscillation in the tropical Pacific
