The principal investigator will study the mineralogical transition from smectite
to chlorite. Goals of the project are to determine if random ordering is
metastable with respect to regular ordering, and also to establish which
techniques provide the best characterization of discrete and mixed-layer phases.
By studying an active geothermal system in Iceland the PI hopes to determine the
relationship between clay mineral paragenesis and metamorphic grade.
