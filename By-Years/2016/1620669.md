TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT Funds in the amount of $2,540 are requested
to support the registration fee and travel expenses of attendees at the
Symposium on "New Chemistries towards Functional Polymeric Materials" to be held
at the 2016 Southern Regional meeting of the ACS (SERMACS) in South Carolina
October 23-26, 2016. The symposium will cover the latest progress in using
chemistry strategies for developing functional polymeric materials, including
monomer design, synthesis, polymerization methodologies for architecture and
composition control, and the chemical modification of polymers. The symposium
provides a platform for the exchange of expertise and ideas by academic and
industrial organic chemistry and polymer scientists from the southeastern
region, and having an educational impact on attending graduate students as well
as postdocs.
