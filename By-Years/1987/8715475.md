As part of the Foundation's initiative to strengthen research environments in
primarily undergraduate institutions, the Division of Networking and
Communications Science and Infrastructure considers proposals to defray CSNET
dues and operating expenses under the research instrumentation category of the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Program. Hope College has met both
RUI and CSNET membership requirements and demonstrates a genuine need for
network access. Initially, at least four faculty members at the college will use
the CSNET services. The benefits from network communication will be significant
and institutional commitment to future network use is evident.
