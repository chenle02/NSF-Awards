The investigator will work on fundamental problems in differential geometry.
Although this research project concerns differential geometry, a subject in pure
mathematics, the methods and results significantly influence our understanding
of the universe. In particular, this project investigates deep problems in the
mathematical aspects of string theory, a topic of great current interest in
theoretical physics. The investigator is involved in K-12 educational activities
and also deeply involved in innovations in both undergraduate and graduate
curricula.

The PI will work on several important problems in Kahler geometry and spectral
theory. This project will continue a long-term investigation of the Weil-
Peterson geometry on Calabi-Yau moduli, incorporating recent results in Kahler-
Einstein geometry. The PI will study Agmon type estimates of the Bergman kernel
and will continue to study the essential spectrum of differential forms on
complete noncompact manifolds. The research will build on recent results of the
PI and collaborators in complex geometry and spectral theory, including proof of
the rationality of the Chern-Weil forms on moduli space of Kahler manifolds;
construction of extremal metrics on certain ruled manifolds; study of the off-
diagonal expansion of the Bergman kernels and the Poincare series of Bergman
kernels on noncompact complete Kahler manifolds; proof of the Antunes-Freitas
conjecture; and study of the relation between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues.
The long-term goal of this project is improved understanding of the geometry of
moduli space; short term goals include study of the Bergman kernel expansion and
the spectrum of differential forms on a complete non-compact manifold.
