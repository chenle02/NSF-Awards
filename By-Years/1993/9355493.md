The Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Physics will host the eighth
National Conference of Black Physics Students (NCBPS) in February 1994. NCBPS'94
will be the continuation of a sequence of such annual conferences that began in
1987. The motivation for the NCBPS is to assist and encourage those African-
American students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter and
complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research and teaching careers in
Physics. The idea for this conference series originated with a group of African-
American physics graduate students at MIT. The conferences have been organized
and implemented by students (with faculty and staff assistance) at various host
institutions throughout the country. The core information of the conference is
transmitted through (1) lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers, (2)
technical presentations by current Black graduate and undergraduate students,
(3) workshops on the graduate admission process, (4) seminars on graduate
financial aid, and (5) forums on successfully completing a graduate program in
Physics. The primary audience for the conference consists of undergraduate
students who are majoring in physics, or who have expressed a genuine interest
in the subject. A principal goal of the conference is to permit these students,
who are in the process of making career decisions that will shape the course of
their working lives, to meet and interact with Black graduate students, and
Black scientists who can serve as mentors and role models.***
