The mechanism of proton-linked ATP synthesis by chloroplast, mitochondrial and
bacterial membranes is a major unsolved problem in biochemistry. This award is
aimed at determining whether the unusual asymmetry of this enzyme is altered by
catalytic turnover. The roles of the delta subunit of the enzyme and its
position in the macromolecule will be elucidated. Interaction between the gamma
and epsilon subunits will be further investigated since these polypeptides play
critical roles in the regulation of the enzyme's activity. Structural changes in
the enzyme are induced by the formation of electrochemical proton gradients
across the thylakoid membrane. Attempts to map these changes and to follow them
kinetically will be made. This research will provide vital information to help
us understand how energy is stored in living cells by the synthesis of an energy
rich compound, adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
