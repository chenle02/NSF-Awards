A program of theoretical research on the structures and thermodynamics of thin
physically adsorbed layers is described. The main goal is to achieve a
quantitative understanding of a few adsorbate/substrate combinations in which
recent experimental data show effects of the competing spatial periodicity of an
adlayer lattice and the substrate lattice. Several topics are described which
could lead to improved specification of the energy barriers to lateral motion of
adsorbed atoms on the substrate surface. The substrates considered are the (111)
face of platinum, the basal plane surface of graphite and the (001) face of
magnesium oxide. The adsorbates include xenon, krypton and molecular hydrogen
and nitrogen. The calculations include variational quantum mechanics for the
ground state of hydrogen and deuterium and lattice dynamics and cell model
approximations for the near classical adsorbates. The proposed work relies
heavily on experimental data obtained from refinements of low energy electron
diffraction, x-ray diffraction, thermal neutron scattering, and thermal helium
atom scattering.
