The PI is developing bottom-up mechanisms for securing wireless networks against
a class of "layer-violating" attacks. In a layer-violating attack, the attacker
uses protocol behavior at one layer of the network stack to compromise a secure
protocol at a different layer. Such layer-violating attacks often can span from
the physical layer all the way to the transport layer. In the PI's approach,
each layer interlocks with the higher layer, relying on the security properties
guaranteed by the lower layer to provide security properties to the next higher
layer, resulting in a protocol stack that is resilient to layer-violating
attacks. The PI's efforts focus on four important security properties:
availability against jamming, fairness, routing, and privacy.

The outcomes of this research will be: - A protocol stack secure against jamming
at all layers, ensuring a specific level of performance despite the presence of
an adversarial attacker - A protocol stack that provides fairness regardless of
attacks at any layer, and specifies the types of fairness achievable against a
cross-layer adversarial attacker - A results-oriented routing protocol that
provides reliable performance assurances against attacks at any layer - A
protocol stack that provides privacy across all layers of the network stack,
ensuring minimal leakage of privacy-sensitive information.

The PI is also revising the introductory programming curriculum in the ECE
department; one aspect of this revision is an emphasis on safe and secure code
writing. The PI is also working to develop a middle-school-level curriculum to
encourage underprivileged groups to pursue engineering education.
