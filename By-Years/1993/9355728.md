9355728 Spooner The Cambridge Public school system is establishing a
comprehensive elementary/middle school science program, through the
implementation of systemic, district-side science staff development over four
years reaching a total of 293 teachers. The activities will prepare all of the
elementary and middle school teachers to teach hands-on, inquiry-based, thematic
science units keyed to the Cambridge Science Framework. All secondary school
teachers of grades 7-9 will learn the content and instructional strategies of a
thematic, interdisciplinary middle grade science program linking the middle and
high school curricula. The methods to be employed to bring about such change
include: training five Science Staff Developers; development of 28 Lead
Classroom Teachers in 14 elementary/middle schools; establishment of school
based Science Action Teams; collaboration with MIT; and science awareness
seminars for administrators. Staff development and technical assistance for the
training activities will be provided by Education Development Center (EDC);
Technical Education Research Center (TERC); and a Core Scientists Group
representing local universities. ***
