The barotropic component of oceanic flow can be extracted from electric field
measurements within the water column. This project will develop the capability
of adding the measurement of weak electric fields to RAFOS floats, an existing
neutrally buoyant subsurface float. The spatial distribution of barotropic
currents would then be obtained along RAFOS paths as they floated at depth.
