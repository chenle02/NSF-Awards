This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports research
by Dr. Przemyslaw Maslak aimed at elucidating the factors which control carbon-
carbon bond cleavage reactions in a group of reaction intermediates known as ion
radicals. Ion radicals are unique and reactive species which have complex and
not yet well understood properties by virtue of having some of the
characteristics of ions (electrical charge) and some of the characteristics of
radicals (unpaired electrons) at the same time. Radical ions are increasingly
recognized as an important class of reaction intermediates as chemists learn of
more chemical reactions shown to occur via electron transfer mechanisms.
Specifically, Dr. Maslak's research is aimed at providing quantitative
measurements of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters controlling these bond
cleavage reactions. The investigation concentrates on the electron apportionment
aspect of the cleavage reaction of radical ions wherein the odd-electron density
is highly localized on one side of the scissile bond. It is thought that
localization of the spin density on the same part of the molecule throughout the
reaction is kinetically advantageous, even if it leads to thermodynamically less
stable products. This research will explore the validity of such a spin
regioconservation rule. The experimental distinction between the two possible
ways in which electrons are apportioned to the fragments will be accomplished by
linear free energy relationship studies and by trapping of the primary
fragmentation products. Another approach will use especially designed molecules
in which electron apportionment is reflected in the regiochemistry of the
cleavage reaction. The influence of ion pairing and solvation on the
fragmentation reactions will be probed by variation of solvent polarity and gas-
phase studies. The results of this work may have practical value for improving
processes based on electron-transfer catalysis, which are important in
synthesis, solar energy conversion, coal liquefaction, and other areas.
