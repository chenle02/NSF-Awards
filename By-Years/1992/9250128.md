The project incorporates an Applied Engineering Photonics Laboratory (AEPL) into
the existing curriculum of the Mechanical Engineering Department. The project
uses the requested equipment to provide hands-on training of undergraduate
students in fundamental optical phenomena and related engineering applications.
The primary equipment for the project is (1) an argon laser, (2) an optical
table, (3) positioning components, (4) light detectors, and (5) optical
components. The equipment serves several closely related purposes. The primary
application is in the establishment of an AEPL course to parallel the existing
Principles of Optical Measurements classroom course. In the new laboratory
curriculum, undergraduate students have the opportunity of setting up optical
experiments and of performing optical measurement applications. The equipment
will also provide modern optical instrumentation that will be used to supplement
the existing Mechanical Measurements course as well as independent laboratory
investigations and undergraduate research that is conducted within the
department.
