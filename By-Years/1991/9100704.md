Professor Hida will work on the theory of p-adic Hecke algebras and their
applications to Iwasawa theory of CM fields. He will also work on studying forms
of half integral weight over totally real fields, the construction of p-adic
symmetric square L- functions and their application to the cyclotomic Z-p tower
of these fields. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry
-a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
