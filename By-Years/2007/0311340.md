A Hardware/Software Framework for Managing On-Chip Communication Latency

In modern computing systems, there is an inherent tension between performance
and correctness. Processors and compilers are becoming increasingly complicated
to maintain the performance growth often characterized by Moore's Law. This
complexity makes it very challenging and costly to ensure these systems operate
reliably. In this project, we explore an execution paradigm that decouples
performance and correctness by simultaneously performing executions of two
versions of a program's binary: one responsible for performance and one for
correctness. The performance execution is responsible for executing the program
quickly with a high likelihood, but no guarantee, of correctness; the lack of
correctness guarantees enables significant optimization opportunities of both
the program and the hardware, without overheads of verification. The results of
the performance execution can be used to parallelize the correctness execution,
which is responsible for updating user-visible (architected) state.
Parallelization enables the correctness execution to be performed by a
collection of simple processors using an unoptimized version of the program. In
addition to reducing verification complexity, the proposed execution paradigm
appears to have potential to improve performance and reduce power consumption.
