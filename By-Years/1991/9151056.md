Hypertext software using ToolBook is being developed to acquaint the general
student with principles of light and sound. Approximately 100 students enroll
each year in PHYS 101 Light and Visual Phenomena, and PHYS 102 The Physics of
Sound and Music. These 3-hour courses satisfy part of the general- education
science requirement at UNCA. The author is currently employing original EGA-
graphics software in class using a rear- view SONY projector in the modern
180-seat auditorium of the new science building, Robinson Hall. Students work
after class with the software interactively in departmental computer labs.The
project brings a significant enhancement to the educational experience by adding
interactive hypertext applications. The author developed ToolBook applications
after receiving a pre-released version from IBM. These were presented at the IBM
ACIS Conference in Miami and are being shipped with IBM's Advanced Academic
System. Equipment being purchased includes eight 386SX l6-MHz computers with
VGA, DOS, Windows 3.0, and ToolBook.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds
from non-federal sources.
