9412815 Greenblatt This award supports collaboration on the design of new solid
electrolyte composites by dispersion of ionically conductive salts in
microporous solids. The collaboration between Dr. Martha Greenblatt, Rutgers
University, and Feng Shouhua, Jilin University, is expected to contribute new
insights into the mechanism by which enhanced ionic conductivity can be
generated in composites of conducting salts and microporous solids. Synthesis
and characterization of materials such as this has potential use in commercial
application. Support for the collaboration will be provided on the Chinese side
by the National Natural Science Foundation.
