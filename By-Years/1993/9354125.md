9354125 SubbaRao Lincoln University will develop strategies to increase the
number of minority students who enter science, engineering and mathematics (SEM)
fields. The proposed approach will develop strategies to assist minority
students at critical stages in their academic life. For example, a variety of
intervention activities at the pre-college, community college, 4-year college
and graduate school levels would be utilized to prepare, motivate and encourage
several hundred urban minority students to pursue advanced degrees in SEM.
Special attention will be paid to developing strategies that enhance
recruitment, retention and graduation rates. A key component of the proposed
effort will establish partnerships and articulation agreements with regional
community colleges, secondary schools, and with majority universities involving
faculty exchange and collaboration, student support, student enrichment
activities, and facilitation of transfer to and from Lincoln University. Lincoln
University plans to improve its SEM curriculum to make it more challenging,
exciting, relevant, and to explore the possibility of introducing new programs,
while at the same time, designing activities to enhance the teaching skills and
methods of SEM faculty; improving faculty/student research capabilities;
renovating and expanding laboratory space and equipment for teaching and
research, as well as establishing multimedia capability. Finally, the project
develops strategies to involve government agencies, private foundations, and
corporations in strengthening SEM programs and the infrastructure at Lincoln
University.
