This project is creating a partnership between Sisseton-Wahpeton Community
College (SWCC) and Northern State University (NSU) that allows Native American
and other area students to receive their bachelor's degrees in elementary and
middle school education without having to leave the area. The students receive a
paraprofessional degree from SWCC and then work in the classrooms while
completing their bachelor's degree. They complete the program for their
bachelor's degree while on the reservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
based on a seven-point plan:&lt;br/&gt;1) Development of an articulation
agreement with Northern State University whereby NSU delivers most of the third
and fourth year level educational classes on the reservation.&lt;br/&gt;2)
Creation of a degree that trains papaprofessionals who have expertise in the use
of technology as a teaching aid.&lt;br/&gt;3) Training of in-service
instructors.&lt;br/&gt;4) Offering support for students in the form of mentoring
and securing finances.&lt;br/&gt;5) Raising students' mathematics
proficiency.&lt;br/&gt;6) Recruitment of students to create a self-sustaining
program.&lt;br/&gt;7) Creation of a listserv that gives all tribal colleges easy
access to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
