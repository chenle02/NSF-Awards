CAREER: A Framework for Sparse Signal Reconstruction for Computer Graphics
Pradeep Sen, Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engr., University of New Mexico

Recent progress in computer graphics has benefited our society in many ways:
from entertainment (e.g. movies and games) to product manufacturing (e.g.
virtual prototyping) and medicine (e.g. interactive medical visualization).
However, despite these improvements we are still far from true interactive
photorealism. In this research, the investigators develop a novel framework for
computer graphics that improves the speed and quality of existing algorithms by
leveraging ideas from the emerging field of compressed sensing. By taking
advantage of the compressibility of real-world signals, the researchers explore
new algorithms for image synthesis and acquisition. The broader impact of this
work is that the core ideas developed will not only benefit important
applications in computer graphics, but could also impact areas such as Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) used for medical applications. On the educational side,
the PI integrates Hispanics students into the research by fostering
relationships with Latin America.

This research is developing a fundamentally new paradigm for a core area of
computer graphics: sampling and reconstruction. Most graphics algorithms (e.g.
rendering systems) expend their effort sampling the entire signal, despite the
fact the signal will be compressed afterwards (e.g. with a transform-coding
compression algorithm such as JPEG). The investigators apply the ideas of
compressed sensing in order to take advantage of the sparsity in the transform
domain and sample the signal in an efficient manner. This results in a framework
that can be used to accelerate rendering algorithms by reconstructing the final
image from a sparse set of samples using greedy optimization algorithms. The
same framework can also be used to accelerate the acquisition of light transport
which is useful for relighting applications. The fundamental science explored
through this work will spur new areas of research within the graphics community
and in related fields.
