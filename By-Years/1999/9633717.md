9633717 Stiling Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are
increasing. The effects of this increased amount of CO2 in the atmosphere are of
great scientific interest to many fields of study. One possible outcome from
increased atmospheric CO2 is a change in plant growth rates and plant tissue
chemistry. This is predicted to impact the herbivorous insects who feed upon
these plants. This SGER project takes advantage of a replicated field study in a
Florida-scrub ecosystem where CO2 concentrations will be doubled in a series of
large open-top chambers. This SGER project will examine the respmnse of
herbivorous insects to elevated CO2 concentrations at this experimental site.
This project will gather the necessary data to develop specific hypotheses about
the relationships of insect herbivores to elevated CO2 levels in a large-scale
field study.
