Moduli spaces reveal how objects of a particular type behave in families.
Results about individual mathematical objects that are unreachable by other
means can often be proved by considering them as members of a family of similar
objects, that is, as points in a moduli space. Important examples are given by
moduli spaces of curves, which give insight into the study of smooth curves and
their degenerations, and are a prototype for researchers studying moduli spaces
of higher dimensional varieties. Moreover, as curves arise in so many contexts,
moduli spaces of curves are a common meeting ground, connected in a fundamental
way with many disparate fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.

This is a project to study sheaves on moduli spaces of pointed curves defined
using representations of vertex operator algebras. These sheaves provide a
natural generalization of Verlinde bundles, also known as vector bundles of
conformal blocks, which have played an important role in understanding the
birational geometry of moduli spaces of curves, particularly in the case of
curves of genus zero, where they are known to be globally generated.
Specifically, this research will enlarge the class of vector bundles with good
combinatorial properties defined on moduli spaces of curves, find geometric
interpretations for basepoint free classes on these moduli spaces in terms of
vector bundles, and use the resulting information to characterize morphisms to
these moduli spaces.
