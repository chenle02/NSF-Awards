Recent research indicates that nonhumans can form internal representations of
external events. This research project will examine how internal representations
act as mediators between independent external events. The primary tasks to be
used in these studies are variations of the delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS)
task, a task that requires an organism to make a choice between two comparison
stimuli based on a sample stimulus that is no longer physically present. Dr.
Steirn will determine the conditions under which the pigeon uses representatives
as mediators in the formation of new associations, how the mediators are formed,
the characteristics or nature of the mediators, and what classes of stimuli can
serve as mediators. Interactive activities include teaching undergraduate
courses in Experimental Methodology and Animal Behavior; involvement with the
University chapter of Psi Chi, The National Honor Society of Psychology; and
holding monthly meetings with female graduate students in animal behavior to
discuss career directions and problems that may be encountered as females in a
traditionally male area of psychology. This project furthers VPW program
objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their
careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and
(2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing
greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,
government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women
in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific
vitality.
