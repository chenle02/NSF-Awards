This project concerns the study of mathematical problems in the theory of
composite materials as modelled by partial differential equations. The search
for optimal bounds on the effective moduli of composites leads to oscillatory or
"chattering" solutions. The macroscopic effects of this oscillatory
microstructure is of interest in determining the properties of composite
materials. Related to this is the study of control of systems which have
oscillatory coefficients.
