It is widely believed that integrated optoelectronic devices of gallium-
arsenide semiconductors will dominate high-bit-rate optical communication
systems. It is also quite likely that this dominance will extend to high speed
computers and processors. This proposal should develop groundwork to answer
important questions about the eventual practicality of all-optical devices for
the above applications. One objective of the proposed project is to use quantum
well structures in novel new device structures in order to provide new planar
guided wave optics components for use in high rate data optical signal
processing. A second objective will be the development of molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) grown quantum well and heterostructure waveguides devices. The primary
contribution of the second objective will be the extension of quantum well based
optical communications and signal processing to a longer wavelength region (1.0
to 1.6 micrometer). The PIs are considered to be extremely well qualified to
carry out the proposed research and I recommend funding of this project for
three years in accordance with the budge submitted with the proposal.
