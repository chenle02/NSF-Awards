TERC, in collaboration with three states and others, will create and implement
the first phase of the development of server and client software that provides
the functionality needed to make the National Research and Education Network
meet the needs of precollege educators. The long-range goal is to facilitate the
kind of network-based student and teacher collaboration which supports the
reform needed in mathematics and science education. This will be achieved by
simplifying access to NREN and providing software functionality that supports
collaboration on the computers typically used in schools for telecomputing.
Issues of technical and administrative infrastructure building, of marketing of
educational services, and of controlling student use of NREN resources will also
be addressed. In this phase of the work, TERC will work closely with teachers,
mid-level networks, potential educational service providers, telecommunications
experts, and its state partners to assess educational needs, technical
resources, and software standards. A minimal set of the resulting specifications
will be implemented, disseminated to participating states and other
institutions, incorporated in TERC telecomputing-based projects, and evaluated.
