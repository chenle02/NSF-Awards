This award supports travel for U.S. participants in the international conference
"Symmetry Plus Integrability 2010," held in South Padre Island, Texas, on 10-14
June 2010. The conference is jointly organized by the Department of Mathematics
at the University of Texas - Pan American and the Faculty of Mathematics, Kyushu
University.

The conference focuses on current research in integrable systems and nonlinear
waves, including work in two-dimensional nonlinear wave equations and soliton
interactions; nonlinear water waves; nonholonomic dynamics; nonlinear equations
with randomness; integrable systems and combinatorics; nonlinear wave phenomena
in nonlinear optics and physics; and applications of integrable systems in
random matrix theory, physics, and engineering. The conference features plenary
talks and other invited lectures by leading researchers, as well as a poster
session for presentations by students and junior researchers.

The meeting will foster the scientific interaction of an international community
of scientists working in these subjects and will provide an opportunity for
junior researchers in these fields to interact with more experienced researchers
and scientists from Japan and other countries. Participation of members of
groups underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and supported.
