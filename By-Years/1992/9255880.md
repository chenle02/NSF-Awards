This project is designed to provide new explanations for classroom and school
factors that foster student learning of mathematics and science. It involves
constructing two studies: one that examines teacher interaction within schools
and another that examines reward structures within classrooms. The purpose of
these two studies is to construct better frameworks, and thereby to validate
existing statistical indicators of how students learn mathematics and science
once they have been exposed to the subject matter. The studies will conduct new
analyses of two existing national surveys, the National Educational Longitudinal
Survey (NELS:88) and the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) and will
include some on-site interviews with teachers. Each of these surveys include
students at the middle and secondary levels of education.
