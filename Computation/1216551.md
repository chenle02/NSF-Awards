The main objective of this research is the development of efficient iterative
methods for computing numerical approximations to the solutions of acoustic and
electromagnetic scattering problems. A fundamental issue in any finite element
approximation to a scattering problem is the efficient implementation of the far
field boundary condition. In this research, this condition will be approximated
using either finite elements with a ``Perfectly Matched Layer'' (PML) far field
approximation or finite element boundary integral formulations. The research
will develop innovative new preconditioning techniques for the solution of the
algebraic systems resulting from the above-mentioned approximation techniques.
The preconditioners are constructed using H-matrix approximation combined with a
sweeping algorithm. Electromagnetic scattering problems play an important role
in the development of new technologies with applications in, for example,
antenna and microwave engineering, remote sensing, stealth vehicle design,
electromagnetic and plasmonic cloaking, biomedical engineering, and
electromagnetic and seismic subsurface imaging, and are especially indispensable
in locating and monitoring gas and oil reservoirs. Simulations capable of
efficiently solving acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems involve
complicated geometry, often, with fine scale inhomegenities. It is the goal of
this research to significantly reduce the computational costs associated with
solving above problems, thus enabling more realistic and robust computer design
technology for systems involving electromagnetic scattering.
