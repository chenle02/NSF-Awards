The focus of this research is the development of electrochemical methodology for
the application of reactive radical intermediates. Radical cation based
cyclization reactions based on anodic electrochemistry will be used to elaborate
complex organic molecules. The targets of interest will be crinipellin B,
scopadulcic acid B, alliacol A and 3-substituted proline derivatives. The
research is designed to show the general utility of electrochemical synthesis
for solving complex synthetic problems. With this award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller of the Department of
Chemistry at Washington University. Professor Moeller will focus his work on
using electrochemistry for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. The
target molecules of interest have important biological properties.
