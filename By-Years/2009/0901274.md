In the current proposal the PI proposes to develop an analog of several aspects
of the so-called Langlands duality to affine Kac-Moody groups. More
specifically, the PI proposes to study the spherical and Iwahori Hecke algebras
for affine Kac-Moody groups as well as their geometric versions (some parts of
that program have already been developed in the PI's joint works with D.Kazhdan
and M.Finkelberg). The PI also proposes to study an analog automorphic forms for
affine Kac-Moody groups as well as some structures generalizing the so-called
geometric Langlands correspondence for finite-dimensional reductive groups.

The proposed research lies on the border of such fields as number theory,
representation theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics; successful
implementation of the project might shed some new light on the connections
between these fields. For example, number theory is perhaps one of the oldest
mathematical subjects and one of its most important parts is called the
Langlands program. Recently it has been realized that geometric aspects of the
Langlands program have many connections with algebraic geometry as well as
modern mathematical physics (such as 4-dimensional quantum field theory). The
proposed research project should confirm the existence of such links as well
broaden and generalize them.
