0104728&lt;br/&gt;Acevedo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award, which
supports U.S.-Spain cooperative research on modeling grass and shrub vegetation
recovery after disturbance, using product imaging techniques to investigate
molecular dynamics, involves Miguel Acevedo of the University of North Texas and
Jose Bonvehi at the University of Alicante, Spain. The objectives of their
research are to develop individual-based models for vegetation regeneration, and
to develop scale-up methods by estimating parameters of the simpler transition
models from the individual-based models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U. S.
investigator brings to this collaboration his experience with modeling and
spatial analysis. This is complemented by the Spanish investigators' expertise
in modeling population and community dynamics and his data sets on tropical
grass growth and grass/shrub recovery dynamics after disturbance events. The
results of this research are expected to provide an understanding of vegetable
dynamics in soil useful to conservation efforts and ecological restoration, and
to assessing their influence on geochemical cycles. &lt;br/&gt;
