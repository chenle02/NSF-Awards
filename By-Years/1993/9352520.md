9352520 Meadows A Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) for Great Lakes undergraduate
laboratory education is serving a broad, undergraduate population with the goal
of producing high quality engineering and science students with the tools
necessary to attack the serious issues facing the marine environment. The ROV is
receiving a wide interdisciplinary use in the education of students across the
breadth of the institution. Technological development in new areas such as ocean
exploration requires the training of engineers and scientists with capabilities
to adequately attack new and challenging problems. Similarly, major future
breakthroughs in all areas of oceanography will be made by detailed
understanding of ecosystems and their interrelationships. An important role in
this effort and in the development of appropriate undergraduate curricula is
being played by the selective sampling and inspection capabilities provided by
vehicles such as this ROV. The equipment and facilities necessary to support the
proposed ROV operations include the Ship Hydrodynamics Laboratory (SHL) and the
University of Michigan's Research Vessel Laurentian which operates in the Great
Lakes as part of the NSF/UNOLS Fleet. ***
