Energy balance modeling studies suggest that the atmospheric circulation works
close to its maximum intensity, corresponding to a state of maximum entropy
production (MEP). However, this simple, emergent outcome of the atmospheric
circulation is controversial and not well accepted in the atmospheric community.
Preliminary results of the PI with an atmospheric general circulation model
confirm the existence of a MEP state representative of the present-day climate
when the amount of boundary layer friction is varied in the model. This Small
Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project builds on these results and
estimates the relevance and implications of MEP states for the atmospheric
circulation under climatic change. Another focus of this project is to quantify
the limits of applicability of the MEP states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
has potentially positive implications for our understanding of the climate
system and how it responds to climatic change, an important issue having
implications for environmental and energy policymaking.
