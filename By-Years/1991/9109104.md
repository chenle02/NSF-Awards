American public policy is remarkably stable and resistent to change. Yet over
the past forty years, dramatic changes have occurred in American public policies
toward women in particular. This sophisticated empirical study develops and
tests a political process theory to account for the political success of the
women's movement in the United States. Specifically, this study uses
longitudinal data on women's movement activities, public opinion toward women's
issues, and congressional activity to assess the nature and extent of the effect
which the women's movement has had on American public policy. In addition to
explaining how the women's movement has shaped the development of public policy,
the study should contribute to our understanding of social movements more
generally and how they influence the policy process.
