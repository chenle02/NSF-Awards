Much of decision theory focuses on how choices are made among a set of
alternative outcome options. However, many real world decisions are
"unstructured" in the sense that choices or "alternatives" are not specified in
advance. Instead, decision makers must create an ideal option. This has
application in business decision making, policy analysis, medical decisions, and
consumer product selection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines a two-
component model that may explain the process of unstructured decision making.
The first component focuses on identifying the decision maker's goals. The
second addresses the presentation of information in relationship to these goals.
Three phases of research will investigate each of the first two components
separately then the two components jointly. The studies will examine product
customization problems, which exemplify unstructured decision making because
they force individuals to select desirable attributes to create personalized
alternatives. A web-based program, Interactive Choice, created by the
investigators and modeled after electronic commerce websites, simulates a
customizing experience. The project also involves creation of an electronic
decision aid called Choice Builder to assist decision makers in making
unstructured decisions. &lt;br/&gt;
