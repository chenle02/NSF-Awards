This workshop proposal addresses data management research for the semantic web.
Semantic web is mainly about technology for machine understandable and machine
readable web pages. To date, much of the research on the semantic web has
focussed on developing ontologies and languages such as the Resource Description
Framework. There is a lot of research that needs to be done on querying and
indexing the web pages. The participants of this workshop will be those who are
actively conducting research in data management and the semantic web from
academia and industrial research laboratories. The workshop will include short
presentations by the experts as well as extensive discussions on research
directions and challenges. The outcome of this workshop will be a list of
recommendations for further research on data management support for the semantic
web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
