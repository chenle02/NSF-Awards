Differences in behavior and morphology of males and females are ubiquitous
throughout the animal kingdom, and commonly include dissimilarities in size,
strength, coloration, and signaling behavior. Such differences are usually
attributed to the operation of sexual selection, which favors traits called
secondary sexual characters that enhance the ability of their bearers to acquire
mates. Because of their greater intrinsic capacity for producing offspring,
males are usually the focus of more intense sexual selection than are females;
as such, secondary sexual characters are most commonly expressed in males.
Traditionally, sexual selection has been assumed to act to increase the ability
of males to compete for females (male-male competition) and/or to render males
intrinsically more attractive to females (female mate choice). Recent empirical
work suggest that sexual selection need not cease once females have mated. In
various insect species, females mated to more than one male may actively select
the paternity of their offspring by 1) shunting sperm to specialized
compartments of elaborate sperm-storage structures, 2) interfering with the
process of insemination, or 3) expelling unwanted sperm. The proposed research
will employ genetic analyses of crickets to examine the consequences of this
poorly understood, though potentially powerful mechanism of evolutionary change.
Understanding how postcopulatory female behavior contributes to male
fertilization success will be of direct practical importance to the efficacy of
integrated pest management strategies. An important component of such programs
involves the mass release of sterilized male for the suppression of pest
populations.
