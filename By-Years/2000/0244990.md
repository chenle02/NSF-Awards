The proposed research will focus on the investigation of Physics Beyond the
Standard Model. The PI proposes to find realistic models of supersymmetry
breakdown that do not lead to processes that are ruled out by present
experiments. The PI proposes to explore various exotic approaches to the
breakdown of supersymmetry, such as super conformal anomaly mediation of
supersymmetry breakdown, gaugino mediated supersymmetry breakdown and
supersymmetry breakdown resulting from deconstruction of extra dimensions. On a
more phenomenological side, the PI is involved in understanding excesses in
bottom quark cross sections at the Tevatron in terms of the existence of a light
squark and light gluino expected from the breakdown of supersymmetry. As an
alternative to SUSY theories in explaining new physics expected at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), the PI and collaborators are investigating models where
the Higgs particle is a pseudo-Goldstone boson.
