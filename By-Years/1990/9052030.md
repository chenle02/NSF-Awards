This project is increasing student participation in experimental psychology by
having students experience many important experiments as subjects, as
experimenters, and as data analysts. The addition of six computers to the lab
enhances participation as subjects at the introductory levels. At the upper
division level, students are involved in designing and implementing experiments,
and in statistical analysis of data from experiments addressing contemporary
issues in psychology. Many experimental psychologists now use computers to
display stimuli and record responses, and statistical analysis of data is also
largely computer-based. Improvements in software now permit more students to
learn to set up their own experiments for course projects and honors research.
The aim is for students to see experimentation as a part of their experience in
psychology, thus enhancing the teaching and learning of content areas,
methodology, and statistics. The university will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
