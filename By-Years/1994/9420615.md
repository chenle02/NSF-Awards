9420615 Sakita This proposal "Problems in Strong and Weak Interactions" deals
with attempts to define a consistent superstring theory which incorporates in
one framework quantum versions of all know interactions including gravity. It
also books for links between these field theoretical models of strong
interactions and certain properties of electrons moving in two dimensions under
the influence of a magnetic field. ***
