This project develops and tests new probabilistic approaches to text retrieval.
Using the statistical technique of logistic regression, documents are ranked in
order of estimated probability of relevance with respect to a query. The methods
are subjected to rigorous performance experiments with the collections of
documents and queries of the TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) series of
conferences sponsored by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). Specifically the project
investigates logistic regression retrieval in the following areas: (1)
comparison of different logistic regression retrieval models; (2) new
theoretical models which combine intelligent Boolean filtering with logistic
regression; and (3) application of the models to Chinese and Spanish language
retrieval. This project will advance the progress in modern text and document
retrieval by developing sound theoretical models of the retrieval process,
models which achieve high performance in experimental tests on millions of
documents. The research will contribute to understanding of themechanisms of
multilingual retrieval by applying its methodologies to queries and document
collections in Chinese and Spanish.
