Conduct a workshop to define a program plan for accomplishing the work,
including schedules and budget estimates. The initial workshop effort will
consist of six major tasks: (1) screen literature on material research
applicable to the selection of innovative construction materials, (2) conduct a
more detailed search of candidate materials and identify researchers working
with these materials, (3) select an advisory panel to assist in directing the
program and establishing the workshop agenda, (4) contact potential workshop
participants and distribute workshop announcement, (5) conduct workshop and
summarize discussions and conclusions, (6) select material research to be
performed and prepare a plan for accomplishing the total program.
