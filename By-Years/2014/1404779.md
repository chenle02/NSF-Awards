The main goals of the Conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry, to be held on
January 27-February 1, 2014 at the University of Miami, will be dissemination of
results and encouragement a wave of young, early career researchers to join
these projects. The wide range of topics appearing in HMS research necessitates
venues for the open exchanges of ideas in order for graduate students and early
career researchers to stay afloat on current topics. The subject has developed
extremely rapidly in recent years, and this conference will really help engage
young researchers.

Over the last several years, a variety of new categorical structures have been
discovered by physicists. Furthermore, it has become transparently evident that
the higher categorical language is beautifully suited to describing cornerstone
concepts in modern theoretical physics. As we head into the second decade of the
21st century, modern geometry and theoretical physics are more intertwined than
ever before. The convergence of ideas from mathematics and physics is
accelerating at the same time as elementary particle physics is on the cusp of a
profound revolution to be brought about by the new experimental results coming
out of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These will serve to identify among the
multitude of theoretical possibilities currently open, which ones best address
quantum field theory at the high energy scale. At the same time, a lot of
mathematical work remains to be done to provide a suitable framework for the new
physical theories that are being proposed. The geometric objects which we
investigate today are the foundations for such a framework: homological mirror
symmetry is the mathematical realization of dualities among super-symmetric
theories, and higher categories are the mathematical foundation for quantum
field theories. These new flavors of geometry, in which categorical structures
play a primordial role, will certainly continue to play a fundamental role in
21st century theoretical physics.
