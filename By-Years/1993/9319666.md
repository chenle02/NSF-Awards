9319666 Ackerman This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Washington
University in the purchase of a modern replacement console and reverse-detection
probe for an existing 300 MHz multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
be used in the following areas of research: (1) Synthetic Ribozymes, Hydrolytic
Chemical Nucleases, and Catalytic Antisense Agents for the Control of Gene
Expression; (2) Extended Organic Chemistry and the Study of Highly Reactive
Intermediates, Frontier Orbital Control of Very Fast Reactions, Gas-Phase
Rearrangements of Germylenes, New Routes to Stannylenes, and the Molecular
Design of Triplet Silylenes, Germylenes, and Stannylenes; (3) Synthesis and
Reactivity of Aromatic Metallacycles; and (4) Solution-Phase Materials
Processing. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
