This grant provides for the continuation of the very productive solar
oscillations studies which have been done off and on for many years at South
Pole. The telescope will make high resolution (4 arcsecond) images of the full
solar disk at two Fraunhofer wavelengths, Hydrogen-alpha and Calcium II K, which
come from different heights in the solar atmosphere. The hydrogen line will be
analyzed for intensity variations as well as Doppler velocity while the calcium
line will be used for intensity variations only. These data will be used to
study the interior of the sun by observing the various modes of the exterior
vibrations. In particular, studies will focus on the variations of the acoustic
oscillations with solar cycle activity, sub-surface structures of magnetic
features such as sun spots, the wave properties of the solar atmosphere and the
physics of acoustic oscillations with frequencies above 4 mHz. The South Pole is
a unique observatory for solar astronomy because only there can one observe the
sun for extended periods, such as weeks and months, without diurnal
interruptions or variations.
