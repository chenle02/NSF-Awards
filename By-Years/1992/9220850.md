Total nitrogen content of plant tissues and soils is a widely used assay in
ecological research. We have need for &gt;800 such assays each year which is
twice what our current analyzer can handle. Here we request purchase of an
additional nitrogen analyzer and ancillary equipment. Four research programs in
our department rely heavily upon total nitrogen determinations. Two groups focus
on plant responses to stress (drought, nutrient, salinity and extreme light
levels) and how those responses influence the population and evolutionary
responses of herbivorous insects. The third group looks at the distribution of
plant communities through time and asks how soil type influences the persistence
of plant communities at particular sites over thousands of years. The fourth
group focuses on experimental analysis of the mechanisms of plant competition
for mineral resources during the succession from abandoned fields to oak
savanna.
