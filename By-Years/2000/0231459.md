This project is developing and evaluating prototypes of interactive, dynamic,
and visually oriented webpages linked by common themes. Current technologies
facilitate animation and exploration of interconnected networks of information,
and in this manner new concepts are made more accessible when associated with
more elementary and familiar ones. Unifying mathematical principles can lead
students to formulate their own mathematical questions, discover results, and
organize and understand their knowledge. The presentations include motivation
from modern applications as well as animations of classical examples. Modules
are expected to become part of the National Science Digital Library and
available as an online resource for both teachers and students, to review
fundamentals, to preview more advanced manifestations and applications, and to
emphasize discovery using animated and linked explanations and "proofs without
(and with!) words."
