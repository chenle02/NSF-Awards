This grant provides funding for the development of mathematical models for
maximizing airlines' long-run revenue from cargo operations. Two types of models
will be developed. The short-term models will focus on the airlines' decisions
about whether or not to accept each booking request from direct-ship customers.
Booking decisions are made dynamically based on current capacity commitments,
historical booking profile, and time remaining until departure. Such decisions
must also explicitly consider weight and volume dimensions of the package and
capacity commitments to freight forwarders who, acting as independent
intermediaries, pre-purchase cargo capacity and generate additional streams of
demand by performing pick-up, storage, customs' clearance, packing, and local
delivery to consignees. The medium-term models will focus on the airlines'
decisions about which combinations of capacity and price to offer for sale to
the freight forwarders. Both short and medium term problems will be formulated
as Markov Decision Processes and structural properties of the optimal solutions
will be identified, where possible. Algorithms that generate good heuristic
solutions and bounds on the airline's optimal expected revenue will be developed
and their accuracy will be tested through extensive numerical experiments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research may affect the
way in which airlines think about and manage cargo capacity. Since air-cargo
revenue management is an uncharted area for academic researchers, the proposed
work will also open up new avenues for future investigation. It will lead to the
development of new models and computational techniques for bounding and testing
heuristic solutions to large scale stochastic optimization problems. Another
goal of this research is to demonstrate the potential benefits of using
stochastic optimization based solutions for managing cargo capacity and to
generate new managerial insights. Finally, the proposed work will contribute to
the training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
