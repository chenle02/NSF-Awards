X-ray diffraction has long been a standard technique for mineral
identification. Improvements in modern instruments and major advances in the
versatility of software have expanded the potential uses of X-ray
diffractometers (XRDs) to include undergraduate instruction and student research
in a variety of geological topics. This project involves acquisition of an XRD
and enhancement of research opportunities for undergraduates. This project
allows the geology department to require senior research problems to include
analytical data. Integration of data from modern laboratory instruments with
theory and field observations is essential because analytical instrumentation
has become fundamental to the current practice of geoscience. The XRD is a major
component of the Mineralogy and Petrology course sequence required of all
geology majors, and essential applications of XRD are being introduced to
undergraduates in other courses.
