0348966&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project will develop energy-
aware compiler techniques to reduce power and energy consumption in
microprocessors, without affecting performance. Over the past few years, energy
consumption by computers has emerged as a major area of intellectual and
commercial activity. A key principle behind this approach is to use speculative
information available at compile time to reduce power and energy consumption.
The key qualifier is speculative: the information does not have to be provably
correct. Speculative information that turns out to be correct will enhance
energy reduction; if it is incorrect, the worst that will happen is that a
penalty (in terms of energy) will have to be paid. The use of such speculative
compile-time information opens up a largely unexplored dimension in compilers
and computer architectures, to target energy
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the proposed effort will not
merely be a set of products, but also a vastly increased understanding of the
means by which compile-time information can be exploited for energy savings. It
is expected that this development effort will have a considerable impact on the
theoretical underpinnings of compilers and compiler-architecture interaction, as
well as a significant commercial impact. With the increasing prevalence of
battery-powered computing devices such as PDAs, mobile telephones, and
notebooks, power-aware computing is becoming increasingly important
commercially. &lt;br/&gt;
