The Earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6C over the past century, and
is expected to experience a further warming of 1.4 to 5.8C over the next
century. A central challenge to predicting how species will fare in a warmer
climate is to understand how the responses of organisms to climate change are
likely to affect their interactions with other species, which will ultimately
determine their presence or absence in the future. In order to accomplish this
task, we will study the mechanisms by which climate change alters species
interactions in two well-studied systems: gray wolf food webs in Yellowstone
National Park and Isle Royale National Park. The reintroduction of gray wolves
to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 provides a research opportunity for
comparing the functioning of an ecosystem with and without a keystone top
predator under different climate change scenarios. Long-term data from Isle
Royale, on changes in the numbers of wolves and moose, and on changes in growth
of balsam fir, allow for a unique analysis of community response to climate
change. This research will contribute to both ecological theory, by providing
insight into the consequences of rapid climate change for species interactions,
and to applied ecology and management, by generating predictions about the
potential consequences of climate change for wolf-mediated systems in two
National Parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
