Title: Access to Justice Among the Rural
Poor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individuals who are poor often do not have
access to legal services. Civil legal aid provides some legal services to poor
individuals, but usually not enough to meet their legal needs. As well, these
individuals may not seek access to justice because may not be aware that their
disputes are legal in nature, or because they are not aware they may have access
to legal help. This project engages in an ethnographic study of the rural poor
in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, as it seeks to examine this population's
conceptions of access to justice, and to understand why these individuals
usually do not pursue legal services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By engaging in a
broad range of interdisciplinary approaches on rural poverty, this project
addresses theoretical issues on legal mobilization from the perspective of law
and society as well as socio-legal studies of legal advocacy and legal
mobilization. The project will explore the complex intersections of poverty,
advocacy, and policy in the distinct context of the rural poor in Minnesota and
Wisconsin. Methodological approaches include observation, archival and legal
analyses, and interviews. This sustained, multi-sited and diverse methodological
approach will provide a rigorous and comparative consideration of rural access
to justice.
