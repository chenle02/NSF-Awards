Recent astronomical observations demonstrate that a large number of planets are
found beyond our solar system. Many of these planets, which are found orbiting
stars other than the Sun, are located in "Habitable Zones". A Habitable Zone is
the temperate region surrounding a star in which water could exist as a liquid.
While the technology needed to measure the radius of planets is now available,
instruments capable of measuring the mass of Earth-like worlds located in the
Habitable Zones have yet to be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator
will build a new astronomical tool, called a spectrograph, for the Large
Binocular Telescope, in Arizona. Unlike previous instruments, which are limited
by blurry images caused by the distorting effects of Earth's turbulent
atmosphere, this project will use hardware that corrects for atmospheric
turbulence, creating clear (diffraction-limited) images that enable measurements
at much higher resolution. By measuring wobbles in a star's motion, with
exquisite precision, the investigators will determine the mass and density of
planets that transit across the face of their parent star. They will learn the
atmospheric composition of these planets. The investigators will study the
physical properties of nearby worlds that hold the potential for life.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The investigators will train students in building
astronomical instrumentation. Further, research and public engagement will be
integrated through a new outreach program called "Living Worlds". A STEM-based
initiative that promotes science for grade school children through hands-on
activities, a series of national contests designed for K-8 students will be
developed to foster and maintain an interest in science through the search for
extrasolar planets and life elsewhere in the universe.
