9603709 Wightman Dr. Bruce Wightman studies the mechanism of axon guidance in
the developing nervous system. During the development of an animal, nerves get
formed by the growth of axons. In order for the nervous system to function
properly, these axons must "wire up" properly. This means that axons must have a
mechanism for determining direction. They must be able to select one particular
route over another. We have employed a moleculargenetic approach to identify two
genes, fax-1 and unc-20, that are required foraxons to follow the correct route
during development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Therefore, these
genes may function as molecular "signs" that provide navigational information to
growing axons. We are using molecular and genetic techniques to clone these two
genes and determine how they provide directions to growing axons. An
understanding of the mechanism of axon guidance will help us understand how
nerve wiring occurs, and thus provide a clearer view of the biological basis of
behavior.
