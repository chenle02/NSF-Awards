The Oceanography Society (TOS) will publish a special issue of the journal
Oceanography on the topic of ocean warming with the overarching goal of
providing a comprehensive, accessible, and authoritative summary of the state of
the science of this globally important topic. Oceanography Editor Dr. Ellen
Kappel, along with three guest editors who are experts in the field, Drs. Paul
Durack, Lars Smedsrud, and Alex Sen Gupta, will oversee the content of the
special issue. Distribution of the issue will include: (1) mailing hard copies
to TOS members, more than half of whom are ocean sciences graduate students; (2)
providing extra hard copies at meetings of opportunity; (3) posting articles on
the open access Oceanography website and promoting their availability through
social media, the TOS website, and TOS newsletters; and (4) distributing full
digital versions to instructors, or multiple hard copies for classroom use, upon
request. TOS plans to follow up a year post-publication to measure outcomes and
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special issue of the journal will cover topics
such as Upper- and deep-ocean warming, Interannual to multidecadal ocean
variability, hurricane impacts-wave climate modeling, Arctic/Northern warming,
warming and vulnerability of subsea permafrost and associated methane deposits,
Atlantic warming since the Little Ice Age (flux estimates, overall warming, sea
level rise), Ice sheet modeling, Arctic amplification and sea ice loss, coral
bleaching, changing Arctic ecosystems, categorizing and naming marine heat
waves, ocean acoustics, and marine host-pathogen
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
