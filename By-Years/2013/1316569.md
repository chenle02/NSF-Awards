This action funds Matthew Walters of Johns Hopkins University to conduct a
research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the
summer of 2013 at the University of Tokyo's Kavli Institute for the Physics and
Mathematics of the Universe in Kashiwa, Japan. The project title is "New Light
Particles in the Early Universe." The host scientist is Hitoshi Murayama.

This research project studies the effects of new light particle species on early
universe phenomena, such as the synthesis of light elements and the production
of residual background radiation. These effects are explored in an effective
field theory approach, in order to provide constraints on theories in a model-
independent fashion. In addition, this project develops calculational methods to
determine the mass of new light particles which become nonrelativistic during
the era of recombination, when electrons and protons began to form neutral
atoms. These results have significant implications for theoretical models and
future experimental research, both in cosmology and elementary particle physics,
with the potential to discover new particles and physical phenomena.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, through this research project the Fellow is
developing new analyses and applications for data from multiple observational
experiments. The Fellow is both submitting these results for publication to aid
experimental scientific collaborations in the use of current and future data and
using them to educate the general population about current progress in physics
and astronomy. In addition, the Fellow is sharing these methods of analysis with
researchers in the host country and the U.S. to encourage further collaborations
and extensions of this project.
