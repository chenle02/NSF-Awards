This project is designed and developed to implement a pilot program for the
establishment of an on-line research and information system. The two main
objectives are: 1) To broaden the participation of minorities in the Federal
Government's research, development, and education programs; and 2) To provide
on-line access to information on minority institutions' education, research, and
service programs; such as, institutional data, extramural activity (centers,
facilities, equipment and consortia arrangements) and (faculty, undergraduate
and graduate students' capabilities).
