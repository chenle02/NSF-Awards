This is a Phase II project under the Small Business Research Innovation Program.
In the Phase I research, the H&N Instruments Inc has obtained a proof of the
concept of the Programmable Laser Activated Parallel Synthesis (PROLAPS) and has
established the feasibility of using PROLAPS to synthesize megapeptide arrays.
In this Phase II project, two major objectives are being pursued; (1) optimize
the instrumentation and procedures so that very large peptide arrays are
synthesized, and (2) demonstrate the usefulness of peptide arrays as a screening
method for finding peptides with desired molecular recognition properties. If
successful, this project will result in the complete automation of the prototype
PROLAPS instrument. This instrument has a potential to become a useful tool to a
broad areas of scientific research and development.
