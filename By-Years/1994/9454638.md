There is a rapidly growing need for advanced technology environmental education
programs to prepare students for the workplace of today and tomorrow. To build a
high performance environmental education infrastructure, the Hazardous Materials
Training and Research Institute (HMTRI), the Partnership for Environmental
Technology Education (PETE), and the University of Northern Iowa Center for
Environmental and Energy Education is establishing a national Advanced
Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC). The vision is to create a
world class network of community college environmental programs linked with high
schools that inform and prepare students for entry into these two-year programs.
The Center has established three broad goals: (1) Develop nationally validated
curriculum models and advanced instructional materials; (2) Establish
comprehensive programs of professional development; and (3) Build a
clearinghouse to serve as a national center of environmental information and as
a hub for the networking of environmental educators, business and industry,
federal agencies, and professional societies. The Center will provide leadership
to: enhance core and advanced math science, and technology components of
environmental education; utilize advanced electronic communications networks;
focus upon meeting the needs of diverse learners; encourage instructional
materials which utilize advanced technologies; and develop teaching and
curriculum standards for environmental education. The ATEEC will touch hundreds
of instructors and improve the education of thousands of students throughout the
nation.
