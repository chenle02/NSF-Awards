The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a software platform for radio frequency integrated circuits
(RFIC) design with more accurate simulation prediction. The RFIC industry, key
for wireless systems, is approximately $50 B, and RFIC companies spend about $15
B on the final trial-and-error fabrication process known as "tape-out". Each
tape-out takes 12 weeks and costs ~$1 M, and 3-5 may be required. Significant
savings may be realized in both time and cost by reducing design
iterations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of RFICs . RFICâ€™s parasitic effect and poor simulation accuracy
requires multiple tape-outs to meet specifications. In the future 5G era, this
problem gets worse as mmWave frequency parasitics are even harder to model and
more tape-out rounds will be required. Using the technology under development,
it may be possible to improve significantly simulation accuracy by combining
traditional physics-based models and customized machine-learning (ML) training
in RFIC simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
