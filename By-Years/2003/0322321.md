0322321&lt;br/&gt;Costerton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award is jointly supported by the NSF and the
Department of Energy (DOE), in the area of biofilm research. Organized by Dr.
John Costerton of Montana State University, the PASI will consist of two 3-week
short courses, one to be conducted at the University of Concepcion (UC) in
Concepcion, Chile, and the other at the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at
Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. The PASI will involve approximately 40
students from the U.S. and Latin America and its main goal is to familiarize
advanced graduate students and postdoctorals, from diverse educational and
cultural backgrounds, with techniques that allow micro-scale investigations of
microbial biofilms, including those used in genomic and proteomic research. In
addition, the PASI will promote familiarity with the use of microelectrodes and
discuss various applications to reactor design. Lecturers will emphasize
discovery through current research projects and will help to stimulate future
collaborations among all participants. A web page for the PASI will be developed
to assist in recruitment and dissemination efforts. &lt;br/&gt;
