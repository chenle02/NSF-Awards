ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;08 August 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1115537&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory&lt;br/&gt;PI: S. Higgins&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D. Goldberg, P.
Ljunggren&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH operated by Columbia
University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO); namely initial support for
oceanographic winch replacement, engineering support for Long Core system
repositioning, a new scientific workboat, an a new marine radio. Funding of
these items will greatly enhance science support capability and safety on board
the vessel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The LANGSETH
supports federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to
expand human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic
vessel in the Academic Fleet. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes
graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time
satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events. The LANGSETH
is scheduled to complete nearly 200 NSF sponsored days in 2011.
