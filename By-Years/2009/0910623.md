This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Roald Hoffmann of
Cornell University will use theoretical methods to understand structure and
bonding in solids under high pressure and the bonding and electronic properties
of extended structures of various dimensions. This research has the potential to
identify new types of superconductors and to uncover new electronic materials.
The PI will also recast the Mott-Jones or Hume-Rothery model for magic electron
counts in intermetallic compounds into chemical terms. This work should result
in a framework for understanding the properties of solids that is broadly
applicable to chemical problems. The PI will also continue to promote science
literacy to the general public through a variety of innovative media, including
plays, poetry, public speaking, and cabaret acts.
