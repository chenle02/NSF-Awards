The Department of Chemistry is acquiring an atomic absorption spectrophotometer
and a diode array spectrophotometer for use in three introductory chemistry
courses. The atomic absorption unit is being used to determine the
concentrations of a variety of metals in materials of environmental origin, such
as the concentration of mercury and lead in the food supply and nickel in
alloys. Following the study of Beer's Law, the diode array uv/vis
spectrophotometer is applied to the determination of phosphate in water, iron in
vitamin supplements, and the study of buffer behavior.
