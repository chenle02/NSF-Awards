High-throughput experimental methods have revolutionized scientific
&lt;br/&gt;inquiry. In contrast to the hypothesis-driven scientific method,
&lt;br/&gt;data-driven science seeks to discover and explore hypotheses
supported &lt;br/&gt;by the huge volume of data generated in high-throughput
experiments. &lt;br/&gt;Such datasets are large and high-dimensional: they
consist of a &lt;br/&gt;multitude of samples and many measured attributes for
each sample. A &lt;br/&gt;typical hypothesis corresponds to a subspace of this
dataset: a subset &lt;br/&gt;of samples that share similar values on a subset of
attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a series
of new data mining &lt;br/&gt;methods that can effectively discover these
subspaces, the embedded &lt;br/&gt;patterns among the values, and the
relationships between patterns. The &lt;br/&gt;underlying problems are highly
combinatorial and efficient algorithms &lt;br/&gt;are required to enable users
to mine and explore subspace patterns in &lt;br/&gt;large and complex datasets.
The proposed methods combine the advantages &lt;br/&gt;of efficient matrix
decomposition, effective sampling techniques, and &lt;br/&gt;advanced graph
algorithms. Solutions to these research problems will be &lt;br/&gt;integrated
into an interactive and visual interface to explore subspace &lt;br/&gt;patterns
mined from experimental data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the proposed methods
are applicable across a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;domains, the focus of project
is the analysis of gene regulatory &lt;br/&gt;networks and the analysis of
protein structure, in collaboration &lt;br/&gt;respectively with geneticists and
pharmacologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current progress and results are
accessible and continuously updated
