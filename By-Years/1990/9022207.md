The testicular feminization mutation (Tfm) occurs in rats, mice, cattle,
chimpanzee and humans. The mutation is carried on the X- chromosome and all
males carrying this mutation exhibits the phenotype which is the insensitivity
to the hormone, androgens. Studies of Tfm mutation have provided us with
insights on the mode of action of androgens, particularly the interaction
between the hormone and CNS proteins. The GW group maintains the only known
colony of Tfm rats and serves as an invaluable resource for the research
community.
