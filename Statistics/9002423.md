The principal investigator will work on two major problems in the area of
nonparametric regression: multivariate smoothing and variance function
estimation. For the smoothing of surfaces, without any restrictions like
additivity of the function or other assumptions to reduce dimensionality, an
approach based on mixtures between an orthogonal series method using
ultraspherical expansions and kernel estimators is to be developed. The main
problems to be analyzed are the choice of bandwidths, boundary effects and their
treatment, associated questions of uniform convergence, the estimation of
isoklines and the development of fast and efficient algorithms. In his work on
nonparametric variance function estimation he will develop methods for
constructing confidence and prediction intervals of the variance. The
nonparametric analysis of curve data has found considerable interest among
statisticians facing applied problems from longitudinal biomedical studies as
well as geophysical and environmental spatial data. The principal investigator
will work on two specific problems in this area: surface fitting and variance
function estimation.
