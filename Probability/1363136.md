The so-called Abelian sandpile represents a striking example of surprising
mathematics arising from a simple setting. The rules of the sandpile are simple:
given a configuration of "chips" on an infinite chessboard (i.e., the integer
lattice), one can "topple" any square with at least 4 chips, by sending one chip
from this square to each of its four neighboring squares. When begun from a
single large stack of chips and continued until no square has more than 3 chips,
the result is a striking fractal configuration. Studying this process has lead
to the discovery of surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of
mathematics, and this project aims to leverage these new connections both for
the sake of a deeper understanding of the sandpile process, and to enrich our
understandings of these other areas as well. This area of mathematics has
connections with phase transitions and conformal field theory in physics as
well.

More specifically, this project concerns the so-called Abelian sandpile model of
Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld. By identifying new connections between integer
superharmonic functions, Apollonian circle packings, and certain regular tilings
of the Euclidean plane, we are now able to characterize the scaling limit of the
sandpile and analyze its local fractal structure. This project has two primary
goals. The first is to extend our knowledge of the sandpile: for example, we
would like to strengthen the kind of convergence we can prove the sandpile
process admits, characterize solutions to long-studied instances of the
Dirichlet problem for the sandpile, and extend our knowledge of the scaling
limit of the sandpile process beyond the universe of the square lattice. On the
other hand, we would like to bring new perspectives developed for our analysis
of the sandpile to bear on other areas, with the possibility of confirming
number-theoretic conjectures regarding Apollonian circle packings, or
characterizing tilings of the plane with certain symmetry properties.
