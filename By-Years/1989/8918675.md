The objective of this research is to study the structure and dynamics of the
equatorial and low latitude nighttime ionosphere. Ground based optical images
will be made of field-aligned transequatorial plasma bubbles by means of the
recombination emission of the plasma. Previous observations have shown the
evening perturbations of the bottomside F-layer, followed by their rise and east
ward drift through the layer. Physical processes to be followed studied include
the initial seeding of depletions and the dynamics that produces the tilting and
shearing motions of long-lived plasma depletions.
