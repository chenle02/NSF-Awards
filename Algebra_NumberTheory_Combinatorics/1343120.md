This award will provide funding for Integers 2013: The Erdos Centennial
Conference, which will be held at the University of West Georgia,in Carrollton,
Georgia, October 24-27, 2013. The Integers conferences, held bi-annually since
2003, serve to bring together mathematicians and students interested in
combinatorics and number theory. The 2013 Integers conference will focus on the
area broadlydefined as combinatorial number theory, a field in which Paul Erdos
was vastly influential, and will pay tribute to his legacy. The conference will
include talks on such topics as additive number theory, multiplicative number
theory, combinatorial games, Ramsey theory, elementary number theory, and
sequences.

The conference will feature several plenary speakers and about fifty additional
speakers. In addition to the plenary speakers, a major portion of the funding
will support a good number of graduate students, younger faculty, and female
mathematicians. The conference will include at least ten student research talks.
It will promote interaction among research mathematicians at all career stages
from the talented undergraduate to the internationally distinguished researcher.
The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special volume of the
journal Integers.
