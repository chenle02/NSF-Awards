This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Early stages of chromosome evolution
in Drosophila." Theory on the evolution of sex chromosomes has focused on XY
systems, neglecting ZW ones that are known to be important in nature. This
research uses D. melanogaster females, normally XX, that have been converted to
ZW and measures the resulting sex-specific fitness changes. It also compares
maternal effects of gene location in ZW chicken with XY genomes.

This research will increase understanding of chromosomal evolution and the
training will further the Fellow's knowledge in molecular systematics. Her
career plan is to combine teaching and research in higher education.
