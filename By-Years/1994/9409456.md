9409456 Nettleship This Research Initiation Proposal is to support an
experimental study of concurrent creep and densification of ceramic materials.
Two existing theoretical models will be evaluated by a systematic experimental
study and comparison made by data obtained during pressureless sintering and a
sinter-forging operation. Compacts of alumina powder will be prepared by
colloidal methods and sintered in a specially designed constant load creep
apparatus. Finally, the sensitivity of the adapted models to processing
variables such as particle size and shape will be examined. ***
