Scientific investigation, the process of formulating hypotheses, designing
experiments, and analyzing results is a critical aspectof any undergraduate
program seeking to produce graduates capable of critical thought. This important
aspect of education has been missing from many computer science programs.
Introductory computer science courses are typically taught with heavy emphasis
towards programming assignments. Students tend to perceive computer science as
the tedious and repetitious study of writing relatively simple computer
programs. Scientifically oriented students are often drawn from the mundane task
of introductory programming to more dynamic fields of experimentation and
analysis. These students never experience the enormous variety and challenge of
computer problem solving. This project is designed to alter the way computer
science is taught at the introductory level. Four laboratory courses have been
specifically designed to serve both as a solid foundation forundergraduate
majors and minors as well as to expose non-majors tothe exciting and varied
facets of computer science. The courses,Foundations I &amp; II, provide a
breadth-first introduction to major fields within computer science. The course,
Computer Problem Solving, augments the foundations courses with a problem
solving perspective of computer programming. Students will use supplied abstract
data types and alternative problem solving methods such as dynamic programming
and divide-and-conquer in the solution and analysis of classic computer science
problems. The fourth course, Data Structures extends this problem-solving
perspective by comparing and analyzing alternative implementations of the
abstract data types used in the computer problem-solving courses. All four
courses combine laboratory and lecture to produce a dynamic environment of
hands-on experimentation and analysis.
