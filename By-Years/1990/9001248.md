This project involves the creation of a new parallel programming language,
called PRAM-Pascal, and the construction of a compiler of this language into
machine language of a parallel random access machine (PRAM). When completed, it
will allow users to program in a high level parallel language similar to C* of
Connection MachineTM and to monitor the execution of the code. Such a compiler
would provide colleges and universities with an environment where undergraduate
computer science students can experiment with a parallel computer.
