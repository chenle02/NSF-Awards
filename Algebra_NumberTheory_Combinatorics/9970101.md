deJong/Vakil 9970101 The investigator proposes to use Maxim Kontsevich's space
of "stable maps" (originally motivated by mathematical physics earlier this
decade) to tackle problems in a variety of fields. Applications include
explaining the conjectured presence of modular forms in the enumerative geometry
of curves on surfaces, understanding various combinatorial problems (relating to
the geometry of ramified covers of the sphere), generalizing stable maps to
positive characteristic, algebraically understanding the original motivation for
stable maps ("Gromov-Witten invariants") in a "relative" case, and using stable
maps to understand the moduli space of pointed curves.

This proposal concerns algebraic geometry, an area of mathematics studying
geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. It has long been known that
nodal algebraic curves are a powerful tool in algebraic geometry. These curves
can be thought of as surfaces with holes with pairs of points "glued together".
Earlier this decade, ideas from theoretical physics led to the introduction of
"stable maps", parametrizing certain kinds of maps of nodal curves into another
space. This development has proved to be very fruitful, sparking advances in a
variety of fields. The investigator's area of research is the use of families of
nodal algebraic curves in algebraic geometry, in particular with applications to
other fields such as enumerative geometry, arithmetic geometry, combinatorics,
and mathematical physics.
