Champaign REU: Undergraduate Symbolic Computations in Engineering and Science
(USCES) This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will support ten
students per year in programs carried out during the summer, for three years.
The project will promote the emerging field of symbolic computational science as
an approach to computational modeling and scientific computing with problems
drawn primarily from mechanical and industrial engineering. Specific goals of
the project are (a) to introduce the students to modern computational and
symbolic methodologies for solving challenging problems, (b) to increase
understanding of the qualitative and quantitative nature of these problems, (c)
to develop the students' ability to derive and interpret mathematical models,
and (d) to provide an integrated educational experience to a selected group of
undergraduate students with special emphasis on underrepresented groups. Members
of the research team are from `oth the University of Illinois and from Wolfram
Research and use of the symbolic manipulation package Mathematica will be a
focus of the effort. ***
