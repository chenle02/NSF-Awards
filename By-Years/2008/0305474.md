Abstract: The long-term goal of this project is to study holomorphic mappings
and real submanifolds arising in complex analysis and holomorphic dynamical
systems. A large part of the PI's proposed research has its roots in Birkhoff's
fixed point theorem, the KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) theory, and the Siegel-
Bruno-Yoccoz theory. On the other hand, new research obtained by the method of
complex analysis will give new insights into the classical area-preserving maps
and reversible maps, and reversible or Hamiltonian systems. The PI's proposed
research involves several problems in connection with real analytic surfaces in
two-dimensional complex space, formally linearizable reversible or area-
preserving real analytic maps, and singular Levi-flat hypersurfaces in the
complex projective space.

The differential equations concerning the motion of N mass points, a model of
the solar system,in the three-dimensional space attracting each other according
to the Newton's law form a Hamiltonian system. The reversibility of a dynamical
system could just be the time-symmetry that is important in practical matters.
The periodic orbits of certain area-preserving mappings correspond to the
periodic motion in the Hamiltonian system of the restricted three-body problem,
and such study of the existence of such periodic orbits goes back at least to
work of Poincar\'e and Birkhoff on the celestial mechanics about a century ago.
The PI's work aims to understand the existence of periodic orbits in such
Hamiltonian or time-symmetric systems, both over the real numbers and over the
complex numbers.The PI is active in undergraduate teaching, and has also
organized a graduate student seminar dealing with his research area.
