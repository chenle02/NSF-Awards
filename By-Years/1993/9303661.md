9303661 Goss The goal of this project is understanding the mechanism of
eucaryotic protein synthesis. In particular a detailed study is planned of
equilibrium and kinetic parameters characterizing the interactions of eucaryotic
initiation factors with mRNA and oligonucleotides. Specific aims include: (1)
study of initiation factor interactions with 5'-cap structures on mRNA, (2)
study of the interaction of eIf-4B with mRNA, (3) explore interactions of
various initiation factors together and separately with oligonucleotides
(including ATP effects), and (4) investigate the kinetics of initiation factor
interactions with oligonucleotides and mRNA. %%% Protein synthesis from many
points of view begins with initiation, a process involving numerous protein
factors and specific portions of mRNA. This is a contentious area of research
because the system is so sensitive to experimental parameters and the choice of
simplifications (ie. which components to employ). The studies planned are
important because they will actually quantitate the interactions involved. This
will ultimately make it possible to compare, understand, and integrate results
from all labs, providing the experiments are clearly described to begin with.
