In this project we will study the algebraic K-theory of infinite groups Gamma
with torsion. These K-groups have important topological applications in Wall's
finiteness obstruction theory and hence in the problem of classifying high-
dimensional manifolds of a fixed homotopy type. In this project we will use the
Farrell-Jones isomorphism conjecture as a conceptual approach towards the
computation of the algebraic K-theory of infinite groups with torsion. The
Farrell-Jones conjecture states that the algebraic K-theory of the integral
group ring of Gamma comes from the algebraic K-theory of the virtually cyclic
subgroups of Gamma. This conjecture has been proven for large classes of groups,
and leads to very concrete calculations. In this project we will use this
conjecture to compute the lower algebraic K-groups of the following groups:
hyperbolic n-simplex reflection groups, hyperbolic reflection groups, certain
co-compact lattices in semi-simple real Lie groups of R-rank 2 and three-
dimensional crystallographic groups (for all of these groups the conjecture is
well known). We also intend to get some preliminary results on the K-theory of
groups such as SL(4,Z), the mapping class group and three-dimensional orbifold
groups (for these groups the Farrell-Jones Conjecture is still open). All of
these groups are of great interest in low-dimensional topology.

Algebraic K-theory plays an important role in many areas of modern mathematics:
most notably algebraic topology, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In
topology, surgery theory is the name given to a collection of techniques used to
produce one manifold from another in a controlled fashion. Surgery refers to
cutting out parts of the manifold and replacing it with a part of another
manifold, matching up along the cut or boundary. With the development of this
theory in the 1960's, many problems in high dimensional topology, in particular
the classification of high dimensional manifolds, were found to have
obstructions in (and were often classified by) the algebraic K-theory of the
integral group ring of the fundamental group Gamma of the manifold being
studied. As such, it is of great interest to obtain computations of these K
groups for various groups Gamma.
