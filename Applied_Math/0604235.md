Some fundamental problems of meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics are
addressed by a combination of mathematical tools in pursuit, in the long term,
of improving the numerical simulation of these phenomena on computers. This
proposal also has a strong interdisciplinary educational component. For problems
in the atmospheric and ocean sciences, fundamentally new perspectives are
proposed that affect the numerical predictions substantially, such as the
boundary conditions and the treatment of the topography in the calculations.
More fundamental concepts are considered in fluid mechanics, which affect our
vision of turbulence, a problem of industrial importance.
