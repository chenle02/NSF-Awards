Science and Mathematics Scholarships-Focus on Baccalaureate
&lt;br/&gt;Studies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the program
is to recruit, educate, support, and graduate students with financial need who
are pursuing academic majors in, and subsequently careers related to, computer
science, and mathematics. The project responds to both institutional priorities
and the national need for individuals within these disciplines. The program
supports 21 students annually for four years. The program consists of
comprehensive recruitment and academic support programs, and appropriate career
counseling programs targeting students majoring in computer science and
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSEMS scholars are supported through
activities that involve students in research, extensive internship program, and
aggressive career services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
