Mathematical Sciences (21) As a part of the CCLI A&I grant entitled Implementing
Reform in an Internet-Based Classroom, the mathematics department at East
Tennessee State University implemented a pilot program, which provided a
technology-intensive laboratory experience for certain sections of elementary
statistics courses. This experiment showed that the use of technology in
elementary statistics increases retention, fosters participation, and improves
conceptual understanding of statistical concepts. Indeed, students in the
program were significantly more successful than those in the general population.

In order for technology to truly make a difference in student learning, it must
be delivered within an entirely different type of course. Hence, this project
creates an elementary statistics course that incorporates software packages such
as Minitab, online materials such as those in the Rice Virtual Lab in Statistics
(NSF DUE 9751307, 07/97-06/99), and the best of curriculum reform. The best
means to do so is to transform statistical instruction into a multi-faceted
program that develops students' mathematical abilities in a step-by-step
process.
