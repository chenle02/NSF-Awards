Through this project, the university is equipping a 20-workstation
microcomputer-assisted data accumulation and analysis laboratory. The
instrumentation is being used in Principles of Chemistry, a course designed for
chemistry majors and other students who require a rigorous introductory class in
general chemistry. Each workstation consists of a microcomputer equipped with a
variety of data accumulating probes and supporting hardware. The equipment is
durable, easy to use and highly suitable for undergraduate level courses. The
use of computer-interfaced probes allows rapid, accurate data accumulation,
which in turn allows more time to be spent on data interpretation. The
instrumentation also is capable of running several different experiments
simultaneously or consecutively. The data storage system and versatile software
analyze and conveniently sort files, and a hard copy can be produced that is
relevant to a particular concept or cluster of concepts. These qualities make
the instrumentation highly applicable to real-time data interpretation. The
instrumentation is in keeping with the goal of exposing students to instruments
with computer-assisted capabilities throughout the curriculum, thereby better
preparing the student for graduate school and a work place that is increasingly
dependent upon such technologies. Some 400 students (chemistry, biology, and
other majors) could benefit from the project over the 5-year period.
