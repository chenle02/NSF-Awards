9701591 Palmer Stream environments are difficult to fully understand because
food and living space tend to be distributed in an uneven way, and animals move
extensively within the environment. These are factors which have lately received
much attention separately, but not together. In particular, many theoretical
studies assume either that animals move at random, or that they have perfect
knowledge of their environment, and thus can determine the best location to move
to. However, many animals do not fit these simplified ideas-they can control
their movements to some extent but do not have extensive information about their
environment. The investigators will use computer models, with varying levels of
biological realism, to determine how animals move within the uneven stream
environment, and how their movement affects population sizes and stability. They
will also perform experiments in an artificial stream to determine how much
control small stream invertebrates can exert over their movement in the face of
flow. The movement patterns and population levels of small stream invertebrates
have important consequences for the stream environment, because they form the
base of the stream food web and are involved in the microbial processes web as
well.
