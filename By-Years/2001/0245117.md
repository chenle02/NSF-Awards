This proposal provides funds for the LIGO Visitors Program at the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The LIGO Visitors Program
supports visitors to the LIGO Laboratories, at all levels and ranks, who wish to
become involved in the science and techniques associated with the detection of
gravitational waves with interferometric techniques. Visitors contribute their
accumulated skills and abilities to enhance the performance of the LIGO team.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LIGO Laboratory Visitors Program is oriented towards
activities at the LIGO Observatories at Hanford, WA, and Livingston, LA as well
as at the Caltech or MIT LIGO Laboratories. The program has several parts: short
term visits as short as one month; long term visits of six months or more;
international exchanges between scientists and students from the VIRGO project
in Europe, TAMA in Japan, ACIGA in Australia and LIGO; and a summer teachers
program at the Hanford and Livingston Observatories.&lt;br/&gt;
