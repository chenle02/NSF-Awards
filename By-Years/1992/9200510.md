The University of Iowa has a two year REU site in the Department of Chemical and
Biochemical Engineering. Students are matched with one of six faculty advisors
that conduct research in an area most closely related to their interests. The
individual projects are in research areas of expertise of the supervising REU
faculty to ensure direct scientific interaction between the REU students and
graduate students of each research group. A close student-faculty interaction
will be developed during daily discussions about the progress of the particular
project and other research related issues. In addition, weekly seminars on
research-related issues and many social events will be held. The summer's
program will conclude with an "in-house" research conference during which the
REU students will present their research results. It is expected that
significant guidance by the REU advisor will be necessary during the early
stages of the research. All of these programs and activities are planned to
achieve the goal of making underrepresented groups more aware of graduate
research opportunities in chemical and biochemical engineering to increase the
number of minorities and women pursuing advanced engineering degrees.
