The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to
significantly improve the prediction of drug response during preclinical
testing. This will result in a potentially higher rate of FDA approvals and
successful translation of drugs to the market. For example, fifteen million
people in the US are burdened with cancer, yet across all drug trials, oncology
drugs experience the lowest approval rate at 5.1%. A screening method that
improves the predictability of drug responses in both safety and efficacy during
preclinical drug testing would have a profound impact. Better drug screening
methods will lead to improvements in successful clinical trial outcomes, thereby
increasing the number of new drugs that are approved to enter the market.
Increasing the availability of new drugs will improve treatment options for
patients and increase survival rates.

This I-Corps project will introduce a new platform technology for preclinical
drug screening to evaluate multi-cellular and multi-system responses. The
technology represents a significant advancement to the field of tissue
engineered models for drug screening by incorporating multiple tissue-systems
into a single assay that provides physiologically relevant readouts for reliable
drug response prediction. The model integrates vascular function across multiple
physiological systems; multi-system readouts are important for evaluating the
effects of drugs on a tissue as an integrated whole. The technology has been
initially demonstrated for preclinical drug screening through the application of
an anti-cancer drug that prevents the growth of blood vessels.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
