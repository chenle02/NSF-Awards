*** 9454357 Weissglass, Julian Equity in Mathematics Education Leadership
Institute This is a four-year project to disseminate effective strategies to
accelerate progress in achieving equity in mathematics education. Two target
audiences are a national cadre of 144 professional developers and a California
cadre of teacher leaders. Each group will be involved in 24 days of workshops
over two years with expectations to use these strategies in their own settings
between workshop sessions. National participants will be recruited in teams from
existing and forthcoming mathematics education projects. The project will
provide on-going support for professional developers through electronic
communications and a newsletter. The project request is $ 3,099,940 with cost-
sharing as $ 809,212 or 26%. ***
