Recent theoretical and experimental studies indicated that over a wide range of
altitudes and for periods from a few minutes to several hours a significant
portion of the waves activity observed in the upper atmosphere/thermosphere is
due to acoustic gravity waves radiated by infragravity waves generated in the
ocean. Studying this impressive gravity wave activity over the Antarctic, where
proximity of the Ross Ice Shelf makes it very special, is the goal of this
project. The ocean's infragravity waves can excite the fundamental mode and low-
order oscillations of the Ross Ice Shelf at its resonance frequencies, thus
creating standing wave structures throughout the entire atmosphere. It is likely
that this effect was recently detected using LIDAR observations at McMurdo. This
project will support the training and education of a graduate
student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow scientists to study the wave
coupling of the Southern Ocean (via the Ross Ice Shelf) to the upper
atmosphere/thermosphere. This study will involve theoretical assessment of the
coupling phenomena and comparing theory with data collected by a unique
combination of instruments deployed in the Ross Ice Shelf area: the NSF-
supported network of seismographs and microbarometers on the Ross Ice Shelf, the
infrasound station near McMurdo, and the Dynasonde recently installed at the
Korean Antarctic Station Jang Bogo.
