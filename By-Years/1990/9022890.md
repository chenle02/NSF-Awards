This project is an investigation into the circulation of the deep basins of the
Arctic Ocean using chemical tracers supported by closely spaced hydrographic
sections. Oceanic tracers are extremely useful in assessing how the large- scale
circulation maintains the hydrographic structure and the arctic sea ice cover,
and in estimating the exchange of water between the Arctic Ocean and its
marginal seas. This project will collect, measure, and evaluate the tritium,
helium isotopes, oxygen-18, and carbon-14 concentration in sea water on
transects in the European Basin as part of the International Arctic Ocean
Expedition 1991, a three-ship expedition. Small volume sampling will be carried
out on the Swedish icebreaker ODEN, while large-volume sampling will be done
from the German research ship POLARSTERN. The proposed combination of tracers
will allow the establishing of renewal time scales for both deep and shallow
water masses. Additionally, the pattern of tracers in deep basins will give
indications of the origin of these deep water masses and the processes by which
they were formed.
