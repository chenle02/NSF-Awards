This research will produce silicon drift photodiodes, which are a derivative of
devices which are at present being developed for applications in other
disciplines (high energy physics), while optimizing their quantum efficiency at
blue-green (400 to 500 nm) wavelengths. This will be done by preforming an
"optimized" series of p+ diffusions to the front (light- sensitive) surface of
the device. Fabrication of these devices will be performed at the Massachusetts
Microelectronic Center, and testing will be done at RMD and the University of
Lowell. These silicon drift photodiodes can be made with very low noise and it
has been suggested that these devices may be quite useful as scintillation
photodectors.
