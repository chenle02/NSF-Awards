This project examines the legitimation of an institutionalized but contested
practice. The methods used by its proponents to defend the practice, the content
of their defense, and how this is covered by media are analyzed. This study
advances understanding of the strategies and techniques used to influence public
opinion and policy outcomes in an environment in which both the amount and
complexity of information are rapidly increasing. Findings from this study will
be valuable to society by increasing public knowledge of democratic decision-
making in an area that has both fiscal consequences and consequences for social
opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qualitative data are drawn from public
documents and narratives from 1995 to 2018 of three groups with diverse
interests, and from interviews with members of these groups. These data are
analyzed using the theoretical concept of frames. Messages derived from the
public documents of the three groups are compared to media coverage of them.
Triangulation among data sources is employed to reduce bias. This study enhances
understanding of legitimation processes by focusing on the legitimation of
established but contested and unstable social
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
