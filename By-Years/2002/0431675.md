This project increases the number of STEM graduates by utilizing and expanding
the institution's proven recruiting and retention strategies. Over the course of
the project 4000+ high school students will be exposed to STEM careers through
high school design competitions, on and off-site visits, faculty mentoring,
Technology Days, Engineering Days, summer engineering camps, and through one-on-
one follow-up. Once recruited, engineering students enter a program that
provides them with an environment conducive to success. Each student has a
personal "academic coach" who meets with him or her weekly, maintains a weekly
dialogue, and actively tracks progress. Students are exposed to design early and
often. Student activities include weekly social events with their cohort and
visits at up to 7 regional universities per year. The project will produce
approximately 500 new baccalaureate STEM graduates over the course of the grant
period.
