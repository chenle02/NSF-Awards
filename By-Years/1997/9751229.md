This project focuses on equipment being used to set up advanced undergraduate
laser experiments to be integrated into a preexisting senior physics laboratory
and research program. The project addresses the need of the department to
provide senior-level students with a solid background in lasers in a hands-on
laboratory setting. A two track sequence of coordinated experiments, of
increasing degrees of difficulty, is being created to familiarize senior-level
students in physics with advanced laser technology and applications. Well tested
laser experiments are being integrated into an innovative sequence that enhances
student learning. These experiments are providing an in-depth experience with
lasers, and giving advanced students the confidence and knowledge to develop
research projects using lasers. The first track of experiments examines the
properties of infrared laser diodes and uses them to perform two advanced
spectroscopy experiments. The second track of experiments concentrates on the
properties and applications of tunable-dye lasers and includes six different
experiments of increasing degrees of sophistication. *
