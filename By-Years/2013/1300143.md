The objective of this award is to develop a low-cost silicon-based microsystem
technology for real-time monitoring of concentration and size distribution of
airborne micro/nano-particles as well as limited composition analysis on such.
The envisioned outcome is a new microsystem technology for highly integrated
particulate monitoring systems. Such microsystems can be the size of a pen or
even smaller and are implemented by assembling a number of batch fabricated
silicon components within a small package. The system can sample the surrounding
air, separate airborne particles based on their size, measure the individual
and/or cumulative mass of particles in each size range, and finally provide
information on the water and organic content of the collected particulate matter
in each size range. Particle size segregation is performed using micro-orifice
cascade impactors while arrays of micro/nanoscale resonating mass balances
perform the real time mass measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon successful
development and commercialization, this technology could revolutionize the
airborne particulate monitoring industry by enabling real time monitoring of
nanoscale airborne particles down to a few nanometers size range using low cost,
light weight instruments. Potential applications can be divided into three main
categories: 1. Controlled environment/cleanroom monitoring for pharmaceutical
and semiconductor industry; 2. Industrial hygiene and particulate exposure
monitoring in mines, construction sites, and nanomaterial processing plants; 3.
Environmental research and air pollution monitoring. For example, every worker
in a cleanroom facility or high particulate processing plant could carry one of
the envisioned monitoring instruments for better quality control or health
hazard management. Monitoring of air pollution in large metropolitan areas is
another area that could be highly impacted by this technology.
