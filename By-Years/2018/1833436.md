The scientists identify an important issue for a world of devices all
communicating wirelessly: "How to identify malfunctioning devices or those not
fairly sharing the spectrum with others?" The scientists explore scenarios for
leveraging local, crowd-sourced mobile devices to detect and identify
unauthorized transmitters. The goal of this technique is to reduce the cost of
enforcement of network rules by adding the capability of some smart phones to
sense the radio spectrum use and report back to a central
database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a Crowd-based Spectrum
ENforcement System (CSENS), which takes a data-driven approach to spectrum
enforcement. Specifically, the PIs propose to conduct 3 tasks: (i) real-time on-
demand spectrum monitoring, which enables real-time responses to spectrum
measurement tasks; (ii) utilizing physical layer features to embed cryptographic
spectrum permits into transmissions, which enables reliably distinguish between
authorized and unauthorized spectrum users; (iii) using a library of known
signatures for network applications, unauthorized transmitters can be uniquely
identified.
