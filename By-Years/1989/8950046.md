Biotechnology, based on recombinant DNA technology, microbiology, biochemistry,
cell biology and immunology, has achieved major advances over the past fifteen
years. This project will run a workshop in biotechnology for faculty from two-
and four-year colleges. The workshop plan is based on a model (used earlier for
high school teachers), developed at Georgetown and also used at Canisius
College, the University of San Francisco, and Seattle University. The workshop
will incorporate lectures on the theoretical background and new knowledge in
molecular biology, emphasizing gene cloning, immunology, and biochemistry.
Laboratory experiments will cover nucleic acid extractions, electrophoresis,
restriction endonuclease, DNA analysis, mapping, and gene sequencing.
