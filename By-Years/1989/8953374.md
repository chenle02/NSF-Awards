The Colorado Alliance for Science, a partnership of business &amp; industry,
schools, and colleges and universities, will operate a collection of activities
to bring the skill and knowledge of industry scientists, engineers, and other
technically educated people into partnership with the expertise of teachers to
improve science, mathematics, and technology education in numerous locations.
Administration of the program will be centered in Metropolitan State College in
Denver, but project activities will be carried out in numerous school districts
throughout the state, particularly those in rural or inner city locations.
Through the SUMMER FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM teachers will work on projects in industry
which can produce publishable result and which may be suitable for recognition
by college graduate credits. In the VISITING SCIENTIST PROGRAM teachers and
visiting scientists will be paired to form two-person teaching teams to bring
industrial applications of science into the classroom of the teacher. The
RETIRED EDUCATORS, SCIENTISTS, AND ENGINEERS TASK TEAM (RESETT) will recruit,
train, and place technically knowledgeable retirees who as volunteers can help
teachers. MANAGEMENT WORKSHOPS will bring industry people into school workshops
and teachers and school administrators into industry workshops to promote cross-
fertilization of management skills across the industry/education interface. Cost
sharing by the partners will total 199% of the National Science Foundation
funding.
