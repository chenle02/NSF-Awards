This project is to conduct an international conference in Chicago in January
1986 on the subject of tall buildings and the urban habitat. The objective of
the conference is to discuss the new developments and concepts in the design of
buildings and their influence on the urban environment. Participants will be
drawn from many disciplines, such as: planners, architects, engineers,
designers, and construction managers who are the leaders in their field and in
their country. The proceedings will be of great benefit to all the professions
involved in the construction of buildings.
