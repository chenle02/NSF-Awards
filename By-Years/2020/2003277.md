The Internet of Things (IoT) generates large amounts of data that machine
learning algorithms today process in the cloud. The heterogeneity of the data
types and devices, along with limited computing and communication capabilities
of IoT devices, poses a significant challenge to real-time training and learning
with classical machine learning algorithms. This project instead proposes to use
Hyperdimensional (HD) computing for distributed machine learning. HD computing
is a brain-inspired machine learning paradigm that transforms data into
knowledge at very low cost, while being extremely robust to errors. When
completed, this project has the potential to change the way machine learning is
done today â€“ instead of depending on the cloud, IoT systems will be able to make
quality decisions on the spot, in real time, regardless of connectivity, with
long battery lifetime. This will be made possible by designing: i) novel HD
encoding schemes to represent various data in IoT applications including
numerical feature vectors, time-series data, and images, ii) a novel distributed
learning framework for IoT networks by incorporating active learning to
considerably reduce communication overhead and learning costs, and iii) a
reliable learning solution based on the error-tolerant characteristic of HD
computing. The ideas developed in this project will be tested on both UCSD and
SDSU using a fully instrumented testbed for human activity
recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
