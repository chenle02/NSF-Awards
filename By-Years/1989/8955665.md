The University of New Hampshire will initiate a three-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in Marine Science and Computer Science for 25 students entering
grade 10 from New Hampshire and southern Maine who have completed Algebra I and
a ninth-grade science course with a grade of least "B". A one-day version of the
summer program will be conducted for seventy- five additional program
applicants, providing in-depth integrated instruction in marine science,
probability and statistics, and computer applications, as well as a lecture
series on planning for scientific careers, science ethics, and topics from other
science, engineering, and mathematical areas. Field work is conducted in salt
marshes, mud flats, and tidal habitats. Students perform work on computers and
prepare and present scientific reports.
