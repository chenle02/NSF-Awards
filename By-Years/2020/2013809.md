The Lorentz Center workshop on Reconstituting Biology will be held in Leiden,
The Netherlands at the end of June and early July 2020. The workshop, capped at
55 participants, focuses on discussing the current state-of-the-art and
challenges in research centering on engineering minimal synthetic cells.
Building upon recent consortiums formed in Germany and The Netherlands and large
research teams formed in the US, the workshop will feature leaders working in
this space from Europe and the US. The workshop is mostly discussion-based in
small groups and will include trainees from the invited groups and some selected
junior faculty. The workshop provides unique opportunities for the trainees and
junior faculty to network with expert researchers in the field, potentially
leading to new research ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The workshop will focus on
four questions/goals: 1) Will we ever be able to reconstitute anything life-
like? 2) Define the role of human-designed elements or building blocks play in
building synthetic minimal cells. 3) What are currently the main limitations for
reconstituting cellular functionalities from the bottom up and how do we
overcome them? 4) Define approaches/practices to set up research community that
shares building blocks, techniques, and protocols to ensure findings are
reproducible across many labs. The workshop discussion will be collected by the
workshop co-chairs along with input from the participants, with an aim to
publish it as a perspective article to reach a large community. This award was
co-funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster and the Systems and
Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
