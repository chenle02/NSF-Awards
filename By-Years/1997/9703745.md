ECS-9703745 Sandberg The general problem of understanding nonlinear mappings
from one function space into another is fundamental to a wide range of
engineering system studies. The proposed work aims to build a comprehensive
understanding of the approximation capabilities, usability and effectiveness of
nonlinear networks intended for use in settings involving compensation,
adaptivity, identification and signal processing. It is founded on recent
results obtained by the proposer showing that very large classes of continuous
functionals, shift-invariant maps, and shift-varying maps can be uniformly
approximated by certain conceptually simple nonlinear structures. The project
will address key issues concerning the advantages, limitations, design and use
of such structures. These include the determination of suitable network
structures, network size, connectivity patterns and form of nonlinearity for
different problem classes, effectiveness of alternate identification algorithms
and their convergence rates, and techniques for constructive/destructive network
growth. The proposed work will emphasize the development of an analytical basis
for design, and will raise the understanding of the capabilities and usability
of these nonlinear structures to a level comparable to that achieved at present
for (static) multilayered feedforward networks. Important examples of systems to
which our results will apply can be drawn from many fields.
