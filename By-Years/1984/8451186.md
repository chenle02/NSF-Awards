This project addresses two important topics in the Dynamic Systems and Control
Program. The first research activity is in nonlinear dynamic systems and
includes studies of chaotic systems and nonlinear system identification. The
second research activity continues work on nonlinear effects in rotor systems.
This project activity also includes establishing a dynamic analysis laboratory
to complement the analytical research in nonlinear dynamics.
