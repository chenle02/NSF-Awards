This research has two major components: design theory and human factors. In
design theory, work will be pursued in the investigation of formal mathematical
structures such as graphs and lattices. In human factors, the interface (e.g.,
task organization, information presentation and computer capabilities) between
the designer and the machine will be examined. A computer system that will
assist a designer with the conceptual stages of the design process should be the
result of this research.
