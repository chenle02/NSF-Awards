9414648 Phillips This research centers around three objectives. First, the
traditional Peierls model of dislocation mobility is reassessed in light of
atomistic calculations. Secondly, a new experimental technique for measuring
directly the interplanar shear potential is examined from the point of view of
atomistic calculations of the interplanar potential. Finally a new scheme for
bringing together atomistic simulation and continuum methods is explored. This
will allow for the use of finite-element calculations outside of their usual
province of applicability in order to study problems of dislocation mobility.
The unifying theme of the research is the examination of factors governing the
structure and mobility of single dislocations in a way that allows the results
to be tied directly to experimentally accessible quantities, i.e., bring
together atomistic and continuum approaches for the treatment of dislocation
structure and dynamics. ***
