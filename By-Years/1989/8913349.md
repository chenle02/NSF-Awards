This project will investigate positional behaviors (posture and locomotion)
among a group of poorly known platyrrhine primates, the tribe Pitheciini.
Similarities and differences in positional behaviors will be considered,
especially in relation to ecological variables such as the location of food
resources. Two unique aspects of this study are that representatives of all
three taxa (Pithecia, Chiropotes, and Cacajao) will be observed in their natural
habitats and that seasonal differences will be investigated. A third important
aspect of the study is the correlation of these positional behaviors with
selected morphological parameters in the postcranium. The data generated in this
study will provide the basis on which to interpret the fossil evidence of the
ancestors of these species, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this
group of primates, and to draw inferences on the adaptive pressures which may
have selected for their morphological features. Principles drawn from this study
may then be important in the interpretation of the morphology of other primate
groups.
