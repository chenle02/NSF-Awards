The University at Buffalo, State University of New York will establish an
Earthquake Engineering Research Center. The goal of the Center is to conduct
research to substantially improve state- of-the-art basic knowledge, improve the
engineering practice, and improve implementation of earthquake hazard mitigation
practices in order to minimize the loss of property and human lives and the
disruption of all facets of human activities resulting from severe earthquakes.
The major research thrusts are a coordinated and integrated approach to
earthquake engineering research centered on structural system and lifeline
systems; and an emphasis on earthquake hazard mitigation in the area of the
United STates east of the rocky Mountains. Research activities will be
concentrated on ground motions, soil dynamics, system response and
unserviceability, reliability and risk assessment, laboratory and field
experiments, innovative computing and expert systems, codified design related
issues, and social and educational issues. The two operational divisions of the
Center are the Research Division and the Education and Technology Transfer
Division. Other institutions that will participate in the research activities
are the City College of New York, Columbia University, Cornell University,
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Lehigh University, Princeton University,
and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
