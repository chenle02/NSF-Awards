The research in this project is concerned with the theory of matrices and
operators. The problems under consideration include matrix completion problems;
determinantal inequalities for positive definite matrices; algebraic Riccati
equations; interpolation for rational matrix functions; qualitative matrix
theory; spectral assignment in infinite dimensions; and interpolation of strong
forms of nonsingularity. A matrix is a rectangular array of objects. Given two
matrices there is a notion of how to add them and how to multiply them. This
rather general setting turns out to be very useful in describing situations
which arise in many areas of science. This project is concerned with the theory
of matrices.
