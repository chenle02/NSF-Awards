Occidental College, located in the northeastern sector of Los Angeles, is a
private college of the liberal arts and sciences. The College has received
national recognition for sustaining its traditional commitment to high
achievement while embracing the changes necessary to serve an increasingly
diverse community. This is evident by its science programs that highly emphasize
both research and student development. Occidental has recognized the need to
integrate scientific research and education programs, and has made a commitment
to provide the programs in Physics, Geology, and Environmental Sciences with new
laboratories. Active research programs include the following areas: plasma
physics, low temperature physics, atomic physics, laser physics, structural
geology, mineralogy, paleomagnetism, paleontology, geochemistry, and
environmental analysis. Currently these programs are housed in Fowler Hall, a
structure that was built in 1931. The building's original utilities are
inadequate to support the research programs of 10 faculty members and 44
students. The facility does not comply with ADA regulations and is in need of
seismic upgrading. However, despite poor facilities, the department is able to
maintain a high level of productivity. As the third part of a four phase
program, funding from the National Science Foundation will be used to replace
laboratories in Fowler Hall. All existing conditions impeding research will be
corrected with the construction of the new building. Upon completion, this
project will increase student participation in the research activities of their
professors earlier in their undergraduate careers. The new structure will
provide equipment and facilities for students and faculty to do more varied and
more extensive experimentation in all three disciplines. Thus faculty research
will be expanded, research training and education will be improved, and students
will be better prepared for professional and civic leadership.
