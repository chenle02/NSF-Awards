ABSTRACT This project is a workshop and is a contribution to the Arctic System
Science Program. It will be held at the Byrd Polar Research Center where key
scientific questions related to processes and environmental change in the
Russian Arctic continental shelves and adjacent lowlands will be defined. A
total of 35 participants, covering a range of disciplines in the bio-, geo- and
social sciences will be invited to formulate scientific priorities. This
workshop will focus on defining interdisciplinary and circumarctic research
themes that would elucidate land/shelf interactions. A broad topical, temporal
and spatial framework for the workshop is proposed to attract a wide group of
scientists and identify the most compelling research ideas. The direction and
mechanisms of climate change cannot be adequately addressed without a better
understanding of processes and environments of the shelf seas of the Russian
Arctic and the adjacent lowlands. Epicontinental shelf seas bounded by the
Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans comprise 25% of the shelf area of oceans and
modulate key climatic parameters such as the exchange of oceanic heat,
atmospheric gases, sea-ice and fresh water input. Large uncertainties remain on
the cause, magnitude and timing of past glaciations in Siberia and concomitant
changes in sea- ice, vegetation, fluvial discharge and animal migrations. Many
present day issues relating to land/Arctic Ocean interactions also need to be
evaluated. This is a "ground up" effort to assess the American scientific
community's sense of priorities for research in the Russian Arctic. The workshop
is an important step for the integration of North American scholarship with that
of Russian colleagues who have decades of experience on these problems. The
consensus of research priorities will provide a conceptual nucleus for proposing
a Russian Arctic Science dimension for ARCSS.
