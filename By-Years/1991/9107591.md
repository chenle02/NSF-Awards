This project addresses the problem of scheduling large job shops characterized
by dynamic job arrivals, machine failures, due- date related performance
measures and different types of workcenters. In spite of their practical
importance, the difficulty of these problems has caused them to remain largely
unstudied to date. However, with the exploitation of special problem structures
present in industrial contexts provides a promising approach. An event
classification approach to the dynamic aspects of the problem is used. It is
combined with an approximation methodology that can obtain near-optimal
schedules for a static problem. Events affecting system state are monitored and
those needing immediate attention (exceptions) are identified. In the absence of
exceptions, schedules are generated periodically and implemented on a rolling
horizon basis. If an exception occurs, the system is rescheduled immediately. An
approximation methodology is proposed to generate the schedules at the various
rescheduling points. This requires the development of efficient scheduling
procedures for different types of workcenters, leading to the formulation of a
number of scheduling problems not extensively examined to date. The use of a
specific industrial setting, that of semiconductor testing operations, as a
research vehicle will enable the evaluation of the proposed research from a
practical standpoint.
