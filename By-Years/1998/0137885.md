The objective of the 9 th International Conference on Microbial Genomes is to
provide a consistent forum for investigators from different fields to interact
with each other and to update the recent advances in microbial genomics. This
conference will focus on (1) defining gene functions and regulatory networks
using integrative, multidisciplinary approaches and (2) exploring genome
sequence information to understand various biological processes. This conference
will identify research gaps, problems, challenges, trends, and directions in
microbial genomics. Attendees will gain an extensive appreciation of the current
status and development in microbial genomics, especially functional genomics.
Attendees will also gain insight into how questions in their own fields can be
addressed by taking advantage of the massive genomic information already
available. In addition, to train the next generation of genomic experts, this
conference will establish fellowship awards to support graduate students,
postdocs, and young faculty attending this conference.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will consist of seven sessions: (1)
Microbial genome diversity, evolution and microbial genome sequencing; (2)
Bioinformatics and microarray-based genomic technologies; (3) Proteomics,
cellular pathways and regulatory networks; (4) Functional genomics of
bioremediation and carbon sequestration; (5) Functional genomics of microbial
pathogens; (6) Functional genomics of model microorganisms, extremophiles and
biofilms; and (7) Applied functional genomics. This conference will be held in
Gatlinburg, TN, in October, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;
