Geographic Information Systems (GIS) training is increasingly essential to any
strong environmental/resource undergraduate degree. This project acquires the
needed equipment to allow: (1) adding ARC/INFO training to several existing
classes; (2) implementing new classes in spatial data; (3) having ARC/INFO
available to students doing the required undergraduate research thesis; and (4)
sharing experiences with the broader undergraduate education community. Six
Pentium-based PCs and a large-format plotter are being added to the existing
workstation and 6-seat license for ARC/INFO. This program can serve as a model
for combining high-level GIS instruction and research with the natural resource
field at the undergraduate level, which is a relatively new endeavor.
