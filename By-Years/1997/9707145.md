9707145 Naylor Galeomorph sharks are the most taxonomically-diverse and dominant
group of living sharks, and include many of the large and well known species
such as the great white, tiger, hammerhead, and whale sharks. The galeomorphs
have an extensive fossil record that extends to the Jurassic, demonstrating that
sharks represent an early offshoot in the vertebrate genealogical tree. In this
research, Gavin Naylor of Iowa State University will employ DNA sequences
acquired from both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to study phylogenetic
relationships among well over 100 species of sharks, including representatives
of seven different orders. Naylor will test whether each of the four orders of
galeomorph sharks were derived from a common ancestor, and also will examine
relationships among species in several lineages within each galeomorph order.
The phylogenetic hypothesis will be used (i) in conjunction with the rich
galeomorph fossil record to assess the time or origin of many morphological
adaptations unique to sharks, and (ii) as a framework for interpreting the rich,
existing database on shark parasite diversity. Naylor also will investigate the
extent to which DNA sequence form different genes and from different regions of
the same gene converge on the same genealogical tree. This analysis will provide
information as to how DNA changes over time and how estimation of genealogical
trees from DNA sequence data can be improved.
