Kuo 9500365 This REG award is made for the acquisition of multiple- channel real
time digital signal processing facilities to support several research projects
in engineering. Specifically, these projects include low-frequency active noise
control in large-size enclosures, high frequency active noise control in small-
and medium-size enclosures, active noise control in free space, acoustic echo
cancellation system for large-scale teleconferencing, integrating automotive
signal processing, communication, and audio systems, active noise and vibration
equalization, and secondary path modeling techniques for active noise structural
acoustic control. The equipment is crucial to support real-live experiments in
order to augment the theoretical, conceptual and analytical research on active
noise and vibration control and acoustic signal processing.***
