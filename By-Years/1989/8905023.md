An organism's DNA is constantly subject to damage from various agents in the
environment (such as chemicals and ultraviolet radiation) as well as from
derivatives of oxygen generated during its cells' own respiration. All species
of organisms, from the most primitive to the most complex, synthesize a number
of different enzymes whose function is to repair different types of DNA damage.
This is a proposal to investigate the organization of the genes encoding DNA
repair enzymes in a group of interrelated species of fishes. This work should
shed light on how these functions evolved among the vertebrates, a topic about
which we know little. The evolutionary knowledge thus gained could help to
elucidate some of the complex and only partially understood relationships among
different DNA repair functions in mammals, including humans.
