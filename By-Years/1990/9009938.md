In this ROW/CAA (Research Opportunities for Women/ Career Advancement Award)
project, Dr. Linda Strausbaugh at the University of Connecticut proposes to
study the evolution of the histone gene family in the Drosophila willistoni
species complex. The histones are a class of proteins universal in living
organisms which, because of their functional importance in chromosomes, have
been highly conserved by evolution. Strausbaugh has found evidence of histone
gene variation among closely related species of the D. willistoni complex and
proposes a series of experiments to test theories about the evolution of histone
genes. Dr. Strausbaugh is a molecular geneticist attempting to carry her
research into the realm of evolutionary biology. Under the ROW/CAA program she
will continue her work initiated while on sabbatical leave at Yale University
during the 1989-90 academic year; specifically, she will "re-tool" her
laboratory for studies in molecular evolution, initiate several new projects and
complete the projects initiated at Yale.
