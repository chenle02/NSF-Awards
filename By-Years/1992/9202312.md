The proposed research is concerned with the study of ferroelectric liquid
crystals (FLC). A program of research is proposed that includes FLC microscopic
modeling, chemical synthesis, and material evaluation. The proposed studies are
directed toward understanding how molecules self organize in liquid crystal
phases, and toward developing new FLCs for electro-optic and nonlinear optic
applications. These studies are significant because there are opportunities to
advance the basic physics and material design of liquid crystals, and to develop
new liquid crystal materials for electro-optic and nonlinear optic applications.
This Materials Synthesis and Processing proposal has been funded jointly by the
Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division.
