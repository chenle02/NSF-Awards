The investigators will develop, analyze, implement and distribute robust,
efficient and accurate new algorithms for evolving complex interfaces determined
by general partial differential systems. Two interacting modular components are
combined: general interface motion under a given velocity, and the problem-
specific velocity of a given moving interface. The first component involves
semi-Lagrangian contouring, with fast stable tools for geometric operations such
as contouring, distancing and intersection. Efficient algorithms convert between
explicit and implicit interface representations with fast computational
geometry, robust global topology resolution, and high-order Bezier
representations, to track complex surfaces evolving under arbitrary dynamics and
topology. The second component requires high-accuracy solution of partial
differential systems for material fields, stresses and concentrations, which
determine the velocity of the interface. Fast accurate solvers for algebraically
complete first-order formulations split Green functions into singular and global
terms, and achieve optimal efficiency for elliptic/parabolic systems with
complex interfaces. The interface motion and velocity evaluation components
connect through new implicit time-stepping schemes which handle sensitive
interface velocities stably. The Frechet derivatives incurred in the solution of
implicit schemes are systematically decomposed into universal components, and
computed by efficiently reusable computational modules.

Mathematical models of complex evolving material interfaces dominate
technological processes ranging from semiconductor production to surgery
planning, from computer animation to computer-controlled machine tooling.
Efficient general computational techniques are crucial in designing better
models. The investigators are developing efficient new modular computational
tools for simulating technological processes in robust user-friendly ways. This
highly interdisciplinary enterprise combines mathematics and computer science to
benefit scientific endeavors ranging from cartography to crystallography. The
research objectives intertwine with an interdisciplinary educational program,
training future scientists and engineers through web-enabled courses,
math/science/engineering seminars and individual student research mentoring.
