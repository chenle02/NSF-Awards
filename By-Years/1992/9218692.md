This award provides one-half the funding required for the acquisition of an
X-ray diffractometer system to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geology at the George Washington University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed. The new X-ray diffractometer will replace
an obsolete twenty- year old unit. The characterization of materials by X-ray
diffraction is a routine requirement in the research projects and teaching
curricula of the departments of Geology, Chemistry and Forensic Sciences, as
well as the School of Civil, Mechanical and Environmental Engineering and the
Materials Sciences Section at George Washington University. The X-ray
diffractometer will also be accessible to regional users including undergraduate
students from the University of the District of Columbia and research groups
from the Smithsonian Institution.
