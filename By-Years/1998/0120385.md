Abstract&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0120385&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obtaining a suitable tracer
that can estimate lateral mixing of shelf waters into the open ocean or can
determine the intensity of upwelling in response to ENSO forcing has been
hindered by (1) the timescale of these processes (decadal), (2) the fact that
simple mixing of radioisotopes with older water masses can result in an aging
artifact, and (3) the effects of multiple endmembers. Based on some preliminary
results, a PI from the University of South Carolina-Columbia has demonstrated
that the activity ratio of 228Ra/227Ac shows great promise as a tracer of
lateral mixing processes in the ocean. Because this proposed application is so
novel, the PI will use SGER funds to improve the analytical technique for
determining these radionuclides and the parent isotopes, as well as carry out
additional field tests to verify the utility of this approach. The PI also plans
to develop an in-line cartridge system that can be installed on ships of
opportunity thereby increasing the spatial distribution of ex228Ra/ex227Ac
activity ratios of surface waters to determine the stability of lateral mixing
rates on timescales of years to decades. &lt;br/&gt;
