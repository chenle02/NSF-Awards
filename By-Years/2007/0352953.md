AST-0352953/Doeleman, Northeast Radio Obs Corp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award
will support the innovation of technical and instrumental underpinnings of very
wide bandwidth, ultra high sensitivity Very Long Baseline Interferometry. The
basis of the technical improvements will be the acquisition of high data rate
recording devices that can be ported to the optimal combination of telescopes
for observations of particular phenomena. Included in the scientific targets of
the program are high-resolution observations of the Sagittarius A* source (the
center of the Milky Way galaxy); the starburst regions of infrared galaxies; and
faint radio emissions from Brown Dwarf stars. The program includes extensive
collaborations with worldwide partners, and the involvement of students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;
