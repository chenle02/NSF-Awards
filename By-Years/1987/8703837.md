This project will focus on mathematical research in the area of approximation
theory. The work is distinguished from more traditional investigations on
functional approximation and special functions in that the complexity or speed
of computability is replaced by degree in the competition for best
approximation. Efforts will be made to determine a hierarchy of function classes
for which the measure of computability is much lower than that predicted by
classical estimates. Evidence produce in specific instances suggests that such a
classification is possible. In addition to refining techniques and algorithms in
approximation theory, applications are expected to be made in software and
computational efficiency, where an emphasis on minimal complexity will be
stressed.
