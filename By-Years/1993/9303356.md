9303356 Jacobson The purpose of the proposed research is to study robust system
identification methods. Robust system identification algorithms produce models
that are appropriate for use in robust design. In particular, the resulting
models are accompanied by a quantification of the identification error which
allows a subsequent design to proceed against a family of possible systems. The
combination of the envisioned robust system identification methods from this
research program with robust design procedures from control and communication
theory will enable important technologies to operate at higher performance and
reliability than they currently are able to attain. The research issues that
will be addressed in this program are the continued development of existing
robust system identification methods (in particular, to address practical
implementation issues), the extension of robust system identification methods to
classes of system models not previously addressed (in particular, to time
varying and finite time duration processes) and the application of the system
identification algorithms developed to important technological areas. The
application of the system identification algorithms developed to important
technological areas. The relevant application studies that are part of the
proposed research program are robust detection techniques involving underwater
acoustics and high performance control of a flexible structure. ***
