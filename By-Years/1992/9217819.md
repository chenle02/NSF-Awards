This award supports a two-year cooperative research project between Professor
John Hildebrand, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California,
San Diego, and Professor Junzo Kasahara, Earthquake Research Institute,
University of Tokyo. The project involves placing seismic stations in island
sites along the Mariana, Yap and Palau Trench regions of the western Pacific, in
coordination with a program for long-term instrumenting abandoned
telecommunications cables in the western Pacific with seismic and magnetic
sensors. A graduate student from UC San Diego will conduct research at the
University of Tokyo as part of this project. The oceanic deep-sea trenches of
the western Pacific are the result of large-scale subduction of oceanic crust in
this region. Associated with subduction is the generation of high levels of
seismicity along dipping Benioff zones on the landward side of the oceanic
trenches. The large magnitude earthquakes generated at western Pacific
subduction zones has been extensively studies using the Global Seismic Network,
providing a detailed mapping of the configuration and characteristics of the
seismogenic zone. Smaller magnitude earthquakes require regional seismic
networks for study. This has particularly been accomplished on the Japanese
Islands where an exensive regional netowrk of seismic stations are positioned
above the seismogenic zone. Other subduction zone regions of the western Pacific
have fewer island sites available for placement of seismic stations, yet these
areas are important to gain a complete picture of the seismicity and tectonic
behavior of the western Pacific.
