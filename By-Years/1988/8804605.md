Case Western Reserve is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduate (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 9 students recruited from Case
Western and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in the
following areas: o Ion cyclotron resonance and Fourier Transform mass
spectrometry o Organic synthesis o Synthetic inorganic chemistry o Synthetic
organometallic chemistry o Magnetic resonance imaging and cryogenic GC/FTIR o
Synthetic polymer chemistry o Bio-inorganic chemistry
