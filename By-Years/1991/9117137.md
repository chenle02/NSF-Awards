This multi-agency award will continue and extend the services provided by
BIOSCI, and electronic newsgroup network which serves as a vehicle for
communications between members of the international biological sciences
community. In addition to forums for communications in specialized scientific
fields, these services include newsgroups for experimental methods, scientific
meeting and other general announcements, and journal contents/abstracts.
Newsgroups dedicated to various aspects of the Genome Project are also in use.
Electronic newsgroups have the potential to revolutionize communications among
scientists, and their use will be actively promoted among the biological
community through demonstrations, training sessions, and assistance with
installation of news software. The newsgroups will be expanded. Archives of
bulletins will be maintained for retrieval by FTP and e-mail. A database of all
newsgroups dedicated to the biological sciences will be maintained along with a
directory of electronic mail addresses of biological scientists.
