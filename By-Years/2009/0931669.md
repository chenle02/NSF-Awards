This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The objective of this research is to scale up the capabilities of fully
autonomous vehicles so that they are capable of operating in mixed-traffic urban
environments. Such environments are realistic large-city driving situations
involving many other vehicles, mostly human-driven. The approach is to integrate
multidisciplinary advances in software, sensing and control, and modeling to
address current weaknesses in autonomous vehicle design.

With respect to intellectual merit, the research address significant
improvements to current methods and tools to enable a number of formal methods
to move from use in limited, controlled environments to use in more complex and
realistic environments. The theory, tools, and design methods that are
investigated have potential application for a broad class of cyber-physical
systems consisting of mobile entities operating in a semi-structured
environment.

With respect to broader impacts, this research has the potential to lead to
safer autonomous vehicles and to improve economic competitiveness, the nation's
transportation infrastructure, and energy efficiency. The richness of the domain
means that expected research contributions can apply not only to autonomous
vehicles but, also, to a variety of related cyber-physical systems such as
service robots in hospitals and rescue robots used after natural disasters. The
experimental research laboratory for the project is used for undergraduate and
graduate courses and supports new summer outreach projects for high-school
students. Research outcomes are integrated with undergraduate and graduate
courses on component-based software.
