This research project is a step towards better mathematical understanding of
some aspects of Mirror Symmetry. Mirror Symmetry predicts a natural
correspondence between the moduli of deformations of a singular Calabi-Yau
variety, on one hand, and the moduli of (Kahler structures on) resolutions of
the mirror dual Calabi-Yau variety, on the other hand. However, there are plenty
of examples of singular Calabi-Yau varieties which have either no deformations
or no resolutions at all, or both. In such cases, Mirrror Symmetry predicts the
existence of some sort of `noncommutative' substitutes for the nonexistent
commutative deformations, resp. resolutions, that recovers the above mentioned
duality between deformations and resolutions.

The goals of the proposal could be briefly formulated as follows.

1. Generalize the techniques based on the notion of Symplectic reflection
algebra introduced by P. Etingof and the PI during the last 5 years to other
classes of singular symplectic varieties.

2. Develop general machinery of noncommutative deformations of symplectic
resolutions analogous to the theory of Poisson deformations developed earlier by
the PI and D. Kaledin.

3. Begin development of the theory of Calabi-Yau algebras. These algebras should
replace symplectic reflection algebras in the case of not necessarily symplectic
Calabi-Yau orbifolds.

Noncommutative Geometry is a relatively new area of mathematics which arose in
early 1980-s at the junction of classical geometry and quantum theory. Classical
geometry which was created in its modern form in the 19-th century, is a
mathematical theory which is designed to describe precisely various phenomena of
Space and Time. It plays a fundamental role in the equations governing electric
and magnetic forces, and is even more fundamental for Einstein's Relativity
theory.

The discovery of the famous `Uncertainty Principle' had clearly demonstrated
that Classical geometry can not adequately describe all of the complexity of
Quantum theory. The latter is one of the most important achievements of
theoretical physics of the 20-th century, which lies at the foundation of this
century's technological revolution, including laser technology and computers. It
is a physical theory which allows to describe the behavior of very small
objects, like atoms and electrons. Noncommutative Geometry is a new kind of
geometry, that may also be called Quantum Geometry since it is designed to
provide the adequate geometry at very small distances. Development of
Noncommutative Geometry is thus absolutely fundamental for Quantum physics. The
present proposal seeks to further develop this theory and to explore its
interactions with other areas of mathematics and physics, including quite
unexpected connections to Probability theory.
