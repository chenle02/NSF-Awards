In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program the chemistry of two high-energy molecules, carbon suboxide and nitrous
oxide, will be investigated. Carbon suboxide will be used as a unique source of
the small carbon-rich molecules which are believed to serve as building blocks
for non-petrochemically derived carbon compounds in the Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis. Carbon suboxide will be used as a source of oxygen in the selective
oxidation of organic compounds under mild conditions. Carbon suboxide will be
used as a source of carbon fragments for the formation of metal complexes of
such species as carbide, ketenylidene and ketene. Suitable metal systems will be
sought for the activation of nitrous oxide toward oxygen transfer reactions to
organic moieties in both stoichiometric and catalytic fashions. Nitrous oxide
will be used also as a reagent for preparing interesting oxo-complexes under
mild, kinetically controlled conditions. Such reactions are expected to be very
clean, since the only by-product of nitrous oxide decomposition is dinitrogen.
