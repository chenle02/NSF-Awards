This project is continuing the successful S-STEM scholarship program at the
university that is increasing the number of students pursuing a computer science
major by offering substantial scholarship support. The program places special
emphasis on recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups such as women and
Hispanics, building on the infrastructure already in place at the university. It
also builds on the work of the Department of Computing Sciences that has
involved faculty members and students in international conferences, internships,
and exchanges. The project integrates the significant academic and financial
student support at the university with NSF support for outstanding, financially
needy students. It continues the professional development seminar for its
participants (and any other majors who want to participate), incorporates
aspects of Team Work in Several Time Zones (TWISTZ), and addresses the role and
power of computing in the global marketplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: The project integrates the professional development seminar with the
offering of sixteen $8000 NSF-funded scholarships per year to full-time
undergraduate computer science majors who have demonstrated financial need and
strong academic records. The seminar uses state-of-the-art programs and peer
effects to encourage all S-STEM scholars to develop good study habits, to learn
how to survey the ongoing advancement of computer science, and to develop
critical thinking skills. In addition to career counseling, scholars are being
encouraged to participate in funded undergraduate research projects whose
project teams are spread across time zones and address needs beyond the U. S.
borders. Of particular interest are projects associated with Ethicomp, the
international computing ethics community, and the virtual reality tours that the
department has created for the Vatican Museum. The university has been ranked by
US News and World Reports as the number one regional university in the North for
almost two decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is
developing a culture that can attract, nurture, and support underrepresented
students through its connection with the Multicultural Affairs Office at the
university. It includes vital cross-cultural aspects into the world view of
computing for students. Over the course of the project, about 20 undergraduates
are receiving financial and academic support to become strong computer science
graduates. Another 40 students participate in the enrichment seminar and
international experiences.
