A knot is a closed loop in three-dimensional space, a link is a union of several
such loops, possibly linked with each other. Besides the immediate mathematical
applications, knot theory has implications in physics of quantum systems and in
the study of chemical and biological properties of long knotted molecules. The
central questions in knot theory are the classification problem (Can a knot be
transformed to another knot without tearing its strands? Can it be untangled to
look like an ordinary circle?) and the study of the geometric properties of
knots or links. Both of these questions can be partially answered with the help
of a link invariant: a collection of numbers that does not change under
continuous stretching of a link. Two links are different if their invariants are
different. The project is focused on uncovering and studying the patterns and
symmetries of link invariants. The project will provide research training
opportunities for students and post-docs.

In more detail, the project is focused on Khovanov-Rozansky link homology which
generalizes the celebrated HOMFLY polynomial. To a link such a theory associates
a triply graded vector space which carries an action of many interesting
operators. The project will build upon and unify a variety of existing
operations (such as Rasmussen's differentials, tautological classes and Witt
algebra action), to study the commutation relations between these and to define
new ones. The action of such a large algebra is expected to unravel some
patterns and symmetries in link homology. Another motivation comes from
geometric models for link homology: these include sheaves on Hilbert schemes of
points on the plane, braid varieties, Hilbert schemes on singular curves and
affine Springer fibers. In many cases, geometric representation theory then
predicts an action of large algebras in homology, and the investigator will
translate these into explicit actions in link homology.
