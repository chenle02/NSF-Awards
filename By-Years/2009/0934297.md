This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UC Riverside Noyce Scholarship
Program focuses on the University's internal partnership among the College of
Natural and Agricultural Sciences, the Graduate School of Education and the
ALPHA Center for Academic Partnerships with the rapidly growing, low-performing
Moreno Valley Unified School District to prepare exceptional science and
mathematics undergraduate majors for secondary school teaching careers. Building
on the unique curricular and training infrastructure available at UCR,
professional development opportunities are being expanded and new services
initiated to create a continuum of teacher preparation and development resulting
in 43 prepared and motivated secondary mathematics and science teachers within
the partnership district. The program impacts 56 classrooms in six middle and
five high schools and supports 14 district mentor teachers and approximately
2,000 students per year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective recruitment strategies
are embedded into the selection process to attract undergraduates from
underserved populations, providing Noyce scholars pre-credential, credential and
induction research-based experiences designed to develop subject-matter mastery,
pedagogical expertise and leadership skills. Progress will be followed
longitudinally to determine the impact of the program on performance as a
teacher, commitment to serving the district, impact as a student role model,
longevity to the profession and ability to assume leadership. The broader
impacts of the program lie in the Noyce scholar teachers' influence to make
significant, durable change. By establishing a replicable model of a financial,
academic and mentoring pathway that develops mathematics and science teaching
professionals proactive in implementing change that will better prepare students
for success in the 21st century, the program has potential to positively
influence K-12 science and math education community.
