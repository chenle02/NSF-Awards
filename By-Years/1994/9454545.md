The Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC) Planning Project is
planning for a Center to be operated by the Maricopa County Community College
District, Phoenix, Arizona, in collaboration with other educational and
business/industry partners. The planning process involves representatives from
three educational levels-high school, community college, and university-and
industry partners who are stake holders in implementing new educational
approaches which prepare students for the high performance workplace. Planning
assumptions, based on an environmental scan, provide the framework for a
collaborative Steering Committee to develop the vision/mission and strategies
for MATEC. Faculty teams, with members from the various educational levels and
support from business/industry representatives, are developing the Operational
Plan. Emphasis is on approaches which integrate the teaching/learning of
academic concepts in science, mathematics, and technology with the development
of workplace competencies, including the skills/abilities necessary for
continuous learning/adaptation after entry into the workplace. The overall goal
is to implement MATEC which will serve as a national model and clearinghouse for
secondary/postsecondary advanced technology education.
