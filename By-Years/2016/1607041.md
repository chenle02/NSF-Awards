Fisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is
often played by the symmetries of the object - particularly when the object has
many symmetries. The proposed research projects investigate ways of
characterizing, describing and studying spaces with many symmetries in various
dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These questions often require
learning, adapting and applying ideas and techniques from many areas of
mathematics. This work has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from
differential equations (the use of wavefront sets to study fine analytic
properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical computer science (expander
graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding
problems).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of the proposed research is to
introduce and develop new analytic techniques in group theory and the study of
group actions. Major projects include: (a) studying quasi-isometries using a new
notion of coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work with Eskin and
Whyte) and newer ideas involving non-standard analysis and Loeb measures; (b)
developing techniques for studying rigidity of dynamical systems based on
analytic techniques from partial differential equations, particularly the theory
of wavefront sets; (c) classifying hyperbolic groups which act smoothly on their
boundaries using ideas from both dynamics and geometric group theory; (d)
developing new cohomological methods in the study of rigidity of group actions.
All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of rigidity in dynamics,
geometry and topology. Many proposed projects involve applying analytic ideas
and techniques to problems traditionally studied by dynamical, geometric or
topological methods.
