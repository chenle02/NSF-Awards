REU site project on infrastructure innovations is designed to attract native
born students to research careers in this area within civil engineering and to
lead participants toward independent research. Recent reports have concluded
that there is a critical need for more research in innovative means of
maintenance and rehabilitation of our infrastructure. Research projects include
behavior of fiber- reinforced composite pvfs materials, holographic measurement
of the fracture process increment, increasing transportation system capacity by
changing patterns of usage, and innovative infrastructure enhancement. Student
interaction is maintained by twice a week orientation meetings which address
research skills common to all work, as well as informal chats with the REU
professors to convey the excitement of a research career. Research results are
presented both orally and in a report of sufficient quality for publications to
ensure training in technical communication.
