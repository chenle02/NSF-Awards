This project will examine the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and
its role in the protection of the rights of citizens. Since 1992, tens of
thousands of Russian citizens have filed petitions, asking the court to assist
them in realizing their constitutionally guaranteed rights. In a typical year,
the court gets more than 10,000 such petitions. While many fall outside court's
jurisdiction, about half of the petitions raise a constitutional question that
merits further analysis. And while the court answers few of these petitions
through formal published decisions on the merits, the court answers every
letter, trying to clarify petitioners' legal rights on a one-to-one basis or
assisting in defining the petitioners' legal options without rendering a formal
decision. The principal investigator will study this developing dialogue about
rights by drawing a sample of petitions and examining the claims that
petitioners have made, as well as the court's responses. By studying this
interaction over the last ten years, this research will trace the emergence of
constitutional consciousness in Russia in its first post-soviet decade.
