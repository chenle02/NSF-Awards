Audio, video and graphics will play a major role in shaping the evolution of
computers and communications. To this end, the formulations of new mechanisms
for multimedia computing and visualization are proposed, with emphasis on time-
dependent data. Specific research objective are (1) the development of protocols
for multi-media communications. (2) the modeling of time-dependent data for
storage, communication, and interfaces; (3) the development of new paradigms for
interactive digital video; and (4) the provision of time-dependent information
retrieval in a distributed database and shared-object environment. An
operational distributed multi-media information system will be developed to
demonstrate the work. The prototype system will be designed to support scale-up
for general-purpose multimedia computing including computer-aided instruction
and collaborative work. Current technology will be used for data compression,
communication, and interface toolkits; tailored to implement the theoretical
results. The proposed research consists of the development of communications
protocols and other mechanisms to enable interactive multimedia computing
systems. Although many application-specific systems have been developed,
effective support for multimedia applications in a general distributed
environment is not widely studied. This work emphasizes the enabling technology
rather than applications per se; however, an application will be developed that
may lead to innovative approaches to learning, human-computer interaction, and
computer-aided education.
