The project is developing computer interfaces and new curricula to provide
students in introductory renewable energy courses with an interactive, Web-based
laboratory using state-of-the-art photovoltaic systems and monitoring equipment.
The project team is preparing learning modules for a photovoltaic test facility
at the NASA Ames Research Center to enable students to control the azimuth and
elevation of a tracking photovoltaic panel to optimize its power output based on
real-time measurements of the panels current and voltage. They also are planning
additional research making use of nanotechnology, such as quantum wires and
dots, allowing students to compare their performance to that achieved with
commercial technology. To support the laboratory experience, the investigators
are writing Java applets and graphical user interfaces that provide online
tutorials and automated feedback tools to measure student learning. By
partnering with a two-year Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), they are testing
the approach in a different academic setting. An independent evaluator is
providing formative and summative studies to determine how well the students
understand the relationship between the measured environmental factors and
generator performance. The investigators are disseminating their materials and
results through a webpage, tagged with descriptive metadata and linked to the
NSDL, and through presentations and publications in the area of undergraduate
education. Broader impacts include the partnership with the HSI, the
dissemination of the materials, and outreach activities using an existing K-12
program.
