Professor Robert D. Grober of Yale University and Dr. James Cameron of Shipley
Corporation are funded in this GOALI project by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. The work is focused on single molecule spectroscopy as a way
of probing photoresists. The team is using pH-sensitive fluorescent dye
molecules to probe photogenerated acids on the nanoscale in chemically-amplified
photoresists. Diffusion of acids and fluors through the resists will be
measured, providing insight into the transport and kinetics of these systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single molecule spectroscopy is a relatively new laser
method made possible in the past decade by extremely sensitive detectors. It
allows optical characterization of phenomena at the nanoscale. It has not yet
found much industrial use. Precise control of the spatial distribution of
photoacid during lithographic processing is paramount for maximizing
lithographic resolution. The results of the study are significant for
nanotechnology and will be of benefit to the semiconducting industry.
