This study will attempt to determine the origin of nutrient- depleted glacial
North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) during the last glacial maximum (LGM)
and changes in the subpolar north Atlantic vertical nutrient gradient over
several climatic cycles. A nutrient vs depth profile for LGM on Rockfall
Plateau/Hatton Drift and Erik Ridge near the source of formation of intermediate
and deep waters will be constructed. Carbon-isotopic ratios in benthic
foraminifera and Cd/Ca ratios will provide clues to the origin of GNAIW.
