This proposal seeks support for The 8th International Conference on Scientific
Computing and Applications (SCA 2012) to be held at University of Nevada Las
Vegas during April 1-4, 2012. The conference is the eighth in a sequence of
international meetings held every two years in different countries in North
America and Asia. The proposed conference will bring together researchers
working in various fields of scientific computing and its applications to solve
scientific and industrially oriented problems, and to provide a forum for the
participants to meet and exchange ideas between computational mathematics,
engineering and industrial communities. The intellectual merit of the conference
is embodied in its addressing many fundamentally challenging topics: Multiphase
Flow in Porous Media; Geophysical Fluid Dynamics; Climate Simulation; Modeling
of Renewable Energy; Numerical Techniques for Wave Propagations; Numerical
Methods for Stochastic PDEs. The NSF funding will be used to cover the travel
cost for about 30 conference participants, who will be predominantly students
and junior researchers from U.S., but the organizers expect to also cover the
travel and subsistence expenses of some senior participants. The conference
organizers will make their great efforts in attracting young participants,
especially participants from under-represented groups, and providing valuable
opportunities for them to network with leaders of computational mathematics. The
conference will provide a better understanding and applications in areas of
importance to the nation such as national security, environment, nano science,
and energy. Specific examples include developing robust and efficient scientific
computing tools for oil reservoir simulation, fuel Cells, biofuels, design of
invisibility cloak, ice-sheet models for the next generation climate simulation,
etc.
