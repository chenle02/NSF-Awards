This Institutional Infrastructure award is for the support of research projects
in artificial intelligence and parallel computing. The infrastructure consists
of a parallel computer and the staff to maintain the computer. The projects
supported by this award include learning algorithms, real time decision making,
data- parallel compilers, and parallel programming support environments.
Parallel computers are research tools in two senses. The first is that they
provide a substantial increase in computational power. The second is that they
act as an experimental vehicle for new systems software that needs to be
developed in order to use the computers effectively. This award addresses both
questions. The artificial intelligence research needs the computing power while
the compiler and support environment work needs the experimental vehicle.
