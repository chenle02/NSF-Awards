Illinois State University will develop a five-year model program for the
preparation of middle school mathematics teachers. The proposed effort involves
a major reconceptualization based on the premises that learning mathematics is a
constructive process requiring reflective activity and that such activity is
facilitated by problem-solving situations. Developmental efforts will include
three new mathematics courses, the modification of two additional mathematics
courses, and the modification of four pedagogical courses. Teaching methodology
in all courses will reflect the above basic premises. The proposed program
represents a cooperative effort involving mathematicians, mathematics educators,
and teacher educators. Students will study mathematics content and teaching
methodology, be involved in numerous practicum and clinical experiences, student
teaching, and a well developed set of induction year activities. The program
will prepare a teacher who is mathematically sound and who is knowledgeable and
skilled in teaching middle school students. This program will stand as a model
for similar types of institutions that have somewhat traditional four-year
teacher preparation programs.
