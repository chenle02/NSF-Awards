9361324 Kalkhoran The principal investigator proposes to demonstrate visible
electroluminescent (EL) devices fabricated on a porous polysilicon thin film on
a glass substrate. In Phase II, a working matrix of red, green, and blue EL
devices for a full-color display panel will be developed. The principal
investigator recently fabricated the first Si-based light-emitting diodes
configured as heterojunctions between an electrochemically-processed p-type
porous Si and an n-type transparent semiconductor (indium-tin-oxide). Quantum
confinement in Si nanostructures is the key to the luminescence of these
devices. These LEDs emit yellow, orange, and red light: The fabrication of a
porous Si-based blue LED is presently being investigated at Spire with NSF
funding. Although most previous work on porous silicon devices has employed bulk
Si materials rather than Si thin films, Spire has shown that bright visible
light can be obtained from porous structures formed on polycrystalline silicon
thin films deposited on quartz substrates. The principal investigator now
proposes to extend this development to create a novel thin film
electroluminescent (TFEL) technology based on porous polysilicon films. Such a
technology would be not only more economical and practical than conventional
practice, but could also offer the monolithic integration of display elements
with the thin film transistor (TFT) chip-on-glass driver circuits. ***
