Many present day and future applications require an efficient lightweight
compact coherent radiation source with high beam quality and high output power.
The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the performance of a neodymium
stoichiometric material, NAB, which has a ND3+ concentration 40 times higher
than that of Nd:YAG and a weak concentration quenching, and to develop a diode
pumped NAB mini-laser to meet the needs of the scientific community.
