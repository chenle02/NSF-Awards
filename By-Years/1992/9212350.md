This project provides support for acquisition of additional testing equipment to
upgrade the newly developed structural engineering research laboratory at
Clarkson University. This equipment includes a new hydraulic pump capable of
maintaining 3000 psi pressure and flow volumes of 30 gallons per minute,
hydraulic pressure control units, and apparatuses for determination of material
properties of concrete (modulus, and Poisson's ratio). Acquisition of this
equipment will improve the experimental research capability existing and will
lead to greater impact on future code development for reinforced concrete
structures under seismic loads. This is an equipment grant.
