The concept of plastic spin measures the rate of rotation of a continuum
relative to its underlying substrate. This new concept has an important effect
on the stress-strain relations of anisotropic materials, particularly at large
deformations. The purpose of the proposed investigation is to check the validity
of the PI's theoretical model by comparison with experimental data. Potential
applications of the proposed research are metal forming and large deformation of
fissured rocks. PI is qualified to conduct the proposed research; his recent
theoretical model had been well-received by the mechanics community. An award is
recommended.
