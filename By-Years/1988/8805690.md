This award will support research on two aspects of RNA catalysis. The first is
to define the substrate specificity of P RNA, the catalytic component of B.
subtilis tRNA processing enzyme RNaseP. Carefully designed mutations in the
established domain of yeast tRNA-phe precursor will be assayed in the RNA
dependent cleavage reaction. Fluorescent assays will be developed to identify
the binding and cleavage steps. The second is to ascertain the mechanism of Pb
and Mg dependent cleavage of yeast tRNA-phe. Mutant tRNAs with unique deoxy-2-
O'methyl and alpha-thio-phosphate substitutions will be prepared to test a model
of Klug derived from X-ray diffraction data. The results will greatly aid our
understanding of how RNA catalysis takes place, the evolution of enzymes and the
origin of life on earth.
