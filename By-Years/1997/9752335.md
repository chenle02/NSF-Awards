The investigators are implementing Calculus on the Web (COW), an interactive
electronic learning system for basic mathematics. It is accessible through the
internet from any platform capable of running a standard web browser, at
http://cartan.math.temple.edu/~cow/. The system presents in modular form units
for study, practice and "hands-on" experimentation for each of the great variety
of topics in a number of courses. Some key features of COW which distinguish it
from the current generation of mathematics learning software are: (i) the system
is not a canned, multiple choice question environment, but requires the student
to compute and enter a numerical or mathematical expression; (ii) the system
algebraically analyzes answers and has the flexibility to detect partially
correct responses and create individually tailored replies. For the current
project, the system will be developed for a complete treatment of calculus, for
precalculus and linear algebra. The educational objectives of COW are: 1. To
create an interactive platform for mathematics skill development and
intellectual exploration without the overhead of supervision and technical
training of students in specialized software. 2. To provide an on-line version
of assigned, graded homework, particularly useful for large or multi-section
courses without graders. 3. To offer the electronic equivalent of mathematics
tutoring, at home or any campus workstation. 4. To make the system available for
all calculus classes at local high schools, and to all other US universities
that wish to use it. 5. To do all this with a low maintenance, simple-to-use
system exploiting existing university facilities and internet technology.
