An REU site project will focus on the use of advanced computational
experimentation to expose undergraduate researchers to a variety of current
mathematical research frontiers. A program to carry out numerical experiments on
the qualitative behavior of solutions of nonlinear evolution equations and
elliptic systems will be available. Studies of asymptotic behavior of solutions
to the porous medium equation represents one specific area. Numerical data
obtained will amplify recent theoretical results on uniqueness for extremal
functions in the Sobolev inequality. Other work will concentrate on the phi-
transform, a new technique developed for decomposing general functions into sums
of simple terms. It is based on important advances in harmonic analysis in the
last twenty years. In addition to being relatively easy to understand, this
transform exhibits certain speed characteristics of the fast Fourier transform.
Properties of the transform make it useful in numerical work; understanding
these properties is a task well suited for undergraduate research. Student
interns will also be involved in the creation of numerical models for
calculation of automorphism groups for domains in the space of several complex
variables. This highly theoretical field lends itself to numerical
interpretation through certain boundary differential quantities known as the
Chern-Moser-Tanaka invariants. Tedious calculations necessary to put the
boundary of a domain in normal form can now be carried out. Students will
develop the basic algebra and symbol manipulation algorithms which will be
needed, learning about the complex mathematical structures and their analysis
simultaneously.
