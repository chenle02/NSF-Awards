This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the control
of S02 emissions to the from coal-fired power plants. Since any economical
reductions of the sulfur content of coal used by utilities is through blending
of various coals, it proposes the development of a neutron-based on-line coal
analyzer. This analyzer will measure in real time the sulfur content of coal
along with other important coal bulk parameters such as caloric value, moisture,
density, volatile matter etc., that affect the efficiency of the power plant The
main features of the proposed analyzer which is based on pulsed fast/thermal
neutrons are self-calibration independent of the coal seam, diminished radiation
risk, and better accuracy in the determination of elements such as carbon,
oxygen and sodium. The proposed on-line coal analyzer is to be used by coal
mines, coal preparation plants and coal-fired power plants worldwide In the
U.S., there exist nearly 900 of the above coal related facilities, and over 100
on-line analyzers have already been installed. This research addresses the
issues that the existing analyzers have problems with, and, in the beginning, it
targets approximately 100 coal mines that have been identified as potential
users of the pulsed neutron technology. This award is supported by the Small
Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
