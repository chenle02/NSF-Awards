The project will allow the P.I. to continue a geochemical and isotopic study of
S. Atlantic MORBs that identified a significant geochemical anomaly at 33S on
the MAR axis. The 33S anomaly appears to be very different from all other
anomalies along the MAR axis and the P.I. proposed some hypotheses for the
origin of this anomaly. He will combine the geochemical and isotopic data to be
gathered with geophysical and bathymetric measurements to test these hypotheses.
