Understanding the dramatic political, social and economic changes currently
underway in the Soviet Union and through out Eastern Europe is one of the most
important challenges facing the social sciences. This award renews support for
research designed to monitor public opinion in the Soviet Union and to study
relations between public opinion and political leaders as the Soviet Union
struggles with the process of democratization. Specifically this project builds
on an 1990 survey of Soviet citizens by conducting a second set of interviews
with Soviet citizens in three republics: the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and
Lithuania. The interviews will measure the extent of public support or
opposition to the institutional changes. They also will permit assessments of
the nature and extent of ethnic and regional divisions and other potential
stumbling blocks to the establishment of democratic processes. In addition,
interviews with members of the Supreme Soviet in each of the three Republics and
the elected representatives to the USSR Congress of People's Deputies will
provide the first systematic evidence of the leadership's personal preferences
and their perceptions of citizen needs and demands. When completed this project
will provide systematic evidence of the relations developing between Soviet
citizens and their representatives. This evidence will be invaluable in
understanding the global processes by which centralized, authoritarian states
evolve toward more decentralized, open, and democratic governments.
