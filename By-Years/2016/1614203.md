Black holes behave very similarly to spinning tops when orbiting other black
holes. This project will seek to understand this behavior in a modified theory
of gravity called Chern-Simons gravity, where the gravitational interaction
changes if the black holes are counter rotating to one another. This research
will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Takahiro Tanaka, who is an expert on
the techniques used to describe spinning black holes, at Kyoto University. This
project will further our understanding of the fundamental nature of gravity and
how to test Einstein?s theory of General Relativity.

Dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity is a modified theory that alters the
gravitational interaction through the introduction of parity violation. Such a
modification only alters gravitating systems that are odd under reflection, such
as spinning black holes. This project will study how the spins of black holes
precess in dCS gravity when in binary systems, which will be encoded in the
gravitational waves emitted by the system. The PI will collaborate with Kyoto
University Professor Takahiro Tanaka, who helped pioneer techniques to describe
the spin precession of black holes. The project is critical to further our
understanding of how to perform model independent tests of Einstein's theory of
General Relativity using gravitational waves where modifications only effect
spinning systems.
