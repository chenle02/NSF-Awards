The objective of this project is to characterize a Nicotiana tabacum membrane
transporter that&lt;br/&gt;may be responsible for the transport of alkaloids
from their initial site of biosynthesis in roots to&lt;br/&gt;xylem tissue and
for their final accumulation in leaves. This will be accomplished by using a
gene&lt;br/&gt;fragment previously isolated during transcriptional profiling
experiments as a hybridization&lt;br/&gt;probe to isolate the full-length cDNA.
With this cDNA in hand, an extensive effort will be made&lt;br/&gt;to determine
the tissue and intercellular localization patterns of the putative alkaloid
transport&lt;br/&gt;protein, using both RNase protection assays and transgenic
reporter gene fusions. Biochemical&lt;br/&gt;confirmation of alkaloid transport
activity will be accomplished by heterologous expression of&lt;br/&gt;the
putative alkaloid transporter in Xenopus oocytes and directly measuring alkaloid
transport&lt;br/&gt;kinetics. Finally, in vivo modulation of the putative
alkaloid transporter gene expression levels&lt;br/&gt;will be achieved using
overexpression and antisense transgenic hairy root cultures to assess
the&lt;br/&gt;effect on overall alkaloid accumulation levels. These experiments
may lead to the first&lt;br/&gt;identification and molecular characterization of
a postulated alkaloid transporter that is&lt;br/&gt;responsible for mobilizing
alkaloids between their site of biosynthesis in specific root cell
types&lt;br/&gt;towards their site of action in the leaves. This would be a
significant contribution to&lt;br/&gt;understanding both how and why the site of
biosynthesis of many plant secondary metabolites is&lt;br/&gt;often spatially
separated from the site of action of these important defense compounds.
