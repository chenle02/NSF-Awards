9321689 Goodnight Inbreeding depression is potentially one of the most serious
genetic consequences of reduced population size. This research is an empirical
study on selection for reduced inbreeding depression among a subdivided
population, using Tribolium castaneum as the model system. It will involve a
comparison of two migration schemes, random and differential, among a set of
fifteen inbred lineages derived from the same outbred stock population. In the
differential migration scheme, migrants will be sent from lineages suffering
from less inbreeding depression to lineages suffering from more inbreeding
depression. In the random migration scheme, the rate of migration will be the
same but migrants will be sent at random with respect to levels of inbreeding
depression. A significant response to selection will be evident by a significant
decrease in the level of inbreeding depression in the differential migration
scheme, relative to the random migration scheme.%%% The significance of the
research lies in its insight into the quantitative aspects of gene flow within
and between small, subdivided populations, an issue of considerable significance
to basic population and conservation biology.***
