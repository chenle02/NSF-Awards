Traditionally, aids for designers have been analytical techniques that do not
incorporate many of the essential features of the design process. Furthermore,
these tools are often based on the assumption that the designer must make a
decision among on a fixed number of alternatives. Additional aids are needed for
the earlier stages of design when alternative designs are generated and
organized. Aids will be created for the preliminary stages of design. The
research is based on the assumption (1) that expert designers use measurably
different strategies and methods than practitioner designers; and (2) that if
tools could be created that would allow practitioner to use the strategies and
methods of expert designers, then design practice would be improved. The
preliminary research will focus on testing these assumptions. If these
assumptions prove valid, design aids will be specified and created.
