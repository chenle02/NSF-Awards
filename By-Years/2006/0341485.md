Chemistry (12) Traditional teaching methods and instructional software products
that focus on presentation and evaluation often fail to help students develop
important cognitive and interpersonal skills in the areas of critical thinking,
problem solving, communication, teamwork, management, and assessment. To address
this situation, this project is implementing a research-based design to produce
60 innovative web-based activities spanning two semesters of General Chemistry.
This design is premised on a cognitive model that most students learn chemistry
best by constructing their own understanding using a learning cycle consisting
of exploration, concept formation, application, and assessment. The activities
are being field tested in diverse learning environments and revised accordingly.
Teaching methods for the effective use of these activities are also being
developed and disseminated through workshops for faculty and graduate teaching
assistants. The activities are being distributed through publishers and digital
repositories in four formats: within the previously developed LUCID Learning and
Assessment System, for use in course management and e-learning systems, for
independent web posting, and as text-based materials.
