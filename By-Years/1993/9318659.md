9318659 Berndt This workshop was held on November 11-13, 1993 in Charleston,
South Carolina. It brings together leading individuals from the international
research community to explore ways of improving the ability to assess, measure
and otherwise understand the economic and organizational impacts of information
technology investments. Participants at the workshop come from a variety of
different disciplines -- computer science, organization theory and economics, as
well as from different research organizations -- academia, national and
international statistical organizations, and national research funding centers.
Particular attention is devoted to the availability and/or necessity of data
sets amenable to testing alternative hypotheses. Another important purpose of
the workshop is to set an appropriate research agenda to guide national research
and statistical funding agencies and the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD). Proceedings of the workshop are to be published as a
special edition of the journal, Economics of Innovation and New Technologies, in
the Summer of 1994.
