This three-year award supports cooperative research in plant physiology between
Raymond Chollet of the University of Nebraska and Jean Vidal of the Laboratory
for Plant Molecular Physiology, University of Paris (South). The investigators
will examine the photoregulatory mechanism that controls the functional
properties and biosynthesis of C4-leaf PEPC. PEPC is a key enzyme in
photosynthesis. Using mutagenesis techniques on maize and sorghum specimens,
they will substitute specific amino acids on the phosphorylation sites and
assess their effects on the enzyme's regulatory and catalytic properties. The
French will add a molecular genetic dimension to the project. They are
experienced in mapping and cloning of PEPC while the U.S. investigators have the
instrumentation and extensive biochemical expertise for large-scale PEPC
isolation and protein sequencing. The project will benefit from this
interactive, molecular-genetic and biochemical approach. PEPC studies will
extend our knowledge of light regulation C4 photosynthesis and enhance our
understanding of protein phosphorylation.
