0210946&lt;br/&gt;Bisson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a
collaborative research project between Professor Mary Bisson of SUNY-Buffalo and
Professors Mary Beilby and Norman Walker of the University of New South Wales,
Australia. Research on osmotic regulation in the marine alga Venticaria will
focus on measuring potassium ion fluxes during osmotic stress, and on the effect
of light, inhibitors and changing ion concentrations on flux rates. Dr. Bisson's
expertise in working with turgor probes and with cultures of Ventricaria will be
complemented by the experience of her Australian colleagues in the use of ion-
selective electrodes to determine potassium ion fluxes and in the mathematical
analysis of current-voltage curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide
baseline information about the generation and control of membrane potential in a
typical marine algae, enhancing our knowledge of marine algae in general and
providing valuable information for mariculture systems. In addition, the project
will strengthen the collaboration between the U.S. and Australian laboratories.
