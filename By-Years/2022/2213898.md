This award will support experiments to study radiatively cooled magnetic
reconnection, a new frontier of fundamental plasma physics which is important
for understanding extreme astrophysical objects. Magnetic reconnection is a
ubiquitous process throughout the Universe, which rearranges the topology of the
magnetic fields which bind plasmas, and converts magnetic energy to kinetic and
thermal energy. In environments with strong radiative cooling, such as around
pulsars or in the coronae of black holes, efficient radiative loss may strongly
effect the plasma dynamics leading to radiative cooling instabilities.
Understanding this radiative collapse process is an outstanding issue in theory,
simulation, experiment, and observation of magnetic reconnection under extreme
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiments supported by this award will
use the largest pulsed-power facility in the world, the Z machine at Sandia
National Laboratories, to open up a new frontier in fundamental laboratory
astrophysics: strongly radiatively cooled magnetic reconnection. Pulsed-power
uses intense currents to convert initially solid targets into hot, dense,
magnetized plasmas, and a pulsed-power driven reconnection platform has recently
been developed. These plasmas are inherently in rough equipartition, with
significant contributions to the pressure balance from the magnetic, thermal and
kinetic pressures, a situation which occurs in many astrophysical plasmas. The
research team will scale this platform from 1 MA peak current, university scale
facilities to the Z machine which drives over 25 MA of current. Scaling laws
predict 100,000 times stronger radiative cooling on Z than in previous
experiments, which will lead to an entirely new and unexplored regime of
astrophysically relevant magnetic reconnection
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
