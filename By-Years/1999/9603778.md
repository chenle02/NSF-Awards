Florman 96-03778 Intracellular pH (pHi) is an important regulator of cellular
activity, including the response to growth factors, hormones, and other external
signals. An understanding of the mechanisms of pHi regulation has been advanced
by the molecular and biochemical characterization of several transport proteins.
However, the Na+-dependent Cl-/HC03- exchange is a major and widely distributed
pHi regulator that has not been identified. The key experimental difficulties in
purifying the protein components of this transport system include: (i) the lack
of specific antagonists that differentiate this pathway from other anion
transport mechanisms; and (ii) the inability to identify sources that are
enriched in this transport activity. Dr. Florman's laboratory has focused on the
activation of mammalian sperm ion transport pathways by contact with the egg's
extracellular matrix, or zona pellucida, during fertilization. The Na+dependent
Cl-/HC03- exchange pathway is the major pHi regulator that is stimulated during
sperm capacitation and zona pellucida contact. This transport activity is
readily detectable in sperm membrane vesicles and can be distinguished from
other anion transport mechanisms. The objective of this study is to purify the
Na+-dependent Cl-/HC03- exchange protein from mouse sperm. This transport
activity will be isolated from detergent extracts of sperm membrane proteins by
affinity chromatography and by conventional gel filtration and ion exchange
chromatography. Purification will be monitored in functional assays by
reconstituting sperm protein into liposomes and by determining the specific
activity of anion transport activity. The identification of a sperm pH
regulatory protein that mediates an essential step of gamete interaction will
advance our knowledge of the fertilization process in mammals. In addition,
these studies form an essential first step in the identification and
characterization of related proteins in somatic tissues.
