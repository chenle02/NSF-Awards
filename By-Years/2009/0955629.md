This project will use a variety of simulation and assimilative codes to
investigate the accuracy of the energy inputs to the magnetosphere and the
resulting response of the ionosphere and thermosphere. In particular the project
will assess the significance of non-hydrostatic processes in the
thermosphere/ionosphere response to magnetospheric forcing. The data sources
that will be used will include neutral wind data from Fabry-Perot
interferometers, satellite data from CHAMP, DMSP and NOAA/POES. Scientific
questions that will be addressed are (1) how can the uncertainty in the Joule
heating in the thermosphere and ionosphere be reduced, (2) what are the global
ramifications of non-hydrostatic processes caused by sudden energy inputs and
how significant are the processes on thermospheric winds and density, and (3)
what are the mechanisms that lead to the enhanced neutral density in the cusp
regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals of the project include
research activities to be carried out by both graduate students and
undergraduate students.
