9221362 Cooper This award supports the United States Antarctic Research Program
component of a joint U.S. Italian project to investigate the acoustic
characteristics of the lithosphere of the Ross Sea and the adjacent
Transantarctic Mountains. The joint project involves deployment of recording
seismometers along a line at approximately 76 S, from the East Antarctic Ice
Sheet, across the Transantarctic Mountains, and across the Victoria Basin
portion of the Ross Sea. Land based seismometers and ocean bottom seismometers
will be deployed to gather seismic reflection and refraction data that will be
used to infer the structure and composition of the lithosphere in the region.
