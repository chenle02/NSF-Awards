This project provides for a series of workshops for high school teachers during
the XII Biennial Conference on Chemical Education of the Division of Chemical
Education of the American Chemical Society. The conference will be held in the
summer of 1992, in Davis, California. In addition to supporting teachers at the
workshops and the Biennial Conference a visiting mentor Teacher Program and a
follow-up program for the participants will be provided. The workshops will
cover the topics: (a) the use of computers in the classroom, (b) employing
demonstrations, (c) using consumer chemicals and supplies and (d) techniques of
microchemistry. In the follow-up sessions prior participants will be asked to
bring at least one of their colleagues so that more teachers will be involved.
Altogether 150 teachers will be supported by the project. The NSF funds are
being matched by funds from the American Chemical Society, the Council of
Chemical Research and private industry. The matching funds amount to about 36%
of the NSF grant.
