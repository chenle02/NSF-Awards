The research proposed here will assess the importance of feedbacks between plant
productivity, biomass removal due to fire and herbivory, and element cycling in
grassland ecosystems. Conceptual models of interactions among these processes
will be evaluated in mixed grasslands of the southern Great Plains. These models
are distinguished by the relative importance they assign to feedbacks between
plant tissue quality and soil nitrogen mineralization rates. Models emphasizing
feedbacks differ in the nature (positive or negative) of specific feedback
mechanisms. Models assume minimal importance to feedbacks identify different
factors (climate vs. decoupling of C and N cycles) as primary regulators of
fertility and plant productivity. Existing data collected by these researchers
suggest that that modulation of plant inputs to soils by fire and herbivory
limit microbial C pools in these grasslands, thereby minimizing feedbacks to C
and N cycling. The investigators request support for analysis of existing plant
and soil samples to assess the degree of decoupling between C and N cycling in
soil pools.
