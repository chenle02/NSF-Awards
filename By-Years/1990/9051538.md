A modern approach to laboratory instruction in physiology is being implemented
using computers to interface with scientific instrumentation. The new laboratory
consists of five computer workstations serving as the primary laboratory tool
for groups of 3-5 students. The computer at each station is equipped with a
complete data acquisition center by interfacing either with mechanical devices
such as strain gauges for muscle contraction, nerve chambers for nervous impulse
monitoring, or transducers for monitoring EKG, oxygen, temperature, and pH. The
computer also controls a spectrophotometer for monitoring colorimetric reactions
for hemoglobin and enzyme analysis. These workstations supersede polygraphs and
oscilloscopes which needed upgrading. The workstations should thoroughly
familiarize students with computer technology while allowing the use of state-
of-the-art instrumentation and computerized data acquisition and analysis. They
are utilized by several different physiology classes, and provide
instrumentation for students pursuing independent study projects. The university
is contributing an amount equal to the award.
