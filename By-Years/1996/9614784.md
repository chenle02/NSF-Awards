The Pacific Software Research Institute is holding a summer school on advanced
functional programming techniques. The school is designed to be of use to
university faculty, industry and government workers interested in software
technology. It will also bring together a group of leading researchers in
advanced functional programming to lecture and interact with the other
participants. This will allow in-depth discussion by both researchers and
practitioners in the field, providing an assessment of the state of the art and
new directions of research needed.
