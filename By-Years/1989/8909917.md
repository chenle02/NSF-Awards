Loess sequences provide excellent records of aerosol concentrations in the
atmosphere and the history of terrestrial aridity. The best loess sequences for
study are in China, where as much as 10 meters of sediments were deposited in
the Holocene. Throughout this interval of time, 14C dating techniques provide
accurate chronologies of the sedimentation history; thus the temporal
relationship between terrestrial climate change and other components of the
climate system (ice volume, marine surface and deep water temperatures) can be
accurately determined. This proposal will study the history of climate in China
in a region with a sensitive response to the Asian monsoon. It is important
because it will help to improve our understanding of the regional impact and
chronology of the early Holocene intensification of monsoonal circulation,
already documented in northern Indian Ocean sediment cores and nearby, tropical
alpine ice cores.
