9714128 Joshi A detailed systematic effort is conducted to develop cost
effective technology for remotely queried sensor units in a composite structure.
Current ongoing research generally targets monitoring of a specific subsystem in
the laboratory, during testing and development, using wired sensors. Existing
efforts on wireless smart materials are in the beginning stages and focus on the
development of simple feasibility test articles. In the current project,
embedded wireless sensory arrays for providing structural health and usage
information about composite materials are being developed. The investigation
leads to the development of inexpensive sensors, techniques for rapid insertion
during composite fabrication, and methods of easily combining panels of smart
material into a complete system. Specific topics being addressed include: (1)
sensor identification techniques, (2) transmitter/receiver circuit development,
(3) energy coupling (between an outside interrogator and sensors) through a
lossy composite material, (4) sensor placement or insertion, (5) comparability
between transducer and interconnection materials with the composite material,
(6) calibration and compensation of transducers, (7) development of outside
interrogator, and (8) selection of optimal sensor placements. ***
