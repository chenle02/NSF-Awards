9352794 Chini This project supplements a previously funded effort to create a
soils compenent in the Construction Management Technology program. Four new
experiments are added to 7 previously developed. The complete set of experiments
create a comprehensive Soils Science and Technology course which introduces
students to the nature of soils and illustrates how soil materails may influence
certain construction operations. The course is divided into two parts. Part I is
an introduction to soil materials in conjuction with testing methods. Part II
addresses the earthwork in the construction contract and reviwers construction
items that involve soils operations. ***
