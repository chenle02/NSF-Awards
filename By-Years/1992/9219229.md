The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) will hold its General
Assembly and the XXXII International Congress of Physiological Sciences in
Glasgow, Scotland, August 1-6, 1993. It is proposed that the American
Physiological Society administer a travel grant program offering a limited
number of travel awards to qualified scientists who are permanent residents of
North America and who may require such assistance. Special emphasis will be
given to female and underrepresented minority scientists. The U.S. National
Committee for the IUPS will serve as a screening and selection committee, and
the American Physiological Society will act as fiscal agent and award the travel
grants.
