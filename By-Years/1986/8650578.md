This project will provide electrical engineering undergraduates with thorough
training in modern communications engineering. Instruments to be purchased
include apparatus to modulate, transmit, and detect radio- frequency signals by
AM, FM, SSB, and a variety of digital techniques. They also include counters,
oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, and noise generators to aid in the analysis
of signals. Communications engineering has been emphasized less than some other
fields of electrical engineering, yet electronic communication is vital to the
operation of most electronic devices, particularly computers. Future
communications networks will be required to perform better than existing
systems, and students need to be trained in all major methods of communication
in order to design these networks effectively.
