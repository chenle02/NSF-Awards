This project's goal is the development of a logical approach to the study of
computational complexity. The approach will exploit two of the main traditions
in mathematical logic, namely, (a) model theory and (b) proof theory. Model
theory studies the relation between logical languages and their interpretations
and has developed powerful techniques to answer questions about the expressive
power of a variety of logical languages. Proof theory studies the notion of
logical inference and elevates mathematical study. In so doing, proof theory
makes it possible to undertake a rigorous examination of the complexity of
establishing conclusions within a given system of inference. A significant
feature of this logical approach is that it forgoes, to a large extent, the use
of machine models of computation in the study of complexity. Much valuable work
in complexity theory has involved careful analysis of the resource requirements
of various algorithms on the specified abstract machines. This project seeks to
obtain new insights into the complexity of combinatorial problems by analyzing
these problems in machine-independent, logical terms. Among the questions
considered are whether the polynomial time decidable properties of finite graphs
are recursively enumerable and whether NP = co-NP. Negative answers to either of
these questions would imply that P is not equal to NP. Though these implications
are certainly significant, the focus of the project is to achieve a deeper
understanding of the problems themselves by the use of logical techniques.
