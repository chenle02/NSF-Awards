A-B testing is a statistical method used to compare the effectiveness of two
design options. It is widely used in clinical trials and e-commerce to compare
the performance of medical treatment plans or marketing and retail strategies.
This project focuses on creating a framework for efficient A-B testing schemes
by leveraging recent advances in the theory of dynamic optimization. While the
project will consider generalized models, a particular focus will be on adaptive
clinical trials that aim to determine whether a new drug or treatment improves
on an existing treatment. In these dynamic medical trials, the decision of which
treatment to assign to each patient is made in real time, taking into
consideration information from the earlier participants. The award will support
graduate student research, and findings resulting from this project will be
integrated into coursework for a new Masters in Analytics
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop a new approach to the design
of optimal A-B tests, rooted in dynamic optimization. The project aims to
establish that the dynamic optimization problem implicit in the design of such a
test benefits from a "state space collapse". This would facilitate the solution
of large-scale problems that are currently computationally intractable. From a
theoretical perspective, this will entail the solution of a random vector-
coloring problem that is fundamental in its own right. From a practical
perspective, the project will facilitate the design of optimal trials in the
face of high-dimensional subject covariates; yield the ability to optimize for
efficiency when treatment effects are highly non-linear in observable
covariates; and finally, give trial designers the ability to optimally trade off
selection bias (or fairness) against statistical efficiency. Collaboration with
industry partners will be used to enhance the practical impact of this research
project, and to enrich the classroom experience for students.
