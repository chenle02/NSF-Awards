This research will focus on the synthesis of hindered bidentate ligands designed
to enforce unusual coordination numbers and/or geometries around a metal
(copper). The work seeks to provide better models for understanding the chemical
and spectroscopic properties of metalloproteins such as azurin. %%% With this
RUI award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Patricia S. Traylor of the Department of Chemistry at the University of San
Diego. The focus of the research will be to use hindered ligands to help
understand the extraordinary spectra and properties of important classes of
metalloenzymes and to involve undergraduates in a meaningful research
experience.
