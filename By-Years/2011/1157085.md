This award is to support the renewal of the REU site run by JILA (formerly Joint
Institute of Laboratory Astrophysics) and the Department of Physics at the
University of Colorado. The primary objective is to provide opportunities for
undergraduate students to participate in high quality ongoing research programs.
This year selected students will spend 10 weeks during the summer at the
University of Colorado in Boulder. The intellectual focus of the REU program is
physics and undergraduate students are paired up with preeminent faculty to do
research in the fields of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Biophysics,
Condensed Matter Physics, Elementary Particle and Nuclear Physics, Plasma
Physics, Physics Education Research, and Geophysics. Although the main emphasis
of the summer is centered around each student's individual research lab, where
the students are expected to master at least a part of a large task, a variety
of other activities take place during the program. These include ethics,
electronics, and machining classes, a "Getting Into Grad School" discussion, as
well as lab tours and a weekly science seminar series aimed at the students. The
program culminates with a day of presentations given by each of the REU
students.
