9617673 Sen Title: Upgrading the electron microprobe at Florida International
University The Geology Department at Florida International University houses a
25 year old electron probe microanalyzer that is used in the chemical analysis
of minerals and materials. This instrument still produces publishable analyses
but lately its overall capabilities have been seriously impaired by persistent
vacuum problems, loss of imaging capabilities, and beam instability. This
project is to replace/upgrade some of the necessary components so that the
instrument can be routinely used for microanalysis again.
