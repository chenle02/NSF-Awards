The research objective of this award is to predict and detect the formation of
lipid nanodomains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Lipid nanodomains are
believed to play a significant role in a number of critical cellular processes,
including replication processes in enveloped viruses such as bird flu and HIV
and signaling mechanisms underlying pathological conditions such as cancer. The
research approach involves three main activities:&lt;br/&gt;1) developing the
first imaging modality suitable to detect and characterize the formation of
nanodomains; 2) developing multiscale models and numerical methodologies for
nanoraft simulation; and 3) identifying the conditions needed for the formation
of nanodomains and image them in GUVs. An important byproduct of these
activities concerns addressing the question of whether or not such nanodomains
can form at all in the absence of auxiliary stabilizing agents such as
proteins.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide an
imaging modality that can be transferred to bioscientists to observe and detect,
and eventually help control, the emergence of rafts in cells. Such knowledge
might be used, for example, to guide the development of treatment schemes for
cancer involving the control of growth factors and other membrane signaling
molecules. Results from the research activities will be disseminated by
providing the microscope techniques to manufacturers, making the computer codes
freely available online to other scientists and engineers, and by providing
images and animations to teachers and science museums. Undergraduate and
graduate engineering students will be trained in the experimental, theoretical,
and computational techniques involved in this research through a system of lab
rotations &lt;br/&gt;
