This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of inorganic, bioinorganic, and organometallic chemistry and in the
associated subfield of protein crystallography. During the sixteen month period
beginning 1 September 1989, Professor Mertes will expand her capabilities in
bioinorganic chemistry by spending the Spring, 1990 semester in the laboratory
of Professor Gregory Petsko at MIT where she will learn the mechanics of protein
crystallography and broaden her knowledge of protein chemistry. Subsequently,
Professor Mertes will return to her own laboratory at the University of Kansas
and bring her new capabilities to bear in her ongoing studies in biomimetic
chemistry. This Career Advancement Award will enable Professor Mertes to acquire
new, critically important experimental skills that should enhance significantly
her research career.
