The spatial variation of seismic ground motions has an important effect on the
response of lifelines, such as bridges and pipelines; it may induce significant
additional loads in the structure than the ones obtained if the structure's
supports are subjected to the same seismic motions. The spatial variation of
seismic ground motions results from the apparent propagation of the waveforms on
the ground surface and the differences in their shape at the various locations
of the supporting structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a previous study, the PI
developed an alternative methodology for the investigation of spatially variable
seismic ground motions recorded at dense instrument arrays. It models the
seismic motions as superpositions of sinusoidal functions, described by their
amplitude, frequency, wavenumber and phase. The application of the methodology
to data recorded at the SMART-1 array in Lotung, Taiwan, revealed that the
common, coherent component approximates to a very satisfactory degree the actual
motions,&lt;br/&gt;and that the spatial variability is caused by arrival time
delays at the array stations associated with the upward traveling of the waves
through the site topography, and by variabilities in both the amplitudes and
phases of the motions around the common component
characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed methodology considers
simultaneously the amplitude and the phase variation in seismic motions. Its
application to recorded data recognized correlation patterns between amplitude
and phase variabilities around a coherent approximation of the motions; this
observation may lead to significant developments in the description of spatial
variability. However, the methodology has been applied to one site only, and,
for the generalization of its results, it is necessary that it be applied at
different sites subjected to various
earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, the present study uses extensive
additional sets of data recorded at rock and soil sites. Differentiation is made
in terms of the earthquake magnitude: small and large events (e.g., main event
and&lt;br/&gt;aftershocks) at the same site are investigated. The effect of the
water table at the sites ('wet' and 'dry' sites) is also taken into
consideration.&lt;br/&gt;
