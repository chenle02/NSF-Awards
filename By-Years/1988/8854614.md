This project offers a novel approach to the design of experiments for the senior
Chemical Engineering laboratory by combining computer simulation, the
cooperation of industrial sponsors, and a videotaped facilities tour. The
resulting laboratory experience is challenging, interesting and educationally
effective. An ideal laboratory experiment would duplicate an industrial project,
using modern equipment to investigate a complex problem under realistic time and
budget constraints. As an affordable alternative to constructing and operating
industrial-scale pilot plants, computer simulation and videotapes are combined
in instructional modules. The project includes seven modules covering areas such
as reactor design, separations, heat transfer, biochemical processing, and
semiconductor processing. Institutional support for this project is more than
three-fourths of the amount of funds requested from NSF.
