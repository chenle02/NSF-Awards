9421947 Eom The specific research tasks for the NSF include: (1) investigation
of various isotropic metallic oxides, both non copper-oxide-based isotropic
metallic oxides and a new family of copper-oxide-based isotropic metallic oxides
(these metallic oxides can be applied in many other devices, and electrodes in
electro-optic devices), (2) the fabrication of superconductor-normal metal-
superconductor epitaxial heterostructures with various isotropic metallic oxides
and characterization of their interfaces, (3) investigation of the origin of
interface resistance between normal metal barriers and superconductors. Junction
properties such as critical current and junction resistance will be measured for
both planar and sandwich type junctions. Normal metal barriers of various
metallic oxides with a wide range of structural, electrical, chemical and
magnetic properties will be used to control the interface properties between
high Tc superconductors and the normal metal barriers. ***
