Gedeon 9622722 Analog neural networks admit stationary, periodic and chaotic
solutions. So far the stationary solutions have received most attention of
researchers. However, in recent years the importance of non-stationary patterns
in brain became clear. The investigator studies networks which admit periodic
orbits and addresses the apparent discrepancy between discrete and continuous
time networks of this type. While in continuous networks one expects generally a
convergence to a periodic orbit, in discrete time networks there are stable
stationary solutions. The project investigates chaotic behaviour of a class of
networks with step-function nonlinearities. These can be viewed as a limiting
case of a steep sigmoid nonlinearities and are easier to handle analytically.
The delay in synaptic response of a neuron is a recognized fact; if one wants to
account for its affect the appropriate model must be expressed in terms of delay
differential equation. The investigator studies the discretization of this
equation and shows that this finite-dimensional approximation captures the
essential features of the dynamics of the delay equation. Artificial neural
networks is an area on a crossroads between artificial inteligence and
neurobiology. Mathematical models play an important role in this area. Neural
networks try to model some basic functions of brain (learning, recognizing
trained patterns) without trying to understand the intricate details of how the
neurons work on a chemical or physiological level. Neural networks are used
today in many areas of apllied science and engineering. The network can be
trained to recognize a certain pattern, given slightly perturbed data. This
pattern must be stationary, i.e. fixed in time. On the other hand, there is
hardly any process in the brain which is stationary, and most processes are
periodic. The investigator studies networks that admit periodic patterns, to
understand the relationship between differen t models and see which one is the
most suitable for applications. If one were able to train the networks to
recognize complicated patterns (in space and time), that would have an immediate
impact on robotics and artificial inteligence.
