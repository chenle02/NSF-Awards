Klein 9504076 The object of this proposal is to apply Car-Parrinello ab initio
molecular dynamics to proton conducting systems in which water predominately
determines the protonic environment. The focus of this research will be the
development of new methodology in order to make ab initio simulations of large
systems for long time scales feasible. New multiple time scale techniques for
Car-Parrinello calculations will be explored and implemented on scalable
architecture machines as a means of simultaneously increasing both time scale
and the system size. In addition, classical Car-Parrinello will be combined with
centroid and staging path integral molecular dynamics methods in order to go
beyond the approximation of classical nuclear dynamics and obtain semi-classical
quantum dynamics of the diffusing proton on the ground state Born-Oppenheimer
surface.
