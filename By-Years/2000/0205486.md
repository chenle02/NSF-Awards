This project aims to develop a framework and tools for defining, describing and
supporting the publication and dissemination requirements of community digital
libraries. It also expects to package the tools and software to create a general
solution for implementation and deployment of resources for diverse communities.
The promise in the approach is that publishing and dissemination will become
more sustainable and effective by moving responsibilities to the author. Four
test deployments will be done involving the US Geological Survey, the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, the Open Language Archives community and selected computer
science departments already involved with NCSTRL-OAI. Monitoring usage will be a
part of the overall effort.
