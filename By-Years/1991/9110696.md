The research is on high-level system design, with a focus on partitioning logic
among functional modules. Three new problem formulations and algorithms for
performance driven layout are being investigated. These are: (1) numerical
methods for finding sparse cuts for logic bi-partitioning with extensions to
multi-way logic partitions; (2) techniques for estimating rapidly optimal
solution values in large scale partition problems. These methods are based on
random walks and the theory of simulated annealing, and have extensions to
module area estimation for floorplan synthesis; and (3) a theoretical foundation
(weighted module packing) for the performance-driven partitioning problem.
Provably good algorithms for this problem are being examined.
