The work will provide a workload characterization based on categorization of
major job classes, rates at which the job mix parameters change, composition of
queues as a function of job size and CPU limits, and a correlation between
resource demands and application algorithms. The goals are to minimize the wall
clock expansion factor through optimal queue control, minimize idle time by
keeping the appropriate job mix in real memory, and process large resource
demanding jobs in the general mix, without penalizing all processes, including
the largest ones.
