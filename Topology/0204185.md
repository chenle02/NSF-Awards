This project continues to develop a set of ideas which began with an attempt to
understand automorphism groups of free groups by representing them as homotopy
equivalences of graphs. The space of all such homotopy equivalences, called
Outer space, is a contractible space on which the group of outer automorphisms
of a free group acts properly discontinuously. Analyzing the quotient of Outer
space by this action has yielded a significant amount of algebraic information
about this group over the years. More recently, work of Maxim Kontsevich has
related the rational homology of this quotient to the homology of a certain
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, consisting of derivations of the free Lie
algebra. Kontsevich also defined variations of this infinite-dimensional Lie
algebra whose homologies are related to the homology of mapping class groups and
to Kontsevich's graph homology, which is a homology theory containing various
3-manifold and knot invariants. The Principal Investigator will use this point
of view to obtain new information about invariants of these groups of classical
interest to topologists; conversely, topological methods will be applied to
obtain new information about these Lie algebras and their homology. In
particular, new Lie bi-algebra structures on the chain complexes used to compute
graph homology, recently discovered by Jim Conant the the Principal
Investivator, will be investivated. Finally, the local geometry of Outer space
will be studied. Certain neighborhoods in Outer space are non-positively curved
metric spaces, and can be identified with spaces of finite labelled metric
trees. Such trees are of interest in many branches of science, including
biology, where they appear as evolutionary trees produced from DNA data. Another
aim of this project is to determine efficient algorithms for finding geodesics
in this space, and to continue from there to develop a program of applying
statistical methods to this space of trees.

Graphs and trees appear in many contexts in the sciences and in mathematics. In
Geometric Group Theory a space of graphs known as Outer space, originally
defined by Marc Culler and the Principal Investigator, has been used extensively
to study the group of outer automorphisms of a finitely generated free group. In
this project the Principal Investigator will continue to study how the geometry
of this space is related to algebraic properties of the group of automorphisms.
A new perspective on this problem is provided by work of M. Kontsevich;
motivated by considerations from physics and symplectic geometry, Kontsevich
defined various abstract infinite-dimensional algebraic structures whose
invariants are closely related to invariants of Outer space. Finally, small
regions of Outer space can be identified with spaces of finite trees. Such trees
are used as a tool by evolutionary biologists, and another focus of this project
is understanding the local geometry of these regions in a very concrete,
algorithmic way which can be applied to problems in molecular phylogenetics.
