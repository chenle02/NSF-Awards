This project will support 8 students for a two semester sequence to do research
in parallel processing. The first semester is an intensive summer spent at the
Parallel Processing Institute of the University of Oklahoma. Students continue
their research back at their home institutions during the Fall semester with
weekly reporting to their research advisors by email and phone. Sample research
projects include: (1) Algorithms for Graph Embedding, (2) Benchmarking Broadcast
Algorithms on the Hypercube, (3) Randomized Algorithms, and (4) Developing
Portable Parallel Software.
