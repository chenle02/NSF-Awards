*** 9660116 Bayless This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will
provide a preliminary demonstration of the feasibility of a novel plasma source
for advanced semiconductor processing. There is a major need for improved low
pressure/high density plasma sources which are scaleable to large areas with
precisely controlled and uniform plasma density profiles. The proposed Rotating-
Field Plasma Source (RFPS) is a new type of source which is expected to meet the
demanding requirements for etching and processing at feature sizes <0.5 m. The
RFPS relies on a novel high-frequency rotating magnetic field drive concept to
generate and shape the plasma density in a way that will not be affected by
insertion of semiconductor wafers. It is expected to operate over a pressure
range of O.1-lO mtorr with reactive gases. The specific objectives of Phase I
are to: (1) design and assemble a Phase I RFPS feasibility experiment; (2)
perform experiments to demonstrate plasma generation with controlled uniformity;
and (3) develop the conceptual design for a laboratory prototype RFPS system to
be operated in a commercial etching system in Phase II. A major dry etch
equipment supplier has expressed great interest in the RFPS concept and will
participate in Phase I. This project contributes to National Critical
Technologies in the Microelectronics and Optoelectronics area. This project will
provide a superior method for generating well controlled plasmas for a wide
range of semiconductor materials processing applications. The RFPS advantages
include: (1) scaleable to wafer diameters of >400 mm with good uniformity; (2)
excellent controllability; and (3) low capitol and maintenance costs. This
source will substantially enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor
industry. ***
