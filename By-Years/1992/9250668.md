This project will give students hands-on experience with computer-interfaced
instrumentation by incorporating fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
into six undergraduate chemistry courses. In General Chemistry, the instrument
will be used to study isotopic substitution and to correlate the spectrum of an
unknown compound with those in a computerized database. Applications in Organic
Chemistry include structural interpretation and identification of reaction
products, compounds isolated from natural sources, and real life samples (e.g.,
cinnamon and mouthwash). Polymers synthesized by students will be characterized
by FT-IR. In Instrumental Analysis, students will record IR spectra of single
strands of hair in a methods development experiment and will determine the
percentage of ethanol in gasohol samples. Other FT-IR experiments include a
kinetics study of a ligand substitution reaction in Physical Chemistry and
enzyme-substrate interactions in aqueous solution in Biochemistry. The
experience gained by students will give them skills to apply to other computer-
interfaced instruments and valuable training for graduate school and the
workforce.
