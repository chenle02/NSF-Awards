9318958 Rodriguez This project involves the dissertation research of a student
in cultural anthropology from the University of New Mexico. The student will
conduct ethnographic research on middle-class White "lifestyle migrants" living
in Taos, NM, an Indian town. The research will see how these people define their
lives in contrast and distinction to the dominant more commercially-oriented
society. Using techniques of participant observation, survey interviews with
individuals and with local institutions, the student will analyze this counter-
current in contemporary US society. This research is important because it adds
to the scientifically trained capacity of the nation, and will provide a case
study of an alternative life-style. Understanding how this sector of society
defines itself will provide a valuable comparative case to enrich our
understanding of contemporary life in the US. ***
