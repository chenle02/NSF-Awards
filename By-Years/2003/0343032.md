With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the School of Chemical Sciences at the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign will acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following
studies on a) new main group and transition metal catalysts for fine chemical
synthesis; b) inorganic catalysts for environmental clean-up and hydrogen
production; and c) supramolecular assemblies derived from heterocyclic and
porphyrinic components.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, especially synthesis of important inorganic
chemicals and environmental chemistry.
