The objective of the proposed research is to determine the downstream
morphologic impacts caused by different combinations of small dam deconstruction
sequencing and impounded reservoir sediment characteristics. The central
hypothesis is that for a given distribution of impounded sediments, small dam
deconstruction can be sequenced such that impounded sediments released
downstream increase the available habitat created by the channel morphology and
thereby improve the downstream ecosystem. A series of laboratory flume
experiments will measure sediment transport rates and changes to the downstream
channel bed under various combinations of sediment mixtures and small dam
deconstruction phasing sequences for each of several scaled dam sizes.
Geomorphic variability in the downstream channel will be measured after each
phase of dam deconstruction, and data analysis will result in a series of
qualitative and quantitative descriptions of small dam removals under a range of
conditions.
