This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of biosensors. The
thrust of this experimental activity is to utilize a plate-mode surface acoustic
wave (SAW) device coupled with an antigen- antibody response to develop a highly
selective biosensor. By elaborating the correct transduction mechanism whereby
the bioanalyte of interest in the test system gives rise to the observed SAW
device response, Dr. McAllister will optimize the device design for analytical
responses in aqueous environments during this Phase I activity. Acoustic wave
sensors are solid state electronic devices which are highly sensitive to minute
mass changes. Sensitivities of less than ten parts-per-billion have been
demonstrated for gaseous analytes. Specificity is a major technical problem in
every sensor system; this issue can be addressed in bioanalytical systems
through the use of monoclonal antibodies. Whereas monoclonal antibodies can be
advantageously used in radioimmunoassay and electroimmunoassay systems, the
overall analysis time extends to several hours. BIODE, Inc. will utilize
monoclonal antibodies together with plate-mode SAW devices to produce a new
generation of sensors which should give rise to on-line applications in both in
vivo and in vitro systems.
