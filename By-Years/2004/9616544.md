Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program: Incorporating Computers
and Group Work to Develop Effective and Efficient Learning Experiences Georgia
State University has been awarded funding in the amount of $50,000 for a period
of 12 months to initiate a planning effort leading to the creation of a
collaborative research program to investigate the effects of using an innovative
instructional approach, called ACE Teaching Cycle, on the learning of
undergraduate mathematics in relatively large size classes. The ACE Teaching
Cycle is based on a cognitive theory of learning and integrates activities of
students: writing, writing computer programs and using the programs to represent
mathematical concepts, investigating mathematical phenomena using computer tools
(both constructed by the student and provided in the form of software packages),
and students working in cooperative groups.
