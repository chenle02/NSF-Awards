Basic hydraulic variables, such as water discharge and flow shear stress, are
derived from velocity profiles assuming that their shape is logarithmic. Recent
studies have demonstrated that velocity profiles in coarse bedded streams are
often not logarithmic but segmented or S-shaped. This doctoral dissertation
research will focus on the various factors affecting the shape and spatial
variation of velocity profiles in natural streams with coarse bed material. In
this project two sets of data will be collected on velocity profiles: one set of
measurements from 10 natural coarse bedded streams in New York and Quebec and
the other set from a flume with a bed of coarse material in the Hydraulics
Laboratory at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Respectively, these
two sets of measurements will permit the elucidation of the effect of varying
bed roughness on the shape and spatial variation of velocity profiles and the
examination of the effect of variables such as channel slope that are difficult
to isolate in the field. These two complementary sets of field and laboratory
data will make possible the more accurate estimation of water discharge, bed
sediment entrainment, and bed sediment transport rates. This research will
contribute to a better understanding of flow and resistance in channels with
large roughness elements. The solutions to many problems in geomorphology,
engineering, and environmental science encountered in the exploitation of
surface water resources depend upon developing more accurate flood routing
models and sediment transport models. The project also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent
research skills.
