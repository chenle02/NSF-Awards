9322410 Cummings The Owyhee region of eastern Oregon is proposed as a REU Site.
The Site affords students an opportunity to conduct geologic mapping at a scale
of 1:24,000, topic-specific field investigations, and to participate in
geophysical studies in volcanic, volcaniclastics, and hydrothermally altered
rocks. The field program is integrated with a laboratory program where students
use samples or data collected in their own research areas. The objective of the
program is to integrate field, laboratory, and professional presentation of
research results. Students are encouraged to present research results at
regional or local professional meetings.
