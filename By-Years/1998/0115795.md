This award provides partial support for acquisition of an 800 MHz Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer for a group of 16 investigators. The
instrument will be placed in a new center for structural biology in Baltimore
along with a six-year old 600 MHz NMR; both instruments will be available for
use by faculty and researchers of the University of Maryland and of the
University of Maryland Biotechnology Center. The request for NSF support was
submitted through an joint program of the NSF and the NIH that allows both
agencies to support the purchase of very expensive research instruments that
will be shared by three or more independent users. Thus, in addition to funds
provided by NSF through this award, partial support for the purchase is being
provided by the Shared Instrumentation Grant program of the NIH. In addition to
the support provided by federal sources, the University will provide
approximately $1 million of its own funds to purchase the
instrument.&lt;br/&gt;The use of NMR for study of the structure and behavior of
proteins and other large molecules has rapidly expanded in recent years as the
availability of instruments capable of operating at high frequencies and field
strengths has increased, and techniques for their use have been perfected. Only
at the highest frequencies can instruments resolve the minute differences in the
NMR signals of each atom in a large protein or nucleic acid. The minute
differences allow researchers to locate the relative positions of each atom with
the precision needed to establish structure at the atomic level. The users of
this instrument will explore varied topics, all involving the structure and
dynamics of large proteins or complexes of several proteins that require use of
a very high field instrument of the type to be purchased.&lt;br/&gt;
