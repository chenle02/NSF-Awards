This award provides funds to establish a Cooperative facilities Center for
Research on the Ecology of Spatial Heterogeneity at the University of Minnesota.
The facility will intergrate the tolls of geographic information systems, image
analysis, simulation models, and ecosystem analysis for research on the spatial
dynamics of ecosystems in relation to global climate change, herbivores,
cumulative impacts of disturbances, and Quaternary and bedrock geology. The
participants are a mulitidisciplinary group of researchers from three campuses
with expertise in wetland, riverine and forest ecosystems, Quaternary and
exploration geology, palynology, ecological modeling, air photo interpretation
and remote sensing, zoology, and forest economics. The facility will strengthen
collaboration among the researchers and provide a tool to address common
problems. The investigators are conducting meritorious research, have an
adequate publication record, and have extramural support.
