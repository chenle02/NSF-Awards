This research constitutes an exploratory investigation of the transferability of
concepts developed for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) to the control and
automation of fixed plant types of construction processes. The overall goal of
this research is the application of computer graphics, computer aided design and
drafting, computer controlled machine tools, robotics, and artificial
intelligence to the art of building with stone. In order to have a practical
framework for the study of fixed and semi-fixed plant construction automation,
the stone cutting process will be used as a context for the study.
