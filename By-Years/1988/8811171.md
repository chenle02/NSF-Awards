Chemical vapor decomposition (CVD) is one of the important techniques in the
fabrication of semiconductor and compound semiconductor materials which are
crucial in high speed electronics and supercomputer technology. Barrel reactor
is a commercial CVD reactor operating at atmospheric pressure or reduced
pressure. Unfortunately, uniformity in film deposition is a real concern in this
reactor. The flow patterns are three dimensional asymmetric. The objectives of
this proposed work are as follows. The first is to use state-of-the-art finite
element techniques in computational fluid dynamics to solve for the complex
reactive flows in a barrel reactor. Different finite element methods lead to
different consistent mass matrices. The goal is to find an algorithm which
provides an "optimal" consistent mass matrix with minimum numerical diffusion
and spurious oscillation. The developed algorithm will be used to study the
effects of gas flow rates, suspector rotating speed, gas nozzle locations,
substrate temperature and operating pressure on the deposition rate and
uniformity of existing reactors. It can also be used as a design tool for new
gas distribution system and reactor design.
