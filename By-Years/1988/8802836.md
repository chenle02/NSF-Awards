The research in this proposal is concerned with the theory of matrices and
operators. In operator theory the concern will be in operator valued functions
and the central theme will be factorization problems. Some of the topics are
analysis of spectral data of various classes of operator functions, synthesis of
an operator function in a given class given its spectral data, special
factorizations of self adjoint operator polynomials, correspondence between
factorizations of an analytic operator function with compact spectrum and
invariant subspaces of its linearization and local and global equivalence of
meromorphic operator functions. In matrix theory the problems will include
matrix completion problems, spectral distribution in qualitative matrix theory,
infinite dimensional spectral assignment problems, linear transformations that
preserve controllability, a generalization of the characteristic polynomial, and
analytic families of subspaces. A general goal will be the understanding of the
unifying structure which may support additional problem solutions in each area.
