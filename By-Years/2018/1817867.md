This work examines the evolution of two proteins that are widely distributed in
metazoan animals and underlie Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans - the beta-
secretase enzyme (BACE1) and the amyloid beta (A-beta) sequence. The main goal
is to understand when and how protein molecules evolve new functions over time.
Broader outcomes of this work include expanded access to STEM research for
underrepresented minorities and first generation undergraduate students, and
outreach to the broader community via a high school teaching module and a
popular science article. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gene duplications are believed to
be major facilitators of the evolution of novel protein function. BACE1 evolved
from a gene duplication event just after the origin of animals. At a later but
as yet unknown point in time, an APP gene duplicate evolved a novel BACE1
substrate motif (A-beta). This project traces back the functional evolutionary
history of the origin and interaction of these molecules and resolves, to the
most precise degree possible, when BACE1 and APP/A-beta evolved. Two specific
aims make up this research: (1) determining the functional origin of BACE1
activity, via a cell culture-based functional test and ELISA, to investigate
which species retain BACE1 enzymatic activity, and (2) determining the
functional origin of the APP beta cleavage site to determine which taxa retain
bona fide BACE1 substrates, using a cell culture-based functional test and mass
spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
