&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research are to synthesize and characterize
thin films of high resistivity undoped, and semi-conducting p- and n-doped
polycrystalline diamond and AlN thin films suitable for the fabrication of high
temperature electronic devices, and to investigate the fabrication of high
temperature microelectronic devices where silicon devices are not useful.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach consists of synthesis of diamond films by
microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and measurement of their
electrical and mechanical properties. The influence of process parameters on the
composition, crystal quality, mechanical strength, and the electrical properties
of the films will be studied. Advanced materials characterization techniques
will be used to characterize nanoscale microstructure, which will be related to
the properties of the films. Electrical properties such as I-V and C-V behaviors
and carrier concentration will be measured over a range of temperatures. Young?s
moduli will be measured on existing Michelson interferometer system. Fabrication
of devices such as Schottky diodes, pressure sensor, and a voltage multiplier
stack will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a broader scale, the
proposed research has potentials for enormous payoffs by developing electronics
for operation above 500oC for aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles and nuclear
reactors thereby reducing engine maintenance costs, and improving reliability
and performance efficiencies. An essential and important component of this
research will be to provide education and training of graduate students, post-
docs, and undergraduate seniors. In addition, minority/women and high school
students will be mentored and exposed to this research through programs at our
university. A significant outreach to high schools is proposed. &lt;br/&gt;
