There are two foci of this proposal. First, research on fundamental models of
distributed computing will be continued. The foundations of communication
protocols will be investigated using game automata, logics of knowledge and
time, and other suitable tools. The long range goal is to help develop
mathematical models and theories for protocols which will have the same footing
as the current accepted mathematical models and theories have for sequential and
parallel models. The second focus is to begin a new research effort into the
connectionist models of computation. There is hope, and even some evidence, that
the new connectionist models will revolutionize the way we compute. There are a
number of obvious differences between traditional models of computation and
connectionist models. The goal of this research is to investigate how deep these
differences are. A comparison of the traditional parallel models of computation
and the connectionist models will be used to determine if indeed the
connectionist models are an improvement over the traditional ones.
