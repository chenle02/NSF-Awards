An Engineering Research Equipment Grant is to be utilized in obtaining a
computer workstation and associated equipment for research in computational
fluid dynamics. Fluid flow and heat transfer are being modeled by this
investigator in three-dimensional complex geometries, aimed at control of drag
and enhancement of heat transfer. The capability of the investigator will be
greatly enhance with this equipment.
