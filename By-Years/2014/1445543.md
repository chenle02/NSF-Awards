The National Research Council in 2013 released the report Monitoring Progress
toward Successful K-12 STEM Education: A Nation Advancing?, which outlined 14
Indicators as well as the needed research and development to create a system to
monitor the quality of STEM education in the nation. This project is funded in
response to a Dear Colleague Letter request for research in the Promoting
Innovation in Measurement and Evaluation program focused on developing research
and tools to advance the nation's capability to measure these indicators. The
researchers in this project will engage an expert panel to identify key aspects
of the science practices articulated in the new college and career-readiness
standards, and develop and validate an instrument to be used as an indicator of
science classroom coverage of content and practices as articulated in the new
standards. This project will contribute to advancing knowledge about how to
measure students' opportunity to learn in science classrooms.

Research activities will be carried out in three phases. In phase one, an expert
panel will be convened in a modified-Delphi process to identify the key aspects
of science practices at different grade bands and domains of science. The
resulting framework will be used in phase two to develop selected-response
survey items for measuring teachers? use of the practices. In phase three of the
study, cognitive interviews, observations of teachers' classroom practices, and
factor analysis of a pilot test of the items will be conducted to validate the
measures. A user manual will be produced that includes evidence of the items'
validity and scale reliability so that the instrument might be used by other
researchers and contribute to future nationally representative studies.
