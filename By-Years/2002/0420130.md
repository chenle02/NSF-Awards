This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
non-invasive pH sensor to determine the pH of exhaled breath vapor to help
diagnose and treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The commercial application of this project will be on the diagnosis and
treatment of respiratory diseases. Acid reflux has been associated with asthma
and other inflammatory airway diseases. Current detection methods, such as
catheters, are invasive and require hospital visits. A simple non-invasive
detector would allow for broader screening and could be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of treatment modalities.
