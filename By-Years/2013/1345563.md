This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop the
first non-surgical cure for cholesteatoma. Cholesteatomas are congenital or
acquired lesions of the temporal bone that primarily affect the middle ear and
mastoid. These lesions are highly destructive and can cause deafness, dizziness,
facial nerve paralysis, brain abscess, meningitis, and death. Cholesteatomas
cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, there is no cure
for cholesteatoma but a costly surgery outside the reach of most of the
developing world population. The project is aimed at redirecting the cytotoxic
arsenal of a natural opportunistic pathogen of the human ear to destroy the
disease. The cytotoxic effects will be mediated by the bacterial injectosome, a
natural structure that can translocate toxins from the bacterium to the attached
host cells. At any time treatment can be interrupted by treatment with standard
antibiotics, since the technology will be sensitive to multiple antibiotics by
genetic design.

The broader impact of this project applies to a large portion of the world
population that suffers from morbidity and mortality related to CHST lacks
access to adequate treatment of this neoplasm. In the US, cholesteatoma is
especially a challenge for rural and indigent regions. In developing countries
the incidence of these lesions is much larger, since it is related to defective
access to advance medical care. The ultimate end result of our work will be a
novel therapy for cholesteatoma that will replace a costly surgery with an out-
patient, minimally invasive and cost competitive treatment. There is an urgent
need for new, simple, and affordable approaches in cholesteatoma treatment. The
proposed experiments will provide a first step in the development of a novel
treatment using bacterial robots that will significantly improve cholesteatoma
management, and ultimately could provide a complete cure at a fraction of the
current cost. If successful, this approach could be extended and applied to
other malignant epithelial growths.
