This project is an exploratory step into the development of new methodologies to
aid in the design for maintainability of computer-integrated manufacturing
systems. It will study the underlying sources of maintenance downtime and fault
diagnosis difficulty in computer-integrated production systems. The project has
two components. The first involves collecting and analyzing plant-based field
data on the amount of downtime associated with various kinds of failures,
including information on frequency of failures and the amount of downtime per
failue. The second component is an experimental study to understand what makes
these failures difficult to diagnose. The experimental study will utilize
professional troubleshooters to diagnose faults in a computer-based model of the
process control of a manufacturing cell.
