This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research Training Group in
Signal Transduction at Iowa State University. The faculty group is a mixture of
outstanding senior and junior investigators who come from a variety of
disciplinary backgrounds, but share a common interest in intra- and
extracellular signal transduction. The funds will provide stipends for graduate
students and postdoctoral trainees, will support research participation by
undergraduate students and will defray part of the cost of the trainees'
research. In addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized research
equipment to be used by trainees and to bring investigators from other research
and academic institutions to the campus for seminars and symposia. Signal
transduction within and between cells is fundamental to all types of cells and
plays a crucial role in normal cell development and function. Examples of signal
transduction might include the cell-cell interactions involved in development
and function of the nervous system, and the molecular mechanisms by which
extracellular signals effect temporary or permanent changes in the metabolism
and gene expression within individual cells. Typically, studies of signal
transduction are directed at any of a number of levels of cell organization,
from the atomic to the organismal. The faculty participating in this training
group study cells from a variety of organisms using a variety of biophyisical
and molecular biological techniques. By integrating their research programs and
training activities in these various areas, the group will promote a cross
fertilization of intellectual and experimental approaches that should provide a
superb experience for faculty and students alike.
