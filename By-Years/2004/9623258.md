9623258 Harte Vegetation feedbacks to climate change: extending results from an
ecosystem-warming experiment to landscape level. Predictions of global climate
change are based on models that largely ignore climate-ecosystem interactions.
Yet such interactions may potentially generate large positive or negative
feedbacks to the climate. For example, shifts in vegetative cover will alter
energy and water exchange with the atmosphere and could be a significant source
of feedback To quantify such feedbacks, a detailed and mechanistic understanding
of climate-ecosystem interactions on the scale of experimental plots is needed,
along with reliable methods for generalizing knowledge obtained from ecosystem
experimentation and natural climatic gradient analysis. This project will
combine manipulations with elevational transect studies to 1) deepen
understanding of mechanisms and contingent factors that shape climate-ecosystem
feedbacks, and 2) evaluate and improve the use of transect and manipulation
studies for extrapolating results about ecosystem response and feedback to the
landscape scale. The focus will be on a shift in dominant vegetation from forbs
to shrubs in subalpine meadow habitat in Colorado. This ecosystem response to
climate variation has been observed over four years of an experimental
simulation of climate warming. Correlations derived from monitoring vegetation
and climatic variables along an elevational gradient will be compared with
results from 1) the existing and continuing climate manipulation, 2) additional
climate manipulations and reciprocal transplants along the gradient, and 3)
interannual climatic variation within each data set.
