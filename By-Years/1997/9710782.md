This research investigates the structure and cause of sunspot penumbra. The
investigators use an inversion of data that couple high spatial resolution, high
spectral resolution, and the full polarization state of light from the solar
photosphere. This inversion allows them to determine the vector magnetic field
and the thermodynamic state in the line-forming region. Specifically,
investigators compare and contrast two inversion techniques: one that allows
multiple magnetic atmospheres and non-magnetic model atmosphere to contribute to
the detected signal; the second, a procedure that allows for bulk gradients in
the velocity field and magnetic vector within the model atmosphere. The more
successful inversion procedure dictates which model applies to interpreting
penumbral observations. Finally, the investigators answer how, why and when
penumbrae form in sunspot evolution. Results from the research paint a more
coherent physical picture of sunspot penumbrae, where knowledge has previously
been limited, to attempt understanding magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in the sun
(especially associated with sunspots).
