The Discussion group brought together national leaders from the sciences and the
humanities for a one day meeting to discuss general education in the nation's
colleges and universities. Included in the charge was the more specific question
of what role the federal agencies could best play in improving the general
education of all students. The participants strongly encouraged the agencies to
continue their joint work in this area.
