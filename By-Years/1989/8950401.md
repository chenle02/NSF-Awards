A newly constructed electron microscope suite will be equipped with a Joel
JMS-840 scanning electron microscope and ancillary equipment, in order to
introduce a new course on biological applications of electron microscopy. In
addition, new laboratory exercises in introductory courses and in other advanced
courses will provide a hands-on experience in electron microscopy. The
microscope will also be available for use in student research projects in
biology and geology. These curricular changes are expected to enhance student
interest in and create new opportunities for research careers. The college will
provide 50% matching funds.
