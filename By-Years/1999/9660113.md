*** ABSTRACT 9660113 Kostecki This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop a power electronic interface module to connect an energy
source to an inverter system connected in parallel to the utility system.
Specifically, this design effort will focus on such an interface module for
connecting a superconducting energy storage (Micro-SMES) system to an inverter
system. Higher magnet currents are needed to increase the power output level of
Micro-SMES systems. Design objectives include the evaluation of different
topologies and determination of the optimal solution. The ultimate power rating
will be up in the 5 to 10 MW range. One of the largest growing national and
global areas for Micro-SMES systems is the power quality market. Power quality
problems can be addressed in a range of customer locations or on the electric
utility system. A Micro-SMES system with a new interface module offers a unique
solution to these problems because of: 1) the ability to connect to a variety of
inverters; 2) paralleling devices increases the power rating; and 3) this higher
power rating combined with the parallel-connected inverters permits the
development of applications at the utility distribution system voltage level.
