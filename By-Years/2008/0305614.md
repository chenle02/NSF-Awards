The PIs will undertake a collaborative effort to establish a data management
system for the MARGINS Program with the objective to implement relational
databases to facilitate the four scientific initiatives of this program. They
will build upon wide-used geological, geophysical and oceanographic databases
that are presently being operated. They will start with metadata definitions and
standards using the NASA Directory Interchange Format and then ask for community
input to evaluate the system. They will then develop structured query language
database schemas, design tables, create forms and tools for the input of data,
give quality control to the input, populate tables and implement graphical
applications for browsing, query and visualization.
