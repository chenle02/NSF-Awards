This project is aimed at developing a three-dimensional seismic inverse model
and then using it to obtain information about the both three-dimensional
structure of the Greater Los Angeles Basin and the nature of fault rupture
during recent major Southern California earthquakes such as the Landers and
Northridge earthquakes. At the end of the project these tools will also be
applied to the Kanto Basin and the 1923 Kanto Earthquake. The project will
capitalize on both the recent and projected growth in seismic networks deployed
in Southern California and the increase in the capabilities of supercomputing
systems. The inverse problem is very large. Part of the project involves
structuring the inverse model so that it will run well on large parallel
systems. Most of this work will be done on single systems such as those
available at National Science Foundation and Department of Energy computing
centers; however, because the inverse model requires many iterations of forward
and adjoint runs, it has a coarse granularity that the investigators plan to
exploit by also deploying the inverse model on the distributed computing
environment of the Teragrid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term benefits of
this work are likely to be a better understanding of the geological structure of
the Greater Los Angeles Basin, a better understanding of fault rupture, and
improvements in the ability to predict strong ground motion. Sophisticated
seismic inversion tools of the sort developed here will help researchers gain
maximum benefit from the data that will start to come on-line in the next few
years from the United States Array.
