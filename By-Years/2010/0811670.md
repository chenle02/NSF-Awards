The mechanical movement inherent in the operation of the hard disk poses access
speed limits for many workloads and storage systems are consuming increasing
amounts of power. Flash memory overcomes some key limitations of the hard disk
including faster access to non-sequential data and significantly lower power
usage. Encouraged by these advantages offered by flash memory and the recent
emergence of high-capacity flash drives, this research will design and evaluate
a hybrid system. Named HybridStore, this system will exploit complementary
properties of these two media to provide improved performance, service
differentiation, and thermal/power behavior in enterprise-scale
storage.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;HybridStore will comprise a dynamic data
management solution that will adapt the use of available flash to workload
conditions. Techniques for improving performance (e.g., moving non-sequential
content to flash, use of flash as a write buffer) will be investigated. The
investigators will explore how flash can facilitate improved service
differentiation by reducing the variance of access times inherent in the
operation of disks. Finally, the the feasibility of selected replication of
popular content on disk and flash and diverting more IO traffic to flash during
periods of thermal emergencies will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. Power savings
resulting from opportunities to slow down disks, without compromising
performance, will also be explored. The investigators will implement a Linux-
based prototype Direct-Attached Storage HybridStore system that will manage a
hard disk drive and a SATA-enabled flash drive attached to the shared IO bus. To
explore other hybrid configurations (such as flash on disk or RAID controller),
a comprehensive simulator called HybridSim will be implemented. The PIs will
enhance the graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;curricula at Penn State with
topics related to this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
