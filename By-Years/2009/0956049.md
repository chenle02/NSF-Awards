Knowledge of how an organism looks, behaves and functions, i.e., its
"phenotype", is central to interpreting the interaction of underlying genes and
environmental effects. Representing phenotype in a way that can be linked to
thousands of molecular genetic and environmental databases, however, remains
difficult. The goal of this project is to establish a network of experts on
plant and animal phenotypes and on computer representation methods (ontologies)
from communities that are independently developing ways to represent and share
phenotypic data. Through this Research Coordination Network, scientists will be
brought together and their activities coordinated to: (1) develop standards and
best practices for accurate phenotype representations; (2) build key reference
ontologies for plants, vertebrates, and arthropods; and (3) cross reference
these ontologies so that key data can be easily shared and accessed.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinating scientific efforts so that effective linkages
are built into databases from the outset is an efficient and economical
mechanism to develop a data network. Plants and animals show complex integration
across genes, phenotype and environment, and a network of these data will enable
rapid scientific discovery and progress. This project also will reach out to
scientists who can use the data, help them link to it, and educate their
communities about these computational methods and their utility.
