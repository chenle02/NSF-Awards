The scanning electron microscope (SEM), used in the Composite Materials
Engineering program, affects the currently offered courses of Mechanical
Characterization Laboratory, Process Design I and II, Surface Analysis,
Composite Characterization Techniques, and Mechanics of Composites. The
equipment better prepares students through hands-on experience and provides
opportunities for undergraduate research activities. Also, new courses such as
Failure Analysis and Formulations which utilize scanning electron microscopy are
developed.
