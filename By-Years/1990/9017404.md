This project will analyze the Hf and Nd isotopic, and trace element
characteristics of different types of mantle materials and has three main goals:
1) to determine the Hf-Nd-isotopic compositions of peridotites. Abyssal
peridotites and peridotitic material from ocean islands and continents will be
studied to constrain the relationship between peridotites and mantle melts.
Furthermore, this study will attempt to constrain the ages of the Hf-depletions
which are a common occurrence in peridotites, and it will test whether Hf and Nd
isotopes are correlated in peridotite materials. 2) to evaluate the use of the
combined Hf-Nd isotope systems as indicators for degree and depth of melting of
mid-ocean ridge basalts as proposed by Salters and Hart (1989). These melt
parameters will be calibrated against those proposed by Klein and Langmuir
(1987; 1989). 3) to determine the extent of the MORB and OIB field on a Hf-Nd
isotope correlation diagram, with the goal of constraining the mixing
relationships between MORB and OIB.
