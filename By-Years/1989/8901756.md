This project is concerned with the study of basic problems in universal algebra
and lattice theory. The specific areas of investigation will be the study of the
complexity of certain algorithms in finitely presented lattices; modular
congruence varieties; the determination of a common generalization to Ore's and
Jonsson's theorems on direct decompositions; development of a computer algebra
system dealing with finitely presented lattices; and projective planes over
prime fields. Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure
reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic. This very weak
structure means that lattices can be found in many mathematical environments. It
also means that problems are easy to state, difficult to solve and of a very
general nature.
