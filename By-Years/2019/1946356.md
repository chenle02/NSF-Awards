The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to improve the combat effectiveness and safety of warfighters and law
enforcement officers by making their gunsights significantly more rugged and
reliable than current state of practice. The research and development conducted
under this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of
optical beam steering and optical guidance techniques applicable to broad fields
of science and engineering, such as astronomy, missile tracking, remote sensing
and self-driving cars.

The proposed project aims to develop an extremely rugged telescopic sight. Once
a telescopic sight is mounted on a rifle, it is necessary to adjust its “point
of aim” so that it corresponds to the “point of impact” where the bullet
actually hits the target. Most telescopic sights available today shift the
position of the crosshairs inside the sight to adjust the point of aim. Military
and hunting applications require adjustment precision of ½ of a minute of arc or
better. Because the turrets and the springs holding the crosshairs in
conventional gun sights are delicate mechanical pieces, conventional telescopic
sights lose their precision over time due to the rifle’s recoil and other
vibrations encountered during field use. This project will advance a completely
new design in which the crosshairs remain fixed while the image of the target
formed on the crosshairs is shifted optically. We will study the potential for
optical aberrations and mitigation techniques, then optimize the design for both
image quality and cost of manufacture.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
