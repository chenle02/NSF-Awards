The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Colloidal, Macromolecular and
Polyelectrolyte Solutions will be held at the Four Points Sheraton in Ventura,
California, February 3-8, 2008. The conference is organized to showcase some of
the most interesting and revolutionary advances in the field of colloids and
macromolecular solutions. The program assembles nationally and internationally
recognized diverse group of research leaders, 20 speakers from USA and 6
international speakers, on experimental and theoretical aspects of colloidal,
macromolecular and polyelectrolyte solutions. The format of the Gordon Research
Conferences allows participants ample opportunities for exchanging ideas and
networking. This format has significantly contributed to the success of new
researchers in a given field. The NSF funds are requested to support the
conference fees for the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral
research associates.
