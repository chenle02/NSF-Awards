This research is on cap type soil plasticity models derived from experience in
constitutive modeling of geological materials and will help answer the urgent
need to develop rational methods for the prediction of earthquake induced slope
failures. The research concentrates on the development of a cap model
specialized for seismic analysis. The resulting simplified model should be
adequate for dynamic slope stability analysis while, at the same time, easily
usable by a broad community of engineers. The research provides improved insight
into conventional methods of seismic slope stability analysis and into the
design of countermeasures to mitigate the damage due to slope failures. The
final results will involve a computational methodology that will be easily
incorporated into the practice using the computer software. This research is
being conducted under the Small Business Innovation Research program as Phase I
research.
