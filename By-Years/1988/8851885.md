Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is being introduced into the
undergraduate curriculum. The use of an FTIR affects more laboratory courses
than any other instrument that could be purchased by the department. In general
chemistry the students are being introduced to the matching of an unknown
spectra with a library. The characteristics and theory of FTIR are being studied
in Instrumental Analysis. The quantitative and qualitative aspects are being
used in organic, qualitative organic, polymer chemistry and in the undergraduate
research program. Physical characteristics of chemical bonding and kinetics are
being studied in physical chemistry and inorganic synthesis. The students are
gaining a deeper appreciation and broader perspective of modern high technology
which should increase their enthusiasm for chemistry. The technique which is
widely used in industry and graduate research is allowing the students to have
hands on experience using a computer controlled data manipulation device that is
one thousand times faster than a dispersive infrared instrument. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
