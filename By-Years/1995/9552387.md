The Psychology Department is developing a computer-based multimedia laboratory.
The department has a well-established research-based curriculum with an
independent senior research project at its focus. In the past, students began
their research training in the second year, with Research Methods in Psychology.
With the new facility, an Introductory Laboratory is added, requiring students
to begin their research training in their first semester. This laboratory
introduces students to the experimental nature of psychology at the beginning of
their college careers. The laboratory provides for multimedia-based presentation
of stimuli and nomothetic rather than idiographic analyses of data. The new
facilities also allow enhancement of existing upper-level laboratory classes.
Laboratory classes that benefit include experimental courses in Cognitive,
Sensation and Perception, and Social Psychology. The facility also provides an
expanded technological foundation for independently conducted senior research
projects.
