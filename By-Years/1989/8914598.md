Funding for controlled environment plant growth rooms is requested. There room
will provide consistent experimental material for plant biochemical and
molecular biological studies. Research will include: investigation on flowering
and the role of photoperiod-regulated genes, isolation of photoperiodically-
regulated genes form the Japanese morning glory plant, and overall gene
regulation studies.
