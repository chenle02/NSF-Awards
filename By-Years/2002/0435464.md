This project is investigating the design, feasibility, and applications of a
Flash-based template system, linked to digital libraries, to enable teachers to
easily assemble, assign, and customize online learning activities. Primarily
focusing on life science content appropriate to Grades 3-5, the project is
developing three computer-based interactive environments that reflect
children's' developmental growth. Using template formats to support concept
learning, children find, match, categorize, and arrange media objects from a
digital library. With another format, children explore and manipulate variables
within a model or micro world. A third template format supports scientific
observation, data gathering, and analysis. To evaluate and identify tools that
enhance the educational effectiveness of digital libraries for elementary
teachers and children, the study team is constructing a small online digital
collection to provide a research base. The prototype is also being linked to
other NSDL collection and service projects, and collaborations with other NSDL
projects are investigating the integration of a Flash-based template system into
the broader NSDL
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
