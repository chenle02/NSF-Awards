The advancement in electronics and personal computer technology has made a huge
impact on the experimental data collection and analysis process. To acquaint
undergraduate students with this new and powerful technique, a prototype data
acquisition system was successfully built and tested. It is now planned to
implement data acquisition systems into the curriculum. Five sets of data
acquisition systems will be introduced to approximately 100 juniors in the
Measurements Laboratory and will be utilized by 100 seniors in collecting and
analyzing data from the experiments on internal combustion engines, air
compressors, fuel injection systems, a wind tunnel, and a robot. A workshop on
personal computer-based data acquisition systems will be planned every year for
the science and engineering students and faculty from the other two universities
in the community.
