The purpose of this proposal is to study the magnetization of seamounts by
examining paleomagnetic data from seamounts and from an analysis of magnetic
properties of seamount rocks. Two types of samples will be used: dredged samples
from Jasper seamount and others and oriented cores from the exposure of an
uplifted seamount on the island of La Palma (Canary Is.). The PIs wish to
develop a first order data set on the magnetic properties of seamount rocks, to
determine the range of remanent and induced magnetization, to determine the
effects of weathering (age and oxidation), to examine the origin of remanence
and the importance of viscoremanent magnetization. This project is important
because an understanding of seamount magnetism is necessary if the history of
oceanic plates is to be determined. The in-depth study of Jasper Seamount, by
coupling paleomagnetic measurements with petrologic data and rock magnetic
properties, is a realistic first step toward this end.
