Professor John Dahler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies in five major
areas: 1) theory of collodial dispersions; 2) chemical reactions in small
molecule fluids; 3) polymer-related research; 4) transport and relaxation in
fluids; and 5) topics in collision theory. He will use formal theory
supplemented by computer simulations to study transport, relaxation and chemical
reactions in model fluid systems including polymers. %%% Since most chemical
reactions occur in solvent media in the liquid state, it is of key importance to
understand the influence the solvent exerts on the reactant solutes. There are a
number of molecular interactions which occur between the solute and the solvent,
and many of them can be modeled using a continuum rather than a discrete
molecular model for the solvent. Dahler's research focusses on theoretical
models for transport of solute molecules, including polymers, in a viscous
continuum medium.
