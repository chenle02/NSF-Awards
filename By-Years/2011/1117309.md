Graph expansion refers to the problem of partitioning a graph into two (or more)
large pieces while minimizing the size of the "interface" between them. Graph
partitions or separators are central objects of study in the theory of Markov
chains, geometric embeddings, etc., and are a natural algorithmic primitive in
numerous settings. Exact computation is NP-hard, so we are interested in
approximate solutions. Despite much work, the status of most expansion-type
problems is still open, in contrast to better-understood problems such as
MAX-3SAT. In recent years it has become clearer that expansion-like problems
hold the key to many of the remaining mysteries of approximation, such as the
unique games conjecture or UGC (formulated by Khot when he was the PI's graduate
student) and the Small-set expansion conjecture (formulated recently by
Raghavendra and Steuerer, and part of Steurer's 2010 dissertation supervised by
the PI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A principal goal of this award is to apply new
spectral (as in eigenvalues/eigenvectors) ideas to study graph expansion. These
ideas were introduced in the PI's recent coauthored work with Barak and Steurer
on subexponential algorithms for Unique Games problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award may result in transformative outcomes such as resolution of the unique
games conjecture, or new algorithms for graph partitioning based upon the full
spectrum (as opposed to algorithms using just the second eigenvector whose
limitations are well-known).
