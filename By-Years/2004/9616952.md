9616952 Bower, Rogerson In this project, the PIs will continue the investigation
of mechanisms of eddy (meddy) formation in the region of the Mediterranean
outflow. Analysis of float data from a field experiment (AMUSE: A Mediterranean
Undercurrent Seeding Experiment) will be continued, in conjunction with other
data sets, particularly using satellite altimetry. Process-oriented numerical
simulations will be used to address specific physical mechanisms associated with
meddy formation and propagation.
