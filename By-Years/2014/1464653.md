Purdue University is planning to join the I/UCRC on Biophotonic Sensors and
Systems (CBSS) as a new university site. CBSS has a goal to establish a national
center of excellence in biophotonic sensor and system research, cultivate
embryonic biosensor applications, develop methods for improved technology
transfer and train a pipeline of skilled engineers and scientist to work in this
field. Ultimately, CBSS intends to provide solutions for disease diagnosis,
patient monitoring, drug efficacy testing and improved food and water safety.
Purdue will expand the scope of corporate connections and brings exciting
complementary areas of research to support the CBSS mission. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The Purdue team will offer research topics including: compressive
optical imaging, flow cytometry, nonlinear optical microscopy, single cell
detection, biodynamic imaging of 3D tissues, and point of care medical devices.
These research topics fit perfectly with the current CBSS research thrusts and
roadmap areas of Imaging, Bioanalytics and Diagnositcs.&lt;br/&gt;The Purdue
Site Director (Dr. Ji-Xin Cheng) has extensive connections in industry that
include Olympus and Leica, which offer products in their portfolios based on his
inventions. Companies that intend to participate in the planning meeting include
companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson,Ocean Optics and Riverside Research,
which are committing to full membership.
