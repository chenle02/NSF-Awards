This award provides one-half the funds required for the acquisition of an
automated, multi-collector, gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometer that will
be installed and operated in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences
at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech is providing the remaining
funds needed. Research in progress in the Division of Geological and Planetary
Sciences requires a very large number of stable isotope analyses of natural
rocks, minerals, water samples, and organic materials. Some of these natural
samples are available only in very small quantities, and the new instrument is
needed to perform microanalyses on a large number of samples. A major research
emphasis of the analyses will be in the use of the isotopic signatures of
oxygen, hydrogen and carbon to decipher the history of water-rock interactions
in the Earth's crust and in investigations of the detailed mechanisms of
isotopic exchange between minerals and coexisting aqueous solutions.
