Words with more than one meaningful part can be described in two ways: as
independent lexical items or as the result of a rule that combines two morphemes
into a single word. Recent approaches without morphological rules describe
morphological patterns as phonological generalizations over a set of forms. Such
proposals have two consequences: (1) regularly inflected forms may be stored in
the lexicon, and (2) phonological factors should influence morphological
processing. The aim of the research project is to examine these consequences
using experiments-induced speech errors in three tasks: SLIPS (for phonological
errors), morphonaming (for morphological errors where an inflected form is the
target), and embedding (for morphological errors where the base form is the
target). The results may demonstrate that non-rule-based approaches are
unworkable, if they show that regular forms are not stored in the lexicon or
that phonological factors cannot underlie morphological effects. However, if the
results show that regular forms are stored and that phonological factors could
underlie morphological effects, then non-rule-based approaches will still be
workable.
