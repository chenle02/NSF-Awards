This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research on speech production
involves the research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
led by Joseph Perkell and Pascal Perrier's laboratory at the Institut National
Polytechnique de Grenoble, Grenoble, France. The objective of the research is to
investigate variations in speech that depend on speaking style and phonological
input within the same speaker. Articulatory, kinematic and acoustic data will be
collected on simple utterances at MIT. The French laboratory will use these data
to guide control of a simulation of the speech production apparatus. The project
takes advantage of a 2-D biomechanical/physiological model tongue developed by
the French investigators. It will advance fundamental understanding of speech
production.
