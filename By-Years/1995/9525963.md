This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in mechanics of
materials between Erland M. Schulson at the Ice Research Laboratory, Dartmouth
College, and Jerome Weiss at the Laboratory for Glaciology and Geophysics of the
Environment, French National Center for Scientific Research, Grenoble, France.
They propose to perform experimental studies on the nucleation of cracks in ice
under multiaxial compression. The experiments will include investigations of the
distinction between the effects of confinement and loading and the effects of
microstructure. The work will contribute to our understanding of the fracture of
ice and to our general understanding of fracture in other brittle materials. The
project takes advantage a `model` ice developed by the French laboratory using
unique techniques for controlling microstructure.
