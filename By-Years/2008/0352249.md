This project proposes interdisciplinary research on the origins of the Sami
people, their culture, language and prehistory. The research explores the
question of whether Sami people, currently perceived as a comparatively recent
migration of nomadic people, have a long-term presence and cultural development
in Scandinavia. The team of American, Swedish and Sami researchers will use
archaeology, historical research, linguistics and place name analyses to provide
insight into the social, economic and possibly cultural identity development of
the Sami in this region.
