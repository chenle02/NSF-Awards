This is a proposal to refurbish and upgrade an NMR spectrometer system to be
used for high resolution multinuclear studies of liquids. The spectrometer will
be used for a wide range of studies including metabolism in marine
invertebrates, molecular conformation in gramicidin, and interaction of metals
with organic polymers. A new magnet will be obtained that has higher field,
better homogeneity, and superior stability than the previous system. The
spectrometer console will be rebuilt to accommodate the different resonant
frequency of this new magnet. This will be a very cost effective way to provide
the required instrumental capacity for these studies.
