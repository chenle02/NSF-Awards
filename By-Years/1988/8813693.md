This action is a follow on to NSF CES-8708747, which concerns an investigation
of the stiffness loss in sands following a dynamic disturbance. On July 24,
1987, such a disturbance occurred during seismic oil prospecting, initiating a
road embankment slide and subsequent roadway collapse on Highway 94 in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, twelve miles west of the city of Munising. This
incident has the potential to generate valuable data relevant to the original
award. The incident occurred during standard seismic reflection profiling. Six
22 ton trucks were generating seismic signals for a reflection study by
vibrating the road surface. It is believed that the flow slide was initiated by
a liquefaction type failure. Shortly after the incident, Prof. Hryciw performed
the necessary field reconnaissance and obtained the relevant information and
data. This data are now being analyzed. It is expected that valuable information
relevant to the reduction in stiffness of cohesionless soils due to earthquake
loading can be extracted from the data obtained as a result of this seismic
profiling incident.
