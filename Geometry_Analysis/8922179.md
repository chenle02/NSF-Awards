The mathematics involved in these studies covers a broad spectrum from the
theory of integrable and almost integrable systems and rigorous analysis in
pde's to the more intuitive ideas best understood in a geometrical setting. In
many cases, and specifically in the investigations in convective patterns and
optics, real experiments are used as a guide to develop and check the validity
of models. In all cases, each theoretical investigation is accompanied by
extensive numerical experiments. An interactive environment (which is
significantly enhanced by many scientific visitors) makes Arizona an excellent
place for the training of students. Indeed, graduate students are heavily
involved in the research described in this proposal.
