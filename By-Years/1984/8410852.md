Adaptive control for nonlinear chemical processes is important for the efficient
operation of these processes. In this effort, one of the current adaptive
control theories will be tested on a team-water heat exchanger, a trickle bed
reactor, and a simulated absorber. The adaptive control theory used approximates
the system nonlinearities by quasi-linearizing the steady state equations or
steady state data describing the system. Slowly time varying process parameters
are estimated by a novel variable forgetting factor algorithm and systems with
unknown delay times and no minimum phase characteristics are stabilized by an
extended horizon control algorithm.
