The focus of research is the development of synthetic methodology based on the
use of axially chiral anilides. New routes for the preparation of anilides will
be studied and new reactions that transfer axial chirality from precursor to
product will be developed. Radical cyclizations, additions and hydrogen transfer
reactions will make up the initial foci of the work. Further, non-radical
reactions such as asymmetric organolithium and organopalladium cyclizations will
be studied. The research is designed to advance the understanding of the
synthesis, structure (including rotational behavior) and reactions of axially
chiral amides in order to expand the synthetic utility of this class of
compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dennis P.
Curran of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor
Curran will focus his work on developing methodology for the transfer of
chirality of synthetic precursors to new stereocenters in products. The work
represents a broad-based study of the structural features and synthetic
potential of a novel class of chiral anilides. The methodology has fundamental
importance and could lead to the production of novel catalysts, reagents and
synthetic intermediates of use to synthetic chemists and, beyond that, to the
pharmaceutical industry. The research also provides an appropriate venue for the
training of students at the graduate level.
