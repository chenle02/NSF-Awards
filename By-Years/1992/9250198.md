The Department of Chemistry is purchasing lasers, monochromators and associated
equipment to introduce Raman spectroscopy, fluoresence and fast kinetics into
the physical chemistry laboratory. Among the experiments involving laser-
induced phenomena that the students are performimg are: Raman spectroscopy in
condensed phases, fluorescence spectroscopy in gases, and the determination of
excited state lifetimes. The equipment is also being used by students engaged in
undergraduate research.
