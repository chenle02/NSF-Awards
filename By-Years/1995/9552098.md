In an effort to develop an ACS-approved polymer emphasis as part of the
Chemistry Program, the university is creating a polymer chemistry laboratory and
incorporating several polymer- related experiments throughout the curriculum.
The department is adding to its inventory of instrumentation a differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC) and the accessories necessary to convert one HPLC
into a GPC for polymer analysis. The DSC is being used for three experiments in
the polymer chemistry laboratory, one experiment in the advanced laboratory for
physical chemistry, and one experiment in the second semester organic chemistry
laboratory. The GPC is being used in two experiments in the polymer chemistry
laboratory, one experiment in the advanced laboratory for physical chemistry,
and one experiment in the analytical laboratory. The repeated use of these
instrumental methods is designed to maximize students' educational experience.
