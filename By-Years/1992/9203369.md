Ignoring the errors in the explanatory variables, as in classical least
squares, can introduce serious bias in the fitted function. This research will
incorporate partial information from various sources using either Bayesian or
frequentist techniques or combinations, will evaluate the resultant
methodologies, and will apply these methods to measurement error problems
arising in chemistry and environmental monitoring. Regression models describe
relationships among explanatory and response variables. When the explanatory
variables are also subject to random error, the regression model may be
systematically distorted unless special analyses are used. This research will
extend these special analyses to incorporate information about the reliability
of the explanatory variables. The new methods for analysis should find
application in chemistry and environmental monitoring (to be tried as part of
this research), astronomy, medicine and behavioral science.
