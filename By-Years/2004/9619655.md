Dr. Martin Minelli and other members of the Chemistry Department at Grinnell
College are being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry including
organometallic chemistry, electrochemistry, coordination chemistry,
biochemistry, polymer and organic chemistry. Students' communication skills are
enhanced through seminar presentations, poster sessions, and written reports.
Participants are recruited regionally, as well as from Grinnell College. ┬║%?╣¥
