The biological diversity of wildlife populations worldwide is threatened.
Population growth and man's ever-pressing need for natural resources is rapidly
causing the decline and extinction of many animal species. In general, the
scientific community agrees that new technologies which have been developed for
improving humankind could be valuable for helping to conserve wild species.
"Biotechnology", the collective term for those procedures useful for enhancing
reproducing and curing diseases in humans and domestic livestock, may be a first
line of defense in preserving endangered species. Presently, there are few
funding programs specifically designed to support research which could benefit
conservation of wildlife diversity. This two and one-half day workshop will
gather together experts in the fields of reproduction, genetics, population and
release biology, and stress and disease to discuss the most crucial areas of
wildlife research deserving federal and private support. Two days of the meeting
will concentrate on intense discussions and the preparation of a 15 to 20 page
paper which will identify and prioritize the various areas of research needed.
On the last half day of the workshop, leaders of the various discussion groups
will present their findings and answer questions from invited representatives of
federal and private funding organizations. The final workshop document will
serve as a guide for all funding organizations interested in supporting species
conservation.
