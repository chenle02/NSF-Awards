9408470 Dietrich The project will document the response to winter rainfall in
the areas of the recent wildfires in Southern California. The topography,
geology and climate of these sites will cause the erosional response to be large
and costly as in previous wildfires like the 1991 Oakland firestorm. The
objective of the work is to determine the appropriate mitigation measures to be
used after these events which occur in this region almost every year. In
addition to the broad documentation of the erosional response to the fire, the
project will collect field evidence on the effectiveness of the erosion control
measures taken, and will use this data to guide and evaluate a digital terrain
model for predicting landscape response to fire. This knowledge will improve the
understanding of the erosional process and the quality of the mitigation
measures to be taken. ***
