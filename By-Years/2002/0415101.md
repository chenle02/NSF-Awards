An audit log enumerates the changes, and often the accesses, that have been
applied to a database. Audit logs are considered good practice for business
systems, and are required by federal regulations for secure systems, drug
approval data, medical information disclosure, financial records, and electronic
voting. Given the central role of audit logs, it is critical that they are
correct and unalterable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanisms are developed, for
implementation within a database management system (DBMS), based on
cryptographically strong one-way hash functions, that prevent an intruder,
including an auditor or an employee or even an unknown bug within the DBMS
itself, from silently corrupting the audit log. The DBMS thus stores additional
information in the database to enable a separate audit log validator to examine
the database along with this extra information and state conclusively whether
the audit log has been compromised, thus supporting tamper detection. Using a
secure audit log replication protocol and the validator, tamperproof audit logs
result. Good performance is essential: tamperproof audit logs will only
realistically be used if their overhead is small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will enable an important and highly desirable capability to be added to
existing database management systems: tamperproof audit logs. By instituting
tamperproof audit logs, US federal regulations in many domains can be more
effectively applied, lending confidence to the business leaders, government
officials, and citizens who depend on these critical medical, financial, and
voting systems. The PI will work closely with vendors to ensure that the
approaches are consistent with existing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
work is being developed on the open-source BerkeleyDB and MySQL systems, as an
extension of these two systems and updates will be available via the project's
Web site (http://www.cs.arizona.edu/tau/Audit/).
