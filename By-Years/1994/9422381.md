9422381 Skjellum Distributed-memory computers have been available for about a
decade. Still, hard questions remain concerning the scalability of implicit
numerical methods, and new, alternative numerical methods, in order to gauge the
value of further, large-scale investment in parallelization of key applications.
Furthermore, algorithms, even if developed to be suitably scalable for certain
applications, must be represented in software cost-effectively in order to make
the massively parallel systems economical overall. Therefore, we seek to answer
fundamental questions about algorithms and software technology related to
implicit numerical integration methods, and more generally, about trade-offs
between concurrency and convergence of iterative methods.
