Charcoal is a natural byproduct of wildland and prescribed fire and is well
known as an important biochemical sorbent. Unfortunately, charcoal deposited
during fire has received little scientific attention. Ponderosa pine forests are
fire dependent ecosystems that are notoriously limited in productivity due to
low nitrogen (N) availability. Fire results in a short-term increase in
available N, but it appears that charcoal may dictate long-term N availability.
We will determine whether charcoal directly or indirectly enhances forest N
fertility. We will combine state-of-the-art soil microbiological and biochemical
methodologies with fire history research plots (USDA-NRI project) to assess the
influence of fire and fire exclusion on quantity and biophysical quality of
charcoal. The experiments will provide the first ever look at charcoal as a
mediator of nutrient dynamics in the Inland Northwest and are likely to have
broad impact as fire and charcoal are common to all temperate ecosystems.
