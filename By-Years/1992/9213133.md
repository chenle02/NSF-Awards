The video display capabilities of the Video Processing and Telecommunications
Laboratory will be upgraded using the resources of this award. The added
equipment will provide 24 bits of color and the capability for real time video
capture. This will be used in research involving the transmission of video
signals over fiber optic Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks. A
codec/packetizer for video data is planned.
