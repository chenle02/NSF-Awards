This project deals with diophantine approximation and value distribution theory
of holomorphic functions. Work by P. Vojta, C. Osgood, and others has shown that
these two fields are in fact connected by a formal analogy. This observation has
led to new conjectures, shorter proofs of old theorems, and proofs of new
theorems. This project will continue this trend, primarily working in the field
of diophantine approximation. Results whose proofs may be simplified include
finiteness theorems for rational points on abelian varieties and Faltings'
theorem on the finiteness of principally polarized abelian varieties over a
given field with finite reduction. New results which may be proved include
"moving targets" type results; i.e., diophantine approximation statements which
involve a slowly varying family of equations. A distant goal is the "abc
conjecture." Technical improvements in proofs using Thue's method will also be
pursued. This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number
Theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole
numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one
whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was
pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the
last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in
areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
