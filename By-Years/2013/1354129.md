A large of body of research suggests that two-way interactions between plants
and soils, known as plant-soil feedbacks, have major effects on the abundance
and distribution of plant species, and that soil bacteria and fungi are largely
responsible. This project will provide a large-scale test of these important
hypotheses. Plant-soil feedbacks will be measured in a large set of plant
species at sites with ongoing, long-term experiments on plant diversity and
productivity. The combined data will be used to construct models that relate
feedbacks to productivity. Linked genetic studies will help identify the
specific microbes that drive feedbacks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of the project include extensive training of students and outreach to
K-12 education, and clear applications to agriculture. The project plans to
train many undergraduate students, two Ph.D. students, and numerous high school
students. The research has relevance to food production and food security
because it is expected to identify key beneficial and harmful microbes and thus
improve our understanding of how soil microbes can be used to manage crop
growth.
