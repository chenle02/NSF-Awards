The investigator studies the averaging principle and effects related to large
deviations in dynamical systems. He considers perturbations of systems with
conservation laws, in particular, of Hamiltonian systems. If an integral of
motion has more than one well, the evolution of the slow variables occur on a
graph or, in the case of several first integrals, on an open book, and even pure
deterministic perturbations, in general, lead to stochasticity of the limiting
slow motion. In this case the investigator studies the limiting stochastic
process, in particular, he introduces a relative entropy and studies large
deviations. This allows to describe the motion of an incompressible 3D-fluid
which is close to a planar motion and reaction-diffusion-convection in such a
fluid. The investigators studies also stochastic resonance and metastability as
manifestation of large deviations.

Long-time effects caused by relatively small deterministic and stochastic
perturbations of a system are considered in this proposal. The investigator
considers problems, where various processes in the system have different rates
(fast and slow processes). This allows certain simplification and efficient
description of the long-time behavior. Another approach considered by the
investigator concerns systems, where long time behavior is defined by small
probability deviations from their typical behavior. These deviations, which have
very small probability on each fixed time interval, occur sooner or later and
define long time evolution of the system. Problems of this type arise in many
technical, physical, and biological systems as well as in sociological models.
