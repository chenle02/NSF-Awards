Electric power transmission systems are large electrical networks spread over a
vast geographic area that deliver electricity produced by thermal and hydro-
electric generators to the wide variety of customer loads distributed along the
network. Because these systems are so large and dispersed, it is extremely
difficult to know how the system is behaving at any moment in time. In spite of
extensive metering and powerful computers, the best we can do is estimate the
state of the power system. Since certain electrical laws must be obeyed that
constrain and govern its behavior, and we are seeking the best estimate given an
abundance of telemetered measurements, we can write the State Estimation problem
as a very large optimization problem that seeks to determine the most likely
electrical state of the network given the data available. Current power system
State Estimators solve a simplified optimization problem that ignores certain
aspects of a real utility's practice. For example, common system devices such as
transformer taps, phase shifters, or series capacitors are either treated as
fixed variables or are heuristically accommodated in the optimization process.
Physically discrete variables and inequality constraints imposed by physical or
operational limits are ignored. Current solution methods are based on first
derivative information and ignore the important effects of second derivatives
which can have a profound impact on computational robustness. These shortcomings
have resulted in an industry-wide dissatisfaction with the current state- of-
the-art, in spite of significant gains in computational speed made by
algorithmic research and faster computers. We propose to construct a State
Estimation model that directly includes essential characteristics that are now
ignored, with the premise that a more accurate and robust model is of greater
concern than a faster solution method. A software prototype for numerical
experimentation is proposed, which will also serve as a benchmark debugger for
commercial software development in Phase II.
