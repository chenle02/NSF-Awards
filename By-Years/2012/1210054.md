This action funds Graham Kent of University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign to
conduct a research project, entitled "Linking Chinese agricultural practices to
increased production and environmental integrity," during the summer of 2012 at
China Agricultural University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Dr.
Daoliang Li.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the use of both
underutilized and new remote sensing and geographic information system
technologies to identify optimal agricultural production strategies.
Conservation and production strategies to improve water quality are a key
component in improving these strategies. Steadily increasing demand for
agricultural products to satisfy the diverse needs of a growing population for
food, fiber and now fuel has long been the main driver behind agricultural water
use. Poor water quality contributes to diminished productivity, increased
treatment costs, damaged global ecosystems, and increased health risks to
humans.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
