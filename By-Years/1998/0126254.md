The project develops an integrated laboratory for state-of-the-art circuit
design and implementation using a CAD system and printed circuit board (PCB)
prototyping. It is based on similar programs at several other universities. The
laboratory is being integrated into the sequence of digital design courses so
that the material is introduced gradually. The evaluation plan compares the
complexity, performance, design time, and packaging of past senior design
projects to those developed using the new laboratory. In addition they will use
course evaluation, senior exit interviews, and alumni surveys to evaluate the
usefulness of the CAD and PCB training. They plan to post laboratory manuals and
examples of design projects on the web and to publish noteworthy outcomes with
journal and conference publications.
