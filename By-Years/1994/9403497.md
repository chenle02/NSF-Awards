9403497 Nolen Colgate University With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program
Professor Nolen of Colgate University will construct using self-assembly
procedures structurally well-defined supramolecular complexes based upon triply
hydrogen bonded associations. A primary goal is the synthesis of a self-
assembled macrocyclic structure containing six components that is called a
supramolecular hexnut. Undergraduates will be involved in the synthesis and
characterization of these compounds and their properties will be studied by NMR,
UV/vis, fluorescence,vapor phase osmometry, and gel-permeation chromatography. A
variety of large, complex organic compounds will be made that have the unique
properties of association by interactions that are called non-covalent bonds.
These structures will mimic the behavior of molecules like DNA that also
associate through non-covalent bonds. An understanding of this non-covalent
interaction will allow scientists to design new compounds that can self
replicate and enhance understanding of biochemical processes including energy
transfer, replication, and enzyme catalysis.
