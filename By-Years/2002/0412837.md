The subject of geometry and deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds
&lt;br/&gt;has seen considerable change and advancement over the last three
years. &lt;br/&gt;Central conjectures have been resolved, presenting a
significant need and &lt;br/&gt;opportunity for results to be disseminated and
absorbed and for new &lt;br/&gt;directions to be evaluated. The Department of
Mathematics at Wesleyan &lt;br/&gt;University is holding a special semester on
the topic of Hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;Manifolds and Geometric Analysis in the Fall
of 2004. The department has &lt;br/&gt;already invited Professor Richard Canary
of the University of Michigan as &lt;br/&gt;distinguished visiting professor for
the Fall semester 2004. Wesleyan &lt;br/&gt;faculty members Petra Bonfert-Taylor
and Edward Taylor will also be &lt;br/&gt;leaders and organizers of this special
semester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A centerpiece of the special semester will be a
three-day conference to be &lt;br/&gt;held in October 2004. This conference will
gather many of the originators &lt;br/&gt;of the recent exciting advances in
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. It is expected &lt;br/&gt;that this conference will draw
many graduate students and young &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians from the area, as
well as established researchers in the &lt;br/&gt;field. The conference will be
preceded by a one-day workshop for graduate &lt;br/&gt;students. The department
further plans to invite a series of longer-term &lt;br/&gt;visitors, to enable
more sustained research activity. It is hoped that &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic
geometers and geometric analysts from the area will also be &lt;br/&gt;involved
in the special semester on an ongoing basis. For the finale of &lt;br/&gt;this
special semester Wesleyan University will host a public lecture
&lt;br/&gt;designed to be accessible to the entire Wesleyan
community.&lt;br/&gt;
