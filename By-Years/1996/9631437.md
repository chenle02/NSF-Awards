Elmore, David Purdue U. This research will use cosmogenic nuclide techniques to
address a classic issue in mountain geography-the spatial pattern of valley-
scale glacial erosion. The debate which centers about the mechanics of process
in the formation of glacial landforms is unresolved. A constraint has been the
lack of reliable knowledge of the pre-glacial form. Cosmogenic radionuclides in
rock do provide information about past erosion of material from the rock
surfaces. This information coupled with approaches that predict the spatial
pattern of erosion as a function of erosion mechanisms and controls can provide
new understanding of valley-scale erosion patterns and processes. To test the
approach, cosmogenic nuclide techniques will be used to measure bedrock loss at
study sites in the Middle Popo Agie drainage basin, Wyoming and the South Yuba
River Gorge, California. The research will demonstrate how cosmogenic nuclide
approaches can be used to reconstruct large-scale patterns of bedrock erosion.
The results will enhance our understanding of valley-scale topography and
provide new information on the role of landscape development in altering the
relationship between climate change and glaciation.
