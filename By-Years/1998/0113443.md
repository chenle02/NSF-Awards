EIA-0113443&lt;br/&gt;Winfree, Erik&lt;br/&gt;California Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Biomolecular Computing by DNA/Enzyme
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Erik Winfree and Dr. Hideo Mabuchi are working
together to develop techniques and instruments for high-precision quantitative
analysis of the DNA molecular devices. These are being designed, characterized
and optimized to investigate issues such as robustness and error-tolerance of
these DNA molecular devices. The technical objectives being achieved in this
project are: development of spFRET instrument capable of counting individual
photons from single molecules; characterization of conformal states, kinetics,
and thermodynamics of DNA switches; characterization of the activities of two
enzymes, RNAP and RNase, on the DNA switches; development of stochastic models
of in vitro transcriptional circuits; and investigation of robust algorithms and
error-control for transcriptional circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this
project, the PIs are establishing a set of experimental systems and techniques
for exploring computation by biological molecules. This will provide fundamental
knowledge and principles for nanoscale computation, such as models of
computation, molecular algorithms, physical limits, sources of error and error
correction strategies. Thus the aim is to leverage the advanced control over
biochemical systems to begin establishing a broader foundation for reliable
molecular computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
