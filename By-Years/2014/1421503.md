Regression testing is important as it checks that changes to software do not
break previously working functionality. However, regression testing is expensive
as it requires executing a large number of tests and inspecting their failed
runs. To speed up regression testing, researchers have proposed many techniques,
including test selection (which, given a set of tests and software changes,
selects a subset of tests that are affected by the changes) and test-suite
reduction (which identifies what tests can be removed from a test suite without
substantially reducing its fault-detection capability). While some of those
techniques have been successful in practice, there is a lot of opportunity to
further improve regression testing by alleviating the assumptions upon which the
existing techniques are built.

Specifically, this project improves regression testing by revisiting these six
assumptions: (1) tests are not deterministic (but depend on timing, environment,
or concurrency), (2) code histories are not linear (but convoluted graphs of
branches and merges), (3) test selection is relevant not only for large projects
(but developers manually select tests even for small projects), (4) test-suite
reduction can decrease fault-detection capability in one version (but can
decrease even more in future versions), (5) tests depend not only on code (but
also on non-code artifacts), and (6) tests depend not only on manually written
artifacts (but also on automatically generated artifacts). The broader impacts
of improving regression testing are to increase the speed of software
development and improve the quality of developed software.
