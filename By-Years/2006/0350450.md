0350450&lt;br/&gt;Marechaux&lt;br/&gt;The Biomedical Engineering Materials and
Applications (BEMA) Roundtable (BEMA) provides a forum for identifying major
opportunities for applying engineering principles to create and improve clinical
performance of medically useful materials and devices, including implants, as
well as for discussion of strategies for overcoming obstacles-technical, legal,
or cultural-that impede transition of new materials and devices to clinical
application. The members of BEMA are high-level representatives of industry,
academia and government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roundtable is a joint
activity of the Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences' National
Materials Advisory Board and the Institute of Medicine's Health Sciences Policy
Program within The Natinal Academies. The roundtable does not provide advice or
recommendations on any specific issue or policy pending before any government
agency. However, workshop proceedings consisting solely of speaker presentations
can be published and disseminated and formal studies that could be developed by
the Academy may be proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general objectives of the
Biomedical Engineering Materials and Applications Roundtable (BEMA) are to: (1)
provide a neutral setting for the exchange of information about issues related
to biomaterials science, research, and practice; (2) identify and discuss
priority issues in the general areas of biomaterials and their use in the
development, manufacture and application of medical devices; and (3) conduct
problem-solving and issue-identification activities such as workshops that would
address issues in greater depth. The Roundtable will facilitate the achievement
of these objectives by its continuity over time, the unofficial nature of its
deliberations, the neutrality of the NRC/IOM auspices, and the moderating
influence of members who have no immediate stake in the outcome of the
Roundtable's discussions.&lt;br/&gt;
