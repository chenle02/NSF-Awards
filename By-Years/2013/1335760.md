In an effort to reduce emissions and fuel consumption, next generation ground
transportation engines are expected to operate on cycles that employ Low
Temperature Combustion (LTC). However, the underlying chemical kinetics and rate
limiting steps in LTC have not been directly explored because of an inability to
measure the key chemical constituents, hydroperoxy (HO2) and alkylperoxy (RO2)
radicals, that control the process. In this study, a new laser absorption
diagnostic combining two more traditional techniques will be employed to
overcome this measurement problem and allow direct measurement of these peroxy
radicals at preignition conditions, with the goal of developing a fundamental
understanding of the underlying chemistry. The new diagnostic, cavity enhanced
magneto-optical rotation (CEMOR), combines cavity enhanced ringdown spectroscopy
which provides the sensitivity to measure the radicals and magneto-optic
rotation which provides the selectivity necessary to eliminate interference from
other compounds with similar absorption characteristics. This work will aid in
the design of the next generation engine systems with increased efficiency and
reduced emissions. The broader impact of the work will include training students
in combustion science and state-of-the-art optical diagnostics techniques. The
data collected in this effort will provide necessary information to further
understand combustion chemistry, its role in the generation of greenhouse gases,
and the subsequent effect on climate change. Efforts will be made to enhance
minority student recruitment and participation in research and graduate
education. Outreach activities include NSF's RET and REU site programs.
