The objectives of the proposed research are to developed an optimum design
approach for permanent magnet brushless dc machines. Issues such as geometric
complexities, configuration, armature reaction effects and nonlinear
characteristics of the ferromagnetic materials will be addressed in the
development of the modeling and optimum design procedures. The approach will be
a nonlinear programming approach based on constrained optimization techniques.
It is anticipated that the magnetic field will be solved by use of finite-
element techniques, with an initial low degree of discretization meshes. The
degree of discretization meshes will be increased with convergence of the
optimum solution, for high accuracy and computing speed. Once an algorithm is
developed to obtain the optimum design parameters, the performance of the system
will be evaluated and compared with conventional design techniques. Feasibility
and efficiency will be taken into consideration throughout the research project.
