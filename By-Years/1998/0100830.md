This award will help obtain annual-to-decadal resolution records of abrupt
climate change preserved in varved and finely laminated fossiliferous lake
sediments from western and southern Europe. Stratigraphic sections in Pianico,
Italy, archived cores from Grande Pile, France, and new cores from Bispingen and
Krumbach, Germany and Ribains, France will be examined using multiple biotic
(i.e., pollen, diatoms) and abiotic (i.e., clay and silica mineralogy, magnetic
susceptibility) climate proxies to obtain high-resolution signals of atmospheric
cooling at the end of the last interglacial period. Such records will provide
new insights into the physical mechanism underlying the transition from warm to
cool climatic conditions at the last interglacial transition.

Furthermore, these terrestrial records will be compared with marine records to
investigate the validity of the conceptual model that links persistent warm low-
middle latitude sea-surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere with
concurrent decreasing temperatures and sea ice formation at higher northern
latitudes.

In the process of developing new data, ideas, and insights surrounding abrupt
climate change, the research will also help develop new collaborations with
international colleagues working in this intellectual area and enhance the
sharing of scientific data and ideas.
