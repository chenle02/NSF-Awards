0121563&lt;br/&gt;Ostrom &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program
award will support thesis dissertation research by Dr. Maria Angelica Toniolo
under the direction of Dr. Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University-Bloomington and
in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Nepstad of the Intituto de Pesquisa Ambiental
da Amazonia (IPAM). Ms. Toniolo plans to explore the impact of different
property regimes on the incidence of accidental fires in smallholder communities
in Tapajos National Park in the Santarem region of Para state in north central
Brazil. The ultimate objective of this comparative study is to produce a
rigorous assessment of the relationship between accidental fires, small farming
practices, forest fragmentation, and property regimes and, thereby, contribute
to the understanding of deforestation processes and the formulation of
conservation policy in the Amazon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this proposal
will be relevant for improving current understanding of the underlying
interactions among land tenure, decision making regarding land use and
management of accidental fires. It will allow for the creation of a fire-risk
map at the farm-community level, which can be used to indicate and minimize risk
in areas that need special attention in terms of fire prevention. The study will
apply two different approaches based on Geographic Information System (GIS) to
model the likelihood of accidental fires at the farm community level. It will
also add new information to the National Program of Prevention and Control of
Fires in the Deforestation Arch (PROARCO) and to the Large-Scale Biosphere-
Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA).&lt;br/&gt;
