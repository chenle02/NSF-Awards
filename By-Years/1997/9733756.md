Abstract - Larsen - 9733756 Prof. Gustavo Larsen of U. Nebraska-Lincoln proposes
to molecularly imprint transition metal oxides in order to impart them molecular
recognition capabilities for catalytic reactions. Zircona and titania surfaces
will be imprinted by means of templating with dibenzamide, alpha-phenyl
propionic acid, or N-benzoylbenzensulfonamide, and will be doped with Cr metal
when H-dissociation activity is needed. They will be characterized
gravimetrically, with infrared spectroscopy, by temperature-programmed
desorption of alcohols, and by probe reactions to test for chiral selectivity
(dehydration or oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols, and hydrogenation of
alpha-phenyl propionic acid). The fundamental parameters governing the
imprinting of zirconia and the stability at reaction conditions wll be
identified. The research will lead to new knowledge that helps a critical area
of heterogeneous catalysis: the ability to design catalysts with ultra-high
selectivity. If completely successful, the work will impact the fine chemical
industries, including pharmaceutical and agrochemical processes. The educational
plan is a comprehensive agenda of activities that may highly affect the
scientific human infrastructure in the State of Nebraska. Part of the
educational plan is targeted to junior and senior high-school students, who will
be exposed to national laboratory and university research, and thus may will be
exposed to national laboratory and university research, and thus may
increasingly choose a career in science or engineering. Some effort will be
applied to the insertion of international students in the American system and
the enhancement of international collaborations. In addition, the teaching plan
involves research experiences for undergraduate students as well as course
development.
