The aim of this project is to upgrade the existing Human Development Lab and
enhance courses in developmental psychology. social psychology, and research
methods. The proposed improvements will enable introductory and advanced level
students to gain hands on experience using video and audio recording equipment
combined with a variety of techniques for data collection and analysis to
investigate a wider range of topics. This project will improve the quality of
the education and training students taking our courses receive and will assist
us in preparing greater numbers of our majors for graduate education and
research in the behavioral sciences.
