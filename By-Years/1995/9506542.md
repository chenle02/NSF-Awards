Dissertation Improvement Research: Flexible Specialization and Specialty Wood
Products in the Rural Northwest This project identifies several groups of
specialty wood products producers in a four-state Northwest region and examines
firm behavior within and between clusters. The study will develop important
empirical knowledge about the shape of flexible specialization in this prominent
rural industry and lead to the development of theory relevant to the conditions
found in the Northwest wood products industry. Most recent research on flexible
specialization has concentrated on change in urban mass production industries.
This proposal examines how clusters of rural firms may be generating collective
efficiencies. The goal is to make a significant contribution to understanding
the nature of industrial diversification in this peripheral and largely non-
industrialized region in this age of industrial flexibility.
