With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professors Christine Hughey and Stephen Lucas and their groups
will explore the fundamentals of negative ion electrospray ionization, an
ionization technique that selectively charges acidic molecules by deprotonation
prior to mass spectrometric detection. Specifically, the researchers will
investigate the mechanisms of ionization under different pH regimes and develop
a multivariate model that will predict response for physiochemically diverse
acidic analytes under different solution/pH conditions. In pursuit of these
objectives, the team will test the hypothesis that analyte physiochemical
properties have a greater impact on ionization efficiency than the route of ion
formation. Since James Madison University is a predominately undergraduate
institution (PUI), undergraduate chemistry and mathematics majors will conduct
the research proposed and, in doing so, will learn how to effectively
collaborate and communicate across disciplines. In addition, Professors Hughey
and Lucas have a demonstrated track record with the involvement of women and the
deaf in their research. The groups will continue to be an integral part of the
research project.
