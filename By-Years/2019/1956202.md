In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B
Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Electronic and Photonic Materials
Program of the Division of Materials Research, Professor Jacob W. Ciszek of the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Loyola University Chicago is
creating novel chemical solutions to processing issues associated with organic
semiconductors. Organic semiconductors power modern electronics, for example the
organic light emitting diodes in OLED TVs and cell phone displays. This research
helps these materials reach their full potential by developing surface chemistry
that can addresses flaws at the interface between the semiconductors and applied
metal electrodes/contacts. Research also contributes to the fundamental
understanding of the surface phenomena which are the important first step in the
reactions of all molecular materials. The project also continues the Emerging
Scientist Workshop, which immerses high school students in actual experiments
performed by the host laboratories, and provides information on a broad spectrum
of scientific fields, and advice on scientific
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monolayers on classical solid substrates (Alumina,
Silicon, Silicon oxide, etc.) were developed decades ago but have not been
developed for the new molecular thin films utilized in many modern electronic
devices. Accordingly, this project develops monolayers for two molecular
surfaces, 2,2สน,2สนสน-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi,
a benchmark OLED material) and pentacene (the organic field effect transistor
benchmark) via vapor dosing of the reactants onto the solid surface. Chemical
challenges include molecular orientation within the substrate which dictates
reactivity and surface defect nucleation of reactivity generating non-uniform
coverages. Upon successful development of reaction, molecular series are
utilized to eliminate metal penetration issues for top contacts deposited onto
TPBi, while reactions on pentacene are utilized to increase conductivity in
devices. In the latter, the molecular series is designed to elucidate the
mechanism behind increased conductance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
