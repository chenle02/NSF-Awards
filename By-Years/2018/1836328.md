Ice Drilling Program Organization (IDPO)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
provides support to the Ice Drilling Program Organization (IDPO) to provide
community leadership and to operate and maintain a facility to support ice
drilling engineering, field support, and education and outreach. The
intellectual merit of this project is embodied in the four closely linked
leadership goals of this project which include: 1) producing and maintaining
long-term and short-term integrated science and drilling technology plans in
collaboration with the U.S. and international ice coring and drilling research
communities, 2) providing field support with drilling equipment and expertise to
support NSF-funded science, 3) identifying new technology needs and seeking
funding for technology development and acquisition, and 4) enhancing
communication and information exchange related to ice coring and drilling
science and technology within the US and international ice science community.
These goals relate to the importance of evidence from the polar ice sheets from
ice cores into, and boreholes to the subglacial aqueous environment or bedrock,
which has led to many important discoveries that have revolutionized climate
science. These discoveries have also had important impacts on policy and thus
also have societal relevance. Continued U.S. scientific leadership in this area
depends critically not only on the support of scientists doing this research but
also on the continued support of a dedicated facility to provide the field
drilling support and accomplish engineering and technology development
activities. This program and its education and public outreach activities will
nurture the inclusion of students of many ages, races, and genders, will help to
launch graduate students into promising careers, and the resulting scientific
discoveries will benefit all citizens. Achieving the goals of this project will
enable the U.S. ice science research community to realize implementation of
their national and internationally-coordinated scientific goals, lead the world
in ice science discoveries, nurture the education and development of the next
generation of scientists and engineers, and help to communicate the importance
of the discoveries to all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
