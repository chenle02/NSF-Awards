The proposed project will develop Visualization and Analysis of C Code Security
(VACCS) tool to assist students with learning secure code programming. The
proposal addresses the critical issue of learning secure coding through the
development of a system for analyzing and visualizing C code and associated
learning materials. VACCS will utilize static and dynamic program analysis to
detect security vulnerabilities and warn programmers about the potential errors
in their code. The research team has a significant experience in using
visualization to teach computer science in such areas as parallel computing,
geometric modeling and data encryption. The project will develop visualization
and animation of common security vulnerabilities that can be customized for
programmers with different level of programming experience. The project will
evaluate the effectiveness of VACCS and instructional materials to improve
students' learning of secure coding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this
research will provide a better understanding of the visualization impact on
secure programming instruction within a computing curriculum, as well as a
deployable VACCS tool for faculty to adopt. This research will inform the
broader community on the visualization potential for positive effects on the
quality of code developed by future computer scientists. The VACCS tool and
educational materials including tutorials, lectures, projects and extensive
examples of teaching secure software development will be disseminated to
academic computing community. In addition, this project will teach students how
to perform software security audits using VACCS and will train graduate students
in the art of teaching computer security.
