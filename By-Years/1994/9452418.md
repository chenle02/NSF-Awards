9452418 King The goal of the Harvey Mudd College Engineering Department is to
assemble a Design Center which allows product and process design via software
simulation. We expect our design center to be capable of down loading data files
to appropriate manufacturing equipment for prototype manufacture. Further, the
Center will be capable of collecting test data from the manufactured prototypes
to compare with predicted simulations. We have assembled the equipment and
software needed to perform computer simulations in mechanical, electrical and
chemical engineering fields. We have also acquired several data acquisition
systems. Funding is now requested to expand the Design Center to incorporate
manufacturing capabilities. Specifically, we request money for a three axis CNC
mill and an automated circuit board manufacturing machine. The acquisition of
this equipment will allow us to continue our development of a coherent
engineering training discipline rooted solidly in design. By providing our
students with the capabilities of performing simulation, manufacturing, and
testing while teaching them engineering fundamentals, we can continue to develop
broad-based engineers well-practiced in the art of engineering design.
