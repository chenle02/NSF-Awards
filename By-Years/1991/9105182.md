The objectives of this research are: (1) modeling and observational studies of
intense downdrafts. This will involve extensions to the one-dimensional models
already in existence, completion and extension of work on the modeling of
axially symmetric downdrafts including detailed microphysics. An extension to
three dimensions and inclusion of more complete microphysics (drop coalescence
and breakup in addition to melting and evaporation) in all the models is
anticipated. The results of the various models will be compared with radar and,
in particular, surface meteorological data; (2) A comparison of ZDR measured by
a radar, with that calculated from the drop size distribution inferred from
profiler observations, and studies of the size spectra of raindrops and raindrop
oscillations by means of profiler observations; (3) Numerical simulations and
theoretical studies of a dual-radar method of measurement of rainwater content
and rainfall rate and tests of the method against observations; and (4) A
theoretical calculation of the growth of drops by condensation in very slow
updrafts, as in stratiform clouds.
