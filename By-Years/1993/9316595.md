9316595 Monaghan This award provides one-half the funding required to acquire a
low-energy gamma-ray detection and counting system that will be installed and
operated by the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurements Laboratory, or PRIME Lab.
Purdue University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for
acquisition of this equipment system. The soil samples and aerosol particles to
be studied with this system contain radionuclides of beryllium, caesium, and
lead which can be used to track aerosol particle movements in the atmosphere and
their deposition patterns on the earth's surface. The Principal Investigator and
colleagues in PRIME Lab are active in research using these tracers to determine
the mechanisms and rates of soil development and mixing of soils on the earth's
surface. ***
