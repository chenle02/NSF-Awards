The Environmental Engineering department at Montana College of Mineral Science
and Technology is developing an undergraduate laboratory where students acquire
experience in full-scale projects which merge design, experimental preparation,
field work, laboratory work, group participation, and data analysis. The Sulfur
Hexafluoride (SF6) Tracer Laboratory improves the students' understanding of air
pollution while providing them with hands-on project experience. The equipment
in the SF6 Laboratory consists of six subsystems: a system for releasing SF6 gas
at a controlled, metered rate; samplers for collecting time-integrated air
samples downwind of the source; an SF6 analyzer for continuously monitoring
tracer concentrations and for analyzing the time-integrated air samples; a
calibration system; a meteorological system for measuring the winds and the
ambient temperature during field studies; and a portable data acquisition system
for collecting and processing the meteorological and concentration data. The
equipment is intended for full-scale experimentation in areas which are critical
to environmental engineering. As examples, in the SF6 Laboratory students can
study the transport and diffusion of air contaminants, develop and apply
laboratory skills in a field setting, study building ventilation requirements,
and test effectiveness of existing ventilation systems.
