The methods of experimental petrology an geochemistry will be applied to
oceanic volcanic rocks to understand their compositional variations, their
relation to coeval plutonic geochemical characterization, phase equilibrium, and
experimental characterized suites of rocks from the East Pacific Rise at 21 N
will be undertaken in an effort to resolve the apparent conflict between geology
and geochemistry about the merits of a shallow magma reservoir and the scale of
magma supply variations. In addition, high pressure research on perousicite
fractionation and loivine floatation and its implications as a source region for
mid-ocean ridge basalts will be initiated. Finally, continued work on boundary
layer fractionation models will be carried out. %%% Understanding magmatic
diversity among mid-ocean ridge basalts is a first order problem in ocean crust
petrology. The experiments to be carried out in this project will help unravel
some of the complicated processes that may give rise to compositional variations
among mid-ocean ridge basalts.
