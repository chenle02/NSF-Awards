A series of numerical simulations of the circulation of the North Atlantic will
be conducted using the Miami isopycnic coordinate model. The high-resolution
runs for the North Atlantic will be compared to the results obtained by other
modeling efforts, namely the Community Modeling Experiment (CME) performed with
the level model developed at Princeton's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.
This comparison is done in the context of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE).
