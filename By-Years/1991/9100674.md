The principal investigator will continue his research on the variational
bicomplex. This theory was first introduced approximately fifteen years ago to
provide a uniform approach to multi-integral problems in the calculus of
variations. The bicomplex has also been used to solve inverse problems in
calculus of variations. The variational bicomplex plays a role in the geometric
theory of differential equations somewhat analogous to the role played by the
deRham complex in finite dimensional manifolds. This theme will be developed in
the research with application to specific examples a primary source of
motivation. It is often useful to create a "calculus" or formalism which can be
applied to a large number of problems of a class. The formalism being studied in
this research applies to the class of problems known as variational problems.
These problems arise naturally in a very wide range of circumstances in natural
science. A simple example would be the problem of determining, among all curves
on a surface connecting two points, the one with the shortest length.
