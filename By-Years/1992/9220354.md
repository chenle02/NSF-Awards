The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the social nature of
Japanese quality control circles by examining the objectives, motivations, and
attitudes of workers who participate in these circles. Such circles group
workers who are responsible for the manufacture of a variety of items in a
factory setting. Their purpose is to provide management with suggestions to
improve the quality and efficiency of production. Previous studies have focused
on how management organized such circles and the goals they established.
However, this study looks at such circles from the point of view of the workers
and therefore seeks to determine whether worker goal's are in conflict with
management and how management and workers negotiate mutually beneficial
relationships in the pursuit of commons goals. The research will provide
valuable training in developing ethnographic research skills in Japan.
