The Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS) on behalf of its
member institutions, is encouraging participation in the data network for all
higher education institutions in Indiana and their constituents, including
public libraries, hospitals, governmental agencies, extension centers, and
business with research and educational needs for connectivity. Additionally,
IHETS is working with the Indiana Department of Education to provide
experimentation opportunities for schools via linkage with the Department's
dial-access system. IDEAnet. This proposal requests partial funding for
participation in NSFNET through a connection with CICNET, the regional network
attaching to NSFNET in the Indiana Area as well as partial start-up funds for
the necessary routers, circuits, and operating support to facilitate the fullest
possible participation. The educational institutions that will participate
include: Grace College, Huntington College, Indiana Vocational Technical
College, Indiana Wesleyan University, Purdue University North Central, and
Taylor University-Fort Wayne. The network initially consists of a redundant T1
backbone linking nodes at four of the larger campuses, 56 kbs DDS end nodes, and
connection to CICNET and NSFNET via Indiana University. Phase 2 will extend the
backbone and add the six new colleges mentioned above. The network is beginning
with the vendor-independent TCP/IP standard, with the expectation of future
migrations to the OSI protocol when appropriate. The network will extend
throughout Indiana to provide affordable access to Internet resources and
enhance the state's information infrastructure, particularly important in small
towns and rural communities.
