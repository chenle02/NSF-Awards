9309402 Kannellakopoulos The proposed research will focus on the development of
the nonlinear design toolkit. Novel Backstepping techniques and new nonlinear
damping terms will be employed to design adaptive systems with even stronger
stability and performance properties, by interlacing the design of the
controller, observer and parameter estimator. The recent breakthrough of damped
interlacing will produce a new generation of adaptive systems, in which
adaptation is not needed for boundedness, but is used only to improve transient
and asymptotic performance. To enhance the applicability of the new adaptive
schemes to practical problems, their robustness with respect to several sources
of modeling errors will be evaluated, and new robustification tools will be
developed. Finally, to understand the issues related to digital implementation,
the problem of adaptive control of discrete-time nonlinear systems will be
addressed. A discrete-time design toolkit will be developed which will hopefully
alleviate the need for short sampling intervals. ***
