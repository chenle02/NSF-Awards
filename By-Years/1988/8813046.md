The northern Bering and southern Chukchi Seas are characterized by high primary
and secondary productivity. Recent research in U.S. waters indicates that food
supply, sediment heterogeneity and silt/clay content, and water temperature are
major factors influencing benthic processes. Past research by Soviet scientists
indicates that biomass is also high in Soviet waters, although few studies have
addressed the processes influencing the high-biomass populations. During a joint
US/USSR cruise, Grebmeier will test the hypothesis that direct pelagic- benthic
coupling on the shallow continental shelf of the northern Bering and southern
Chukchi Seas enhances benthic production and carbon cycling in the underlying
benthos. For comparison, stations in Soviet waters will be sampled in a manner
similar to those previously sampled in U.S. waters. Results will greatly enhance
the understanding of carbon and nitrogen cycling within the Bering and Chukchi
Seas. This Research Planning Grant was awarded through the Research
