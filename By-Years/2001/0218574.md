The PI proposes to develop an innovative algorithmic development to simulate
physical problems involving large-deformatin interactions among multiple
materials such as fluid/solid regions with moving boundaries at the interface.
The proposed research advances Information Technology through the development of
a new paradigm, which incorporates leading-edge simulation techniques with high
performance computing and data visualization.
