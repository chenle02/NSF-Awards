9702556 Griffeath This award provides funds to partially support a workshop on
cellular automata theory to be held at the Santa Fe Institute. The purpose of
the workshop is to bring together researchers from different disciplines to help
foster the development of rigorous results in cellular automata. The workshop
will focus on three active areas of cellular automata research: shape and
interface theory, constructive analysis of Conway's Life, and algorithmic
complexity of elementary cellular automata.
