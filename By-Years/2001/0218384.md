0218384&lt;br/&gt;Banerjee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth materials - rocks,
sediments, soils - all contain magnetic minerals in trace amounts. The
properties of these minerals (chemical composition, grain size, concentration)
are determined by the geologic processes and conditions under which the
rocks/sediments originally formed and by which they have been subsequently
affected. Laboratory measurements of bulk rock/sediment samples, under different
conditions of temperature and applied magnetic fields, enable quantitative
analysis of the trace magnetic mineral characteristics, and yields valuable
information for reconstructing their history. Natural-material magnetic research
has important applications over a broad expanse of science, including
paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental research, paleogeographic reconstruction of
the past locations of the continents and oceanic tectonic plates, and the
history of the Earth's magnetic field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides
for continued support of the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) at the
University of Minnesota over the next five years. The IRM
(http://www.geo.umn.edu/orgs/irm/irm.html) is the leading international facility
for in-depth fundamental research on the magnetic properties of rocks, sediments
and minerals. A state-of-the-art assemblage of instruments allows detailed
magnetic characterization through measurements under widely-varying conditions
of temperature, time and applied magnetic field. Research by IRM-resident
scientists is complemented by that of Visiting Fellows, selected through a
competitive proposal process from the global geoscience community. The IRM also
enhances the research infrastructure for Earth sciences by organizing technical
workshops and research conferences, developing and maintaining a public database
of magnetic properties of geomaterials, and providing research-related news and
information through a web site and quarterly
newsletter.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
