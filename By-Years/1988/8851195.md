The new chromatography curriculum is exposing all of the chemistry majors and
many additional students to GC employing temperature programming, capillary
columns, TCD, FID, and GC/MS; and to HPLC utilizing normal phase, reverse phase,
ion and GPC columns; isocratic and gradient elution; and UV, fluorescence,
conductivity, and refractive index detection. These students are gaining
experience in the use of computers for data collection and analysis. They are
increasing their ability to use computers to prepare formal scientific reports
incorporating the analyzed data. In addition to the 2 HPLC's (one a gradient
system), a GC/MS, and several student model GC's previously available in the
department, this project has added a dual column, microprocessor controlled gas
chromatograph with temperature programming and capillary column capability, a
refractive index detector for HPLC, and a PC based chromatography data station.
Thus, the experiments in seven courses and student-faculty research is extending
the students' understanding and appreciation of chromatography as a tool for a
wide variety of applications as well as giving them experience using computers
and computer controlled instrumentation for chemistry laboratory applications.
