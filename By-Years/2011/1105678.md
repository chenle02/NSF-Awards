The Jones polynomial is a powerful knot invariant that keeps tightly locked key
information about the geometry and topology of the knot complement. The
principal investigator and the principal co-investigator propose to study the
Geometry and Topology of the Jones polynomial and its 3-dimensional counterpart,
the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant, that is revealed via asymptotic
expansions, and especially its relation to hyperbolic geometry via
representations of the fundamental group and to number theory via modular
properties of the asymptotic expansions. A side project growing out of the
proposal which concerns only classical invariants is the investigation of the
growth rate of torsions of finite coverings of 3 manifolds and its relations to
geometry/topology of the manifolds.

The study of knotted curves in 3-dimensional manifolds is intimately related to
our physical 3-dimensional space. With a long history reaching back to the early
stage of topology, it is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and physics,
and also has applications in biology, chemistry, and quantum computation. In the
last few decades, Jones and Witten's work and ideas from physics have led to the
discovery of new types of invariants for knots which create interactions of low
dimensional topology with geometry, algebra, number theory, analysis, quantum
field theory and combinatorics. The aim of this project is to better understand
the nature of these new invariants and their relations with classical
invariants.
