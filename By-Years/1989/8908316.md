This research is aimed at the production of superconducting ceramic powders by
the aerosol decomposition method. In this technique gas- borne liquid drops
containing soluble compounds of the desired metals are dried, heated in furnace
to decompose the compounds, and then further heated in oxygen to achieve the
desired level of oxygen addition. The research will address problems of
composition segregation which may arise if one of the metal species is
sufficiently volatile or if oxygen diffusion is insufficiently rapid. It will
study methods of controlling particle microstructure such as shape and porosity.
Bulk and thin film samples of the particles so produced will be characterized as
to their superconductive properties by the Los Alamos National Laboratory for
High Temperature Superconductors. The aerosol decomposition method offers a
flexible technique for producing particles of controlled size, shape and
composition and so could contribute substantially to the engineering
developments needed to make superconducting a practical reality.
