Floer homology theory, a technique using partial differential equations to study
problems in smooth / symplectic topology, were first introduced in the 1980's.
Since then, these theories have led to many dramatic discoveries, including the
resolution of the Arnold conjecture in symplectic geometry and Gordon's
conjecture on lens space surgeries, but their structure remains somewhat
mysterious. The focus of this project is on better understanding the structure
of certain Floer homology theories. One particular goal is to continue to
develop Lipshitz-Ozsvath-Thurston's theory of "bordered Floer homology," an
effort to axiomatize Heegaard Floer homology by a type of second-order
degeneration. Another goal is to construct a "Floer homotopy type" for
Lagrangian intersection Floer homology, an idea suggested by Cohen-Jones-Segal
and carried out in other contexts by Manolescu, Kronheimer-Manolescu, and
Sarkar. A third goal is to associate maps on knot Floer homology to knot
cobordisms, hopefully leading to deep structural results about 3- and
4-dimensional Heegaard Floer theory.

Most of mathematics falls into one of two categories. One category studies
continuous problems, like fluid flow or minimal surface (bubble) formation,
often through partial differential equations. Another studies more rigid,
algebraic problems like hidden symmetries of real world objects (e.g., mosaics
or particle physics theories) or mathematical objects (like groups and fields).
Some of the most striking mathematics sits at the intersection of the two types,
using algebraic methods to study qualitative properties of continuous systems
which are quantitatively intractable. One powerful example of this method is
Floer homology, which uses algebraic structures like chain complexes, Hochschild
homology, and topological field theories to study certain families of partial
differential equations coming from physics. Floer theory then re-interprets the
results to answer questions in topology (large-scale or qualitative geometry).
This project will extend several Floer homology theories by considering even
deeper algebraic and topological structure to obtain stronger geometric results.
