This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a
process that uses halophytic plants and aquaculture effluent to treat highly
saline coal bed methane (CBM) discharge water. Vast volumes of water are a
necessary though unwanted byproduct of the gas drilling process. The saline
discharge is widely viewed as an environmental liability. Discharges into
streams are essentially forbidden, while indiscriminant surface discharge causes
soil salination. Prior Phase I work has shown that halophytic plants may be
successful in sequestering significant amounts of sodium when irrigated with CBM
discharge waters. This Phase II project will confirm Phase I greenhouse data
with field trials of plants irrigated with CBM water and fish effluent when
compared with controls under otherwise normal farming practices. Soil impacts
and tilth will also be examined in great detail.

The commercial application of this project will be to alleviate the negative
impact of CBM discharges on the environment in Wyoming, and to open up huge
areas of land for responsible CBM exploration and recovery.
