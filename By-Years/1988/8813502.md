This project deals with a manufacturing technique for depositing thin films of
high-temperature superconducting ceramic materials of the type yttrium-barium-
copper-oxygen compound. Deposition of the film will be done in a high-vacuum
system. Elemental targets of the superconducting material will be sequentally
evaporated from a rotating target holder using an Excimer laser. The composition
of the deposited film will be monitored and controlled in situ using a quartz
resonator microbalance and a computer control. Thin films of superconducting
materials have applications in the electronic and computer applications.
