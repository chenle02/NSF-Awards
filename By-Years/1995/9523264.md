9523264 Zoughi The primary objective of this research is to investigate the
relationship between the compressive strength of concrete and microwave
reflection coefficient measured at the aperture of an open-ended rectangular
wave guide inspecting the concrete in a contact or non-contact fashion.
Subsequently, the results of this study will be used to develop a microwave,
nondestructive, real-time, in-situ, cost-effective and portable sensor for
estimating concrete compressive strength with a high degree of accuracy. ***
