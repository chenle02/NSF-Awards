The Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) was formed in 1988
to identify and bring together the distributed human and facilities resources of
the academic research community with the purpose of advancing knowledge and
understanding of the Arctic to meet national needs. Specifically, ARCUS serves
as a forum for planning, facilitating, coordinating, and implementing
disciplinary and interdisciplinary studies of the Arctic; acts as a synthesizer
and disseminator of scientific information; and encourages and facilitates the
education of scientists and the public in the needs and opportunities for
research in the Arctic. Today ARCUS has 21 member institutions from 17 states.
The main activities ARCUS proposes to undertake as part of this effort are: (i)
establishment and support of an ARCSS Project Office and (ii) the organizational
and business systems development of ARCUS. The specific TASKS of the ARCSS
Project Office would include: (a) providing support to the ARCSS Integrating
Panel, (b) providing support for the OAII Science Steering Committee, and (c)
providing support for the LAII Science Steering Committee//
