Through the application of digital audio technology, a new microcomputer-based
laboratory will expose psychology students and speech pathology and audiology
students to the fundamentals of acoustics, sound propagation, distortion, time-
domain and frequency-domain representation of sound, sound spectrograms,
resonance and the format structure of the human voice, the source-filter theory
of speech production, categorical perception of speech and non-speech stimuli,
fused and segregated perceptual images, multidimensional scaling, and associated
topics. The laboratory will employ an active hands- on approach, so that
students will acquire a firm understanding of the relationship between the
physical properties of sound and sound production on one hand, and the
perceptual consequence of changes in stimulation on the other. Both major- and
non-major upper-division undergraduate students will utilize this laboratory .
