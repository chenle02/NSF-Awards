This award will support development of a new method to measure erosion rates
beneath glaciers and ice sheets. The method is based on interpretation of depth
profiles of cosmic-ray-produced nuclides (Be-10, Al-26 and Cl-36) beneath
glaciated bedrock surfaces. Nuclide concentrations, ratios, and profile
gradients are sensitive to the exposure and erosion history. We will invert
these data to determine erosion over the past 0.5-1 million years. To verify the
method we will measure profiles at up- and downflow ends of glacial landforms in
eastern Maine, where existing theory predicts different erosion processes and
strongly contrasting erosion rates.

This work will provide a quantitative method for the study of landscape
evolution in glaciated terrain. This will allow geomorphologists to re-examine
long-standing questions concerning the erosional effects of the Pleistocene ice
sheets, formation rates of characteristic glacial landforms, and the origin of
glacial valley profiles. Broader impacts of the work will include: (i) Graduate
student training, (ii) Undergraduate participation in field- and laboratory-
based research, (iii) Collaboration with the Maine Granite Industry Museum,
where project results will be used to explain the glacial imprint on the
surrounding landscape, and (iv) Evaluation of glacial erosion as a risk factor
in planning for long-term isolation of nuclear waste in high-latitude countries.
