This is a one-year effort to refurbish and deliver a scientific grade optical
instrument, Limb-imaging Ionospheric and Thermospheric EUV Spactrograph (LITES),
which will be flown as a hosted payload onboard a commercial satellite as part
of a US Air Force (USAF) program. LITES is a compact, high-sensitivity extreme
and far ultraviolet spectral imager designed to measure key ion and neutral
species in the ionosphere-thermosphere system. It will be constructed by
modifying an existing, flight-proven high-sensitivity imaging spectrograph
developed by the proposer. Specifically, the instrument will be upgraded by
replacing the existing detector with a larger, more capable detector, providing
an extended spectral range for the instrument as well as lower noise. To meet
the current schedule for the payload, the upgraded instrument must be ready by
mid 2012, which leaves less than 12 months for its construction and testing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide valuable opportunities for
graduate and undergraduate students to experience a real life space project in
collaboration with the USAF and aerospace industry. The upgrade to the
instrument will expand the scope of this USAF project from purely technology
demonstration to a science investigation and the NSF participation in the
project will help ensure that the science data is made freely available to the
scientific community. Finally, the project will advance the technological
development and demonstration of miniaturized instruments that may benefit the
realization of future small satellite missions.
