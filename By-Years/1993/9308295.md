This project develops new procedures for estimating non-linear models of "long-
memory" processes, that is relationships between values over long periods. These
new procedures can be applied to many questions in macro, financial and labor
economics. They are particularly relevant for modelling relationships between
macroeconomic and weather variables, as when studying global warming for
instance, as these variables are certainly slowly moving and the relationships
are likely to be non-linear. Work concerning long memory processes has largely
been linear. There are many non-linear modelling techniques available to
approximate actual relationships but these procedures usually assume, either
explicitly or implicitly, that the variables are stationary, or short-memory. In
order to provide a class of techniques appropriate for modelling non-linear
relationships between long variables, this project will develop new definitions
and tests of long-memory in the non-linear framework and specify new techniques
for testing for linearity and for overcoming the "data-missing" properties of
some of the techniques.
