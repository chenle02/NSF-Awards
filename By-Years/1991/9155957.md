Case Studies of exemplary collegiate mathematics programs are being developed.
These projects will be highlighted in a volume describing model programs that
illustrate different aspects of the many recommendations calling for change and
revitalization of undergraduate mathematics programs. The MAA's Committee on
Undergraduate Programs in Mathematics is serving as an advisory committee for
the project.
