The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the research vessel EWING that the institution operates. A substantial part of
the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is in support of NSF-sponsored
research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of
the ship and of the institution to support research and engineering activities.
The instrumentation includes: -150-kHz transducers for the Acoustic Doppler
Current Profiler system for making precision measurements of subsurface
circulation features, -a Cesium beam frequency standard to enhance precision
navigation capabilities, especially in remote areas, and -components to complete
fabrication of a modern, digital, 3-kilometer, 240-channel seismic streamer and
electronics system for making detailed studies of seafloor features and sub-
seafloor structure. Columbia University is providing cost sharing for acquiring
this equipment. The instrumentation described above will increase the capability
of the Institution to support NSF- sponsored research and engineering projects.
