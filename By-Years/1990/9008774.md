Intracellular free calcium ions act as second messengers in numerous
physiological process in virtually all types of cells. One transport system that
is involved with the regulation of cellular calcium is the sodium/calcium
exchange system which is recognized as one of the fundamental mechanisms through
which the intracellular ionic environment is maintained constant.
Electrophysiological and molecular biological techniques have been used to study
the sodium/calcium exchanger, providing more information on the properties and
physiological roles of the exchanger in cells. A conference, under the auspices
of the New York Academy of Sciences, has been planned to assemble investigators
from various disciplines of science to discuss and share new information on the
mechanisms that help regulate calcium in cells.
