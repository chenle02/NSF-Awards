T. Keith Hollis, University of California-Riverside, is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for studies of
phosphametallocene catalysts. These compounds have one or two
phosphacyclopentadienyl ligands coordinated to a transition metal. The
phosphorus in the aromatic ring gives rise to unique isomerization pathways,
including ring slip and P-inversion. These processes have stereochemical
consequences and can lead to the dynamic resolution of metallocenes, chiral
catalysts and oscillating catalysts. Extensions to other heterometallocene
systems such as boratabenzene, pyrrolyl and arsolyl may lead to similar
isomerizations and yield additional useful chiral
catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral metallocene catalysts have been applied
in several processes, including olefin polymerization, epoxide ring opening,
asymmetric hydrogenation, asymmetric allylic alkylation and enantioselective
isomerization of allylic alcohols. The heterometallocenes developed in this
project offer new potential catalysts for many transformations of interest to
pharmaceutical and fine chemical producers. Students working on this project
will be trained in organometallic and organic chemistry, including parallel
combinatorial chemistry, and in polymer chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
