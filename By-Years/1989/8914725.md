This research is an experimental study of the liquid-vapor equilibria of
selected binary mixtures of common gas solvents with polar solutes, which will
contribute to our fundamental understanding of multiphase equilibria in complex
molecular systems. Detailed studies of the liquid-liquid-vapor regions of
ternary mixtures will also be studied in order to evaluate the relative
separabilities of the liquid phases of very low volatility solutes with widely
divergent polarities. The data to be obtained are of value for providing a
database of multiphase equilibria on well-defined mixtures containing polar
molecules to complement existing multiphase data on nonpolar mixtures. This
study should also provide considerable insight into possible new methods to
separate certain molecular types of species from complex mixtures that might
occur in environmental, manufacturing, and refining applications.
