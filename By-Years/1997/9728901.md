9728543 Dohanich One of the most fundamental questions in neuroscience is how
the CNS is able to store and retrieve information. It is clear that whatever the
actual mechanisms that underlie learning, whether structural, physical, or even
functional, they must involve chemical changes. The steroid hormone, estrogen,
has been shown to promote the growth of brain structures, modulate brain
biochemistry, and affect performance on tasks of learning and memory. Moreover,
estrogen modulates the activity of a number of neurotransmitters including
acetylcholine which has been hypothesized as a transmitter of learning. Indeed,
Dr. Dohanich has found that estrogen effects on memory become most apparent when
acetylcholine systems have been compromised pharmacologically. Using a variety
of behavioral paradigms, Dr. Dohanich will now began to decipher the complex
role of the ovarian hormones, estrogen and progesterone. on spatial learning and
memory. Moreover, using quantitative autoradiographic techniques, he will
examine the effects of estrogen and progesterone on cholinergic receptors in
brain regions important for memory. The results from these studies will
determine both the conditions and the mechanisms under which estrogen has memory
enhancing effects. These studies are especially important and timely given the
recent reports suggesting that the presence of estrogen in women is correlated
with improved memory and a reduced incidence of Alzheimer's Disease. Moreover,
the results from this project will greatly enhance our understanding of the
fundamental interrelationships of ovarian hormones, cholinergic
neurotransmission, and learning and memory, an area which is filled with
speculation while lacking important data.
