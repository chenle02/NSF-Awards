This study seeks to theoretically investigate the lightning initiation in low
thundercloud fields, that currently represents a fundamental unsolved problem in
lightning discharge physics. The research promises to answer questions about the
frequency of relevant hydrometeor (rain/snow/ice in cloud) collisions, the kind
of discharge process or streamer activity that would be triggered, and the
likelihood of conditions required for such discharge activity to escape and
continue to develop on larger scales. A better understanding of electric fields
around small particles could be of interest to industries like powder-coating
and laser printing. The work includes training of young scientists and enables
support of undergraduate research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will,
first, quantify the electric field between two spherical hydrometeors using the
image charge method and between two non-spherical hydrometeors using the
Poisson's equation, and apply the avalanche to streamer transition criteria to
observe whether streamer initiation is possible. Second, the investigators will
develop a fluid model consisting of continuity equations for positive and
negative ions, and electrons coupled with Poisson's equation. Third, the
investigators will apply streamer models to describe the streamer development
between the two hydrometeors and the streamer escape to open
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
