This award to the California Institute of Technology supports the Los Angeles
Number Theory Group, a research activity in the category of Mathematical
Sciences Research Groups. The four principal members of the Group are Professors
Dinakar Ramakrishnan of Caltech, and Haruzo Hida, Jonathan Rogawski, and Don
Blasius of the University of California, Los Angeles. The purpose of the award
is to make possible visits to the greater Los Angeles area by outside
researchers in the field of automorphic forms and representations. Non-Euclidean
plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical
curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many
objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The
detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several
branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic
forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with
questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it
retains connection to its historical roots.
