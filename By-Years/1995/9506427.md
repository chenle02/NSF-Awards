9506427 Hager The PI will develop and use global flow models to test
geodynamical hypotheses, including compositional stratification of the mantle,
the relation between seismic tomographic models and temperature/composition, the
driving mechanism for plate motions and its relation to mantle heterogeneity,
the origin of sea level variations, and the evolution of deep continental
structure. These models will be tested against observed seismic and gravity
data. ****
