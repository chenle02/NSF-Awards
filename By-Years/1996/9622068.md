9622068 He This project lies in the interface of complex analysis, topology and
geometry. It deals with conformal geometry and circle domains in the plane.
Conformal mappings of relative circle domains generalize mappings induced from
circle packings of the same combinatorial pattern. The investigator will try to
determine whether classical results for circle packing maps hold for these
generalized mappings as well. In addition, the investigator will study the
following problem in topological fluid mechanics: estimate the lower bound for
the energy of incompressible vector fields which are subject to deformations
under some ideal physical condition. The circle packing and circle mapping
problems are classical problems touching on several different branches of
mathematics. For example, recently it was discovered that three-dimensional
hyperbolic geometry involving negative curvature plays an important role in
circle pattern and packing problems. Also, certain extremal packing problems and
their higher dimensional analogs - whose solutions can be approximated with
computer simulation - may have applications in industrial packing problems.
