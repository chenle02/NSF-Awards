ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: DMS-0204589&lt;br/&gt; Conference on
Minimal Varieties in Geometry and Physics&lt;br/&gt;PI's: M. Anderson, D.
Gromoll, C. LeBrun, M. Rocek&lt;br/&gt; (Stony Brook)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Dept. of Mathematics at SUNY Stony Brook will host a conference on&lt;br/&gt;
MINIMAL VARIETIES IN GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS&lt;br/&gt; June 1 - June 7,
2002&lt;br/&gt;on the occasion of Blaine Lawson's 60th birthday. The progress in
the&lt;br/&gt;study of minimal varieties in a broad sense has had a profound
impact&lt;br/&gt;on numerous areas in geometry and physics. This conference will
bring&lt;br/&gt;together mathematicians and physicists working on minimal
varieties&lt;br/&gt;and their recent applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award provides partial support for active researchers in this &lt;br/&gt;area,
who otherwise have limited means of funding, to participate in the
&lt;br/&gt;conference. Most of the funds will support younger mathematicians
and&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians from underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confirmed Speakers: S. Bloch, J.P. Bourguignon, R.
Bryant, J. Cheeger, T. Colding, &lt;br/&gt;J. Figueroa-O'Farrill, E.
Friedlander, H. Gillet, H. Gluck, P. Griffiths, &lt;br/&gt;M. Gromov, R. Harvey,
D. Hoffman, P. Lima-Filho, R. MacPherson, W. Meeks, &lt;br/&gt;W. Minicozzi, R.
Osserman, M. Rocek, J. Rosenberg, R. Schoen, I. Singer, &lt;br/&gt;G.
Tian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organizing Committee: M. Anderson, D. Gromoll, C.
LeBrun, M. Rocek, A. Phillips, &lt;br/&gt;S. Simanca.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference has 4 main themes: minimal submanifolds of&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian
manifolds, calibrated geometries, complex subvarieties and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic
cycles, and the Dirac operator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be 3 mini-
courses:&lt;br/&gt;I. Minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds (Colding and
Minicozzi)&lt;br/&gt;II. M-theory and calibrations
(Figueroa-O'Farrill)&lt;br/&gt;III.Algebraic Cycles (TBA)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
