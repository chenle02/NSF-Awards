This proposal will provide support for one year for Dr. T. Kageya, a
postdoctoral fellow working at the Laser Electron Gamma Source (LEGS) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory. The LEGS collaboration will carry out
measurements of photon elastic scattering and pi meson production from protons
and neutrons, which will in turn provide tests of some key low-energy
predictions, such as the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule, as well as chiral
perturbation theory.&lt;br/&gt;
