This research is on the Theory of Symmetric Functions and its applications to
Representation Theory and Combinatorics. The connection between Representation
Theory and the Theory of Symmetric Functions is provided by the Frobenius map
which relates group characters to symmetric functions. Combinatorics plays a
role in that multiplicities of irreducibles are often obtained by counting
tableaux, paths, trees and a growing variety of newly emerging discrete
structures. In the more than ten years since its discovery, the Macdonald basis
has progressively emerged as a central element in these connections. For more
than a decade of research in the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials, the
investigator and M. Haiman have been led to a variety of conjectures in
Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorics and Symmetric Function
Theory. Efforts in proving these conjectures have yielded fundamental facts and
methods in each of these areas. More recently the investigator discovered a
variety of summation formulas (PNAS V. 98 (April 2001) 4313-4316) which
permitted the proof of the first significant positivity result in the Theory of
Macdonald Polynomials. In joint work with J. Haglund the investigator proved a
beautiful combinatorial formula (conjectured by J. Haglund) for a rational
function which had come to be known as the $q,t$-Catalan. The investigator in
collaboration with students and associates plans to use his recently discovered
symmetric function identities for a direct attack of some of the conjectures
that are still unresolved.

The Theory of Symmetric Functions is a powerful symbolic manipulation tool. The
reason for this is that non linear problems may often be linearized by the
introduction of an infinite number of variables. Now it develops that the change
of bases matrices of Symmetric Function Theory may be used to "mimic" the
presence of infinities within a finite device, thereby permitting the
linearization and solution of many a computational problem. Discoveries in the
theory and applications of symmetric functions, should also turn out to be of
significant impact in the various areas of mathematics in which symmetric
function methods have been shown to be effective. This given, we can see how
important it is to pursue investigations in the Theory of Symmetric functions
that extend and deepen the computational power of the theory. This is the
foremost goal of the present project.
