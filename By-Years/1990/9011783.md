This research is to analyze 16 well-recorded aftershocks of the October 17,
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake recorded on a variety of site conditions in the East
Bay area using the new NSF/IRIS PASSCAL seismic instruments. Preliminary
analysis of these data shows clear amplification on mud with respect to both
alluvium and rock sites. Further analysis is necessary to quantify rigorously
the details of the site response, including a quantification of uncertainties.
We will investigate ground motions on sediment sites over the entire available
frequency band, roughly 1 to 40 Hz. Converted S-to-P phases may be useful for
constraining the depth of the sediment layers, a quantity that is constrained in
some places by geotechnical data but which is known to vary considerably over
scales of 100 meters. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
