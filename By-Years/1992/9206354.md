Subduction-related, high pressure metamorphism is commonly overprinted by
younger plutons during convergence and accretion of allochthonous terranes to
craton margins. In the Klamath Mountains of California several accreted terranes
contain evidence of low P/T metamorphism related to regional shortening and
magmatic heating that occurred during Middle and Late Jurassic evolution of an a
really widespread continent-margin magmatic arc at the western edge of North
America. However, in the southern part of the Klamath Mountains, these terranes
preserve the older, subduction- related high P metamorphism primarily due to an
absence of later plutons. This research will investigate this metamorphism to
help constrain the origin, evolution and tectonic environment of these terranes
prior to their assembly in mid-Jurassic time. Results will advance understanding
of the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic paleogeography of the North American
cordillera.
