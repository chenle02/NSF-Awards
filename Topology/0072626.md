Proposal: DMS-0072626

Abstract. This proposal is concerned with mappings of the plane which keep
certain subcontinua invariant. Historically the first significant results for
maps of the plane were obtained for orientation preserving homeomorphisms. All
homeomorphisms of the plane are either orientation preserving or orientation
reversing. In this proposal we will introduce a new class of oriented mappings.
Every oriented map is either positively or negatively oriented. We expect to
show that all compositions of open and monotone (proper and onto) mappings of
the plane are oriented. We have generalized known results on the existence of
fixed points in non-separating invariant plane continua for homeomorphisms of
the plane to the class of positively oriented maps. We expect this to be true
for all oriented maps. We will establish connections between these problems and
the structure of invariant continua of branched covering maps of the plane
including the structure of the boundary of invariant simply connected domains.
We will make use of prime end techniques as well as results from continuum
theory and dynamical systems.
