In this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project, the team
conducts research leading to software design tools for automated and
reconfigurable robotic systems that manufacture at the nano scale. They define
these systems as Wafer-Scale Nanofactories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key
ingredient in realizing this vision is full automation of the production of
millimeter scale robots, and the ability to install and reliably operate a few
hundred such robots on the nanofactory wafer. Before physically building the
nanofactory, users will design and optimize its layout using assemblable
building blocks through a novel software design tool - NanoLRM. This tool
utilizes Lean Robotic Micromanufacturing (LRM) principles, through which
tradeoffs related to resource allocation, precision requirements, production
yield, rate and cost can be judiciously studied. Specifically, the following
work is part of this project: modelling assembly, motion, and processes
uncertainties using interval analysis, to select and simulate precision-based
planners and controllers in the nanofactory, and employ parametric optimization
tools for cost, yield and production rate trade-off studies.
