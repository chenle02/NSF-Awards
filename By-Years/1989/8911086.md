This modest award assists Professor Paul I. Abell of the University of Rhode
Island to collaborate in paleoclimatology research with Professor Hans-Joachim
Pachur of the Institute for Physical Geography of the Free University of Berlin,
FRG. The objective of their current research is to assess the degree to which
stable isotope analyses of the shells of ancient freshwater gastropods by Dr.
Abell give the same interpretation of paleoclimates as the geological/paleon-
tological approach used by Dr. Pachur. The shells were collected by Dr. Pachur
from sites along a mid-Holocene Saharan river bed in the northern Sudan, where
he has been applying a variety of techniques to the delineation of ancient
climatic conditions. Shell material will be jointly selected from his
collections, and Dr. Abell and his students will measure stable isotope ratios
on these shells at short intervals along the growth spirals. The environment in
which man evolved in Equatorial Africa has been the subject of extensive
interest and study by anthropologists, archeologists, paleontologists and
climatologists. It has become evident that climate may have been a significant
factor in directing evolutionary change, both morphologically and socially. The
measurement of stable isotope ratios in freshwater gastropod shells may provide
a valuable new tool in the armory of those scientists interested in the
Pliocene-Pleistocene-Holocene world. Comprehensive comparison and interpretation
of the isotope and geological and paleontological data produced in this
collaborative project will test the validity of the stable isotope approach and
provide useful research experience for several U.S. undergraduate and graduate
students.
