This award is for a renewal of an REU Site in multimessenger astronomy at the
University of Wisconsin Madison. Students will work under close supervision of
faculty and research scientists for ten weeks each summer on research projects
that span a broad range of scientific areas. This program will benefit society
by enhancing the education of undergraduates through research and professional
development programs and by extending these opportunities to students from
institutions otherwise unable to offer such experiences. Students will be
actively recruited at meetings of several national organizations and through
participation in the National Astronomy Consortium, a partnership that focuses
on the recruitment and continued professional development of underrepresented
minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research opportunities include
experimental physics, instrumentation, and astrophysics. All faculty mentors are
required to participate in a training seminar offered at the start of each
summer. The program also includes: a lecture series in astrophysics, training in
scientific presentations, web-page and Python programming, scientific ethics,
graduate school preparation, field trips, and opportunities to participate in
public outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
