9405498 Beroza This research is to analyze earthquake multiplets and clusters
using digital waveform data from the Calnet seismic network in northern
California. The goals of the study are to 1) develop a catalog of similar
earthquakes for northern and central California in order to study the factors
that influence the occurrence of multiplets, presumably creep-related, and 2) to
detect and understand changes in crustal wave propagation associated with a
major earthquake. Preliminary work has detected co-seismic and possibly pre-
seismic velocity changes related to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and these
phenomena will be investigated in more detail. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
