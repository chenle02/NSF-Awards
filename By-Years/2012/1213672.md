This award provides support for students and postdoctoral researchers who will
attend the 2012 and 2013 annual CTEQ Summer Schools. The CTEQ Collaboration is
an informal group of 32 experimental and theoretical high-energy physicists from
eighteen universities and five national labs who are engaged in a program to
advance research in and understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) --- the
theory underlying the strong interaction. QCD and its study at high energies is
increasingly shared by both elementary particle and nuclear physics. The annual
Summer Schools organized by the CTEQ Collaboration are large meetings whose goal
is to bring participants up to speed on recent developments regarding strong-
interaction physics through lectures and other formal presentations. These
annual events typically cover topics that strike a balance between the
underlying physics and practical applications in current experiments. Organizers
also ensure that junior physicists in attendance also have the opportunity to
interact closely with the senior physicists about their research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These meetings have significant broader impacts.
Attendance by junior physicists at these meetings enhances their education and
promotes their research. It permits face-to-face interactions with those giving
presentations, thereby fostering interactions between physicists at different
stages in their careers. It also allows all to network in an informal setting,
and enables them to share ideas and establish personal contacts. These meetings
also promote interactions between theorists and experiments, and help to develop
a badly-needed intellectual infrastructure for future QCD-related research.
