The Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing is an international multidisciplinary
conference covering research in the theory and application of computational
methods in problem of biological significance. The conference provides a forum
for work on databases, algorithms, interfaces, visualization, modeling and a
variety of other computational approaches. A particular area of emphasis has
been data-intensives areas. The session are defined dynamically each year, with
session organized to provide forums for publication and discussion of emerging
areas of research. The award will provide funds for travel support for US
