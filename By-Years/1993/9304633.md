There are clear suggestions that elements of the diet influence the physiology
of reproduction in primates, including humans. Some plant chemicals mimic the
actions of animal steroids and therefore may directly influence reproductive
function and even development. This project will develop a set of methods
appropriate for investigating these actions in a natural setting. The
investigator will develop three lines of analysis. First, she will directly
assay phytochemical in plants foods eaten by humans and primates. Second, she
will attempt to develop a steroid analysis reproductive function in natural
populations via fecal steroid analysis, validating these results by comparing
them with serum profiles. The third line of analysis will relate phytochemical
intake to reproductive responses.
