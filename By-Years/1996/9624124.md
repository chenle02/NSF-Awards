A method is proposed for the decoupling of design and manufacturing of micro-
electromechanical systems (MEMS) and devices. A design infrastructure is to be
developed that will allow non-experts to quickly design and simulate MEMS
devices and systems. The philosophy follows the VLSI paradigm, where there is a
clear separation between the wafer fabrication and the design effort that
creates the pattern which is to be implemented. MEMS software tools, device
models, and educational materials will be made available on the Internet. These
tools will include schematic editing, layout synthesis, parameter extraction and
simulation. The proposal also contains a strong education plan extending the
PI's successes in recruiting undergraduates, including women and under-
represented minorities, to become research students.
