This project explores the environmental parameters under which peptide self
replication may occur and the types of structural features within peptides that
allow for efficient replication. Specific issues being addressed include the
control of self replication by cofactors such as metal ions and small molecule
ligands and the use of other peptide structures, such as the collagen triple
helix motif, for self replication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor
Jean A. Chmielewski of Purdue University. Professor Chmielewski studies the
self-replication of peptides by analogy with similar work in the area of DNA
self-replication that has contributed significantly to the development of
biotechnology. In addition to revealing the possible role of peptides in the
molecular origins of life, self replicating peptides offer promise in a wide
range of technological developments, including self healing materials and
sensors.
