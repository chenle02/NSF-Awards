OISE-0814083 (Jhon, M. S. Carnegie-Mellon University)&lt;br/&gt;The Fifth
U.S.-Korea Forum on Nanotechnology: Nanobiotechnology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award supports a U.S. Korea workshop on nanobiotechnology. The workshop will
focus on synthesis, characterization, and structural control of nano-
biomaterials; relevant instrumentation technologies; and environmental, health
and safety issues. The workshop will bring together approximately 35 U.S. and
Korean researchers. One-third of the U.S. scientist and engineers will be early
career. The key Korean collaborator is Dr. Jo-Won Lee, Director, The National
Program for Tera-level Nanodevices, Seoul, Korea. Korean participants come from
the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), the Korea
Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), the Korea Institute of Science and
Technology Information (KISTI), the Korea Nano Technology Research Society
(KNTRS), the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), the
Korea University (KU), the Pohang University of Science and Technology
(POSTECH), the Seoul National University (SNU), and the Yonsei University. This
workshop is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and
Engineering (OISE) and the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).
