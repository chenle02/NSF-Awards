The primary objective of this proposal is to determine how mycorrhizal fungi
recolonize the roots of host pine species following fire. The fungi are
essential to the health and growth of all trees in the pine family, yet little
is currently know about how they survive and re-establish themselves after fire.
Most of the research will be conducted at Pt. Reyes National Seashore in
naturally regenerating Bishop pine forests. Study sites were selected to take
advantage of the recent 5100 hectare wildfire which included several areas where
the pre-fire symbiotic fungal community was know in detail. Specific questions
to be addressed include: 1) What is the dominant source of post-fire fungi? 2)
How is fungal species composition affected by differences in ash deposition,
tree mortality, and litter removal? and 3) What effect does fungal inoculum
level have on successful seedling establishment? An increased understanding of
the dynamics of mycorrhizal populations should have important implications for
our understanding of forest dynamics and reforestation practices.
