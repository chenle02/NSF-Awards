With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program
in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Sarah Stoll of Georgetown University
will develop synthetic routes to novel two-dimensional materials with useful
magnetic properties. This project focuses on materials with structures that are
naturally layered, with strong covalent bonds within the layer and weak
interactions between layers, similar to graphite. A deeper fundamental
understanding of how structure and nanosheet thickness determine magnetic
coupling and orientation will be key for designing new devices that take
advantage of both electronic and magnetic properties, i.e. spintronics. This
project will provide research training to graduate and undergraduate students.
An interactive workshop that focuses on environmental chemistry and ethics
issues will be developed and adapted for a local girls high school.

The investigation will focus on three classes of lanthanide (Ln) materials that
vary systematically in structural anisotropy, inter-layer bonding, magnetic
orientation and electronic conductivity. The first family are the tritellurides,
LnTe3, which are van der Waals layered XY magnets in which moment is in the
plane of the sheets. Slightly less anisotropic are the ditellurides, LnTe2,
ionic-layered Ising magnets in which moment is perpendicular to the plane of the
sheets. Finally, the third family are the isotropic monochalcogenides such as
EuTe; these are Heisenberg, three-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. The
synthetic methods developed will be important for expanding the synthetic range
of two-dimensional materials. These materials exhibit a wide range of properties
whose further study can extend their utility for next-generation devices.
