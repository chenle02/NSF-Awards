Proposal No: CTS-9618635 Proposal Type: SGER Principal Investigator: Arijit
Bose Affiliation: University of Rhode Island The investigator proposes to use
magnetic fields to move functionalized magnetic particles through a novel
affinity based separator. The objective of the work is to allow these
functionalized magnetic particles to contact target molecules (or cells) without
the significant sustained. The novelty of the research is the reactor design
involving tunable magnetic fields allowing magnetic gradients in the radial and
/or axial directions. The use of functionalized magnetic/superparamagnetic
particles to remove specific molecules/cells etc. is of vital importance. For
example, if cancerous cells can be removed from bone marrow, the patient's own
bone marrow can be re-implanted (after chemotherpy) thereby eliminating the need
for a transplant. There are several small startup companies that have succeeded
in making functionalized magnetic particles and the PI will use the particles
from one of them (Bioquest). But simply using mechanical agitation to contact
cells with the functionalized particles leads to shear induced cell death. Hence
the problem the PI is attacking is an ideal case of applying chemical
engineering fundamentals of diffusion and convective transport to a novel
problem in separator design. The novelty is the problem and the separator design
. If successful, this scheme could revolutionize the field of cell separations,
by allowing greater throughput by using a continuous system, and additionally
sustaining cell viability. This is truly a high payoff project. What is also
exciting is that the seperator prototype can be built with the minimal
investment of the SGER.
