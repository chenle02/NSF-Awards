ABSTRACT CTS-9720537 Perla B. Balbuena Professor Balbuena will investigate
theoretically the intercalcation of lithium into solid electrode, the diffusion
of lithium through the electrolyte, the formation of surface film on the
electrodes, and the influence of much film on electrochemical behavior of
electrodes. An application of this research is in Li-ion batteries development.
Quantum ab initio and molecular dynamics simulations will be used to
characterize electronic, atomic, and molecular properties of these systems. This
research will allow Professor Balbuena, a recently appointed Assistant
Professor, to strengthen her career in the area of computational prediction of
electrochemical and materials properties.
