Important new technology is becoming increasingly available to professionals in
the hazards reduction field. This effort focuses upon the patterns of
implementation and outcomes of microcomputer use by State and local emergency
managers in preparing for and responding to earthquakes and other natural
disasters. Specific goals of the project are to: (1) document microcomputer use
by State and local emergency managers for disaster preparedness and response,
(2) explore the consequences of microcomputer implementation on the internal
functioning and external linkage patterns of State and local emergency
management agencies, and (3) identify the future needs of such organizations in
regards to microcomputer usage. Data will be collected from a sample of
organizations both before and after major disaster events.
