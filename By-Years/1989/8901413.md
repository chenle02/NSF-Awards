This award will support a three week workshop on Mathematical Ideas Arising
from Conformal Field Theory to be held July 17 - August 6, 1989 at the Aspen
Center for Physics in Aspen, Colorado. The workshop will be under the direction
of Professor Daniel Freed of the University of Chicago. The purpose of this
workshop is to encourage and extend collaboration and research among
mathematicians working on projects directly related to conformal field theory.
Such ideas occur in the study of infinite dimensional algebras, loop groups,
invariants of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds, invariants of knots and links, and
elliptic cohomology. Invitations to the workshop will be issued on the basis of
applications submitted to the Aspen Center.
