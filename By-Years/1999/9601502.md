This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the School of Chemical Sciences at the University of Illionois at Urbana-
Champaign upgrade the existing 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) solid state
structural studies of proteins and inorganic systems (2) structural studies of
biologically active natural products (3) structural studies of the estrogen
receptor (4) structural studies of protein-carbohydrate interactions (5)
structures and dynamics of nucleic acid complexes (6) high resolution NMR
studies of chemical and biochemical systems at high pressure and (7) sol-gel
processing of advanced ceramic materials (8) nanoporous coordination networks
(9) donor solvent-assisted synthesis of inorganic materials (10) size effects in
dielectric and electrooptic ceramic oxides (11) characterization of
electrochemically modified surfaces, and (12) nanporous extended networks based
on supramolecular bonding Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology
