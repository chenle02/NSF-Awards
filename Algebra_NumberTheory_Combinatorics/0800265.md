Moment zeta function over finite fields gives interesting new ways to count the
number of rational points along the fibres of a family of varieties. As such, it
incorporates critical information about the distribution of rational points on a
family of varieties. It also serves as a geometric bridge between classical zeta
function (which is rational) and Dwork's p-adic unit root zeta function (which
is p-adically transcendental). It is a fundamental object of study in arithmetic
geometry, linking classical objects to p-adic objects, such as p-adic modular
forms and p-adic L-functions. This project is to combine the two powerful
approaches (p-adic methods and l-adic methods), to continue the PI's development
of the theory of moment zeta function, and to explore its substantial
applications in arithmetic mirror symmetry and coding theory.

The PI is expanding his collaborations and interactions with graduate students,
post-docs, junior and senior mathematicians worldwide, both within the
mathematical community, and the computer science and engineering community. His
ideas have motivated researchers and students, both at the university level and
at the community college level. Many further efforts in this direction are
planned via teaching, writing and collaborations in a self-contained manner.
Moment zeta function is a self-contained diophantine reformulation (in terms of
counting rational points) of some of the very deep and sophisticated problems in
arithmetic geometry. As such, it provide an excellent meeting ground for
collaborations crossing different fields and for training graduate students of
all levels.
