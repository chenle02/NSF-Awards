This three year project is developing and making available on the web a
collection of curricula and resources for teaching undergraduate and graduate
networking engineering courses. Project personnel are establishing an advisory
board, identifying existing materials and soliciting new contributions from
authors, developing appropriate formats and editing the materials as required,
soliciting corporate and university partners to assist in making the project
self-sufficient, and expanding the existing web site and defining the
feedback/review process.
