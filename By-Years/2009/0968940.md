&lt;br/&gt;0968940 University of Akron; Celal Batur &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Center for Tire Research and Test Center (Tire TeC) will focus on building a
base of research, engineering education, and technology transfer that will
impact industrial practice and productivity through advanced materials and
intelligent tire technologies. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University (VT) and the University of Akron (UA) are collaborating to establish
the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
primary goals of this planning project are to initiate formal partnership with
various industry partners and national laboratories that have an interest in
tire technologies, and to discuss fundamental issues and topics for research.
The proposed IUCRC will generate new scientific knowledge; develop novel smart-
material-based tires, novel nanotechnology-based tire compounds, and intelligent
tire technology; and advance their associated dynamic models and constitutive
relationships by developing virtual and hardware-in-the-loop-based simulation
environments. The various envisioned research thrusts will provide solutions to
improve the industry's yield and contribute to its competitiveness.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed Center has the potential to
improve sustainability and profitability of US tire manufacturing industry by
developing new technologies that will reduce energy consumption, pollution and
increase driving safety. The Center will greatly enhance the infrastructure and
lead to other opportunities to assist the tire manufacturers. The proposed
center plans to provide students and faculty with a platform for conducting
industry-relevant research, establish an effective mechanism for collaboration,
and will help promote, catalyze, and accelerate the commercialization of
innovative technologies. Finally, Tire TeC will recruit participants from groups
traditionally under-represented in Mechanical Engineering, Polymer Engineering,
Chemical Engineering, and other scientific disciplines and will promote this
center through its ongoing working relationships with colleagues at Virginia
Tech's Northern Virginia Campus and the Middle Eastern and Northern Africa (VT-
MENA) campuses.
