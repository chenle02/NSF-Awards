This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
to Professor Tobin J. Marks of Northwestern University supports studies on both
fundamental and technologically-oriented aspects of new catalytic
transformations involving lanthanide and related early transition metals. The
proposal has been divided into four subtopics: 1) exploratory catalytic metal-
heteroelement chemistry, 2) organolanthanide-mediated materials synthesis, 3)
multinuclear catalysis and 4) other metals and supporting ligands for f-element
catalysis. Titration calorimetry will be used to quantify the strengths of
metal-ligand single and multiple bonds and to "anchor" bond enthalpies on an
absolute scale. The research includes the study of selective C-N, C-O, C-S, and
C-P bond-forming processes, the study of a range of precursor structures, the
characterization of reaction rates, selectivities, and substituent effects, as
well as the comparison of intramolecular vs. intermolecular processes. These
transformations may produce efficient, atom-economical, catalytic processes for
the production of fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals and other commercially-
important chemicals. This research also addresses the national need for
researchers trained in basic heavy element chemistry for the nuclear industry.
