This is a request for partial support of U.S. participation in a Joint Symposium
with Japan on drug delivery systems. The Symposium, first of its kind, will take
place on Dec. 16-20, 1991 in Hawaii. The technology of making systems that
deliver drugs continuously in controlled amounts is developing rapidly, and this
Symposium will be an important step in exchanging information with Japanese
scientists.
