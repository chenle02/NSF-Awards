With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Georgia Institute of Technology will
acquire a dual beam focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM).
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a)
multifunctional scanning nanoprobes and quantum cascade laser based sensing
systems; b) stimulated surface chemistry using metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
devices containing nano-scale field emission arrays; c) optically gated single
molecule transistors; d) shape-preserving chemical conversion of 3-D bioclastic
structures; e) nanobelts as nanobiosensors and nanocantilevers; and f) impedance
mapping atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever arrays.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental operating principle of the focused ion
beam (FIB) systems is comparable to scanning electron microscopes (SEM).
However, instead of an electron beam (e-beam), a finely focused beam of ions
with a diameter as small as 5 nm is focused on the sample surface. Operating the
primary ion beam at low beam currents allows imaging of the sample; at high beam
currents, sputtering or milling occurs. E-beam lithography allows
nanofabrication with higher lateral resolution, whereas ion beam enables short
processing time, high throughput, and a broader range (micrometer to nanometer).
This dual beam instrument allows for both e-beam and ion beam capabilities. This
instrument will be the only dual beam FIB/SEM system available in the state of
Georgia. &lt;br/&gt;
