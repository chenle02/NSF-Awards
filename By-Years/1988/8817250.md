This proposal is looking at the regulation of synthesis of LHCPII at the level
of translational control in Euglena. Both genomic and cDNA clones of Euglena
LHCPII are being sequenced to determine the identity of the proteins derived
from a polyprotein intermediate found during LHCPII synthesis. LHCPII mRNA
levels and the recruitment of LHCPII mRNA into polysomes are measured to
determine whether translational control operates at the level of initiation of
translation or afterwards. Hybrid-release and - arrest studies are being used to
determine the extent to which all four preLHCPIIs are derived through internal
initiation of the polyprotein mRNA. The results of these studies will aid in
understanding the mechanisms of light regulation of LHCPII translation in
Euglena. This proposal looks at the light regulation of protein synthesis of the
photosynthetic protein LHCPII in the unicellular organism Euglena. This alga
shows an unusual pattern of regulation of this protein such that synthesis of
the mRNA is held constant and the light-induced increase in LHCPII protein is
associated with an increased level of translation of the mRNA to protein. The
research outlined in this proposal is looking at the mechanism by which this
translational control is achieved since the light regulation of LHCPII in other
photosynthetic organisms operates at the level of mRNA production, not
translation. The results of this research should provide new insights into the
mechanisms of translational control in higher organisms, both plant and animal.
