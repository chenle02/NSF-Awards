The title of this proposal is "A Novel Interdisciplinary Science Teacher
Education Program for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) with a
Marine Science Thematic Approach." The 3-year program is designed to infuse
marine science into a re-structured general science curriculum that can serve as
a model to be replicated in all the schools in the District, where the student
population is 80% under- represented. The model will train a selected group (40
each year) of LAUSD teachers of grades 5-12, who will in turn function as peer
trainers in the LAUSD. Training will focus on an integrative curriculum with a
thematic emphasis on marine science. The program will be guided by various
educational resources that are available through the Consortium. It will be
implemented through the partnership between the Consortium and UCLA Extension
services at various institutional sites and at the Fort Mac Arthur Marine
Studies Center. The project runs from February 1, 1992 to January 31, 1996. The
cost sharing exceeds 41% of the amount requested from NSF.
