This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I (SBIR) research project uses
augmented reality devices to combine multimedia technologies with manikin task-
trainers to provide a nonlinear, immersive learning platform for nursing
education. This project hopes to combine interactive, 3D medical graphics with
the hands-on realism of manikin task trainer simulation, capitalizing on the
strengths of both technologies. Using mixed reality goggles, 3D imagery of the
body's internal anatomy will be superimposed over the view of the user,
providing additional 3D didactic information while using a task trainer manikin.
The project anticipates that this will enable highly effective synergy between
the visual and hands-on component of medical education.

Integrating multimedia technologies with manikin simulation presents the
opportunity to combine the strengths of both technologies. The potential
outcomes of this project will integrate multimedia medical education technology
with low-fidelity manikin technology (task trainers) using affordable, mixed-
reality goggles to provide an affordable mixed-reality training solution for
nursing education. While there have been academic prototypes of an augmented
reality application for endotracheal intubation, the project anticipates that
this will be the first work to develop fully functional mixed-reality training
simulator for nursing education. Using mixed-reality goggles, 3D imagery will be
superimposed over the view of the user. This will enable the user to get
additional 3D didactic information while using the task trainer. This research
project will play a role in increasing learning opportunities in the nursing
field. This technology may play a critical role in mitigating the well
documented future nursing shortage, by providing high quality virtual nursing
educational experiences, without increasing the number of nurse educators.
