9407993 Hastings Abstract Dramatic advances have been made in the way in which
biologists make and test predictions about the evolutionary relationships among
animals. However, the process of applying these modern phylogenetic methods to
the behavior of animals has just begun. This approach has great potential for
increasing our understanding of evolution and behavior. In order to pursue this
important area of research, it is necessary to work with groups of animals whose
ecology, morphology, developmental biology, and phylogenetic relationship are
all known. Dr. Hastings has identified such a group of animals whose natural
behavior is easily studied in the laboratory. He will conduct detailed studies
of their behavior and combine the results with existing information to work out
a detailed picture of behavioral evolution in this group. This project will help
develop a deeper understanding of the role of behavior in evolution.
