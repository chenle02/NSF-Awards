This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support
for the completion of Harvard's helium recovery and reliquefaction
infrastructure . The project includes helium gas recovery piping from a multi-
user nuclear magnetic resonance facility and from the labs of 15 faculty members
(8 physics, 3 engineering, and 4 chemistry), and the fixed equipment to collect,
liquefy, and dispense the recovered helium. The project would also include HVAC,
electrical, and control infrastructure required for
operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helium is used extensively in physics,
engineering, chemistry, and biology research whenever cold environments are
needed for experiments or detectors. Current and future research activities
include making accurate measurement of the electron magnetic moment and the fine
structure constant, and the most stringent test of charge-parity-time symmetry
with leptons; using helium as a buffer gas to cool new atoms and molecules into
Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum Fermionic systems; providing cooling for
studies of the electronic orders in exotic correlated electron materials such as
high-Tc superconductors and graphene; allowing access to the quantized energy
levels in nanostructures fabricated from materials such as GaAs, carbon
nanotubes, graphene, and diamond; and permitting diagnostics such as nuclear
magnetic resonance, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy
of newly synthesized molecules and catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year,
over 300 students and postdocs will be working on research projects in physics,
chemistry, and materials science that involve liquid helium. The liquefier would
conserve helium, a precious nonrenewable resource, and would consume
approximately one-fifth the electricity of alternative technologies such as
pulse tube refrigerators.
