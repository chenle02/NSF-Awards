DMS-0207488&lt;br/&gt;Tian-Jun Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project
is to apply methods from differential &lt;br/&gt;topology, geometric analysis
and algebraic geometry to study &lt;br/&gt;symplectic four
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic four manifolds can be divided into four
categories &lt;br/&gt;according to their Kodaira dimensions, which take values
-1, 0, 1 &lt;br/&gt;and 2. The classification of those with Kodaira dimenision
-1&lt;br/&gt;has been achieved, to which the investigator has made essential
&lt;br/&gt;contribution. Tian-Jun Li proposes to classify those with Kodaira
&lt;br/&gt;dimension 0. Fiber sum is the most powerful construction of
&lt;br/&gt;symplectic four manifolds, and one would like manifolds
&lt;br/&gt;constructed this way to be minimal. Tian-Jun Li has shown that
&lt;br/&gt;a large class of fiber sums are indeed minimal. The investigator
&lt;br/&gt;believes that he can prove it for all fiber sums using&lt;br/&gt;his
work on the minimal genus problem for rational
surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An n manifold is a space that locally
looks like the Euclidean &lt;br/&gt;space of dimension n. For example, the
space-time universe we &lt;br/&gt;live in is a four manifold. &lt;br/&gt;A
symplectic four manifold is a four manifold with&lt;br/&gt;a symplectic
structure, a very basic structure that underlies&lt;br/&gt;almost all the
equations of classical and quantum physics. &lt;br/&gt; Thus symplectic four
manifolds&lt;br/&gt;play a central role in mathematics and physics.&lt;br/&gt;
The investigator aims to gain some understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental
problem: classifying symplectic four manifolds.
