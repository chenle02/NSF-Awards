CBET-0828987&lt;br/&gt;Mutharasan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall
goal of this project is to develop quantitative measurement methods using
piezoelectric-excited millimeter-sized cantilever sensors (PEMC) for assaying
proteins in complex fluids such as cell culture medium or body fluids. The
methods to be developed will not use labeled reagents, and will measure proteins
directly in serum-containing fluids without a sample preparation step. The
cantilever sensors are unique in design and are the result of development in the
PI?s laboratory. The results obtained thus far are significant, as the
sensitivity obtained is superior to highly sensitive nano- and micro-
cantilevers, and is comparable (in simpler measurement format) to methods
advanced by others. When fully developed, the sensor can potentially be used in
a high throughput format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to develop a course
titled: "Fundamentals of Piezoelectric Cantilever Sensors with Applications to
Proteomics". The course notes will be web-published. A summer workshop on the
fabrication and use of PEMC sensors will be conducted for high school students.
Minority and under-represented students will be especially recruited.
