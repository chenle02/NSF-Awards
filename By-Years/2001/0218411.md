University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Optimal Control of Quantum Information
Processing Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time optimal control of quantum
mechanical systems can significantly minimize decoherence effects in coherent
manipulation of quantum pheonomenon. The central theme of the project is to
develop a mathematical theory for optimal unitary control of quantum networks.
Network of coupled two level quantum systems form the benchmark for a quantum
computer. Finding the minimum time it takes to produce a desired unitary
evolution in a network of coupled quantum systems is of fundamental practical
importance not just in the field of quantum information processing but the whole
field of coherent spectroscopy. In particular, focus is on optimal control of
network of coupled spin half particles (acting as qubits in liquid and solid
state NMR quantum conputing with fixed interaction Hamiltonian and ability to
selectively excite some of the qubits. One of the goals of this project is to
develop geometric methods for computing fundamental bounds on the minimum time
it takes to produce unitary evolution in a network of coupled quantum systems
and find time optimal control laws which achieve these bounds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These methods are based on variational ideas as captured
by the theory of optimal control. Finding optimal strategies to control the
dynamics of quantum networks can be reduced to problems in Riemannian geometry
of computing subriemannian geodesics in certain homogeneous spaces. Using these
geometric techniques time optimal control strategies for quantum networks are
being computed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
