This project will study efficient methods for classifying a system based on
outcomes revealed through a series of tests. A common task in medical decision-
making is to perform a sequence of diagnostic tests in order to determine an
underlying condition as quickly as possible. Tests will reveal partial
information about the underlying condition, but may also be subject to error.
The goal is to optimize the sequence of tests to minimize cost and time to
classification. Similar problems arise in fault detection of complex systems and
in threat detection. Noisy or missing data is a major issue in these
applications, which often renders traditional models inapplicable. These
examples can be modeled as sequential decision trees, and this project will
develop methods to study optimal sequential decision trees with noisy outcomes.
The specific questions studied in this project are of interest to multiple
research communities including operations research, industrial engineering,
computer science and machine learning. The educational component of this project
involves training graduate and undergraduate students for a career in research,
enhancing the curriculum of graduate courses, and outreach programs to high
school students designed to broaden participation in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project will study models and algorithms for stochastic covering
problems in the presence of noisy outcomes. Classical models for these problems
assume that random outcomes are observed without any noise. This project will
consider new models that incorporate noise in the following ways. In the
stochastic noise model, the outcomes of certain tests are uncertain with known
probability distributions. The stochastic noise can be either non-persistent or
persistent, depending on whether observing the same outcome repeatedly results
in independent samples. In the adversarial noise model, each noisy outcome
instantiates to a value that results in the worst-case objective. A central
paradigm in this project is the optimal decision tree, where one needs to
identify an unknown random hypothesis using an adaptive sequence of tests. Apart
from the noisy optimal decision tree problem, this project will also study noisy
versions of stochastic submodular-cover and sequential testing problems. The
project will design algorithms with mathematically rigorous performance
guarantees. It will also test the empirical performance of the resulting
algorithms on synthetic as well as publicly available
datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
