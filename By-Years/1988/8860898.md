This research involves the development of an electropneumatic actuator which
permits swift, smooth, electronically controlled movement, even under heavy
loads. The approach is an extension of electrochemical refrigeration compressor
technology. The research program will demonstrate the key elements of membrane
compressor cell performance. An experimental system can be built to demonstrate
the feasibility of electropneumatic actuators.
