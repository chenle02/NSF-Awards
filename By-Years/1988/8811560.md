The investigation covers a novel general purpose transport model, embodied in
an artificial intelligence based computer code, and its initial application to
the solution of the radiation heat transfer problem critical to the analysis of
crystal growth in a semitransparent ampoule exposed to heater cores with non-
unity view factors. The computational methodology is based on a discrete
particle model of transport being solved using a recursive tree, a common tool
used in the implementation of expert systems, and is suitable for solving a wide
range of transport problems. Use of a recursive tree facilitates the convenient
computational description of complex interactions and geometries common to
contemporary transport problems. The development and availability of this
modeling technique and its embodiment in a well documented, portable and
conveniently user extensible computer code results in advances in radiation heat
transfer and fluid mechanics problems.
