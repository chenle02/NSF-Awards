Biological Sciences (61) Ithaca College and EcoVillage at Ithaca, in
partnership, are developing a science-intensive curriculum in environmental
sustainability. Drawing on models of college/community affiliation successful on
other campuses, such as Pennsylvania State University, the project adds four new
laboratory courses (Ecologically Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Land Use,
Energy Systems and Sustainable Energy, and Ecological Footprinting) and faculty
sponsored summer research. The new courses are sequenced such that students are
introduced to the approach of sustainability science in the first course, master
the analytical tools involved in energy efficiency (combustion analyzers, watt
and light meters, thermal submetering systems, as well as computerized building
models) and land use (field surveys, and GPS/GIS) in the second and third
courses, and unify their knowledge and apply it using the ecological
footprinting approach in a final capstone course. Furthermore, all the core
courses in the Environmental Studies Program are being modified to incorporate
the curricular theme of environmental sustainability such that students are
trained in all aspects of sustainability and are fully equipped to pursue
careers at the science-policy interface with a solutions-oriented approach.
