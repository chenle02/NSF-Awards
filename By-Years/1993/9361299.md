9361299 Tekula Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) can sometimes be used as a
diagnostic device in biology and medicine. In general, LIF has difficulties in
relating the fluorescence spectra to the concentration of the emitters within
the tissue, in identifying different species, and in the possibility of
destroying the molecules being probed if the wrong excitation wavelength is
chosen. Many of the problems associated with fluorescence can be eliminated by
the use of Raman scattering. Raman techniques allow the measurement of multiple
species even in aqueous solutions (not accessible by infra-red methods because
of water absorption). However, spontaneous Raman techniques give very weak
signals. Signal enhancement is possible by utilizing resonance Raman techniques.
Both of these methods still suffer from the fact that spatial and, to some
extent, temporal information is lost. The research in this proposal is intended
to investigate a non-invasive, real-time, high resolution device for the
detection of enzyme levels, metabolite concentrations or other critical
molecules in single biological cells. This unique device is based on stimulated
Raman scattering and can simultaneously measure the concentrations and temporal
evolution of several different molecular species.
