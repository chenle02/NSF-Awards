9450394 The proposed research would attempt to gain a better understanding of
the environmental/geochemical processes involved in the "trapping " of
hydrophobic organic molecules within the organic matrix of sediments. The
experimental approach to solve this problem is based on the development of an
analytical technique capable of recovering these non extractable components from
the sediment/soil sample.
