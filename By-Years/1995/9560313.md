This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of a novel, high-efficiency process for the
infiltration/densification of fiber preforms. This method, designated closed-
system chemical vapor infiltration (CSCVI), offers several advantages over
conventional CVI. Raw material is used in a highly efficient manner, and
unreacted raw material is easily recycled for future use, thereby minimizing
materials costs. Because the process takes place inside a sealed system, there
is no waste stream, and only extremely small amounts of hazardous material are
used. The dramatic reduction in the waste stream translates into greatly reduced
costs for waste treatment. This project will specifically address the
manufacture of fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). By operating
at high efficiencies and minimizing the waste stream, it is expected that the
cost reduction per part will be about 45%, based on material costs alone.
Furthermore, because the waste stream is reduced by orders of magnitude, capital
equipment required for waste treatment will be greatly reduced. Essentially any
system currently utilizing conventional CVI can benefit from the application of
CSCVI. A successful demonstration of CSCVI is expected to improve the economics
of ceramic matrix composites. CMCs have benefitted from the success of
carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) and SiC/SiC materials. The cost of these
materials is quite high, however, and any technique that will significantly
reduce their cost is expected to find a large commercial market.
