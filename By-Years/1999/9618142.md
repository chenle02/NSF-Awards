9618142 Krasny This proposal is to develop a set of in-depth, interdisciplinary,
grade 9-12 instructional modules that focus the application of the four process
standards (from the National Science Education Standards) -- Science as Inquiry,
History and Nature of Science, Science and Technology, and Science in Personal
and Social Perspectives -- to the topic of environmental toxicology. This issue
is important to students living in urban, suburban and rural communities and all
students using the materials will be investigating problems relevant to their
own lives. The modules include activities designed to engage students in three
levels of inquiry, 1) open ended laboratory exercises that focus on building
skills and understanding science concepts, 2) exploratory investigations that
give students the opportunity to investigate variables related to their initial
laboratory exercise, and 3) controlled experimental research that uses the
results of explorations to define a controlled experiment with independent
variables. Students learn to communicate their results among communities of
scientists and to the wider lay community. The topic of environmental toxicology
is a focus of Cornell research programs and the scientists from these programs
will join with teachers and educators to develop the materials. The outcome
includes teacher materials designed to assist teachers in making the transition
to inquiry-based science and to other aspects of the science reform movement.
