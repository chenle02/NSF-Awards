Soviet and Western scholars have been devoting increasing attention to the
question of the efficiency potential of the Soviet economic system. It has long
been thought and/or known that that Soviet allocational, productive and
distributive arrangements impede efficiency, but attempts to rigorously
classify, analyze and measure these phenomena are of more recent origin. A good
deal of valuable work has been accomplished, but much remains to be done. The
purpose of this research project is to continue past joint work with
collaborators at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences (TsEMI) in Moscow. It represents the second year (Phase II)
of a five-year research agenda, to which the Soviet research team also is
committed. The current Phase involves four main directions of analysis: (1) to
complete a monograph entitled Theory and Measurement of Economic Efficiency in
the Soviet Union and the United States; (2) to assimilate the disparate strands
of the efficiency literature into a status report on the analysis and
measurement of Soviet economic efficiency; (3) to assess the efficiency
potential of the Soviet economic system by extending existing theoretical and
empirical analyses; and (4) to evaluate the implications of Gorbachev's
unfolding reforms from the standpoint of the efficiency potential of the system.
The methodology being developed and applied in this project has broad
applicability in economics. The collaborative effort, unique for its scale in
this area, should provide a better formal picture of the emerging Soviet
economic arrangements, at the same time that it acquaints some influential
Soviet economists with state-of-the-art Western analysis.
