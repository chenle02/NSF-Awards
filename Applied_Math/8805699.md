This research is concerned with the mathematical foundations of classical field
theory. The work will develop a covariant Hamiltonian formalism in the calculus
of variations which will provide a general and systematic means of analyzing any
variational principle. The key ingredient in this work is a generalization of
the notion of a multisymplectic structure. This work should furnish a
comprehensive basis for studying questions related to symmetries, the Cauchy
problem, linearization, stability, and quantization.
