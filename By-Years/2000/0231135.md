Invertebrates comprise 95% of all animal life on the Earth and dominate the
world's oceans so some knowledge of their biology and ecology is fundamental to
a student's understanding of the planet's ecosystems. Invertebrates are covered
in many university-level courses ranging from traditional invertebrate zoology
classes to those emphasizing general introductory biology, marine biology,
oceanography, and biodiversity, to name a few. Invertebrates are represented by
a dizzying array of body forms and morphological variations as well as complex
feeding, locomotory, and other behaviors that are difficult to describe and
illustrate. Virtually all textbooks represent invertebrates with line drawings
and photographs in an encyclopedic manner that provide students with little or
no sense of their position and/or behavior in natural habitats. No multimedia
products are available on the market today that provide students with a means to
observe most invertebrate groups, their respective body plans and behaviors.
This project is developing a prototype interactive CD-ROM containing digital
videotape sequences of selected living marine invertebrates with an emphasis on
the body plans and locomotory and feeding behavior of two major groups. We are
building on several years of experience in videotaping living invertebrates
under both natural and simulated field conditions and have access to a multitude
of marine habitats and state-of-the-art culture facilities for conducting the
project. The prototype is being tested by visiting undergraduate students from
30 universities that use our teaching and research facilities. Additional
testing of the prototype will occur at a national meeting of invertebrate
zoologists.
