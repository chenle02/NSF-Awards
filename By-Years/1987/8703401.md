The research will deal with asymptotic problems in nonparametric inference. For
inference on regression, due to the possibility of heavy-tailed residual
distribution, regression is viewed in more general way than conditional
expectation. Regression estimation with homogeneous residuals and various
generalizations of the well-known Theil estimator will be sought. Inference on
autoregressive processes with heavy-tailed residuals is part of such problems as
well. Kernel and nearest neighbor methods will be used for estimation of a
conditional quantile function. The important issue in these methods is the
choice of the smoothing parameter. Other topics of study will include inference
on linear regression based on truncated and censored data, use of covariate
information via nonparametric regression in observational studies, methods for
parallel regression, non- parallel regression and tests of parallelity.
