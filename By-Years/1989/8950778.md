The first major change that has occurred in the teaching of organic chemistry
laboratory in decades has been the introduction of the microscale laboratory
technique. The apparatus is down sized and experiments are carried out on a
scale one-tenth to one-thousandth of the scale previously employed. The
microscale technique is an entirely new way of doing the undergraduate organic
chemistry laboratory: everything on a very small scale. Among the many
advantages of this technique is a strong instrumental focus, infrared
spectrometry and gas chromatography. Switching from the traditional approach to
the microscale technique cannot be accomplished without ready access to these
important instrumental techniques. Along with using the infrared spectrometer
and the GC for product characterization in most of their experimental work, the
students learn the theory behind these two important instrumental techniques.
The institution is matching the grant with an equal amount of funds.
