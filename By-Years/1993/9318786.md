9318786 Zimmerman This award provides for adding five institutions to the state
mid-level network ARKnet, and extending ARKnet's capability to provide service
to less populated areas and new Internet users. Faculty and students at the
newly connected campuses will benefit from access to the resources of the
Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able
to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit
of research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of this
project for two years. ***
