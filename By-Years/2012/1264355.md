This proposal will investigate whether the presence of target bile acids in a
solution outside a droplet of liquid crystalline material (5CB) will trigger a
radial-to-bipolar transition in the structure of the liquid crystal, which can
then be detected simply by polarized light microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, this method of detecting bile acids is much easier than existing
technique and might be employed in more remote locations where sophisticated
analytical tools are not available.
