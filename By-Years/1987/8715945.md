Extensive collections of fossil decapod crustaceans, which were made on Seymour
Island, Antarctica, during the 1986-1987 field season, permit continuation and
extension of research on the paleobiology of this group throughout the southern
high latitude region. These specimens extend the distribution of decapods in
Late Cretaceous-Paleocene, making it possible to test the extent to which the
terminal Cretaceous extinction event effected decapod faunas in high latitude
regions. Because several new, or recently described taxa are ancestral to modern
deep-water forms, it is also possible to determine whether the organisms possess
similar reproductive strategies which may have served equally well as an
adaptation to deep-water and high latitude shallow-water habitats. Further, the
extended information regarding the distribution of decapods from Seymour Island
can be coupled with data derived from detailed collecting of sites in New
Zealand, containing comparable faunas, to further expand our knowledge of the
biogeographic distribution of Southern Hemisphere forms.
