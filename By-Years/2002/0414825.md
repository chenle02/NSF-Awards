18th Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics

Abstract.

This grant will support the "18th Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and
Related Topics." The workshop has become internationally recognized, for both
the high quality of its research talks and the supportive environment it
provides for junior researchers. Participants will give presentations covering
all areas related to automorphic forms, including Maass wave forms, elliptic
curves, Siegel and Jacobi modular forms, special values of L-functions, random
matrices, quadratic forms, computation and applications of modular forms, etc.
As in the past, this sharing of knowledge will be of significant benefit to the
participants, as well as to the wider mathematical community. It will also
provide participants with the opportunity to establish new collaborations and
strengthen their existing collaborations.

In addition to cutting-edge research presentations, this workshop will feature
discussion sessions, facilitated by experts, on the following topics:
Encouraging and retaining women and other underrepresented groups in the number
theory community; Applying for grants and funding opportunities. Experts will
contribute their own successful experiences, aimed at engaging the participants
in each of these important topics. These discussion sessions will result in a
written report, to be posted on the American Institute for Mathematics (AIM)
website as a living document. This will provide a lasting benefit to
participants, as well as to their future students and colleagues.
