The Mathematical Science Research Institute is developing and producing a
15-minute pilot for a regular mathematics slot in a new PBS magazine format
program that is being developed. Keith Devlin will be responsible for the
mathematics content as well as appearing as the on-camera host. The segments
will be based on Devlin's popular radio "Math Guy" segments that have been
appearing on NPR's Weekend Edition. The topic for the pilot is the Clay
Millennium Problems. The pilot is being produced by Jon Palfreman, an award-
winning science documentary producer. Evaluation of the pilot will be conducted
by Rockman et. al. If successful, a future segment would explore a range of
mathematics topics including mathematics education, epidemiology, scientific
visualization, uses and misuses of statistics, how the brain acquires and
processes mathematics, and the mathematics of voting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
