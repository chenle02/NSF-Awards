Over the past few decades, it has become increasingly common for people to set
forth for remote, harsh, and potentially dangerous environments in the interests
of science, commerce and national defense. The focus of this conference is on
innovative behavioral research pertaining to psychological and social adaptation
to the antarctic, and by analogy, to outer space and other potentially harsh
environments. The meeting will provide an opportunity for a diverse group of
behavioral scientists, antarctic researchers, operational personnel, and space
scientists to discuss common interests and future plans. The conference will
specifically explore the application of recent theories and methods to
understanding life in Antarctica and analogous settings. Experienced
participants will be encouraged to identify critical research needs for
behavioral research within isolated and confined settings and to apply the
results of behavioral research findings to future polar and spaceflight
operations. A report of the proceedings will be produced which will include a
synthesis of recommended future research directions in this area of scientific
activity. The Polar Biology and Medicine Program recommends support of this
conference. The National Space and Aeronautics and Space Administration is
providing joint support of the conference.
