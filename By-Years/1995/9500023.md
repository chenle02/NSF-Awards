Proposal Number: ECS-9500023 Principal Investigator: Mark Kushner ABSTRACT This
is a Research Equipment Grant proposal for purchase of additional memory and
processors for a Sun Sparcserver 1000. The SS1000 is a moderately parallel
computer having up to eight processors. The SS1000 is dedicated to research
projects win which computer model and parallel algorithms are being developed
for plasma equipment used in processing and toxic gas redemption.
