Configuration updates are a common source of instability in networks today,
frequently leading to outages, disruptions, and even security vulnerabilities. A
key factor that makes updates difficult to implement is that networks are
complex systems with many interacting components. A typical datacenter network
consists of thousands of devices, a significant challenge for network
administrators is that each of these devices must be reconfigured after an
update. The goal of this research is to develop new mechanisms for implementing
network configuration updates using techniques based on software synthesis.

To meet this goal, the research is developing (i) new synthesis algorithms based
on efficient incremental model checking techniques; (ii) extensions that model
bandwidth and fault tolerance using quantitative constraints and objective
functions; and (iii) theoretical foundations based on connections to concurrent
and distributed programming. The project will have broad impact by discovering
new techniques that automate a difficult network administration task and by
training undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary skills in
formal methods and networking.
