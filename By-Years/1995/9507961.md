IBN-9507961 Lutz, Peter L. The brain of most vertebrates, including humans, has
such an obligatory high energy demand that even a short term interruption in
brain oxygen supply can result in irreversible neuronal damage. However, in some
unique species the brain can survive and recover from the absence of oxygen for
many hours. Interestingly, the mechanisms allowing this survival are
recapitulated in the initial phases of the mammalian brain responses to the
absence of oxygen. Clearly, chemicals in the brain functioning as messenger
molecules are of paramount importance in regulating brain activity. Dr. Lutz
proposes to investigate the role of these messengers in tolerating oxygen
deprivation. One messenger seems to play a paramount role in the response to
oxygen deprivation, and that messenger is adenosine. Therefore, Dr. Lutz will
determine the role of adenosine in conserving brain energy stores during oxygen
deprivation and also in protecting the brain from the ravages of cell loss
during periods of low oxygen levels. By learning the mechanisms by which the
system survives oxygen deprivation, valuable insights will be provided into the
processes underlying the harmful changes that occur during oxygen deprivation in
mammalian species and humans.
