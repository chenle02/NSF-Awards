Dr. Schwartz's research is focused on two areas. First, transition metal
complexes will be bound to an oxide support which will then be a ligand
environment for them by anchoring to prevent clustering of coordinatively
unsaturated species, stabilizing high-oxidation states of the transition metal,
and acting as a variable ligand in which basicity and availability of Lewis acid
and hydroxylic sites can be adjusted. These complexes will be probed by kinetic,
structural and synthetic studies. Second, early transition metal complexes will
be studies for use as new synthetic reagents. The focus will be on the catalytic
conversion of hydroxy acids into lactones by use of oxotungsten compounds. The
preparation of oxide-bound zirconium species and comparisons to soluble analogs
will also be carried out. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program of
the Chemistry Division will support the research of Dr. Jeffry Schwartz of the
Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. The research is in the general
area of synthetic methodology and is focused on the areas of transition metal
reagents in organic synthesis. The goals of the project are to find metal
complexes which can perform specific transformations on organic substrates under
mild conditions and in high yield.
