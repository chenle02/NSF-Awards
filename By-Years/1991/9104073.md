Within the scope of the proposed research, a complete range of multinuclear
magnetic resonance experiments will be conducted. The three research foci are:
Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Study of Lanthanide Ion Solvation and Complex
Formation, NMR Study of Chlorophyll A in Galactolipid Membranes, and
Polyborane/Carbon Cluster Chemistry. The main objective of the proposed research
is the evaluation of the coordinating properties of the lanthanides in the
presence of a variety of ligands and in different solvent media, with an
eventual expansion of the program to ligands of biological interest. This
research program, which encompasses instrumentation and application of NMR to
inorganic, organic, and biological molecules, will be conducted by a chemist and
six minority students at California State University at Los Angeles.
