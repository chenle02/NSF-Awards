The recent Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) program and its partner the Bering
Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP) have resulted in a better
understanding of the roles of temperature and stratification in regulating the
walleye pollock population, but the role of advection remains poorly understood.
Therefore, funds are provided to elucidate how the ocean?s response to variable
atmospheric forcing affects the distribution of walleye pollock (Theragra
chalcogramma) eggs and larvae on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The proposed
approach builds on advances made under the BEST-BSIERP program and will use a
combination of new modeling results and recent observations to examine
historical dispersal pathways of pollock eggs and larvae and will simulate how
these might change in the future under various
scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advection, the transport of material or a
property by the movement of a fluid, plays a major role in the life cycle of
many fish populations because early life history stages depend on quasi-passive
transport from spawning areas to suitable nursery grounds. Drift trajectories of
eggs and larvae and the physical and biological conditions they encounter during
the first few months after spawning are highly variable and are linked to
regional and broad-scale climate conditions. Thus atmospheric and oceanographic
variability affects the survival of early life stages and the resulting year
class strength of fish populations, such as walleye Pollock, on the eastern
Bering shelf. The results of this project will improve our understanding of the
interactions of physical and biological processes on walleye Pollock and,
consequently, lead to better management of this important fishery.
