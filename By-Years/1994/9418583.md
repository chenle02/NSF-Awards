9418583 Humphreys This award provides one-half the funding for an upgrade to the
computational resources in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Oregon. The institution is committed to providing the remaining
funds lecessary to acquire the equipment. The computer system upgrade will be
used primarily in the research and teaching programs of several faculty members
and their students in geophysics. Their areas of research include regional-scale
seismic imaging of the crust and mantle, kinematic and dynamic modeling of
lithospheric deformation, seismic imaging of ocean ridge-crest structures, and
paleoseismicity studies. ***
