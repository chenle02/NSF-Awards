The objective of this research is an experimental investigation of laboratory
columnar vortices which are frequently useful representations of tornadoes. A
new non-intrusive measuring device--laser velocimeter--will be used to
investigate the region at the base of the vortex where the inflow layer erupts
to form the vortex core; it is here that the lowest pressures and highest speeds
are found. Air flow in the vortx core will be investigated using neutrally
buoyant bubbles. Despite the fact that a laboratory aplparatus is in principle
incapable of completely simulating actual tornadoes, it appears that several
characteristics of laboratory vortices may reveal some of the essential physics
of actual tornadoes. This prospect is further supported by theoretical work
which is not restricted by the usual limitations of the laboratory. Thus, the
laboratory results could suggest crucial measurements in actual tornadoes or a
novel analysis of existing observatories.
