The aim of this project is the development of regularization theories, robust
numerical algorithms, and a software package for problems that are known to be
highly sensitive to data perturbations. Some of the fundamental problems in
algebraic computation that remain at the frontier in numerical analysis, and
where reliable algorithms and software are in demand, are of this nature.
Extending on novel theories and algorithms/software developed under previous NSF
support, the PI proposes to design algorithms for defective eigenvalue problems,
to develop a numerical elimination strategy for polynomial systems, to validate
the regularization theories, and to produce software, NAClab.

This research attempts to bridge scientific fields of numerical analysis,
computer algebra, algebraic geometry, and differential topology. Hypersensitive
problems are known to be formidable challenges in practical computation
particularly when empirical data are inevitably used. Advances in attacking
those problems will enable wide range of applications. The intellectual merit of
this project lies in an innovative geometric analysis, proven regularization
theory and an effective computational methodology for striking out the dreaded
hypersensitivity in fundamental algebraic problems. This project is
multidisciplinary in nature along with a major outcome in a robust, blackbox-
type, and publicly available software toolbox NAClab to solve highly sensitive
algebraic problems arising in sciences/engineering and to serve as building
blocks for future algorithmic development. The software will supply critical
tools for application areas such as robotics, molecular conformation, chemical
equilibrium, Nash equilibria, automatic control, as well as other branches of
mathematics such as algebraic geometry.
