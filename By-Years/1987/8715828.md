Ammonia is the most readily assimilated nitrogen source for bacterial growth.
Before adapting to utilization of dinitrogen or other sources of fixed nitrogen,
both itrogen fixing and heterotrophic microorganisms avidly scavenge the
environment for ammonia. Under these conditions, the active, concentrative
uptake of ammonium ion is required for the utilization of ammonia and for
repression of nitrogen fixation. This project will study the mechanism and
metabolic regulation of ammonium ion transport in Escherichia coli, an enteric
bacterium, and Azotobacter vinelandii, a free-living, aerobic, nitrogen-fixing
bacterium. The project involves both biochemical and molecular genetic
approaches to four primary objectives: 1. To test the hypothesis that active
NH4+ transport is catalyzed by an NH4+/K+ antiporter which utilizes high-energy
phosphate. 2. To select mutants of E. coli with defects in the structural gene
for the ammonium transporter. 3. To deduce the primary amino acid sequence of
the ammonium transporter from the DNA sequence of the cloned gene and to
identify homologus sequences in the genome of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. 4. To
describe the mechanism of feedback inhibition of ammonium transport by
glutamine. This information will be useful in the genetic design of nitrogren-
fixing bacteria which more readily provide ammonia for soil enrichment. //
