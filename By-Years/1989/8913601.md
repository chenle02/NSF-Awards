Title: U.S..China Cooperative Research: Local Political Reform in China
Abstract Narrative: This is a two and one half.year collaborative research
project between John E. Jackson and M. Kent Jennings of the University of
Michigan and researchers from the Political Science Department of Beijing
University. The three objectives of the project are (1) to study the political
and economic reforms taking place at the local level in China, (2) to examine
the structure and behavior of local government in China, >comparing these
structures and behaviors with those in other countries, and (3) to bring
researchers from Beijing University into the international research community
through their participation in the design of the study, the data collection, and
the writing and publishing of papers based on this work. This project is
expected to provide important new findings about political and economic reform
in China, about how global trends affecting all countries are being dealt with
in China, and about how local government and politics in China compare to those
in other countries. It will provide some baseline analyses and a data set that
will encompass a broad range of political and economic phenomena, and as such,
will constitute a fundamental advance in the knowledge of and ability to study
political dynamics in China. This collaborative project is jointly sponsored by
the NSF and the Chinese State Education Commission.
