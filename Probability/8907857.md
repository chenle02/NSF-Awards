The principal investigator will continue to work on developing a theory of
Lyapunov exponents and stable manifolds for stochastic dynamical systems with
finite memory. Such dynamical systems occur in many applied sciences as models
of physical phenomena incorporating the past history of the state variables as
well as the effects of random fluctuations or noise. One example would be a
hydrodynamic model of blood circulation while a second would be a model for
population growth. Small random perturbations of deterministic delay models also
lead very naturally to stochastic differential delay systems. This research will
lead to discoveries concerning the almost sure dynamics of these models.
