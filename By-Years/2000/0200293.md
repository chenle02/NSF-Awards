This award supports improvements in the capability and reliability of the X-ray
diffraction laboratory used for study of single crystals of biological
macromolecules at Purdue University. The equipment to be obtained with this
support will be used for in research aimed at determination of the three-
dimensional crystal structures of proteins, RNA molecules, and of protein-
nucleic acid complexes. Knowledge of such structures are essential to molecular
level understanding of how biological macromolecules function in a variety of
processes. Three types of equipment will be obtained: a new diffraction
instrument that will improve throughput and, by providing a more monochromatic
and intense X-ray beam, that will facilitate the study of very large
macromolecules. The new instrument will allow flash-frozen crystals to be saved
in their frozen state for later diffraction experiments. A new optical system
for an existing diffraction instrument will improve the intensity and quality of
the X-ray beam, permitting more pricise measurements and use of smaller crystals
than now possible. Finally a new microspectrophotometer will be obtained to
monitor enzymatic reactions and measure ligand binding of crystalline
macromolecules. The award provides improved infrastructure for one of the
nation's leading academic laboratories in one of the most important areas of
contemporary biology.
