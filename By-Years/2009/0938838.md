This award supports the annual conference for the Summer Research Opportunity
Program (SROP). This program is offered by universities in Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. SROP offers
undergraduate students first-hand exposure to graduate study and faculty life
through mentor-guided research and professional development seminars. The
culminating event is the CIC-SROP research conference. This year's conference
will be held at the University of Michigan and offers more than 450 students
with the opportunity to present their research, participate in research
roundtables and workshops, and network with faculty attendees.
