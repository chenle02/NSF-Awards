*** 970635 Donahue This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
be directed toward the fabrication and performance evaluation of a new
generation of oxygen anion conducting solid electrolytes. The new materials
based on oxygen deficient brownmillerite lattices are expected to have a near
term potential for achieving high ionic conductivities at relatively lower
temperatures. There are strong incentives to develop solid electrolytes for
application in electrochemical cells and sensors. The performance of these
devices would be significantly enhanced by realizing higher ionic conductivity
at lower temperatures than is currently realized in the yttria stabilized
zirconia. It would, for example, enable fuel cell technology to be economically
competitive by reducing the severe materials constraints on hardware due to the
high operating temperatures of the current system. Moderate temperature
electrochemical devices based on such advanced solid electrolytes will only
require relatively inexpensive stainless steel hardware components for their
implementation. Successful completion of this program will result in identifying
a new generation of oxygen anion conducting solid electrolytes for application
in intermediate temperature electrochemical devices. ***
