The tremendous increasing demand to support various data applications requires a
wireless network to be more agile and spectral-efficient. Cognitive Radio
technology allows secondary users to access the underutilized licensed bands and
is a promising solution. However, the coexistence of secondary users with the
authorized primary users requires careful and dynamic resource management to
deal with interference, which is a very challenging issue. The major objective
of this project is to deal with the issue by utilizing graph theory/algorithms
to develop efficient resource management schemes for general coexistence
scenarios.
