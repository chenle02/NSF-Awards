9302812 JENKINS Understanding of the physical processes affecting gases in the
upper ocean is important for quantifying biogeochemical cycles in the upper
ocean. Time series measurements of dissolved gas concentrations in the upper
ocean, which respond to changes in atmosphere-ocean "forcing" have proven
effective in studying gas exchange rates. This project will develop and deploy a
moored sequential noble gas sampling system which will permit the determination
of a time series of noble gas concentrations at several depths in the near
surface. The device will be capable of obtaining between 50 and 100 samples at
predetermined time intervals over a course of days to months (as dictated by the
scientific program). Samples would be processed in the laboratory using a self-
contained, automated vacuum system which would sequentially extract and analyze
the stored samples. The noble gases (He,Ne,Ar and Kr) will be analyzed to
document the time evolution of gas concentrations during high wind events,
permitting the quantitative modeling of bubble injection and gas exchange rates
at those wind speeds. This will permit the comparison of models of these
important processes on larger scales. Comparison of results with noble gas
analyses of conventionally obtained water samples, as well as moored oxygen
sensor and total gas devices will be used to evaluate sampler performance and
refine models.
