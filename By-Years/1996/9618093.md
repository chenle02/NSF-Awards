9618093 Rutherford This project will involve the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) to continue the work of science education reform
by developing an Atlas for Science Literacy, expand Resources for Science
Literacy, and to support educators who want to put these tools, and others
already developed by AAAS, to work in their states, districts, and schools. The
Atlas will produce "strand maps" that portray the sequence and structure of
knowledge and skills needed for students to achieve particular science literacy
goals. Resources will: provide aid to those developing science frameworks at
district and state levels; develop workshop guides to help preservice and
inservice teachers improve heir knowledge and skills in science, mathematics,
and technology, along with their instructional skills; and extend the procedure
for analyzing science materials to mathematics and technology materials.
Finally, the project will work with reform leaders on using these materials. The
third party evaluation by SRI will continue.
