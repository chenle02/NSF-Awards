With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Scuseria will develop new algorithms for the application of
coupled-cluster perturbation theory to the study of molecular electronic
structure. This theory will be instrumental in understanding chemical bonding in
transition metal dimers, hydrides and the C-H bond of acetylene. Four research
projects will be carried out. (1) The formulation and implementation of an
analytical energy gradient capacity within the open shell coupled-cluster
method. (2) The implementation of a full coupled-cluster method that includes
all single, double, triple and quadruple excitations. (3) A solution of the
coupled-cluster equations that attempts to transfer the effect of triple
excitations directly onto the single and double excitation amplitudes. (4) A
formulation of the coupled-cluster theory in terms of the Hartree-Fock-
Bogoliubov reference state as an alternate to the conventional multi-reference
approach.
