The Fourth International Congress of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology will
be held at the College Park Campus of the University of Maryland from June 30 to
July 7, 1990. The theme of the Congress "The Unity of Systematic and
Evolutionary Biology" will bring together an international assemblage of
systematists, population biologists, and ecologists, as well as members of the
"user community", for which systematics is a critical but undervalued resource
(e.g., agroeconomists, government policy specialists, conservationists, and
biotechnologists). The Congress will host sessions on a variety of topics,
several of which will be devoted to the main themes of: 1) Evolution in
Perspective: Biodiversity, Conservation, Biotechnology, and Global Change; 2)
Evolutionary Mechanisms and Processes; and 3) Systematics and Phylogenetic
Reconstructions. Ten scientific societies will also be sponsoring symposia at
the Congress. Dr. Reaka's proposal to the National Science Foundation addresses
the critical issue of human resources in systematic and evolutionary biology.
NSF support for the Congress will allow graduate students, members of under-
represented groups of U.S. scientists, and investigators from lesser-developed
countries to attend this important meeting. This travel support will promote
international collaborations and enhance the research careers of women and
minority scientists in the U.S.
