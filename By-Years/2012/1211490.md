The PI will use data from the Venus Express and Pioneer Venus spacecraft, and
existing moodels of Mars in order to constrain models of Venus' ionosphere. He
will focus on modeling major transitions of the dominant ion composition and
electron temperature that have measured as a function of change in altitude.

The work will be useful to better explaining how ionospheres are formed and
maintained. An ionosphere is the uppermost part of a planet's atmosphere where
most of the atoms and molecules are ionized by photons from the Sun, and thus it
has properties of both a gas and plasma. This research has broader impacts to
modeling all terrestrial ionospheres, including those of planets around other
stars. The research team will include the participation of a graduate student,
undergraduate students and high school students.
