Detecting targets and their direction-of-arrival plays a key role in the areas
of radar, sonar, astronomy, seismology and wireless communications. In the case
of passive sensing with a receiver to just analyze signals intercepted, a
uniform linear sensing array with N physical sensors can identify at most N - 1
targets, guided by the theoretical limit of the so-called degree of freedom
(DoF) metric. Designing a sensing system with high DoF can fundamentally advance
the field of sensing, detection and estimation, by increasing the capacity of
such systems. The advancement is instrumental to support various applications
and services that are important for national security and the economy. This
project seeks to develop some fundamental techniques for active sensing to
significantly increase the degree-of-freedom metric, and contribute to the
advancement of sensing, detection and estimation that many applications depend
upon. The investigator will incorporate the project materials into both
undergraduate and graduate courses, and will facilitate participation from
under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work falls into two major
thrusts: 1) Developing a fundamental Active Synthetic Co-array that can exploit
the concurrent use of principles of MIMO radar and co-arrays to surpass the
sensing limit from the use of either technique alone; 2) Designing a novel two-
level advanced sparse array geometry that can take full advantage of the active
synthetic co-array method and flexibly integrate different array geometries in
the two levels to increase the DoF up to four orders while meeting various
application needs with different array structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
