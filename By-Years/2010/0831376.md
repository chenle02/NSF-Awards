The goal of this project is to develop the Application Aware Anonymity (A3)
infrastructure, a flexible, secure, and low-overhead infrastructure for
deploying anonymity-based services on the Internet. A3 allows applications to
tailor their anonymity properties and performance characteristics according to
their specific requirements. A3 employs a novel path selection scheme that
allows hosts to discover routes with specific anonymity and network properties.
Declarative networking is used as an extensible framework for users to specify
their routes using a declarative interface. A3 utilizes network coordinate
systems that map nodes to n-dimensional coordinates such that the distance
between coordinates corresponds to network metrics such as latency and bandwidth
between the nodes. To secure its network coordinate systems, A3 utilizes
Veracity, a fully decentralized vote-based service that does not require a
priori shared secrets or trusted nodes to verify network coordinates. The
intellectual merit of this project is the integration of concepts from
networking, security, and distributed data management. The broader impact of
this program is the development of an extensible routing infrastructure that
enables the rapid development, deployment, and testing of anonymous source-
routing protocols and applications. A3 will be disseminated as open-source, and
deployed as a PlanetLab service with a declarative API to enable security and
networking researchers to rapidly develop, deploy, and experiment with different
anonymous routing strategies. Potential applications of this infrastructure
include the anonymization of next-generation Internet services including voice-
over-IP, video-on-demand, video teleconferencing, and live audio and video
streaming.
