This proposal describes a series of experiments aimed at addressing the
questions of the stability of crystal surfaces at elevated temperatures. The
relationship of three types of instabilities on the relatively open surfaces of
metals are particularly interesting; surface roughening, surface melting, and
irreversible surface reconstructions. Metal surfaces are exceptional candidates
to study all three instabilities since the temperatures for these different
structural transformations (whether already measured or theoretically predicted)
are all very similar for this face. All of these studies require detailed
information on the temperature dependence of the long range correlations. This
information will be obtained through accurate measurements of low energy
electron diffraction profiles. Understanding roughening on metal surfaces will
be of extreme interest since the high concentration of active adsorption sites
present above the roughening temperature are critical to many important
catalytic processes. In addition, surface roughening and surface melting are now
recognized as important factors in the growth of semiconductor superlattices and
metal-semiconductor interfaces.
