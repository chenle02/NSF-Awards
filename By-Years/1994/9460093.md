The unique product described in this proposal has the potential to greatly
improve the current procedures used to obtain hemostasis and control trauma
during invasive surgery. It is estimated that by 1998 there will be in excess of
1.5 million surgical procedures that will use some type of hemostatic device.
Currently, there are no products on the market that adequately address all the
surgeon's needs. The major complaint is that present devices cannot be
effectively sutured or stapled in place. This is due to the low tensile strength
and poor tear resistance of the materials. It is the objective of this program
to prepare bioresorbable laminated structures that can be sutured in place and
provide a high degree of support to traumatized organs and tissues. The program
will involve an initial screening of bioresorbable polymers as well as a
preliminary investigation into the best methods of attaching the reinforcing
polymer film to the rather delicate collagen hemostat. Once this screening
process is completed the best candidates will be tested in vivo under surgical
conditions. If the Phase I study is funded, Kensey Nash Corporation will be able
to move to Phase II which will include an evaluation of polymer structures and
collagen pore sizes (lyophilization technique) relative to the overall tensile
strength of the device.
