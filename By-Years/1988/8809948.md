This research examines the development of education as an institution, and the
impact of political and economic forces on its expansion. It also relates
educational expansion to economic growth, a central topic in the study of the
development of human capital within the labor force. The objectives are (1) to
extend the analysis of existing research on models of education in the United
States to Europe and (2) to extend the time period in which they are examined
(1850-1975). The goal is to develop a contingency theory, that is, to specify
the conditions under which human capital theory (developing skills ) or
credentialling theory (acquiring certification) are more applicable. The
contingency of particular interest is a strong and active government (state).
Looking at four countries (Britain, France, Germany and Italy) over a long range
of time permits considerable variations in state policies, economies and
educational systems. This research offers an opportunity to broaden theories of
the effects of education on economic growth, first by generalizing across
countries and second by generalizing across time. Finding conditions under which
educational expansion does and does not affect the economy is important in
clarifying current explanatory approaches to educational growth.
