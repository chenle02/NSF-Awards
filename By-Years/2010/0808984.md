In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Morse of the University of Utah,
together with his postdoctoral and graduate student researchers, will study the
structure and boding in a series of transition metal silicides, early-late
transition metal dimers (e.g. TiNi), transition dimer metal cations, and
complexes of TiO+ cations with Lewis bases. These experiments will be carried
out in a molecular beam or a cryogenically-cooled ion-trap. The molecules will
be interrogated with a variety of laser spectroscopic methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These molecular species are a challenge for current
theoretical methods, thus these results will serve as useful benchmark systems
to test new or improved computational chemistry methods. In addition, the
species themselves are important models with which to build up useful models of
technologically important materials -- from memory metals to titanium oxide
photocatalysts. The young scientists working with Prof. Morse will use
sophisticated lasers and vacuum apparatus, and will be well-trained for the
technological workforce. Prof. Morse has trained a significant number of women
scientists, and this track record is expected to continue.&lt;br/&gt;
