Courses on computer networks and distributed operating systems rarely provide
students with realistic hands-on experience. As computer technology moves into a
new era characterized by multimedia communications and high-performance
computing, this deficiency becomes more and more significant. It is imperative
that changes are made at the undergraduate level to keep up with the evolution
of theoretical and practical skills. A series of courses in computer networks
and operating systems has been developed to address these changes. The success
of this innovative curriculum depends to a large extent on this project, which
funds the establishment of a modern networking and operating systems laboratory.
This laboratory facilitates experiments with network installation, system
administration and testing, multimedia (specifically audio/video) traffic
control, and operating system management.
