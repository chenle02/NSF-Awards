An important issue in the design of host-network interfaces is how much
protocol processing should be done in hardware (i.e. on the network device) and
how much should be done in software (i.e., on the host). THis issue is becoming
increasingly important as improving network performance puts more and more
stress on the end host. Recent work in this area has focused on moving one or
more high-level protocols from the host to the network device. In contrast, the
principal investigators propose to investigate another point on the design
spectrum. --a chip that implements a collection of protocol-independent
functions. The PIs have identified key functions that span multiple protocols,
and plan to provide these functions in hardware. The chip, called the x-chip is
an outgrowth of the PIs' work on the x-Kernel--software architecture that
supports protocol implementations. One of the design philosophies of the
x-Kernel has been to identify tasks that are common to all protocols, and to
provide general software tools that support these tasks. The x-chip takes this
philosophy one step further by moving certain aspects of the support tools into
hardware. The ultimate goal is to integrate the network device and the network
software infrastructure vertically.
