Naming and identification is critical to the Internet today, with the Internet's
Domain Name System (DNS) as the glue making the Internet useable by ordinary
people by mapping human-readable names such as www.nsf.gov to Internet addresses
such as 128.150.4.107. Originally a simple lookup mechanism in a low-risk
environment, today naming has additional roles in the network ranging from
content delivery to anti-spam systems. DNS spans many applications because is
flexible, universally deployed, and has robust infrastructure capable of
supporting high traffic loads. But DNS today faces many challenges: needs for
improved security and privacy, richer functionality; increasing dynamic content;
orders-of-magnitude more names (at the top with DNS expansion and
internationalization, and the edges with the Internet of Things). Most
critically, DNS is increasingly difficult to evolve, both due to the installed
base of critical infrastructure, and because of increasing distance between the
research community and the data and infrastructure needed to make credible
contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one year planning project will identify
and provide conceptual designs for infrastructure that will counteract this
ossification and catalyze research in Internet naming, identification, and
trust. The project will bring together researchers on naming, around shared
infrastructure that supports: (1) Parallel Resolution Evaluation with
simultaneous and safe testing of experiments in the context of live, operational
DNS, and (2) Instrumentation And Measurement that helps share real-world DNS
query and performance data, employing both technical and legal methods for
ethical sharing. Community input will be obtained via focus groups and
workshops. The outcomes will be clear statement of the community's
infrastructure needs in this area, community-vetted designs for the
infrastructure, and assessment of the risks and costs associated with the
infrastructure
