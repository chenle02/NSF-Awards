This project develops adaptive human multi-robot systems that can flexibly
respond to changes in situation and task needs. It develops methods for real-
time monitoring and analysis of the cognitive and emotional state of operators,
enabling human operators to adapt to robot system changes and robots to adapt to
human cognitive and emotional states. By developing adaptive systems to improve
the performance of human-robot teams, the project advances our understanding of
human multi-robot interactions. The new technologies provided will improve
function of human multi-robot teams deployed (for example) in environmental
monitoring, nuclear cleanup, disaster response, and defense. The project
advances STEM education and workforce development by involving K-12 students,
undergraduate and graduate women, minorities, and underrepresented groups in
human-robot interaction and multi-robot systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project develops novel concepts and tools for 1) designing mission-specific
human multi-robot teams; 2) estimating operator cognitive and emotional state
from physiological and behavioral signals; and 3) enabling adaptive control of
autonomy, tasks, and resource assignment. This approach will enhance the fields
of multi-robot systems and human-robot interactions and improve performance and
versatility of human-robot teams. The project will increase our understanding of
how multiple robots can more effectively interact with multiple humans and vice
versa, and advance the scale and capability of human multi-robot
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
