Extraterrestrial construction presents many interesting and new challenges.
Unlike Earth, on the moon, Mars and asteroids there are very limited resources,
other than soil, out of which the shelters, roads and landing pads needed for
exploration can be built. As a possible candidate, a new material composed
primarily of soil held together by a solution of water and proteins called
Protein-bound Soils was recently developed. This material has strength similar
to unreinforced concrete. However, the material?s behavior after it has been
damaged has yet to be explored. This information is critical to designing a
durable material that can resist extreme environments. In this project, a
collaboration between damage modeling experts at Hokkaido University in Japan
and protein-bound soil experts at Stanford University hopes to explore for the
first time the material's damage states and computationally model its response.

To date, experimental tests of mechanical properties have shown significant
variability among Protein-bound Soil samples. This variability drives the
creation of computational micromechanical models to gain a better understanding
of the underlying mechanics that provide strength. Currently the focus is on the
micromechanical properties, with emphasis on modeling periodic unit cells that
capture the interactions between the particles and the protein bridges that bind
them. Moving forward, mesoscale modeling is needed to understand how the
material responds to damage and how its performance is affected by fatigue and
environmental attacks. To achieve this, the PI and Prof. Tamon Ueda of Hokkaido
University, an expert in mesoscale damage in concrete, will explore how current
mesoscale damage modeling can be applied to Protein-Bound Soils. This project
would represent the first venture into mesoscale modeling of this new material
and promises a framework to computationally model damage in similar earthen
materials.
