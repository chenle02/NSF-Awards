In this project, the Principal Investigator will study the 3- way interaction
of tidally induced, buoyancy-driven and wind- forced currents in a coupled
estuary-shelf environment, using a 3-dimensional Primitive Equation model with a
rigid lid boundary condition. Removing the lid allows the addition of tidal
motions which are likely to strongly affect the motions in the flow regime of
interest. Results will be compared with measurements made in the plume emanating
from the Chesapeake Bay onto the continental shelf. This study will contribute
to the coordinated study of plumes emanating onto the continental called MECCAS
(Microbial Exchange and Coupling in Coastal Atlantic Systems).
