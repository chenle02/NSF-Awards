This award provides funds for the support of two undergraduates working with
the principal investigator on mathematical problems arising in the modeling of
transport of medical drugs within brain tissue. The models will be designed to
explain the types of transport (convection, diffusion or absorption) by which a
drug may spread from an injection site into the brain. Students will concentrate
on developing the appropriate mathematical analysis necessary to formulate the
model through their studies of systems of nonlinear equations, regularity of
solutions of the heat equation and the application of multivariate analysis to
regression. Work will also be done on the design of experimental computational
schemes for testing various models Although the students will use data derived
from live experiments, their work consists solely of mathematical modeling and
mathematical analysis.
