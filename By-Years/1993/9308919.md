Shynk This research is developing nonlinear adaptive algorithms for the
detection of cochannel signals transmitted over time- varying channels. These
algorithms directly estimate both channels, and the results are used to perform
joint sequence estimation or joint symbol detection. At least two performance
criteria are being considered, including maximum likelihood sequence estimation
and maximum a posteriori symbol detection. The focus will be on applications
where the channels are rapidly time-varying and the data are transmitted in
short bursts. Dual- mode adaptive algorithms that combine fast training with
blind equalization/tracking for cochannel signal detection are also being
developed. These algorithms will be designed to have a superior symbol error
rate performance compared to conventional interference cancellation techniques.
