The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting Prof. B.Whaley
at the University of California, Berkeley. The research, to be carried out over
the next three years will be a a continuation of ongoing theoretical studies of
foreign species in quantum clusters of helium and hydrogen. This research
program has a two-fold design. First, to establish general methods of dealing
with structure, dynamics and spectroscopy of complex quantum systems when
nuclear delocalization and exchange effects are important. The approach is based
on Quantum Monte Carlo methods, both zero and finite temperature, which have
been shown to be powerful tools for analyzing the properties of quantum
clusters. A significant algorithmic development here is the calculation of
imaginary time correlation functions, which allows the calculation of dopant
spectra directly. The second goal is to answer some open questions about the
interaction of probe molecules with their quantum environment which have been
raised by recent experiments on doped quantum clusters. Thus in the applications
during this grant cycle, Prof Whaley will focus on the study of the spectroscopy
of these clusters. This includes infra-red spectra of dopant molecules,
electronic spectra and the nature of electronic energy transfer in pure and
atomic-doped quantumclusters. Quantum clusters of helium and hydrogen possess
unusual low temperature behavior which is of interest to both chemistry and
physics communities. While conceptually of importance because of the unique
opportunity they present for study of finite size effects in strongly quantum
systems, theyalso have significant practical use as gentle quantum matrices
which may be utilized to study spectroscopy of weakly bound systems and chemical
reactions at low temperatures. The utility of this quantum micro-environment has
recently been dramatically demonstrated with the production of small metal
clusters inside a helium droplet. This opens a new controlled route to study of
the reactivity of metal particles. The aim of this theoretical and computational
investigation is to develop the understanding necessary to interpret spectral
signatures of such doped quantum clusters, and to provide predictive power for
using them to control elementary reaction dynamics in a novel ultra-cold
nanoscale quantum matrix.
