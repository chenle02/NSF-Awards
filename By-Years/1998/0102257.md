0102257&lt;br/&gt;Iskander&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests NSF funding of
the first Wireless Grants Review Workshop to be held on February 20-21, 2001 at
the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
main objective of this workshop is to help establish closer ties among the
wireless communications researchers at NSF and to facilitate a forum for
exchanging ideas, discussing progress, minimizing duplication, and ultimately
helping build and maintain a stronger research program in this area at NSF. The
workshop is also expected to help NSF learn of outcomes from ongoing research
projects, highlight and display significant progress to communities at large,
and also identify and focus future funding on promising technologies in this
fast-growing area of research.&lt;br/&gt;***
