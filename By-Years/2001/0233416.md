EDC, SRI International, and Policy Studies Associates propose a research and
technical assistance design study to create conceptual and practical tools that
will help improve implementation evaluation in selected MSPs. The design focuses
identifying empirical descriptors of two critical elements in large-scale change
(1) teachers' instructional practice, and (2) effectiveness of coaching/teacher
leader strategies aimed at changing teacher practice and/or principals'
instructional leadership strategies aimed at deepening instructional
improvement.
