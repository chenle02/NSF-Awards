All cells are known to transiently increase the expression of a group of
proteins--the heat shock or stress proteins--in response to a variety of imposed
stresses. These proteins, known to be present at reduced, but significant,
levels in non-stressed cells are of, largely, unknown function, although the
hsp70 family have been implicated recently as essential for protein maturation
events. The work planned will focus on putative interactions of hsps70, both in
vivo and in vivo, focusing on the role of ATP in binding/release of targets, and
in the fate of targeted proteins; evaluation of amounts and types of pre-
existing proteins that may interact with hsp70, as a function of stress, and the
relationship to thermotolerance will be studied. Such studies should lead to a
fuller comprehension of the functions of hsps in normal cell events, and in
those that accompany stress responses. The cellular responses to a variety of
stresses--heat, heavy metal contamination, pressure, etc.--involve an increased
level of synthesis of certain proteins designated heat-shock-proteins; the
interactions of these proteins with other cell proteins will be examined as part
of an effort to understand the precise role these heat shock proteins play in
normal, as well as stressed, cells. //
