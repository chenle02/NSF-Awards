This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas Christian
University provides eight undergraduate students the opportunity to participate
in nine weeks of research on topics in atomic, molecular, biological, and
chemical physics, as well as astronomy and planetary science. The main goal of
the program is to provide a memorable and potentially career-defining experience
for student participants, who may not have a clear direction of career path upon
entering the program. Thoughtfully-selected field trips, weekly discussions with
other students and faculty, and workshops on career-planning are vital
components of the REU program, providing opportunities for students to consider
a broad range of career possibilities and professions in physics and
engineering-related fields extending beyond the focused summer research project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to participating in research with an
experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure
not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging
collegial and scholarly experience. The summer experience culminates with a
final oral research presentation given by participants to TCU undergraduate and
graduate students and faculty. This award is supported by the Division of
Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences within NSF's Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
