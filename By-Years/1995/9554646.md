Starting in each of June of 1996 and 1997, this Undergraduate Faculty
Enhancement project will bring 32 faculty members from other schools to Mount
Holyoke College for a one week workshop and to a two day follow-up meeting
preceding the joint mathematical meetings 18 months later. The project will
disseminate materials and methods from the course, Laboratory in Mathematical
Experimentation, which was developed at Mount Holyoke with NSF support.
Exploration of the course materials will introduce participants to the
interactive, conversational mode of mathematics teaching that the course
requires. Participants will also explore the opportunities the laboratory course
affords for dramatically restructuring the undergraduate mathematics major in
ways that enhance student understandine. The June workshops will have five
elements. First, participants will model the learning experience of students in
the Lab by actually carrying out computer experimentation. Second, the workshop
instructors will model the role of the teacher as coach. Third, by looking at
student papers, participants will both address issues of teaching and evaluating
writing and also have a means of examining some of the ways students' thinking
develops. Fourth, participants will have an opportunity to talk with students
who have taken the Lab. Finally, participants will discuss their observations
and experiences and compare them among themselves. These elements will allow
participants not only to deepen their understanding of the mathematical and
pedagogical issues but also to begin to imagine themselves teaching in new ways.
The January follow-up workshop will be devoted to implementation issues,
evaluation, and a study of strategies for opening the mathematics curriculum.
