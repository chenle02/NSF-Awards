Electronic networks, ranging from local to national in scope, have been
developed for a variety of purposes. Persons involved in science and mathematics
education at the K-12 level have increasingly been identifying ways in which
such networking could be useful, and experimenting with the creation of such
networks. It now seems appropriate to draw on the experience of both educators
and electronics experts to define optimum characteristics of such networking
activities and systems, including the hardware, software, databases, and
interconnects. These guidelines should be useful to educators in facilitiating
the efficient establishment of new networks and to funding agencies in deciding
how best to allocate funds for networks. A small working conference of persons
experienced in the electronics of networking and in the educational applications
of networking will draft guidelines for the design and operation of networks for
the K-12 science and mathematics education community. These will subsequently be
refined and compiled into a report which can be broadly distributed. The
objective will be to provide practical guidance to anyone interested in linking
K-12 schools and teachers electronically in the most effective and economical
way.
