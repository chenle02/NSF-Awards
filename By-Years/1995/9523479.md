9523479 Mundt and Vallis Numerical and laboratory simulations of baroclinic
flows have revealed that moderately supercritical baroclinic systems can exhibit
a wide range of behavior (e.g., steady, periodic, chaotic). Moreover, aperiodic,
temporally-irregular solutions can exist even when the flow is only marginally
unstable, that is, at small values of supercriticality. Most previous dynamics
studies have been directed to studying this parameter range which corresponds to
lower driving than is geophysically realistic. Studies in more realistic
parameter ranges are usually conducted with more complex models and have
provided more empirical results, often relying on statistical descriptions,
rather than a more thorough understanding of the dynamics. Thus, little is known
about the transition from chaos to turbulence in the supercriticality range
characteristic of atmospheric flows. The principal investigators will carry out
a study focused on the complexity (disorder) of flows with increasing
supercriticality, guided by their hypothesis that the level of mean flow
supercriticality is directly related to the disorder of the eddy flow. They will
explore the extent to which behavior observed at low supercriticality is also
observed at more geophysically realistic ranges of supercriticality. Models of
varying complexity will be employed, although the initial effort will focus on a
two layer, quasi-geostrophic model. A variety of analysis tools, from empirical
orthogonal function analysis to wavelet analysis, will be employed. The
importance of this study lies in the potential for better understanding of the
variability of the atmosphere, and has important implications a wide range of
weather and climate issues, including weather regime transitions and
parameterization of meridional heat flux in climate models. ***
