9318653 Davis This is the American portion of an international project to
administer identical surveys in a number of nations, focusing on attitudes
toward environmentalism and on women, work and the family. The International
Social Survey Project (ISSP) will be carried out in the United States and twenty
other countries: Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic,
Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, and Sweden. In
each nation, questionnaire interviews will be administered to scientifically
drawn samples of the population, employing items selected by an international
committee of experts. The module on women, work and the family will chart
changing gender roles, challenges facing the family, the correlates of declining
birth rates, and changes in women's labor force participation. The environment
module measures attitudes and behaviors related to preservation of the ecology.
%%% The data collected in the United States by these two survey modules will be
enhanced by the fact that they will be connected to the General Social Survey
(GSS), a major data base project supported by the National Science Foundation.
In the past, more than two thousand five hundred scientific reports have been
based on the GSS, and many researchers in several fields will use the ISSP data.
Not only will the United States benefit from the scientific findings of the ISSP
concerning significant policy issues, but the ISSP will enhance scientific
cooperation with twenty other nations. ***
