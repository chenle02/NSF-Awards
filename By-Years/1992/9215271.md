This project addresses the weight least absolute value (WLAV) state estimator
for power system applications. This estimator is more robust than the weighted
least squared (WLS) state estimator used at present by most utilities. The WLAV
estimator involves solving an L1 norm problem which is usually formulated as a
linear programming (LP) problem resulting in relatively large computational
times. This work is investigating the use of interior point methods for WLAV
state estimation. This involves three research questions. First, there is the
question of finding a suitable interior point method. Second, there are
numerical considerations and sparsity aspects particular to this problem .
Finally, there are practical considerations such as the handling of virtual and
psuedo measurements by means of equality and constraints. The research will be
performed using a sparse matrix environment known as the Sparse Matrix
Manipulation System.
