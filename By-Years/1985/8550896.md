This research project will explore a number of factors concerning the children's
television series "3-2-1 Contact" including: (1) awareness of the series on the
part of children, parents, and teachers; (2) perceptions of appeal and
comprehensibility of the program format among both viewers and non-viewers; (3)
the demographics and viewing habits of viewers and teacher users; (4) reasons
for particular modes of viewing and use; and (5) impacts that result from
viewing. A major goal of this exploratory study is to identify factors that
require more detailed, controlled research before their influence can be fully
understood and that offer promise of productive research because their influence
is clearly significant. The study will focus on 100 children in the 8-12 year
age range (the target audience), 100 viewers in the 4-7 year age, 100 parents of
viewers, and 150 teachers of grades 3-6. Two-hour group sessions will provide
study subjects with opportunities to respond to questions on series awareness,
modes of viewing and using the series, and series impact. Subjects will complete
written questionnaires, view selected program segments from the series, and then
participate in oral interviews. The expected outcomes of the study are: (1) a
description of the viewing audience; (2) an understanding of patterns of series
viewing at home and use in the schools; (3) the role of parents and teachers in
stimulating children to view the series; (4) a picture of audience response to
program formats and performers; and (5) a measure of program comprehensibility
among different types of viewers. The final outcome will be a comprehensive
research model for additional study of "3-2-1 Contact" as a vehicle for science
education.
