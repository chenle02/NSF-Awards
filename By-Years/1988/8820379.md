One of the most exciting issues confronting contemporary neuroscientists
concerns the identification and elucidation of brain mechanisms underlying
learning and memory. For example, recent studies of classical (Pavlovian)
conditioning have indicated that different brain regions mediate the development
of different kinds of conditioned responses. For example, autonomic (heart rate)
and somatomotor (eyeblink, leg flexion) conditioning are all mediated through
very different brain structures. Dr. Gibbs is employing an unique appetitive
conditioning procedure, which will complement more than three decades of
aversive conditioning studies. He is examining whether similar brain mechanisms
mediate the development of somatomotor and/or autonomic conditioning where the
unconditional stimulus is pleasurable -- the intraoral delivery of a small
amount of water. Specifically, Dr. Gibbs will use this established conditioning
procedure to determine (a) whether the cerebellum (a structure that is
essentially concerned with coordinated movements and which appears to be
essential for aversive somatomotor learning) is involved in the development of
an appetitive, swallowing response, and (b) whether other brain structures
(primarily in the forebrain) also participate in the development of this learned
response.
