Propose to establish an optical facility which allows the detailed
investigations of the optical properties of solids in the S...15,000cm-1
spectral range. The facility is a combination of a home-designed spectrometer
which spans in the low energy end of the spectrum, and a commercial instrument
spanning the high energy part of the spectrum. All instruments will be operating
in the 1.5..300K temperature range. The broad spectral range, in combination
with the millimeter wave facility established earlier at UCLA will allow the
unambiguous determination of the real and imaginary part of the optical
conductivity. The facility will be used to study a broad variety of problems,
including the investigation of the dynamics of collective modes, highly
correlated metals, and disordered, highly anisotropic conductors. The equipment
will also be used as characterization tools for a broad range of condensed
matter problems.
