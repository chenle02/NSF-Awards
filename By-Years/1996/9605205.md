INT 9605205 Pollock John A. Pollock: "Planning Visit: Analysis of Normal and
Genetically Mutant Visual system Development using Multi Dimensional Time Lapse
Microscopy" This award supports a planning visit of Dr. John A. Pollock of the
Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University to Dr. Philip
Batterham of the Department of Genetics, University of Melbourne, Australia.
They will establish a collaboration focused on the molecular genetics and
developmental neurobiology of the developing visual system in the fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster. This international project is an interdisciplinary
study that capitalizes on particular strengths of the two counterparts whose
research utilizes genetics, molecular biology, microscopic imaging and computer
science. The two week planning visit will permit the U.S. counterpart to consult
with the Australian partner, as needed to create the specific experimental
design and time table for the internationalization of the project. Partner
exchange both from the United States and to the United States will broaden the
impact of the NSF supported biological research ongoing in the Center for Light
Microscope Imaging and Biotechnology at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.
