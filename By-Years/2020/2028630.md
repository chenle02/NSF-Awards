The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of high-performance, cost-effective, and safe lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) based on components optimized with a novel computational platform that
can minimize the discovery and design-cycle time scales. The new simulation and
design technologies have a direct impact on segments including developers in LIB
companies and electric vehicle companies, and university/laboratory researchers.
This technology can accelerate adoption of electric vehicles, which can reduce
emissions and achieve better fuel economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project is based on the development of geometrically accurate numerical models
of particles, binders, and conductivity enhancers in LIB electrodes. Finding
optimal LIB electrode architectures and corresponding LIB configurations that
maximize energy and power densities, rate capability, and safety during
operation presents significant challenges. This project proposes use of Bayesian
Machine Learning (BML) algorithms. The proposed BML-driven design algorithms
incorporate statistical microstructure characterization and reconstruction
methods to support the LIB electrode design, multitask Gaussian Processes (GPs)
to integrate experimental data with multi-fidelity and multiscale simulations,
and a multi-objective acquisition function to achieve the LIB multi-objective
design. The use of a Bayesian optimization approach allows the systematic
exploration of the design space. The result is an LIB electrode architecture
optimizing the trade space of performance, cost, and
safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
