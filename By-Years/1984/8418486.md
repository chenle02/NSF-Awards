A theoretical model is being developed describing the effects of upstream and
downstream pressure on selectivity and rate of permeation and pervaporation of
multicomponent liquid mixtures through polymer membranes. The experimental
results from two component systems are in agreement with the model predictions,
and confirm the expected influence of downstream pressure in pervaporation-type
experiments. Investigations are continuing on the selective permeation of
water/ethanol in cellulose acetate membranes, including those very lean in
ethanol; interpenetrating-type polymer composite membranes; the two-phase
permeate region; permeant pairs with very large solubility and/or diffusivity
characteristics in the membrane; and the effects of temperature.
