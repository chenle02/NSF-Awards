The College of Marine Studies at the University of Delaware will acquire several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared-use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a research vessel owned and operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -an optical disk drive for
the shipboard computer, -profiling fluorometer for use in several environmental
studies, and -an acoustic command unit for remotely activating instrumentation
on the seafloor. The instrumentation described above will increase the
capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering
projects.
