This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
photocatalysis between David F. Ollis of the University of North Carolina and
Pierre Pichat of the Ecole Centrale de Lyon in France. The award provides travel
support to Dr. Ollis and his students. The objective of the research is to
improve the photocatalytic treatment of contaminated air at ambient pressure.
The investigators propose two approaches. The first is to cause chain reactions
induced by chlorine radicals. The second approach has the objective of
increasing the efficiency of contaminant capture and its removal from air with
the assistance of a solid adsorbent. The project takes advantage of French
expertise in mechanistic and analytical chemical techniques and may result in
improvements to photocatalytic oxidation.
