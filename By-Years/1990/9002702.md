Dr. Low will attempt to map out the portion of the cholinergic receptor
molecule which binds to a toxin. The technique involves forming covalent bonds
between the toxin and identified peptide sequences of the receptors, using a
photoreactive group inserted in the peptides. This approach is new and if
successful, can be used to probe the properties of other receptor molecules.
