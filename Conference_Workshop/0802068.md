Abstract McCarthy

This proposal is to partially support a conference on "Function Spaces and their
Operators" to be held at Washington University in St. Louis in May 2008. The
conference will run for three days. Particular attention will be given to
supporting women, young mathematicians, and members of under-represented groups.
The primary use of the NSF funds will be for this purpose.

The study of function spaces and their operators has advanced rapidly in recent
years, and is still undergoing development. It is important to take this
opportunity to expose young researchers to recent developments, to assess these
developments, and to plan for future work.

The impact of the conference will be broad and lasting. One of the goals is to
integrate young mathematicians and mathematicians from underrepresented groups
into the working infrastructure of the profession. Putting them into contact
with mature and experienced scholars, and exposing them to current research
problems, will help to boost their careers, and give them something of permanent
value to take away from the conference.
