The objective of this research is the development of new methods for the
controlled synthesis of macromolecules. Specifically, attempts will be made to
develop solid-state polymerization processes to yield polymers that cannot be
synthesized by other methods. The work falls into four main topics. (1)
Unsaturated organic monomer molecules will be clathrated in the molecular level
tunnel systems formed by certain crystalline solids. The monomers will then be
polymerized in the tunnels by exposure to high energy irradiation or by chemical
initiation. Stereospecific polymerizations are expected in some cases. (2)
Attempts will be made to prepare one-dimensional metallo-backbone polymers by
the use of the same tunnel clathration technique. (3) Cyclic phosphazenes which
crystallize in appropriate crystal packing arrangements will be polymerized by
gamma-irradiation methods. It is expected that this route will generate polymers
not accessible by the conventional thermal melt polymerization route. (4) Other
cyclic inorganic systems that crystallize in suitable space groups will also be
studied by gamma-irradiation methods. These systems include heteroelement
phosphazenes, boron-nitrogen-, sulfur- nitrogen-, and other heterocyclic rings.
Most of the systems to be studied have proved to be resistant to conventional
thermal ring- opening polymerization methods. The polymers prepared in this work
should have new macromolecular structures and new combinations of properties
that are potentially useful in electronic, optical, magnetic, and other
applications.
