This research will examine coastal marsh sequences in the Pacific Northwest for
evidence of seismic activity. Sediment coring and age dating of peats in the
section will be the major analysis method. The sediment record needs a realistic
evaluation of seismic versus non-seismic causal events. Temporal distributions
of late Holocene paleoseismicity and coastal deformation are a major objective
of this study in order to bear on the debatable but important question of
whether there are past major earthquakes recorded in the late Holocene coastal
marsh sequences. This research bears directly on the question of the possibility
of a major subduction-type earthquake along the Pacific Northwest coastal
region, and therefore is an important contribution to the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
