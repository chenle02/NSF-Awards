This research project explores the performance of different package auction
designs in different environments. Past research shows that package auction
mechanisms can be effective in settings where market clearing prices do not
exist and standard auctions are expected to perform poorly. This project extends
the PI's research with his collaborator Paul Milgrom of Stanford University in
several directions by conducting laboratory experiments combined with simulation
methods to test the game theoretic models. The team explores whether different
bidding languages lead to different and better results. They measure the impact
of constraints, like budget constraints, that are faced by institutional
bidders.

This project has broader impact because the results will help auction designers
to identify the pros and cons of different auction formats in different
environments. Individuals, firms, or governments who seek to use auctions will
have more comprhensive knowledge when choosing the specific methods used to
conduct their auctions.
