9305115 Ammar A significant obstacle to achieving heterogeneous system
interconnection is the need to maintain compatible network protocols on all
communication systems. Protocol standardization and profiling has long been
viewed as a way to overcome this obstacle. The exclusive nature of this
approach, however, presents certain limitations. Among them are exclusion of
sometimes superior technology and the necessity for strict agreement among
systems. This research will consider an inclusive approach for achieving inter-
operability based on the use of multi-protocol architectures, that is systems
with a mixture of protocols from different standards families. Inter-operability
in these architectures is achieved by 1) providing sufficient overlap in the
protocols that systems implement and 2) equipment systems with the mechanisms
that can be used to determine this overlap. The work will have two major
components: a model building activity which will help focus the work and help in
identifying problems and solutions and a parallel implementation activity based
on a case study of Internet and OSI protocol suites. ***
