An adequate level of safety and reliability for embedded systems can be
guaranteed only through the use of computer aided design and analysis tools in
the development process. This research investigates several key questions whose
solution is expected to increase the scope and decrease the cost of symbolic
analysis techniques for embedded systems. Simultaneously, the project is
implementing the new algorithms and strategies for the automatic analysis of
embedded systems within the prototype tool HyTech that is being developed at
Cornell. Embedded systems are modeled as Hybrid Automata, which combine discrete
system transitions and continuous environment activities. Symbolic model
checking and abstract interpretation are used to automatically compute the
conditions under which a hybrid automaton satisfies a temporal-logic
requirement. The method has been implemented in HyTech, which allows the
automatic analysis of hybrid automata with piecewise-linear behavior. The
purpose of this work is, first, to improve the applicability and the efficiency
of HyTech and, second, to investigate--through theory, implementation, and case
studies--how far standard program-analysis methods can be generalized to permit
the direct analysis of continuous-time systems.
