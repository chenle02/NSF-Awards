The proposed work would orient small, single crystalline grains of high
temperature superconductor (HTSC) powders by exploiting both the magnetic and
shape anisotropies, in order to create a bulk sintered 'granular single crystal'
with complete crystalline alignment. The potential of this approach for
producing high critical current polycrystalline pellets will be explored by
studying the effects of annealing, residual misalignment, and surface treatment
on the transport properties of these materials. Alternative approaches for
maintaining oxygen stoichiometry in the densified materials will be explored.
Detailed pole figure analyses and microscopic grain boundary studies will be
undertaken together with various forms of pinning mechanisms.
