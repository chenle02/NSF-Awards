The 27th NSF EPSCoR National Conference supports the work and mission of NSF
EPSCoR. The goals of NSF EPSCoR are to increase research capacity, strengthen
STEM education, and advance science and engineering in jurisdictions that have
historically received limited funding from NSF. Under the overarching theme of
“Translating Stakeholder Needs into Impactful Research Outcomes,” the event will
focus on and demonstrate NSF EPSCoR's unique ability to engage stakeholders
through broadening impacts, community science projects, educational
opportunities, and partnerships. Each jurisdiction will be asked to present on
their programs that can be used as national models for creating strategic
stakeholder engagement, leading to improved scientific research impacts and
educational outcomes. In addition, the conference will serve as a platform for
attendees to learn more about NSF EPSCoR and funding opportunities with a
special emphasis on Track-2 and 4 proposals. Other strands will include
broadening participation in STEM, economic development, convergence science,
“pandemic” best practices, and professional development for students. There will
be a poster session for students, and a community science showcase for all
participants. This conference will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness
of the program, and also to help improve future
events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
