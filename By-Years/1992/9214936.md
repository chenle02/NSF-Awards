The objective of this dissertation improvement application is to analyze and
compare two areas of the primate prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral area 10 and
orbitofrontal area 13) in a series from all extant hominoid species and two
species of monkey brains, with recently developed computerized imaging
techniques and advanced statistical sampling methods, along with new staining
methods. These techniques should provide accurate and reproduceable information
on the architectonics of these parts of the primate brain, including the numbers
of neurons in these cortical areas, volume, and vertical structuring. The
working hypothesis is that area 10, associated with many cognitive functions,
will show substantial distinctions, quantitatively and structurally, while area
13, associated with emotional states and responses to social environments, will
be more conservative. Reconstructions of earlier states will naturally follow if
the findings, especially for the more conservative areas, fall into the expected
relationships. The work requires travel and collection of additional brain
samples (a number are already collected, including some rare specimens), along
with subseqent analysis time. It is a most feasible and promising project.
