Information Science and Systems (33)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
implements an interdisciplinary data visualization course and laboratory for
upper-division engineering and science students. To support students' ability to
develop custom software applications and to facilitate discovery of features
present in large data sets, exemplary materials are adapted and integrated from
several sources. The project adapts modules from a Computational Science Across
the Curriculum (CSAC) program to create integrated visualization techniques for
engineering and science majors using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), and course
materials for graduate students and working professionals are modified for use
by undergraduates. Engineering and science students not only learn to understand
basic visualization techniques, but also to use a unified, software development
platform to create, modify, and test algorithms. Students also contribute to
building custom visualization applications that will be used by others including
high school teachers and students. The project also includes civic engagement by
having students work in interdisciplinary teams to implement, extend, and
maintain a repository of contextually-relevant, visualization applications to
support inquiry-based learning opportunities for high school students.
