This proposal is concerned with molecular orientation in the deformation and
flow of liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). Rheological equations of state will
be developed to describe LCP flow, and several solutions for simple geometries
will be obtained. Molecular structure during flow will be probed experimentally
by using dyes and particles for flow visualization in model flows in capillaries
and between parallel plates. Molecular structure during flow near boundaries
will be probed by an evanescent wave technique. The evanescent wave technique is
novel, and is particularly suitable to probing flow induced orientation effects
near boundaries.
