(Public Law 111-5).

This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project seeks to
develop functionalized nanocoatings on fibers that will improve the adhesion of
fibers to rubber. The better coupling of the fiber will enhance the rubber
performance. The better coupling of fiber in rubber will improve the stiffness,
toughness and durability of the rubber/fiber composite material.

Successful commercialization of this research can result in improved performance
and longevity for tires, tubing and other industrial applications.
