Amniocentesis is the technique which permits diagnostic analysis of fetal
chromosomes. As currently practiced, it involves four separate steps:
ultrasonographic imaging, amniotic tapping, cell culturing, and chromosomal
analysis. Thus, amniocentesis should be regarded not as a technology but as a
technological system. Like many 20th century technological systems, the first
phase of its development--the research phase--was heavily dependent upon
scientists and scientific advances. Professor Cowan is undertaking with this
grant a history of this research phase in the development of the technological
system known as amniocentesis. Each of the separate steps in the system of
amniocentesis was developed by specialists in quite different fields
(geneticists, engineers, cytologists, research physicians, clinicians) and
perfected under different historical constraints, different times, in different
countries. The "research phase" of the history of amniocentesis is thus
extremely complex and raises significant questions about effective science and
technology policies. Further, because amniocentesis is used as a diagnostic tool
which may lead to abortion, the process also entails not only the feasibility
but also the legality of abortions--a step that raises difficult ethical issues
as well as attendant questions about the ways in which ethical concerns
determine the direction of scientific and technological research. Under this
research grant, Professor Cowan will examine the specialized literature and
examine archives in genetics, engineering, cytology and medicine to trace the
development of the several components of this technological system.
