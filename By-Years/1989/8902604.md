This research will use Nd-YAG laser vaporization of solid FeS rods to generate
Fe/S clusters. Time-of-flight mass spectroscopy techniques will then be used to
detect mass distributions and intensities of ionized clusters, produced directly
from the pulsed nozzle source. Patterns favoring stable species, especially
those found in Fe/S proteins (Fe2S2,Fe4S4, etc.), will be noted. Mass selected
ion photofragmentation techniques will then be used to identify the primary
dissociation products and branching ratios of the Fe/S clusters. If time allows
these techniques will be extended to study the interactions of Fe/S clusters
with small cysteinyl like ligands. Interactive activities include teaching a
graduate level cluster chemistry course, and organizing and directing a
symposium on metal clusters involving outstanding women chemists in this area of
research. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide
opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the
disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue
careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women
scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
