The primary aim of this project is to help 60 high school mathematics teachers
integrate technology (graphing calculators and computer software) into the 8-12
curriculum- -while at the same time strengthening their content background and
enriching their pedagogical repertory. In the first year, 30 teachers will be
chosen (in pairs) from across the State of Connecticut, but urban areas with
concentrations of minority students will be especially targeted. The program
consists of two sequential four-week summer institutes in which the
participating teachers will study and explore applications of technology in the
classroom. As they do this, they will see that technology can not only help take
the drudgery out of mathematics, but can also make a wealth of interesting and
useful mathematics accessible to high school students. The applications of
technology will be studied in the context of modern mathematical content and
modern pedagogical techniques, e.g., cooperative learning groups. To help smooth
the implementation and dissemination process, administrators from the
participants' home schools or districts will be at least briefly involved in the
first summer program. In the second summer, groups of high school students will
be available for participants to pilot test new lessons and units as they are
developed. During the first academic year, project staff will provide support
for the teachers' visits, as well as two scheduled two-day workshops. During the
second academic year teachers will be expected to engage in significant staff
development work in their buildings and/or districts, including offering
extended workshops of 30-40 hours for their peers. The program described above
will be repeated for a second group of 30 teachers in years 3 and 4. Cost
sharing amounts to 68% of NSF funding.
