9614250 Beck This research ilvolves continued seismological study of the large-
scale structure of the central Andes with existing data from the recently
completed BANJO/SEDA passive seismic deployments using PASSCAL instrumentation.
The central Andes, in western Bolivia and northern Chile, are among the highest
and widest mountain belts in the world with elevations locally over 6000 m,
crustal thicknesses up to 75 km, and deformation extending inland nearly 1000
km. The research involves use of a combination of receiver function analysis and
regional waveform modeling from events in the down- going slab to determine a
three-dimensional "seismic snapshot" of an active orogenic belt. Comparison of
crustal columns of the un- deformed Chaco with the over-thickened Altiplano and
Cordilleras will be used to constrain the origin of the "anomalous" thickened
crust. It is expected that this "seismic snapshot" of an active, thick orogen
will form the foundation on which to test ideas and models of high-pressure
regional metamorphism and anatexis in over- thickened crust. ***
