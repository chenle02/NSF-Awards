With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professors Schwarz and Altman at Yale University are developing a
new approach for the visualization and characterization of single molecule
surface chemistry. This new approach is allowing the groups to control each step
of a reaction using the tip of a scanning probe microscope where the specific
and unique reaction pathway is chosen at will. Professors Schwarz and Altman are
using this technique to study the interactions responsible to drive the reaction
and to ultimately reveal the influence of nearby surface defects or other
molecules. The research outcomes are opening new venues to study surface
chemistry and catalysis. Professors Schwarz and Altman are using carbon-hydrogen
and carbon-carbon bond formation to illustrate the power of the technique. These
bond formation reactions are fundamentally importantly and could have great
impacts to the chemical and petrochemical industry. Professors Schwarz and
Altman are using their research outcomes to reach out to the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Schwarz and Altman are developing a
high-resolution tool to locally map energy landscape between an adsorbed
molecule and the surface underneath, with the aims of quantifying energy minima
for specific chemical bond formation or dissociation and subsequently
manipulating single molecule surface chemistry at will. Specifically, they are
(1) further developing their atomic force microscopy technique to quantify the
interaction between the tip and a sample, and map potential, forces, and
currents in three dimensions; (2) using the developed technique to study
adsorption of aromatic molecules and hydrogen, and manipulate their chemical
behaviors; and (3) testing the technique with local creation of benzyl radicals
and formation of associated products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
