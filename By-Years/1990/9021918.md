Laboratory experiments to simulate ice particles in cirrus and convective
clouds will investigate conditions for break up and separation of electric
charge. A system will be constructed to generate monodisperse ice crystals of
selected size and shape whose optical properties will be examined in a specially
designed and constructed optical system. Results will be compared with field
data already obtained during flights through hurricanes, maritime convective
cells off Florida, convective feeder clouds in North Dakota and new data to be
obtained on the NOAA P3 during CAPE (1991). This will include measurements of
electric field and microphysical evolution (ice particles, coalescence drops and
their electric charge) as convective clouds evolve overland in Florida. Results
will also be compared with radiation and other aircraft data obtained by higher
flying aircraft in cirrus as it becomes available. A simple numerical model of
heat evolution in convective clouds will be constructed applicable to assessing
the vertical heat budget of deep convective cloud systems involving both ice and
coalescence precipitation processes.
