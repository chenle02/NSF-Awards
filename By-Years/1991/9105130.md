This project will more fully document the major and trace element composition of
magmatic sulfides and the host rocks from the vent-facies intrusions and flows
of the Tintic Mountain Volcanic Group. In addition, those from the Fish Canyon
Tuff (and associated volcanic units), Bishop Tuff, and Central Nevada Caldera
Complex (tuff of Williams Ridge and Morey Peak) will be analyzed for comparison
purposes. By combing these data on sulfide compositions with intensive
parameters and magmatic evolution for each volcanic system, it should be
possible to model the origin and variations in modal abundance of magmatic
sulfides. The stability and degassing/exsolution characteristics of these
sulfides will also be examined. These data should help develop a general model
about the role of magmatic sulfides in setting the metal ratios of various
hydrothermal ore fluids.
