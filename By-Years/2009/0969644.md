The PI's Tensor Triangular Geometry is an umbrella program covering the
geometric study of tensor triangulated categories in algebraic geometry, modular
representation theory, stable homotopy theory, motivic theory, noncommutative
topology, and beyond. Be they modules, spaces, motives or C*-algebras, objects
are usually too wild to be classified up to isomorphism. However, one can always
classify classes of objects stable under the basic constructions which are:
suspension, cone and tensor product (such classes are known as thick tensor-
ideals). This classification is made by means of subsets of a certain
topological space, constructed by the PI and called the triangular spectrum.
This space has been computed in stable homotopy theory, algebraic geometry and
modular representation theory, using the work of Hopkins-Smith, Neeman-Thomason,
Benson-Carlson-Rickard and Friedlander-Pevtsova. Computing the triangular
spectrum in noncommutative topology (equivariant KK-theory) or in motivic
examples is a major ongoing project where progress has recently been made. The
broader ambition of tensor triangular geometry is that of building brides across
some parts of mathematics as follows: Identify the concepts, results and
techniques from any area covered by tensor triangular geometry which can be
abstracted and consequently applied to all other areas under the umbrella.
Recent activity has exhibited numerous such phenomenons, in the PI's work and
beyond, like filtration by dimension of supports, gluing techniques, Picard
groups, Witt groups, and more.

Tensor triangular geometry is a relatively new theory which can simultaneously
claim a large catalog of examples ranging from Algebra to Analysis, a strong
corpus of abstract techniques and a broad range of applications. The strength of
tensor triangular geometry is illustrated by several new theorems in algebraic
geometry and modular representation theory, whose statement does not involve
tensor triangular geometry but whose proof does. This project is highly
interdisciplinary and appeals to mathematicians from very different horizons.
