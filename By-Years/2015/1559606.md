This project supports a conference entitled ''Extremal Combinatorics at Illinois
III'' (EXCILL III), to be hosted at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago,
from August 8th to 10th, 2016. This is third in a series of highly successful
EXCILL conferences that have each time attracted over 100 participants from
around the world. This conference will stimulate the development of the field,
will enhance interdisciplinary interactions with areas of Computer Science, and
will help many graduate students and recent Ph.D.s improve and enhance their
research. The proposed scientific activities include invited addresses by
leading experts in the field from all over the world, a poster session for young
researchers, and open time for discussions between participants. These
activities in addition to enhancing the advancement of knowledge within the
field, will also foster international collaborations between U.S.-based
participants and their international counterparts. The conference activities
will be disseminated at the website:

Combinatorics is the study of existence, enumeration, and optimization of
discrete configurations. Driven by applications in computer science, coding
theory, operations research, biology, and other natural and social sciences,
combinatorics has evolved in recent decades into a branch of mathematics
employing powerful and sophisticated tools with roots in other branches of
mathematics such as analysis, algebra, probability, number theory, geometry, and
topology. The applications of discrete structures in computer science,
engineering, and the natural and social sciences have naturally given rise to
many fundamental combinatorial problems whose study has spurred the development
of interdisciplinary collaborations across all mathematical sciences, both
theoretical and applied. This conference will help bring together these ideas,
tools, and problems from across mathematical sciences, building connections
across fields.
