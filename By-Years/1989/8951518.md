A model undergraduate laboratory course is developed to teach the principles of
air quality. The interdisciplinary course will integrate fundamental concepts
with numerical simulations and experimental measurements. Students in the course
will be provided with rigorous classroom instruction, participate in the design
and operation of experiments, and develop an appreciation for the comparison of
modeled and experimental results. The sizes, properties, and removal mechanisms
of particles suspended in the atmosphere will be investigated with aerosol
particle sizing, filter sampling, and aerosol generation systems. Gaseous
pollutants will be measured by gas monitors. Students will explore the link
between pollutant concentrations and meteorology by coupling pollutant data with
measurements from meteorological instruments. A computer workstation will be
used to collect, store, analyze, and graph data. The computer will also be used
for numerical simulation and graphical illustrations of pollutant emission,
dispersion, transformations, and transport. This state-of-the-art air quality
principles course will also be a model for interdisciplinary teaching.
Undergraduates participating in the course will receive a unique education in
air quality principles, numerical simulations, and laboratory techniques that
will provide them with the skills needed in graduate school and in their future
careers.
