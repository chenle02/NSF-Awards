Currents flowing in magnetic mediums are found in sunspots, in the dynamo
generating the Earth's magnetic field, as well as in the laboratory plasmas used
in a variety of controlled experiments. Recently, researchers participating in
this project have determined that magnetic helicity (which is a topological
concept) could quantify the twistedness or knottedness of magnetic fields and
unify a number of observations. The research is an experimental investigation of
this concept using experimental equipment to carry on laboratory plasma
experiments.
