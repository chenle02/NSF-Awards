9452248 Stolzberg The Department of Chemistry is developing multiple approaches
to strengthen the connection between the laboratory and lecture portions of
Introductory General Chemistry. A major focus of the plan is the proposed series
of four atomic absorption spectrometry experiments. After each experiment is
done, and students have examined data from other groups and interpreted their
results, they propose that a full lecture period be allocated for students to
make presentations of their interpretation of the experimental data. Faculty
will summarize student findings and put them into a practical perspective. The
experiments are designed so that the students will practice the component parts
of scientific investigation. They will use well-designed experiments to make
comparisons of averages or trends, test hypotheses using inductive reasoning,
and examine and interpret relatively large data sets reduced to graphical form.
In addition, they will do short, out-of lab writing exercises which will be
evaluated by their peers. They intend to make students comfortable with the idea
of, and enchanted with the ability of, the component methodologies of good
laboratory science.
