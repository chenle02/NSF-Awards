Research is directed towards crystal solidification and sintering research that
impacts both metallic and ceramic alloy systems. A study of liquid phase
infiltration techniques, applicable to advanced materials processing, is part of
this effort. Sintering of powder compacts using finite element analysis focusses
on sintering kinetics, grain growth during densification, and macroscopic
stresses that arise during sintering and high temperature processing. Studies of
crystal growth include modeling of radiative heat transfer in the growth of
semitransparent crystals and surface structure formation.
