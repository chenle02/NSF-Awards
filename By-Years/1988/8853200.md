Expand current undergraduate laboratory in the Department of Materials Science
and Engineering so as to include facilities and experiments in processing and
characterization of thin films. The expanded laboratory will serve the
undergraduate Materials Science degree as well as the newly established dual
major B.S. program in Materials Science and Electrical Engineering. This is the
model for the College of Engineering's policy to develop several cross
disciplinary programs.
