This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the
development of a sensor that is based on nanoparticles that change color in the
presence of vapors from improvised terrorist explosives and the hydrogen
peroxide used to manufacture them. The sensor is important because it improves
public safety through a cost-effective way to detect peroxide-based explosives,
as well as hydrogen peroxide itself during transportation spills or other
accidental release events. The project will result in a prototype electronic
"area sensor" that has high sensitivity coupled with high selectivity for
peroxide based explosives using simple electronics and a color-changing sensor.
These features provide significantly enhanced performance and major cost-savings
when compared to the leading competing explosive sensing technologies in this
market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this project, the best methods for
preparing sensing films will be determined and the response of the sensing films
with hydrogen peroxide and the improvised explosive triacetone triperoxide
(TATP) will be explored. This will provide critical information for the design
of the technology that lies at the heart of the prototype sensor and is
important for the commercialization of the sensor. The research will also lead
to the completion of the design and fabrication of operational sensors using
off-the-shelf electronics to keep costs low. In addition, there will be an
assessment of potential interferents to ensure that these don't pose problems in
sensor commercialization. In addition, personnel involved in this project,
including undergraduate and graduates students, will receive entrepreneurship
and technology translation experiences through group meetings, workshops, and an
entrepreneurship program. The project engages XploSafe, LLC to provide test
environments and to guide the commercialization of this technology translation
effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.
