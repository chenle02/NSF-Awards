This award funds the research activities of Professor Zhongbo Kang at the
University of California, Los Angeles.

After nearly twenty years of planning and construction, the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) is now the highest-energy particle collider in the world. By
colliding elementary particles against each other at high energies, physicists
expect to learn about the fundamental building blocks of matter and their
interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been
previously explored. Collimated jets of hadrons are a dominant feature of high-
energy particle interactions, and are copiously produced at the LHC. The
research of Professor Kang is focused on understanding the production of these
strongly interacting particles, from which important information can be
extracted. Jets constitute unique opportunities to explore the dynamics of the
strong interaction and to study the fundamental properties of the underlying
theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As a result, research in this area
advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of
its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical
law. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.
Professor Kang will involve graduate students in his research, and thereby
provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this
field. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, and
develop new course curricula based on results from the LHC.

More technically, Professor Kang will develop theoretical tools to perform
accurate QCD phenomenology at the LHC, especially for inclusive and heavy flavor
tagged jets and their substructure. He will also perform studies for heavy
quarkonium production by making use of a novel fragmentation function approach
within QCD factorization. In addition, he will combine the frameworks of heavy
quarkonium physics and jet substructure in order to achieve a better
understanding of the production and polarization of heavy quarkonium at the LHC,
which is currently one of the most intriguing puzzles in the field.
