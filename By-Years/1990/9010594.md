An experimental investigation is to be conducted, under a Research Initiation
Award, of the mixing layer between two parallel streams at supersonic speeds.
Optical non-intrusive diagnostics and pressure measurements will be used to
infer the effectiveness of mixing and the role of shock waves. A coordinated
computational effort, based on large-eddy simulation, will also be carried out.
Mixing between parallel streams at very high speeds is essential for the
operation of advanced propulsion systems and the understanding of the organized
turbulent flow features that control the mixing which is necessary for
combustion.
