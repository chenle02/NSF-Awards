&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
lead to the development of compact, low cost gas sensors and analyzers based on
cavity ringdown spectroscopy using near-infrared lasers manufactured for fiber
optic communications. Although conventional cavity ringdown spectroscopy can
achieve part per trillion detection limits for many gases (water vapor, carbon
dioxide, ammonia), few commercial applications require such extraordinary
sensitivity. Instead, price and reliability are controlling factors for the
sensors and analyzers market. That is why we propose a modified form of ringdown
spectroscopy that should lead to low cost, compact, and rugged instruments. The
Phase I effort is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
technique which will lead to the development of a prototype instrument in Phase
II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications include industrial process
analysis and control, bioreactor monitoring, and worker safety. Ideally, the
sensors and analyzers will be low power (possibly battery operated), self-
calibrating and self-checking devices that will be sufficiently rugged to allow
in situ installation.&lt;br/&gt;
