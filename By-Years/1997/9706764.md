ABSTRACT Tao will study geometrical analysis conjectures and results, and
relate them to oscillatory integral statements such as the restriction
conjecture. A typical example of the former is the Kakeya conjecture, that a set
which contains a line segment in every direction in R^n must have dimension n. A
typical example of the latter is the generalized Strichartz estimate for various
PDE (the wave equation, the Schrodinger equation, etc.). It has been known since
the 1970s that there is an intimate relationship between the two types of
statements, but no systematic approach exists, and the few concrete connections
that are known are not very satisfactory. We hope to collect, simplify, unify,
and extend previous results in this direction. Tao will also attack some of
these conjectures (notably the Kakeya conjecture) directly, using some new and
promising techniques; for example, Tao will exploit the affine invariance of the
Kakeya conjecture. One of the aims of this work is to deepen our understanding
of oscillatory integrals, which are a type of mathematical expression which
occur in many places in physics (optics, quantum mechanics, acoustics, and any
other field of physics dealing with waves), as well as having theoretical
importance in other fields of mathematics. Understanding these integrals, and in
particular knowing how large they can get, may ultimately lead to new designs
for physical applications (e.g. tennis rackets that maximize the area of the
"sweet spot", or curved reflectors that have a large number of focus points for
a wide range of frequencies), or at least place theoretical limits on such
designs. There are also numerical applications when modeling certain physical
systems (e.g. the seismic behavior of the Earth); if one knows that a certain
oscillatory integral will never become very "large" in a certain technical
sense, then this will provide a theoretical guarantee to the accuracy of the
computer sim ulation of the physical system. Tao will study these oscillatory
integrals with the aid of geometry; a connection between these two fields of
mathematics is known (being somewhat similar to the relationship between
geometrical optics and the wave theory of light), but is not understood
completely. If this connection is developed thoroughly enough, we may be able to
reduce difficult questions in oscillatory integrals to simpler problems in
geometry, or at least use geometrical techniques to obtain partial progress on
the oscillatory integral problems.
