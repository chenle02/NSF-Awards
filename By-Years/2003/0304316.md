0304316&lt;br/&gt;Larson&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to
Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 02-148, category NIRT. The
objective of this proposal is to design and build a microfabricated platform for
study of DNA/protein interactions at the nano-scale. These interactions are at
the heart of the cellular machinery for maintaining and transcribing DNA, and
include transcription factors, as well as histones and other chromatin proteins.
These DNA/protein interactions are under active study at the cellular level, but
the next steps towards a detailed understanding of them require their study at
smaller length scales, including the nanoscale. Therefore, a microfabricated
devise will be built, which contains a main channel of length 20 to 30 microns
and of width ranging from 20 nm to 2 microns. Individual DNA molecules will be
stretched in the channel and positioned using high frequency electric fields,
and anchored at gold electrodes using thiol groups chemically attached to the
ends of the DNA molecules. This long, very thin, channel will be joined to thin
side channels for addition of DNA-interacting proteins locally to specific
regions of the DNA molecule. The proteins will be further localized by use of
capture electrodes as well as hydrodynamic focusing using flow through other
side streams, and other confinement methods. The channels will be etched in
silicon, and bonded to a thin glass substrate, to permit examination by optical
microscopy. The broader impacts of the proposal include the integration of the
proposed research with the introduction of a new Nanoscale Science and
Engineering (NSE) curriculum for graduate students. The new course will focus on
nano- fabrication issues related to integration of electronic function with
microfluidics and transport issues related to the processing of biological
samples.
