This is a proposal to continue at MIT the work begun under the NSF funded
Collaborative. TEAMS-BC. In this proposal we request funds specifically to
develop the MIT Teacher Education Program (TEP) into a full Teacher
Certification Program FCP) during the academic years 1997-99. We are requesting
$124,900 for the first year and $93, 360 for the second. This project is a
continuation of work begun at MIT under the TEAMS-BC Collaborative for
Excellence in Teacher Preparation. Courses designed or revised under TEAMS-BC
will be further developed and integrated into a full Teacher Certification
Program. In particular, we will concentrate on revisions of our second semester
education course so as to prepare students to meet the competencies required for
Massachusetts State Certification. We will also add to this course an emphasis
on educational technology and a focus on effectively understanding the lives and
learning of inner city youth. To further these goals, the MIT Provost will
support the appointment of two new members to the TEP staff, each a 1/2 FTE:
Maurice Page, a mathematics teacher at our primary internship site, Cambridge
Rindge and Latin High School (CRLS), and a current MIT faculty member to be
drawn from the Schools of Science or Engineering
