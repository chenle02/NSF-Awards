A Presidential Young Investigator will continue his research into the
fundamental groups of Kahler manifolds and the rigidity of finite group actions
for subgroups of complex Lie groups. The principal investigator will extend his
theories of fundamental groups of certain complex manifolds. Fundamental groups
are determined by closed loops on manifolds which cannot be deformed into one
another.
