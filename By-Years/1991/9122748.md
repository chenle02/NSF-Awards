Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving
the University of Texas and Bogazici University is in the general areas of
animal learning and sexual behavior. Project funding will enable Dr. Falih
Koksal of Bogazici University the opportunity to work for 11 months in the
laboratory of Dr. Michael Domjan at the University of Texas. Their collaborative
research will concentrate on the learning mechanisms of sexual behavior in
quail. The main emphasis of the work is concerned with the role of visual cues
and context on sexual conditioning. Research results could expand the present
knowledge base of how cue-to-consequence effects influence more complex
Pavlovian conditioning. This project in experimental psychology fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
