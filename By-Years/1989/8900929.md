This award provides funds to the Biology department of Temple University to
support a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site for a combined academic
year and Summer program. This program will draw on Temple's experience with
undergraduate research as part of the academic year research program, and also
incorporate elements of the Temple University Basic Science Summer Minority
Program which has been in effect for the past two years. The goal is to provide
a rich research environment and a sense of community among promising students in
order to encourage them to enter careers in the biological sciences. To achieve
this goal, the program will have two major components. The first of these is
continued academic year participation in research projects by students enrolled
at Temple. The second is an intensive Summer research program in which students
outside Temple will be involved. Academic year students will have the
opportunity to participate in the Summer program. In both components a special
effort is made to attract under-represented minority students. The program will
focus on a multifaceted approach to the subject of Light in Biological Systems,
employing approaches from Biochemistry, Physiology, Genetics and Plant Science.
