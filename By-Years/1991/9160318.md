This award is to support Phase I research to determine the feasibility of using
a catalyst to permit oxidation of organic compounds of pollutional significance
at lower temperatures than are now necessary and thus reduce the emission of
volatile organic compounds into the environment. This project involves
formulation of a range of catalysts and determination of their activity as a
function of temperature in oxidation of organic compounds that are
representative of aromatics, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and halocarbons. The
proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 91-20, Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR). Results of this research are expected to
determine the technical feasibility of the proposed concept and the basis for
potential continuation of the research into a subsequent Phase II. The results
have potential applicability to incineration of wastes, process improvement for
production of ammonia and to the control of pollutants in automotive exhaust.
