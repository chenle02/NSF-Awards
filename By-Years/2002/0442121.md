Computer Science (31)

This project is developing a more effective way of teaching the introductory
computer programming course (CS1) by creating a set of cooperative learning
materials for use in the course, building on a previous CCLI proof-of-concept
project. The effectiveness of the materials in improving student learning is
being evaluated at a variety of types of institutions, serving students with
diverse backgrounds and career goals. The project is also adding to the
educational research base by studying ways of using cooperative learning in
Computer Science courses.

Intellectual merit Cooperative learning is not a new idea, but previous efforts
in computer science have not taken full advantage of a key element in
cooperative learning: assigning specific concept-related and process-related
roles to group members. This project uses more structured exercises and making
greater use of roles. The project also builds on the successes of the pair
programming approach, another collaborative learning technique. It generalizes
this approach by leading students through different levels of cooperation: from
pure group work, to working in pairs with various levels of interaction, to
individual work with group support.

Broader impacts The results from a prior proof-of-concept study strongly
indicate that cooperative learning leads to higher student performance and lower
attrition, and cooperative learning also seems especially beneficial for women
and other underrepresented groups. Thus, the application of cooperative learning
methods in Computer Science is expected to increase student performance, reduce
attrition, and help alleviate the under-representation of women and minority
students in the Computer Science major.
