This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Bogdanovic and Dr Reynolds will
conduct a series of 3-D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, to study how outflows
from radio galaxies affect the surrounding gas, and to better understand the
role of magnetic fields in regulating the temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas
in galaxy clusters. First, they will study bubbles rising in a plane-parallel
atmosphere. They will include both radiative cooling and heat transfer along
magnetic fields in their simulations, to assess how these affect the magnetic
field geometry and conductive heat flow. Simulating an entire galaxy cluster,
they will examine whether the observed temperature structure in the gas might
represent a balance between radiative cooling and heating as the radio jet blows
bubbles in the cluster gas. Finally, Dr Bogdanovic and Dr Reynolds will consider
galaxy clusters in a cosmological setting. They will examine how mergers between
clusters, and galaxies stirring the gas, will affect the gas temperature by
introducing additional turbulence and mixing. Targeted studies will examine in
detail the effect of various transport processes: anisotropic viscosity, the
diffusion of cosmic rays, and heat conduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr
Bogdanovic is a woman scientist at an early stage of her career. Heat transport
by turbulence and thermal conduction is important for studies of terrestrial
fusion plasmas. Each year, Dr Bogdanovic and Dr Reynolds will recruit an
Astronomy graduate student to work on some aspect of this research for a short
project (a required element of the PhD program), and an undergraduate to work on
visualizing the results from the simulations. Both Dr Bogdanovic and Dr Reynolds
will continue to give public talks on their work.
