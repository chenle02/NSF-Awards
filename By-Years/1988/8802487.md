The objective of this research is to study solid state amorphization produced
by irradiation of charged particles. Electron and ion irradiation will be
applied to a number of intermetallic compounds, using the High Voltage Electron
Microscope facility at the Argonne National Laboratory. Point defect
characteristics of primary interest include threshold displacement energies,
defect migration enthapies, defect recombination volumes, and the softening
introduced per defect. In addition, anisotropy and elastic properties will be
determined. The proposed research is expected to reveal the contributions that
different types of lattice defects make in crystalline-to-amorphous phase
transformations.
