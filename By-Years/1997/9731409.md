9731409 Peach This project proposes to have both middle and high schoolteachers
participate in a summer oceanographic research experience. It will take the
teachers through the scientific process of from research project design to data
collection, analyses, synthesis, and interpretation. After this they will devise
strategies to translate these research experiences into investigative learning
activities for implementation into their science classes. Included will be the
development a manual of classroom and field-based exercises together with a set
of inquiry-based learning modules that will be incorporated into the SEA
educational web site. Almost all of the work will be done at Woods Hole campus
and on sailing vessels in the Gulf of Maine. Thus work will be conducted at sea
and on the campus of Woods Hole in Massachusetts.
