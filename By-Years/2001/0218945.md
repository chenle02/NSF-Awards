The PI will carry out exposure experiments of fresh basaltic glass in seawater
on the ocean floor, and compare the results to the behavior of natural basalt
glass exposed at the same site in terms of the role of microbial communities in
the alteration of the glass. Study environments are located on the submarine
slopes of Hawaii at water depths ranging from 200-2000m, at water temperatures
ranging from near freezing to hydrothermal spring temperatures of approximately
80 degree C. Exposed rock surfaces vary in age from a few years to several
100kyrs and include sites on Loihi Seamount, Puna Ridge and the submarine slopes
of Kohala and Hualalai. With other funds from NOAA's NURP program, the PIs will
undertake 16 submersible dives in FY's 2002/2003, to carry out the field portion
of the study. This award will support cruise participation for the recovery of
previously-placed exposure charges, and the chemical, and microbiological
laboratory investigations of materials recovered from the dives. The PIs will
observe and characterize the microbial populations and physical effects of
natural microbial alteration on well defined glass surfaces. They will compare
reaction rates in the one-year exposure experiments to the rates of basalt
alteration in natural exposure of several years to nearly a million years.
Chemical mass balance will allow the PIs to determine the chemical exchange
rates between seawater and the basalt exposure
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
