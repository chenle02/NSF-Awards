This project will synthesize observational datasets with modeling to improve our
understanding and parameterizations of boundary layer clouds over the southeast
Pacific Ocean, building on the earlier findings by these researchers from the
Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate Processes in the Coupled Ocean-
Atmosphere System (EPIC), a field campaign conducted in 2001
(http://www.atmos.washington.edu/gcg/EPIC/; http://www.ofps.ucar.edu/epic/).
This and other recent studies suggest drizzle is common, especially in aerosol-
poor air masses, and strongly influences cloud properties and boundary layer
turbulence. This investigation is to be undertaken using the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's remote sensing cloud data, coupled with
surface, radiosonde and buoy data sets. Specific goals are to track cloud
evolution within aerosol-poor and aerosol-rich air masses over several diurnal
cycles, and to use observations to force and test the National Center for
Atmospheric Research's Single-column Community Atmosphere Model.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will form the foundation of two doctoral theses,
and will also form the central component of the science plan for the VAMOS Ocean
Cloud Atmosphere Land Study, an international program within Climate Variability
and Predictability. The results are expected to provide an improvement in
single-column model parameterizations which will be tested in global Community
Atmosphere Model runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the
Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR).
