This project investigates the grammatical properties of two genetically
unrelated indigenous languages spoken in the southwest. Due to contact over
hundreds of years the languages share grammatical features, in particular,
complex morphological process (that is, the way that words are formed),
especially when talking about pluralities of individuals or events. These
grammatical features are only rarely found in human languages. Understanding
these processes will thus allow fundamental contributions to language sciences.
By studying how words are formed in these languages, and through this complex
case, the project will sharpen linguistic and psychological theories of word
formation, as well as how words are processed and stored in the brain.
Additionally, the project provides educational opportunities for graduate
students and post-doctoral researchers to train in field linguistics, language
documentation, and language revitalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two
languages mark plurality, pluractionality, and plural agreement using complex
morphological systems that are typologically rare, and which provide an ideal
opportunity for studying the semantics-morphology interface. After documenting
these systems, the research team will use the resulting data to make the
following fundamental contributions to language science: (i) draw bounds on how
semantic composition works below the level of the word; (ii) sharpen
morphological theories of the paradigm; (iii) compare competing theories of
suppletion; and (iv) consider the implications for how complex morphological
systems diffuse areally. These questions will be investigated through
elicitation, both structured and semi-structured, over a three-year period. The
result will be the richest set of data on plurality and pluractionality for this
linguistic region and will allow researchers around the world to investigate
novel questions about how words work in human languages. Concrete results of the
project include research publications, as well as a publicly shared corpus with
semantic and morphological annotations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
