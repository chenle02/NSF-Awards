The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate ion-implantation of boron,
carbon, and nitrogen into pure iron and several steels with simple metallurgical
structures. The propsed research is a cooperative/interdisciplinary program
between Professor Williamson at the Department of Physics, Colorado School of
Mines (CSM) and Professor Wilbur at the Department of Mechanical Engineering,
Colorado State University (CSU) MSM-8617811. Ion-implantation will be done with
a unique facility at CSU, where the tribological testing will also be carried
out. The primary microstructural characterization of the surface before and
after wear testing will be done at CSM in a non- destructive manner with
Mossbauer spectroscopy. The general goal is to develop an improved understanding
of the effect of ion implantation on wear reduction. The outcome of the research
should have a significant impact on tribology.
