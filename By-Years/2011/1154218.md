Morgan State University, a public urban institution with about 90% of its
students of African-American ancestry, provides scholarships to meet the
outstanding financial needs of academically talented students majoring in
Biology. The scholarships allow scholars to devote time that would otherwise be
spent working more than 20 hours per week to pay for their education to instead
focus intensively on their academic and professional development. In addition to
the financial assistance, students in the STARS-1 program receive active and
structured support of both their academic success and professional goals.
Students are also strongly encouraged to undertake mentored undergraduate
research projects during the summer or academic year. Through these
interventions, it is anticipated that the students will persist and excel to
graduation and go on to diversify the STEM workforce and graduate education
programs. This project builds on several other significant federally-funded
activities and is expected to lead to similar initiatives targeting other unique
populations of students majoring in a variety of STEM disciplines.
