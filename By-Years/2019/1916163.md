The analysis of large-scale and complex data plays an increasingly central role
in society, and innovations in machine learning are yielding ever more powerful
predictive technologies. However, when we use such data to guide decision
making, it is important to recognize that the majority of datasets in these
domains are observational rather than randomized in nature, and require careful
analysis in order to draw correct conclusions about the causal effect of
deploying a potential policy. The research aims to develop new methods for data-
driven decision making that can harness the power and expressiveness of machine
learning, all while rigorously building on best practices for causal inference
from non-randomized data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
centered around the following three statistical tasks: (1) Examine the problem
of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies, and
develop a flexible framework that can be used with, e.g., boosting or neural
networks. The accuracy of the proposed method depends on the complexity of the
causal signal that we can intervene on, not on other merely associational
signals. (2) Consider welfare maximizing structured policy learning, and study
an approach whose regret decays as the inverse square root of the sample size in
a non-parametric setting. (3) Consider the problem of learning optimal stopping
rules from sequentially randomized data, and propose a new robust yet
computationally feasible approach to policy learning in this setting. A unifying
theme underlying all these results is that they highlight how classical ideas
from semiparametric statistics can be used to rigorously leverage accurate
machine learning predictors in decision-making
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
