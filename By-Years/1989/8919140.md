This "accomplishment-based-renewal" provides funds for Dr. McNutt to continue
research on two closely related projects awarded her by MG&G; both pertain to
the study of anomalous elevations of ocean crust beneath the Pacific. The first
of these features is the South Pacific Superswell, a large area of seafloor as
much as 750m shallower than predicted by its age relative to the 125km-thick
cooling plate model of Parsons and Sclater. Previous analysis by Dr. McNutt
discount both local density and dynamic stress field anomalies as the
fundamental cause; a plate model thinned to 75 km and accompanied by small-
scale convection in the underlying asthenosphere is favored. This renewal will
allow her to complete the write-up phase of this analysis, and to evaluate the
model by writing computer code that will model this convective flow and test its
stability. The Darwin Rise is a second depth anomaly studied under a previous
award, and Dr. McNutt and colleagues argue it was formed by the same processes
that created the Superwell. She will continue analysis of isostatic compensation
surrounding Mesozoic guyots surveyed on a recent cruise across the Darwin Rise
with the objective of gaining better understanding of mantle dynamics.
