The analysis of fecal steroids is a developing technique of potential
importance in the field of primate reproductive biology and socioecology. It
should allow for the monitoring of reproductive states of animals - whether or
not they are ovulating, for example. Coupled with behavioral observations, this
technique will enable the formulation and testing of much more sophisticated and
incisive hypotheses in the field. This dissertation project is directed by an
excellent senior scientist and will involve collaboration and training with a
leader in this developing field. It will also provide important information on
the ecology and preservation of primates.
