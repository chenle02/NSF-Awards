&lt;br/&gt;(I^3\)C: An Infrastructure for Innovation in Information
Computing&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal, advancing the state-of-the-art in
cluster computing, addresses a broad spectrum of interactive and archival
information processing issues that require intensive computational capabilities.
A high performance compute-engine (clusters), the Access Net, Storage Network
(file and database server), and a Media Lab (multimedia and graphics equipment,
workstations, laptops, PDAs, and software) comprise the infrastructure that will
support the following three core areas, with respective research
activities:&lt;br/&gt;1. Applications&lt;br/&gt;a. Computational
Science&lt;br/&gt;b. Digital Immortality&lt;br/&gt;c.
Bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;2. System Software&lt;br/&gt;a. Cluster
Scheduling&lt;br/&gt;b. Shared I/O Support&lt;br/&gt;c. Fault
Tolerance&lt;br/&gt;3. Architecture&lt;br/&gt;a. QoS Support for Multimedia and
E-Commerce Applications in Clustered-Servers&lt;br/&gt;b. Design of Energy-
Efficient Hardware and Software Optimizations&lt;br/&gt;c. Energy Perspective
Optimization of Different Layers of the Wireless Protocol Stack &lt;br/&gt;The
project focuses on three application areas (Computational Science, Digital
Immortality, and Bioinformatics) to examine common research issues, which in
turn drive the Software and Architecture research for providing holistic
solutions to challenging problems. A research team, consisting of 25
investigators from three different colleges, will benefit from this
infrastructure by strengthening their interdisciplinary research through cross-
fertilization of new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;
