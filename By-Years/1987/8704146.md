Regulation of lysogeny by the plasmid prophages P1 and P7 is mediated by
expression of genes located in the ImmC and ImmI regions of the phage genomes.
The c1 and c4 genes (located in ImmC and ImmI, respectively) are both required
for the maintenance of lysogeny and are believed to code for repressors of
transcription. The structure of ImmI genes (specifically c4, ant/reb, and sim)
will be determined by DNA sequence analysis. Gene expression in the ImmC regions
will be investigated by identifying transcription products produced in vitro and
in vivo and measuring the effect of c1 repressor binding on their expression.
The precise nucleotides involved in the interaction of the c1 repressor with its
operator sites will be determined by studying repressor binding to synthetic
oligonucleotides of defined sequence. The characterization of P1 and P7
regulatory elements should provide insights into control mechanisms operating
during bacteriophage infection and plasmid maintenance.
