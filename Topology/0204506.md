DMS-0204506 Bruce Kleiner

The proposal consists of two projects which are motivated by the geometry of
three dimensional manifolds. The first project uses quasisymmetric
homeomorphisms as a framework to understand the asymptotic geometry of
hyperbolic groups. Several uniformization and rigidity problems are discussed.
The central problem is Cannon's conjecture that a hyperbolic group with boundary
homeomorphic to the two-sphere is a lattice in the isometry group of hyperbolic
space. A resolution of this conjecture would be a major step toward Thurston's
Hyperbolization conjecture. The second part of the proposal addresses the Weak
hyperbolization conjecture, the other missing step in the proof of Thurston's
conjecture. The proposed attack uses geometry and dynamics of surface
laminations in three manifolds.

One of the major open problems in Mathematics is to determine the possible
shapes (topologies) that a three dimensional space might assume. In the 1970's,
Thurston formulated his famous Geometrization conjecture, which is a precise
statement about how the classification of such spaces should look. The proposal
addresses a piece of Thurston's conjecture known as the Hyperbolization
conjecture. The general line of attack is to associate a two dimensional self-
similar fractal sphere with each three dimensional space, and reduce the
original conjecture to showing that one can find "good" coordinate systems for
this associated fractal sphere.
