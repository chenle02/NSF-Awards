This research studies the modes of deformation in the continental collision
zone using great historical Himalayan and modern Pamir earthquakes. The deep
structures beneath these areas provide constraints of the tectonic models and
dynamic processes that have created the Himalayas and Pamir mountains. Another
aim of the study is to find out the mode and extent of strain occurring at
different crustal and upper mantle levels in the Pamir collision zone. Source
parameters of recent moderate sized earthquakes and great historical earthquakes
will be determined using body and surface wave analysis. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
