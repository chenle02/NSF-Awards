This research will focus on the development of synthetic methodology for
preparing the indole ring system. This will be accomplished by use of an
intramolecular Ä±2+2! cycloaddition reaction of arylamino ketenes containing a
pendant alkene, to form fused indoline cyclobutanones. %%% With this Research in
Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Bjorn C. Soderberg of the Department Chemistry at
the University of South Alabama. The project will not only provide new
methodology for synthesizing an important class of organic compounds, but will
also provide excellent opportunities for research by undergraduates.
