The regulation of the light (lt) gene which is located within or very near the
heterochromatin of Chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster will be studied. When
removed from heterochromatin and placed in distal euchromatin by a chromosome
rearrangement, the lt gene shows variegated expression. Using P-element-mediated
transformation, we will determine if a similar position effect occurs when the
gene and its surrounding repetitive sequences are introduced into a variety of
chromosomal sites. The transformed gene will be tested for interactions with
known trans-acting modifiers of variegation. The transformed middle repetitive
sequences will be examined for properties attributed to heterochromatin. We will
assay for the ability of these sequences to induce variegation of euchromatic
genes or alter chromosome morphology in polytene tissue. These studies of
position effect variegation address questions about the molecular determinants
of chromosomal structure and functional differences between the heterochromatic
and euchromatic chromosomal domains. The properties of the heterochromatic lt
gene of D. melanogaster will be compared to its euchromatic homolog of D.
virilis to provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that allow a gene to
function in heterochromatin.***//
