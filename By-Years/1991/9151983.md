Franklin and Marshall College is purchasing a nitrogen pumped dye laser for use
in multiple upper division chemistry courses. Experiments being performed with
the new equipment include laser induced atomic fluorescence, time-resolved
fluorescence quenching, and Raman spectroscopy of pure liquids. Additionally,
the laser is used by advanced students in independent research projects.
