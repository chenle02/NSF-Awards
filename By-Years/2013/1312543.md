The research project synthesizes theory, computation and experiments to create
multiscale models of dense particulate flows, ranging from microstructural
dynamics of nearly contacting particles to the macrorheological properties of
dense suspensions. The theoretical core of the project includes both mechanistic
models of nearly contacting groups of particles, and continuum modeling and
analysis of the dynamics of dense suspensions. The research develops new
Stokesian Dynamics algorithms to resolve the slow particle interactions in dense
suspensions, and uses simulations of how particles collectively reconfigure on
the micro-scale to accommodate applied external strains to construct a continuum
model for suspension rheology. New theory is supported by experiments carried
out in the Applied Mathematics Laboratory at UCLA to test predictive models of
suspension rheology.

Particle laden flows are important in many industrial applications including oil
and gas extraction, coal processing, mining of minerals, and waste-water
treatment. Results from this basic research project can be used to develop
quantitative models for such diverse applications as spiral separators in the
mining industry, cell separation in inertial microfluidic devices and
aggregation of microbes. The project supports both graduate student research and
undergraduate research involving experiments and theory.
