project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an opportunity
for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to participate
in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select
promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.
Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the conversion of the
NSF-funded research into commercial applications and technological innovation
supported by follow-on private venture capital or other non-federal financing.
This Phase I project investigates the use of microlaser arrays to produce
multichannel optical heads for retrieving data off CD-ROM. The project is
evaluating the performance and functionality of CD-ROM drives using the
multichannel read-out with (a) the present CD-ROM format, and (b) a new encoding
and demodulation format optimized for multichannel read-out.
