This award provides support for participation in the Representations of
Riemannian Geometry Conference, to be held August 10-13, 2017 at Saint Joseph's
University in Philadelphia, PA. The conference focuses on modern developments in
global Riemannian geometry and the relationship between global metric geometry
and topology. In the recent past these fields were very important in several
breakthroughs in mathematics. For example, methods from both geometric analysis
and metric geometry were crucial for the proof of the famous Poincaré
conjecture, which goes back to the year 1900 and is the only one of the
Millennium Prize problems to be solved to date. These areas of mathematics also
have many applications, for example to physics, chemistry, engineering, and big
data analysis. This funding will help to involve early-career mathematicians,
including graduate students and postdocs. Special attention will be devoted to
identifying and supporting women and other members of underrepresented groups.
There will be speaking opportunities for junior researchers and graduate
students, as well as a full day of introductory talks with the goal of
attracting a broader audience. The conference will include speakers and
participants who work in several research areas, thus further encouraging cross-
collaborations.

The conference will feature eleven plenary speakers with plenty of time between
talks to encourage discussion and the interchange of ideas. Additionally, there
will be three talks given by graduate students. The technical areas represented
by the conference include several areas of global Riemannian geometry:
symmetries of spaces with lower curvature bounds, special Riemannian metrics
(especially Einstein metrics, Kähler metrics, and warped products), families of
harmonic self-maps of spheres, foliations of spheres, projective and conformal
geometry, homogeneous Ricci flow and isometric flow on orbit spaces,
isoparametric hypersurfaces, path spaces, and closed geodesics. The overlap
between these areas makes very real the possibility for cross-collaboration
among the participants, and the conference activities will bring together
leading experts and young researchers and students, facilitating the
dissemination of recent research progress and discussion of future directions
and open problems.
