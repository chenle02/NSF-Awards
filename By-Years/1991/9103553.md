Professor Rumely will work on sectional capacity for adelic sets on projective
varieties of arbitrary dimensions. He will develop properties of sectional
capacity and attempt to prove the homogeneous form conjecture that on a variety
of dimension d, the sectional capacity is determined by a homogeneous form of
degree d+1. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a
subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
