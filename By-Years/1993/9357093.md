9357093 Kiessling In general, oligosaccharide-protein interactions that play a
critical role in cell-cell recognition in the immune system and
structure/function relationships of RNA and RNA-protein complexes will be
studied. Cell adhesion at the molecular level, where a specific complex between
the tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis x and the E-selectin receptor has been
implicated as a mediator, will be studied. This will lead to an understanding of
how: (1) the carbohydrate sequence determines conformation and conformational
rigidity of the sialyl Lewis x and (2) the molecular details of complexation.
This will allow the development of new methods to modulate carbohydrate-mediated
adhesion. A new analytical technique for determining binding of proteins to RNA
will be applied with the IRE-binding protein, which controls levels of iron
regulatory proteins. In addition, the mechanism of selective cleavage of
oligoribonucleotides at bulges and loops by a Cu(II) complex will be studied as
well as cleavage of DNA at hairpins. %%% This grant from the Organic Synthesis
Program supports the work of Professor Laura L. Kiessling at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison. Interactions between carbohydrates and proteins play a
critical role in cell-cell recogition in the immune system and these important
interactions will be studied. Understanding this complexation will be important
to the design of new drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. A new analytical technique for
determining the binding of proteins to RNA will be implemented to increase the
understanding of RNA-mediated gene regulation, which can lead to new strategies
to control cancer, viral infections, and other genetic diseases. ***
