This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support research projects by D. Griffeath, J. T.
Cox, and R. Durrett in the Departments of Mathematics of the University of
Wisconsin, the University of Syracuse, and Cornell University, respectively. At
least two of the three investigators will work on the following five projects:
nonlinear voter models, anti-stepping stone models, forest fires and epidemics,
cyclic wave dynamics, and growth models on Poisson lattices.
