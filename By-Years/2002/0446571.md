Optics on Si enables a platform for monolithic integration of optics and
microelectronics. It can open the door to a new technology that is free from
conventional microelectronics limitations with low power, high bandwidth, high
speed and a high level of integration.

Recent results in Si Nanophotonics have shown the ability to guide, filter, bend
and split light on Silicon chips using nano-size structures. Here it is proposed
to address two of the major issues in Si-based Nanophotonics that remain the
bottleneck of this field: 1. Coupling on-chip nano-size structures to off-chip
micron size structures necessitated by the current absence of an all-Silicon
optical source, and 2. Controlling externally the photonic structures for
modulation and switching. The solution to these two key technical challenges
will enable the design of all-optical and electro-optical systems with
unprecedented performance.

In order to achieve coupling, switching and modulation on Silicon highly
confining structures will be used. The high degree of optical confinement at a
specific location of the structure increases the sensitivity of the device to
external control. It also enables modification of the waveguiding modes in very
short lengths, for increased coupling efficiency between different structures.
The preliminary results show the feasibility of switching and coupling light
using sub-micron size high confinement structures in Si and create the
groundwork for this proposed research.

In addition to the research plan, it is proposed to develop: 1. An outreach
program with the goal of addressing the retention problem of female students in
engineering and in particular in the emerging field of nanotechnology by
addressing career-family life issues, and 2. An educational program for exposing
students to photonics as an interdisciplinary area and enhancing the
undergraduate and graduate ECE curriculum in the area of photonics.
