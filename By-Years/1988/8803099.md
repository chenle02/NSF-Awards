This award will support collaborative research between Professor Mourad Ismail
of the University of South Florida in Tampa and Professor Jairo Charris of the
National University of Colombia in Bogota, Colombia. The investigators plan to
carry out research problems in the following three areas: 1) Differential
Equations, 2) Difference Equations, and 3) Orthogonal Polynomials. More
specifically, they plan to study a class of differential equations of order 2
with an arbitrary number of regular singular points. They also plan to construct
spectral measures of certain families of fourth order difference equations and
study orthogonal polynomials arising from discrete Schrodinger operators with
quasi periodic potentials. Additionally, they will investigate polynomials
orthogonal on several intervals and the distribution and monotonicity of zeros
of orthogonal polynomials depending on a parameter. The U.S. investigator is an
experienced and respected researcher who has obtained important results in these
areas. By helping to bring together Professor Ismail with a promising researcher
from a developing country to work on problems of mutual interest, this award
fulfills the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
