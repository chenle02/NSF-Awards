Abstract 9530347 J.W. Keto, M.F. Becker and J.R. Brock, University of Texas at
Austin It is proposed to experimentally investigate generation of nanoparticles
using "laser ablation of microparticles" (LAM, a process proposed by the
principal investigators), optimize particle collection, and to develop a pilot
station to check the scale-up approach. A laboratory system with a production
capacity of about 0.5 kg/hour using a nominal 100 Watt laser system is targeted.
LAM generates dry particles in the 50-300 nm size range in an inert carrier gas,
at either near-atmospheric conditions and low velocity flow or in vacuum at
supersonic velocity flow. The nanoparticles of either insulator, semiconductors,
metals or alloys are collected in a compatible surfactant to prevent
agglomeration and facilitate further processing and use. Fundamental knowledge
for particle production and handling for the manufacture of conductive thick-
film pastes for electronic circuits will be developed in collaboration with
DuPont Company. DuPont will provide expertise in powder preparation and handling
for use in such kind of pastes, perform testing and give feedback to the
academic team concerning the paste performance as a function of the particle
characteristics and the production process. The main contributions of the
proposal target better understanding and modeling of the LAM process, research
on the collection and processing of ultrafine particles, a scale-up approach,
and application of the resulted particles to the development of a new technology
which consists in the use of nanometer sized particles in pastes for printed
circuit board conductor strips. ***
