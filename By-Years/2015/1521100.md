Striga is a parasitic plant that feasts through the roots of corn, sorghum,
upland rice, millet, and cowpea, devastating these crops and the lives of people
who depend on them in sub-Saharan Africa and other areas in the developing
world. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) notes
that, while maize has the largest acreage of all field crops in Africa, the
average yield (1.6 t/hectare) is less than 1/3 of that achieved per unit area
elsewhere in the world. The situation is further exacerbated by widespread
dispersal of Striga seeds that intermix with maize kernels and ears going to
market. This EAGER project will test a potentially novel strategy for dealing
with Striga infestation using a newly identified transposon-induced (non-
transgenic) mutant of maize. This plant carries a mutation in a gene that
encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 (ccd8) and has been shown to produce
little to no precursors for strigolactone (SL), a maize hormone that is sensed
by the Striga parasite and is required as a chemo-signal for host location and
germination of its own seeds. The non-transgenic nature of this new maize mutant
also enhances prospects for its acceptance and use by peoples with diverse
cultures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the extent to which
actual interactions between maize and Striga are affected by the partially-
understood roles of strigolactone in plant biology. The specific objectives are
to: 1) determine the degree of resistance to Striga seed germination and host
attraction offered by the ccd8 mutation, and 2) test the concept that a
relatively modest yield penalty in ccd8 maize can be countered without losing
Striga resistance, by breeding strategies based on hybrid vigor and naturally-
occurring genetic modifiers. If successful, this EAGER project will provide for
a new strategy that could counter Striga-based yield losses that extend from 15%
to 100%, thereby making maize production sustainable in Striga infested regions.
