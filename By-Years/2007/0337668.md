This GK-12 project develops a partnership between Polytechnic University and 3
New York City high schools to enhance student achievement in the Regents Exam of
Living Environment, Physics, and Math--A. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the proposal includes, raising academic achievement of students in STEM
disciplines; stimulating students' interest in science and math by integrating
"high-tech" sensing and data collection technologies in high school STEM
curriculum, instruction, and laboratory; giving professional development
opportunities to teachers; and encouraging cross-pollination of education
research and technical concepts among the university and school faculty.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the proposal include reinforcing
STEM training and educational experience of a socially diverse and economically
disadvantaged inner-city student body; building the laboratory infrastructure
for sensor-based STEM curriculum and instruction; and broadening the ties of
Polytechnic's Packard Center with local school districts and local businesses to
sustain and grow its outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is
receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering
