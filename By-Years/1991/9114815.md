This Small Grant for Exploratory Research aims to study chaos in electromagnetic
systems. During this 1-year experimental research program, we seek to establish
the important principles governing electromagnetic chaos via specific
experiments on: 1) Wavefunctions of chaotic microwave cavities, such s the Sinai
billiard and the stadium. In particular, detailed information regarding the
spatial distribution of the wavefunctions will be obtained using novel
experimental techniques. 2) Spectral statistic of resonant mode frequencies of
chaotic and regular cavities. 3) Scattering properties of chaotic systems, such
as the three disk. The work is expected to impact on telecommunications, since
the concepts of chaos will be introduced to electromagnetic systems for the
first time. The program will borrow from and impact upon fundamental ideas in
quantum chaos, eg. scarred eigenstates, eigenvalue spacing distributions, etc.
In addition, the results can be scaled to correspond to experiments on quantum
mesoscopic systems.
