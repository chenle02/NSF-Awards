This proposal pertains to the development of a novel, cost effective, compact
sensor for time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of biological samples. The
sensor will have high time resolution (sub-nanosecond) for accurate fluorescence
decay time measurements with high sensitivity. The sensor is based on the pseudo
random code modulated (PRM) cw lidar technique whereby the fluorescence signal
from the PRM laser excitation is detected by a receiver system, and processed
using cross correlators to determine the decay profile in real time. The time
resolution of the measurement is enhance beyond the quantization precision of
the digitizer using a proprietary resolution enhancement technique. The spectral
information of the fluorescence signal is obtained using a set of interference
filters. Unlike in the pulsed laser fluorescence technique, the detectable
signal is not limited by the background noise level due to the inherent
characteristic of the PRM phase sensitive technique. In Phase I, we will carry
out a proof of concept experiment, critical system analysis, and conceptual
system design. This sensor can be used for the in vivo as well as remote
measurement of the fluorescence signal from samples in realtime.
