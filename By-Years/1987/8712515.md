This grant will allow MIT to serve as an REU site for nine selected
undergraduates who will take part in a ten-week program in sedimentological
research during the summer of 1987. The students will contribute to three
ongoing research projects: 1) Bed configurations and sedimentary structures
produced by combined flow; 2) Texture of gravels as a function of flow
conditions and deposition rate; and 3) Bed-load travel distances and transport
speeds in mixed-size sediments. All three will involve the students in current
research projects under the supervision of the PI and a graduate student who
will soon receive his Ph D. Students will be selected through advertisements in
large circulation geological publications.
