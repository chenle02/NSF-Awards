The goal of this project, named DataWizard, is to dramatically simplify the
effort that is currently required for data analytics through the use of
computer-aided programming. Specifically, this project aims to semi-automate
data collection, querying, and wrangling tasks by automatically generating
programs from informal specifications. As a result, the DataWizard project will
allow domain scientists to focus on more interesting data analytics and
visualization tasks, leaving the "grunt work" of data science to computer-aided
programming tools. The project will also advance the state-of-the-art in
automated program synthesis and natural language processing and apply these
techniques to the burgeoning field of big data analytics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a technical perspective, the goals of the DataWizard
project are three-fold. First, this project develops novel programming-by-
example and information extraction techniques to address challenges that arise
in data collection, including consolidation of different data sources,
transformations between hierarchical and relational data, and extraction of
information from unstructured data sources. Second, this project explores new
techniques for querying data using natural language descriptions. In particular,
this project considers data extraction from relational and noSQL databases as
well as semi-structured data sources, such as XML and JSON. Third, this project
develops novel program synthesis methods for automating data wrangling,
cleaning, and imputation tasks that commonly arise in data analytics. Overall,
these techniques make it significantly easier for data scientists to gain
insights from messy data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
