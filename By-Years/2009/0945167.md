This SBIR project proposes to develop a new technology for the detection and
identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a portable instrument.
Spectral photoionization detection technology will be used to identify VOCs
based on their electron energy spectra. This is a useful application because
existing photoionization detectors can not identify individual VOCs present in a
gas stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed
project will be the ability to detect and identify individual VOCs in the
atmosphere or at emission sources. This can be useful in atmospheric monitoring
programs, hazardous materials management, control of fugitive emissions, etc. A
cost-effective technology will be beneficial to society in maintaining ambient
air quality, and in preventing hazardous conditions.&lt;br/&gt;
