Project NETWORKS is a staff development program for teacher enhancement in
precollege science education in the Fairfield Public Schools, Fairfield,
Connecticut. Cooperating community agencies and institutions will provide a
variety of professional growth opportunities for teachers of science, K-12, and
their supervisors and administrators. The main goals of the project include the
improvement of science education in the schools and revitalization of a mature
staff through professional growth incentives. The scheduled offerings will help
teachers gain knowledge of science and education content where weaknesses and
interests have been identified, become aware of the latest research findings of
teaching methodology and learning theory in order to apply them in their
teaching and supervision, and experience new educational and science technology
in research techniques and skills, such as using the computer as a laboratory
instrument.
