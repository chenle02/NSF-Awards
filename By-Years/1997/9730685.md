9730685 Chen Mid-ocean ridges represent the longest plate boundaries on the
earth's surface and their persistent volcanism has produced over half of the
earth's crust. Understanding mantle upwelling and crustal accretion processes at
mid- ocean ridges is important in our understanding how global plate tectonics
work to shape the earth's surface. This proposed two-year investigation is
designed to construct three-dimensional ridge crustal flow models at a fast
spreading mid-ocean ridge. The main goal is to test if the along-axis crustal
flow at fast spreading ridges is sufficient to smoothen the gravity, topography,
crustal thickness and other observables if mantle upwelling at fast ridges is
three-dimensional. This is the key to discriminate between the current two
competing hypotheses for the mantle flow and crustal accretion at mid-ocean
ridges. This is inexpensive and effective approach toward solving the current
dilemma of the production of oceanic crust and its related processes at fast
spreading ridges.
