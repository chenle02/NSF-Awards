A primary objective of this research is to develop a unified theory for
nonparametric fitting of multivaritate response surfaces based on likelihoods
for smoothing splines and kernel estimators. The proposed approach involves
combining the notions of a penalized likihood and a weighted likelihood in a
penalized- weighted negative log-likelihood equation. This will provide a common
framework within which to study and compare the properties of kernel estimators
and smoothing splines. Remaining objectives address ways with which to make
kernel estimators as efficient as possible in order to prove a nonparametric
alternative to the currently popular parametric approaches used in response
surface methodoloy. This research is in the general area of statistical
regression. Much recent activity in the field has been directed at relaxing the
assumptions in regression theory and thereby increasing the utility of these
statistical methods. The result of recent progress is the existance a new set of
fragmented tools for data analysis with unclear advantanges and disadvantages
with respect to each other. This inhibits their application to other scientific
problems. This proposal is to unify recent advances in this area and, thereby,
provide the means to choose the most appropriate and informative tool for
analyzing a particular data set.
