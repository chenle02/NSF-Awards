9414634 McDowell This project is to study the path dependence of the
constitutive behavior of shape memory alloys (SMA). SMA materials are used in
"smart structure" applications to provide damping or as medical devices. The
hysteresis loop changes during cyclic loading and dislocations are also
generated to accommodate the phase changes associated with their primary
response. The research will provide data on how multi-axial states of stress and
loading path affect the behavior. ***
