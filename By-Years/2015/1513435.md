This award provides travel support for graduate students to attend the 44th
Annual Conference on Parallel Processing to be held in Beijing, China from
September 1-4th, 2015. ICPP is a premier conference in parallel and distributed
systems. A committee will be selected to choose the travel awardees according to
the following criteria. The first priority will give to students who are from
under-represented groups. The second priority will be given to those who
normally could not attend the conference. Besides technical paper presentations,
the venue offers a wide range of technical activities including panels, industry
presentations, posters, demos, and keynote talks. Attending such high-caliber
technical venues is extremely valuable for future researchers. This award will
enable the supported attendees to be exposed to the state-of-the-art research in
the field, to have the opportunity to interact with peer graduate students,
researchers and experts from all over the world, to further gain knowledge that
is likely to shape the future of the field.
