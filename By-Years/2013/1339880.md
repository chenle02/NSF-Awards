This joint program reviews the state-of-the-art of the field of model-based
assistive robotic technologies for medicine and rehabilitation in the USA and
Japan, outlines the fundamental science and technologies in this area, and
proposes models for future collaborative research between Japan and USA by
building on the mutual strengths. In particular, gait training for stroke
patients using exoskeletons is studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of
medical and rehabilitation robotics offers much in terms of broad societal
impact. In addition, the project exposes graduate students and faculty to the
culture of research in Japan, and more broadly, Asia. Today, Japan leads in many
areas of robotics and automation. The students in the NSF-JST program interact
with researchers in Japan and visit prominent universities and research
laboratories. This exposure provides excellent training for the students and
prepares them for careers in industry and academia globally.
