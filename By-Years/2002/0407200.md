AST-0407200&lt;br/&gt;Eisenstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a
specially targeted sample of luminous early-type galaxies in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) to probe the power spectrum on large scales to unprecedented
accuracy, and to study the evolution of these massive galaxies. The volume and
uniformity of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample, which has a roughly constant
co-moving number density, make it far superior to any other existing or planned
survey for estimating the large-scale power spectrum. The research will focus on
the baryon acoustic oscillations as a critical cosmological test, capable of
quantifying the acceleration of the Universe with a precision similar to the
supernova test but using a completely independent and very clean method. The
SDSS LRG sample also provides an enormous data set for the study of the most
massive galaxies in the universe today. This remarkable view of the physics of
structure formation and hierarchical galaxy evolution should yield important
progress on these two core issues of modern cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;
