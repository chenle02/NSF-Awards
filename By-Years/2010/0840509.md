This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities:Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will
upgrade a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with a new
console and broadband probe and obtain two sample carousels (for a 300 MHz and
the 500 MHz spectrometer). The research activity to be supported by this
instrument spans areas in synthetic organic, inorganic, physical organic, and
polymer chemistry. These include the study of (i) multi-metal complexes for
light harvesting, (ii) metal complexes of new fluorinated poly(pyrazolyl)borate
ligands with unusual catalytic and luminescent properties, (iii) polymeric
materials with enhanced electrical conductivity, possible superconductivity, and
electro- and photo luminescent properties, (iv) the total synthesis of bioactive
alkaloids, (v) the development of new organocatalysts, and (vi) synthetic
methods development.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool
essential for progress in modern chemical research. NMR spectra enable
researchers to study how molecules react and to identify reaction products and
unstable reaction intermediates. Structural information on how the atoms are
connected in the molecules under study is obtained from observing transitions
between energy levels arising from the nuclear magnetic spin properties of
atoms. The instruments will be used to support research projects of
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students at UTA and train them in the
use of state-of-the-art instrumentation. UTA will pilot a program with Tarrant
County College to allow students in a sophomore organic lab to obtain and
interpret data from their experiments.
