The research entails the value distributional geometry of complex curves in
complex hyperbolic spaces. Ramifications include a geometric study of several
associated number theoretic questions (Diophantine Approximation). The research
also includes an approach to several problems concerning the Gauss maps of
minimal surfaces in space forms.
