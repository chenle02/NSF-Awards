Phase I research project will investigate a new near-infrared spectrophotometer
which has no moving parts. The instrument is based on an array of solid state
light emitting devices and can work with or without a diffraction grating
depending on application. The array of light emitting diodes (LED) cover a
specific, application dependent spectral range in infrared wavelengths of 1um to
3.5 um. The LEDs will be designed, then some selected wafers will be epitaxially
grown and processed and the feasibility studies of the diode and array
manufacturing would be explored.
