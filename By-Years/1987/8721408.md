The introduction of a swath-mapping Sea Beam capability to the Research Vessel
ATLANTIS II, and tender to the Deep Submergence Vehicle ALVIN, has had a
profound effect on the submersible's scientific operations and productivity. The
reason for this improvement is a greatly improved shipboard computing capability
for navigation and bathymetry, and for general data logging, processing and
display. This full capability is presently available only during those cruises
when Sea Beam personnel are on board. This instrumentation project will upgrade
the ATLANTIS II's shipboard computing capability and will provide software
documentation so that it may be operated by a member of the ALVIN technical
support on all research cruises. Shipboard processors will be upgraded for
improved maintainability, and common software will be developed for precision
navigation of the submarine, and for data logging, integration, processing and
display. The new computing system will combine transponder and traditional
navigation, and data from this system will be logged along with individual
navigation sources, and integrated with scientific data. All shipboard data,
including dive, station, submersible and Sea Beam data will be integrated in the
ALVIN/Sea Beam shipboard computers into a common data base for return to shore
as well as for processing and display at sea. This integrated computer
capability will allow scientists involved with any operation aboard the ATLANTIS
II to work with the same computer system containing all cruise data in a
coordinated and navigated format.
