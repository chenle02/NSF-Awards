9625384 Rice and Fredkin ABSTRACT The investigators do research on a number of
problems that arise in modeling the stochastic behavior of ion channels and in
the statistical analysis of patch clamp recordings: (1) investigations of
maximum likelihood estimation of kinetic parameters with particular attention to
computational aspects and the interpretation and assessment of the kinetic
models; (2) investigation of problems which arise in the analysis of records in
which multiple channels are present; (3) investigation of the utility of models
which are based on stochastic differential equations in contrast to Markov
models with a discrete state space, which have typically been used in the field.
Ion channels are large proteins that allow current in the form of ions to pass
across cell membranes. These channels are the fundamental units of current
conduction in the neuromuscular system and the interrelationships of a large
variety of ion channels shape the electrical signals of the system. The study of
ion channels is useful not only for the purpose of deeper basic understanding of
the neuromuscular system, but also because ion channel function is implicated in
various neuromuscular diseases and because pharmaceutical products, such as
anesthetics, are targeted at ion channels. An experimental technique known as
the "single channel patch clamp" allows recordings to be made which provide
important information about these channels. The apparently random character of
the recorded currents has led to the widespread use of statistical models for
the dynamics of the channels and to the use of statistical techniques of data
processing. The very large quantity of data produced by such recordings poses
substantial computational problems which must be resolved in order that
important information about the channels can be extracted efficiently. This
interdisciplinary proposal is primarily concerned with the development of
effective statistical and computational methodology.
