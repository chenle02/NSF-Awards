The objective of this project is the study of algorithms and complexity,
focusing on specific application areas and methodologies. This project is aimed
to further our understanding of local search and some other important
computational problems whose answers are guaranteed to exist. The research
involves development of rigorous techniques for attacking various computational
problems with an "artificial intelligence" flavor, such as prehension and
exploration by robots, and probabilistic logic, a complexity-based understanding
of certain aspects of Economic Theory and Game Theory, and study of problems in
security and communication in very large networks, and certain novel
optimization problems related to communication networks.
