0129319&lt;br/&gt;Fewell&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Jennifer Fewell and
graduate and undergraduate students from Arizona State University in a
collaboration with Juergen Gadau of Institute for Behavioral Physiology at the
University of Wuerzburg, Germany. The aim of the international project is to
examine the extent and consequences of hybridization between two native seed-
harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex rugosus and Pogonomyrmex barbatus. The German and
U.S. groups will test the hypothesis that hybridization in that system does not
universally produce reduced hybrid fitness, as expected by current models. They
will also test the hypothesis that colonies respond to hybridization by
preferentially using sperm belonging to different species. They will use
morphological, molecular, and behavioral techniques to determine the extent of
introgression between species and to measure fitness components of hybridized
and parental colonies. In addition, they will perform controlled mating
experiments to determine the effect of hybridization on caste determaination.
The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
