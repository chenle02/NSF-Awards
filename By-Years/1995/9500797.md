This project involves studies on two topics: 1) multiplicity of discriminants,
class numbers and Artin L-functions, and 2) distribution of Hecke eigenvalues.
In the first category, the main objective is to establish estimates for class
group character sums which are relatively short with respect to the
discriminant. On the second topic, the aim is to investigate the orthogonality
and equidistribution of eigenvalues of Hecke operators. This research falls into
the general area of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the
study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
