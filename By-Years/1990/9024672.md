This project will support the curation and inventory of a collection of
parasitic wasps in the Trichogrammatidae (Hymenoptera). Wasps of this family are
internal parasites of the eggs of other insects. 73 genera and about 650 species
have been described. They are among the smallest insects known. Because they
commonly parasitize the eggs of several agricultural pests, these wasps have
been of particular interest to biological control. Problems associated with
their small size, however have deterred entomologists from building requisite
collections. Consequently the taxonomy of the family is in an extremely
unsatisfactory state. Species identifications are impossible for most genera.
Generic identifications also are problematic. Because the family is so poorly
sampled, diversity, geographic distributions and biological characteristics
remain unappreciated. A large collection of Trichogrammatidae has now been put
together at the University of California at Riverside. The collection is world
wide in coverage but stresses North America. It, by far, represents the largest
holdings of this group in North America and probably the world. Support will be
used to inventory and curate the collection. The largest portion is in alcohol
and in peril because of the fragile nature of these wasps. Specimens require
immediate removal and critical point drying. Computerization of collection data
also is planned and will make specimen information available to other
researchers. A large and well curated collection is required to encourage future
taxonomic studies of this poorly known but important family of insect egg
parasites.
