This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research in the laboratories of Dr. M. Frederick Hawthorne at the
University of California, Los Angeles. The research to be performed involves the
development of macromolecular assemblies based upon icosahedral carboranes.
Utilizing nucleophilic substitution, dicarbollide preparation, or electrophilic
halogenation, ortho-, meta-, and para-icosahedral carboranes will be
functionalized with hydrophobic or hydrophilic moieties. Linear assemblies,
carborods, will be synthesized using para-carboranes alone or in combination
with linear-bifunctional linking groups. The ionic association and thermotropic
liquid-crystal characteristics of carborods will be examined. Cyclic assemblies,
carboracycles and mercuracarborands, will be synthesized using ortho- or meta-
carboranes and bifunctional-spacer groups. The host-guest interactions,
electrophilic catalytic activity, and lyotropic liquid-crystal characteristics
of carboracycles and mercuracarborands will be investigated. Additional research
topics include the functionalization of decakismethyl para-carborane and
investigation of dicarbollide reactivity. Exploration of molecular self-assembly
will lead to the development of unique molecular architectures and advance our
understanding of the interrelationship of structure and function. This research
may lead to the development of analytical probes for molecular recognition and
new catalysts.
