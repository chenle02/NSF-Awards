9350846 Illies The use of a massspectrometer is being integrated into
undergraduate teaching laboratories. The Hewlett-Packard MS Engine has a modern
data system capable of true multi-tasking and four attached personal computers
allowing exposure of large numbers of students to practical modern mass
spectrometry. The degree of exposure and "hands on" use of the instrument
increases from the sophomore to the senior level. Initial student contact with
the instrument is in the organic laboratory where students are identifying the
products of simple synthetic reactions. In physical chemistry, the concepts of
bond formation and reaction mechanisms are being studied through ion-molecule
reactions. In the inorganic labs, students routinely are using the instrument to
analyze the products of their inorganic syntheses, while in the analytical
laboratories, quantitative analysis of chlorinated hydrocarbons and
polychlorinated biphenyls is being carried out on water and soil samples
collected throughout the state. Finally, students are using the mass
spectrometer in a number of undergraduate research projects. Careful choice of
experiments, efficient use of instrument time, and easy data access through
multiple computers are enabling us to expose large numbers of students to
practical "hands on" mass spectrometry. A review of the literature shows a
marked deficiency in teaching mass spectrometry at the undergraduate level. This
project is providing a model for correcting that problem. ***
