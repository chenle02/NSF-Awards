The objective of the project is to provide a total of 54 one-year scholarships
to economically disadvantaged but academically talented students from
underrepresented minority groups to improve the enrollment, retention, and
graduation in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Incoming high
school students to receive an associate degree in one of the CSEMS disciplines,
and current students to transfer from an associate degree program to a
baccalaureate degree program are targeted. The recruitment takes place through
outreach activities on campus and at regional feeder high schools, and through
the electronic and hard copy dissemination of detailed program and application
information. The project links and leverages existing resources providing all
scholarship recipients access to academic support, tutoring, priority
registration, counseling, educational planning, academic excellence workshops,
career development resources, work-based learning opportunities/internships,
priority transfer support, additional financial aid, and state-of-the-art
computer and technological equipment and laboratories. The project also builds
on the strengths of the current MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, and Science
Achievement Award) program, and the articulation agreements with four-year
programs.
