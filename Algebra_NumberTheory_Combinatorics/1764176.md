This award supports the PI's research in building mathematical tools to solve
problems in graph theory and additive combinatorics, and to better understand
the connections between these two subjects. Graph theory concerns mathematical
techniques for analyzing abstract networks, especially very large networks that
are relevant for applications in computer science. Additive combinatorics
concerns structures in sets of numbers, such as the prime numbers. Previous
foundational work, including some done by the PI, has shown that tools and
insights from one of these areas can be helpful in solving problems in the
other. The PI will continue to prove results that further build the connections
between these two subjects. The first topic of this project concerns extensions
and variations of Szemerédi's theorem. Szemerédi's theorem is a cornerstone
result in combinatorics, stating that subsets of integers with positive density
must contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Developments around
Szemerédi's theorem have led to important and powerful tools in graph theory
such as Szemerédi's regularity lemma, as well as concepts in additive
combinatorics such as Gowers uniformity norms and higher order Fourier analysis.
A major goal of this project is to extend Szemerédi's theorem, including
understanding polynomial and multidimensional generalizations, popular
differences, and variants inside other settings such as permutations. The second
topic concerns large deviations in discrete random structures. The PI will
develop tools for understanding tail distributions of subgraph counts in random
graphs as well as counts of certain arithmetic patterns in a random set.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
