The primary objective of the project is to establish cell culture systems as
the basis for development of a competitive research proposal on "Regulation of
Proliferation and Progression of Uterine Fibroid Cell Types". Support of these
planning activites will assist a well trained new investigator to improve her
research capability and to complete the planning and development of a research
proposal. Successful completion of the planning activities should significantly
enhance the potential of the investigator to compete for Federal research
support.
