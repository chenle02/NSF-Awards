The objective of this research program is to develop a comprehensive data base
on the modulus and damping characteristics of surficial soils in the Mississippi
embayment region - which is recognized as a high seismic hazard area associated
with the historic New Madrid earthquakes of 1811-12. The New Madrid seismic zone
(NMSZ), located at the northern edge of the embayment, is well known for its
seismically active buried faults. The earthquakes that occur in the NMSZ are
characterized by a long recurrence period and low seismic wave attenuation (the
effect of an earthquake is felt at large distances from the epicenter). The
damaging effects of earthquakes are intimately associated with the dynamic
properties of the surficial soils, most notably the stiffness and damping
properties. These properties are a major component to regional seismic risk
assessment studies. The damage is most often a result of amplification of the
ground surface shaking as a result of the coincidence between a natural mode of
the soil profile and the dominant frequency of incident seismic waves; or of the
liquefaction of water-saturated granular deposits near the ground surface. The
dynamic soil properties for the data base come from several sources: the
laboratory test program; data and soil samples provided by local sources; and
field work to collect special soil samples. The data have many applications in
earthquake hazard mitigation, including the design of earthquake resistant
structures, the retrofit of existing structures, and revision of the current
building codes for the urban development projects in the Mid-south.
