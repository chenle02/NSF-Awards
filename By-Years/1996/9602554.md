The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB) conducts research and offers
courses on the biology of marine organisms. Resident and visiting faculty,
postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduates use the teaching
and research laboratories year round. A seawater water system is essential to
the function of a marine station such as OIMB; it permits researchers and
instructors to work with live organisms. Currently any growth in the OIMB
programs is limited by the amount of seawater that can be stored for use in the
teaching and research labs, and the amount of wet laboratory space available for
research activities. In this project OIMB will construct a 480 square foot wet
lab annex to house new seawater tables space and incubators, and a 30,000 gallon
concrete seawater storage tank. This would allow an almost doubling of the
amount of seawater that could be stored, thus permitting an expansion of
research and teaching activities. It would also provide additional seawater
table space in an aquarium annex to be built adjacent to the research building.
