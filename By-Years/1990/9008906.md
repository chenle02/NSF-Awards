This project is a renewal of an investigation into the large-scale and mesoscale
dynamics of the eastern Weddell Gyre, dealing with the analysis of a data set
obtained on an extensive cruise to the Weddell Sea in the austral winter 1989 in
a cooperative program with the West German Polar Institute, and the USSR Arctic
and Antarctic Research Institute. The cruise generated a substantial body of
data on the structure of the upper ocean in winter to complement the existing
body of data on summer conditions. Oceanographically the Weddell Gyre acts as a
primary area of deep water mass formation and ocean ventilation. Maud Rise, a
seamount in the eastern Weddell Sea, introduces topographically determined
dynamics which appear to control the occasional formation of the Weddell
Polynya, a large area of open water where normally winter sea ice is found. An
understanding of these effects is necessary to determine the nature of such
important phenomena as water mass modification, maintenance of fronts, deep
ocean ventilation, sea ice distribution, and climate modification. This renewal
phase of the project includes the completion of data processing, and the
synthesis of the data set which will provide a basic description of the Southern
Ocean thermohaline and chemical stratification under the sea ice cover from its
outer fringes to the coast of Antarctica. Several tasks will be undertaken: the
mapping and description of the full water column winter stratification of the
Weddell Gyre, the study of the entrainment of deep water into the winter mixed
layer in various sub-regions of the gyre, and the study of the oceanography
associated with Maud Rise, specifically the initiating of strong upwelling and
its effect in producing the periodically forming Weddell Polynya.
