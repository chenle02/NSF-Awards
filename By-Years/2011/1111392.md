The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry
Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Nicholas Turro of
Columbia University, who will study electronic and nuclear spin pair recognition
in supramolecular systems, specifically hydrogen and water molecules
encapsulated inside fullerenes ("buckyballs"). The synthetic and spectroscopic
investigations in this work will determine how, on the atomic level, two or more
small molecules recognize and communicate with each other. The novelty of the
approach in this work is to create strong spin polarization in the encapsulated
molecules, to enhance the sensitivity of the magnetic resonance signals.
Professor Turro's group also plans to label mRNA in living cells in a unique
way, with fluorescent quantum dots.

Professor Turro has a keen interest in attracting young people to science, and
to chemistry in particular. He and his research group have developed websites,
instructional videos and books to enhance chemical knowledge across all age
groups. He has multiple long-standing collaborations with scientists from all
corners of the globe, and he has established a multi-user-friendly shared
instrumentation laboratory for spin chemistry and physical organic chemistry
studies at Columbia.
