This project will extend a long-term program to measure trends of atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in seawater, and their
13C/12C isotopic ratios. These measurements, that date back several decades,
will be used along with other climatic data, such as satellite-borne radiometric
data of greenness of land vegetation, to estimate net exchanges of CO2 between
the oceans, the atmosphere, and the terrestrial biosphere. This research is
relevant to understanding the impacts of climate and human activities on the
global carbon cycle. Data collected as part of this project will become part of
the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) data archive.
