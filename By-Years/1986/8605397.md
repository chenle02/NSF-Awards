This work is concerned with the development of a prototype computer-integrated
cell for die manufacturing. This research employs a novel technique of utilizing
a robot to perform the die polishing process, Such a cell should result in
automation of the die manufacturing process, which is currently accomplished by
skilled tool and die makers who are becoming less available.
