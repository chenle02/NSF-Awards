9360024 Drory This objective of this research is to develop a novel interlayer
to allow diamond coatings of higher quality than has previously been achieved to
be deposited on steel substrates. Steels present a particularly difficult
material for depositing high quality diamond coatings onto because of chemical
incompatibility and the large difference in thermal expansion coefficients. The
emphasis in the proposed work is to use a metal interlayer between the diamond
coating and the steel substrate to alleviate these difficulties. The mechanical
properties of coated test specimens will be determined. Friction and wear
testing will be performed along with measurement of the coating cracking stress,
interface fracture toughness and substrate yield strength. ***
