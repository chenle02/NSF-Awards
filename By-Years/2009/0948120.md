This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports infrastructure
upgrades at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) that will ensure the
viability of current NRAO assets for supporting research by the ground-based
radio astronomical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of $5.4M is awarded
to address infrastructure problems associated with facility maintenance,
operational efficiency, energy conservation, and modernization. These activities
will improve the longevity of government-owned facilities, reduce the cost of
facility operations, enhance energy conservation, improve the safety of visiting
scientists, staff and visitors, and improve the quality and quantity of data
acquired with the telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NRAO facilities are used by
the US astronomical community to address outstanding problems in forefront
astronomical research. Through these upgrades, NRAO?s ability to support this
research will be substantially enhanced. &lt;br/&gt;
