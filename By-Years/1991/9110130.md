People define themselves in part in terms of the groups or categories to which
they belong, e.g. as women, attorneys, African-Americans, or parents. These
group memberships, or social identities, motivate people's behavior and
influence the way they react to others. Important distinctions exist among
identities, however. Two ways in which identities differ are: (1) whether an
identity is ascribed, such as gender or ethnicity, or achieved, such as an
occupation or a parent role; and (2) whether the identity is enacted primarily
in the private or in the public domain. Six studies, using a combination of
laboratory experiments and structured interviews, will explore the implications
of these differences for self-evaluation, group evaluation, and interaction with
others. The overall goal is to understand how various forms of identity relate
to each other and what characteristics of group membership are important for
what forms of social activity.
