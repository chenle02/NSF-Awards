The purpose of this proposal is to provide financial support for selected US
participants, primarily beginning researchers showing great promise, to attend
the July 2005 summer school in mathematical statistical physics at the well-
known conference center of les Houches in France. Some of the speakers and their
topics are B. Duplantier and W. Werner on conformal invariance, F. Guerra on
disordered systems, K. Johansson on random matrices, A.-S. Sznitman on random
walks in random environments, A.D. Sokal on Monte Carlo simulations, and A.-L.
Barabasi on complex networks.

The July 2005 school in Les Houches, France, for advanced graduate students,
postdocs, and junior faculty, will focus on a variety of models involving
randomness that have been of intense interest in recent years among both
mathematicians and physicists. The financial support that will be made available
to young US researchers will make possible their participation, which can be
expected to have a major impact on their careers, and hence on the
continuedleadership role of the US in this area. For European participants,
support is available from the European Science Foundation; the main objective of
this proposal is to ensure that US based junior researchers do not miss this
opportunity because of lack of support.
