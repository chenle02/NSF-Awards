In terms of disease transmission male and female mosquitoes could not be more
different. Female mosquitoes require a blood-meal to develop eggs and in the
process of feeding transmit disease to millions annually. In stark contrast,
male mosquitoes are harmless because they do not blood feed. Thus, sex
determination in mosquitoes is of great interest. Recently, a gene, Nix, was
identified as the dominant male-determining factor in the Yellow fever mosquito.
Nix was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for male development. This
raises the question of whether it is possible to use Nix in vector control
strategies to convert deadly female mosquitoes into harmless males. Nix has also
been identified in the Asian tiger mosquito but its function remains unknown.
The Asian tiger mosquito is the major vector of Dengue fever in southern China
and has lately expanded its range to Europe and North America. This project will
investigate whether Nix functions as the male-determining factor in the Asian
tiger mosquito. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Xiao-
guang Chen, a preeminent mosquito researcher in China, at the Southern Medical
University in Guangzhou China. The collaboration with Dr. Chen will allow the
function of Nix to be tested in the Guangzhou strain of the Asian tiger mosquito
and may pave the way for novel mosquito control measures.

The function of Nix in the Asian tiger mosquito will be tested through knock-out
with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and ectopic expression of native Nix. To assess
whether Nix functions as the male-determining factor in the Asian tiger
mosquito, morphology of the sexually dimorphic antenna and genitals will be
documented after knock-out and ectopic expression. The isoforms of two key genes
that regulate downstream sexual differentiation will also be monitored to assess
the effect of Nix on sex determination. This NSF EAPSI award supports the
research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the
Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.
