This project provides a computer lab for students which will enable them to
experience the impact on the national economy of various changes in national
policy. The Department of Economics at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh is
extending its strategy of providing computer simulations of economics in its
core courses to its macro principles and intermediate macro theory sections.
Using a high quality spreadsheet and the fine resolution of the Apple Macintosh
computer, student imputed changes impact the simulated economy. The software and
department-developed templates provide an easy way for students to record both
the numerical impact and graphic illustration of their policy changes.
