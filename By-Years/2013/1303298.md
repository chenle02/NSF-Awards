This project is devoted to studies of zonotopal algebra and its combinatorial
applications. The methodology of zonotopal algebra is already known to play a
role in Approximation Theory (box splines), Commutative Algebra (fat point
ideals, Cox rings), Enumerative Combinatorics (matroids and simplicial
complexes), Convex Geometry (zonotopes and hyperplane arrangements), Graph
Theory (Tutte polynomials, parking functions), and Algebraic Geometry
(hyperkaehler toric varieties, de Concini-Procesi wonderful models). This
project seeks to advance the theory of zonotopal algebra in the following three
ways: (1) develop a discrete counterpart to the existing continuous theory, (2)
apply zonotopal algebra to problems of algebraic and enumerative combinatorics,
(3) build the infrastructure for larger-scale collaboration on the
subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort should advance an important
area at the crossroads of pure and applied mathematics. Results of this research
may also have applications to the mathematics of large networks and traffic
flow, including wireless communication, problems of statistical mechanics,
scheduling, logistics and discrete optimization. The project will involve
graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in and outside UC Berkeley. Junior
participants will be encouraged to interact with each another within a research
seminar at UC Berkeley as well as with more senior experts in the field during
mutual collaboration visits. This should contribute to the integration of
research training and education.&lt;br/&gt;
