0330588&lt;br/&gt;Emmermann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On February 26, 1996, the
National Science Foundation and the GeoForschungsZentrum-Potsdam (GFZ) signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on "Implementation , Management and Operation
of the ICDP". This MOU is an Annex to the Agreement between the NSF and the
Federal Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Technology of the Federal
Republic of Germany (BMBF) on "Cooperation in Research in the Geosciences". The
original MOU was in force for five years and was renewed for an additional five
years (until August 31, 2007) in September, 2002 (see enclosed extension
0330588).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the MOU is to specify the terms by
which the NSF and GFZ shall cooperate in the scientific planning, management and
operation of an earth science research program of scientific drilling on the
continents. One of the terms specifies the funding arrangements agreed to by the
parties. In particular, article 5 (1) states that: "Each party agrees to provide
funding for the overall scientific planning, management, operation and
management of the ICDP in the amount of $700,000 per annum, subject to the
availability of funds. The annual membership fee shall be paid to the Executive
Agency for transfer to the Operational Support Group (OSG) and will be
commingled to provide the base funding for the ICDP. The annual contribution of
$700,000 shall be paid in US dollars for five years duration of the MOU." The
National Science Board in its May, 1996 meeting approved the ICDP (see copies of
NSB Memorandum (NSB-96-68) and Minutes of the 336th Meeting (NSB-96-87)).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides the funds for the US
membership fee to ICDP for the period 2003 -2007.&lt;br/&gt;
