Dr. Robert Liu and other members of the Chemistry Department at the University
of Hawaii at Manoa are being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
research projects on topics ranging from natural products to materials science,
environmental and geochemistry and biomolecular structures and functions. In
addition to students from the Manoa campus, participants will be drawn from
surrounding colleges in the State of Hawaii and the territory of Guam, with
particular emphasis on attracting minority students to careers in science.
