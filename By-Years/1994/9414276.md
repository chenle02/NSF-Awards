This project will continue the acquisition and archiving of polar orbiting
satellite images of the Antarctic environment by the Arctic and Antarctic
Research Center (AARC) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for two years.
Satellite tracking facilities have been established by the AARC at McMurdo and
Palmer Station, Antarctica, which record and archive images from the NOAA series
of polar orbiting satellites and from the Department of Defense DMSP series of
satellites. The AARC presently maintains an archive of more than 14,000
satellite overpasses and the regional coverage includes all of Antarctica and
much of the Southern Ocean. These data are used to support such Antarctic
operational activities as the navigation of research vessels in Antarctic waters
and weather forecasting for air operations, as well as the geophysical and
environmental research projects of polar scientists worldwide. ***
