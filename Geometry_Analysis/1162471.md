In the current project the PI intends to explore some open problems about self-
similar fractals and related geometric structures. The fractals considered often
arise from the dynamics of groups or the dynamics of maps under iteration, and
often a better understanding of their quasiconformal geometry is of crucial
relevance. Specific topics for investigation include the geometry of Sierpinski
carpets, dynamics of expanding Thurston maps, and instances of entropy rigidity
in coarse and metric geometry.

Fractal and self-similar features can be seen in many natural phenomena such as
coast- and fault lines, snowflakes and crystal growth, electric discharge or
plant growth patterns. This projects intends to contribute to the development of
basic methods and tools that are necessary for a deeper understanding of such
structures. An important part of this activity is the involvement of young
researchers. The goal is to provide them with the mathematical expertise
necessary for independent investigations of fractal phenomena.
