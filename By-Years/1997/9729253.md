The authors are developing techniques for use of a geometric relationship
between hotspots and the seamounts producted by them that allows the authors to
decouple the age-progression from the geometry and accurately determine hotspot
locations on the basis of seamount locations alone. They propose to compile a
seamount location database and fully develop the technique to address a number
of questions. How many hotspots are there? Are hotspots stationary? Which
seamounts were created by hotspots? Where are extinct hotspots? What is the
temporal and spatial record of intraplate volcanism? Are hotspot fluxes steady?
How accurately can absolute plate motions be resolved?
