The principal investigators seek to elucidate detailed velocity-concentration
statistics in a chemically reacting flow via a combined approach of experimental
investigation and mathematical analogy. It has direct relevance to many
technologies, automotive, energy, petrochemical, environmental and pollution
control, etc. These technologies permeate 18 of the top 20 of the Fortune 500
companies. The novelty of this research is in the use of extended analyogy
between measurable joint concentration statistics and the statistics of
unmeasurable concentrations in the smae turbulenc. It has a number of "firsts",
not the least of which is its applicability to any complex geometry including
flow recirculation and turbulence modification (due to reaction).
