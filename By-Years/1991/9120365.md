This action funds an Interagency agreement with the Bureau of the Census to
support a pretest of the 1993 postcensal survey of college graduates. The
postcensal survey collects data on education, training and employment related to
science and engineering from a nationally representative sample of persons with
bachelor's degrees (or higher). These data are used in NSF's Scientific and
Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS).
