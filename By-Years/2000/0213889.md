With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, Prof. Andrey F. Vilesov of the University of Southern California will
develop a state-of-the-art pulsed helium droplet spectrometer. He will develop
and optimize experimental methods for the generation of pulsed (50-100
microseconds) helium droplet beams in order to achieve a factor of 100 - 10,000
higher intensity as compared to contemporary continuous-wave beams. To fully
exploit this advantage, he will mate the developed source with other modern
pulsed experimental techniques such as infrared depletion spectroscopy, laser-
induced fluorescence, laser photolysis, laser ablation, and time-of-flight (TOF)
mass spectroscopy. This will facilitate new experiments involving helium
droplets, such as (i) studies of large bio-molecules; (ii) assembly and
interrogation of large metal and molecular clusters; (iii) pump-probe
experiments; (iv) studies of photochemical reactions; and (v) generation and use
of very large droplets containing over 100 million atoms. This development will
help to establish He droplet spectroscopy as a versatile new tool, will make it
cost-effective, and will make the technique immediately accessible to mainstream
scientists. The ultimate goal is the development of a pulsed helium droplet beam
apparatus based on a closed-cycle refrigerator, equipped with pulsed infrared
laser and a TOF mass spectrometer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students will
be involved in all phases, and will use the instrument as a training ground
prior to integrating the pulsed nozzle in their own experiments. This system
will enable advances to be achieved that are not presently possible. Other
chemists interested in spectroscopy, analytics and low temperature chemical
reactivity and dynamics can also benefit greatly from this user-friendly and
cost-effective source. Utilization to more applied areas such as interrogation
of large biomolecules or development of new nano-materials is anticipated.
