This proposal seeks to establish an undergraduate instructional laboratory for
programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The laboratory trains students in the
specification, installation and use of PLCs and thus better equips the students
to be productive in the present day environment of industrial automation. The
laboratory is interdisciplinary in nature, serving the needs of both industrial
and mechanical engineering students. The equipment consists of five PLC trainer
modules called simulators, a sixth PLC for actual control of cell simulation
modules, manufacturing cell simulation modules, and a microcomputer to act as a
dedicated server to the PLC network. Students are taught the basics of PLC
programming, the programs checked out in the simulation mode by downloading the
programs to the 5 PLC simulators through the network server, and finally
downloaded into the sixth PLC, which will be in control of the manufacturing
cell simulation modules.
