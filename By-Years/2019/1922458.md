The Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting will be held in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from October 16-19, 2019, and anticipating over 4,500
participants. The meeting will feature 19 Program Tracks with the theme
"Connecting Communities: Bioengineering Locally and Globally". The goal of the
meeting is to encourage innovative learning that promotes inclusion from
underrepresented populations within the biomedical engineering community, and
opportunities that support research in both academia and industry. NSF funds
will support networking and small group interactions and will promote increased
knowledge of educational opportunities and pathways to success in biomedical
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for several
competitive travel grant programs as well as professional development activities
targeted at underrepresented groups and those that may not otherwise be able to
participate in the conference. The competitive travel grant programs include: 12
students research awards, 40 career development awards for graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty and professionals from
underrepresented populations in BME, including junior faculty; and 20 NSBE
members interested in biomedical engineering. Additionally, funding is required
for a High School Expo program for students from schools that might not have a
STEM curriculum. Finally, funding from NSF will be used to support 15 high
school students with chaperones in this activity. Over four days, the 2019
meeting will feature 19 Program Tracks with approximately 950 oral presentations
and more than 2,000 poster presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
