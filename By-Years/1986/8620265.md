Lightwave technology is playing a major and expanding role, especially in
optical communications, based on the success of optical fibers, diode lasers,
and efficient detectors. The research effort proposed here concentrates on the
most recent area of lightwave technology, namely all- optical logic. Based upon
an area called nonlinear optics one light beam is able to control another,
sometimes much more rapidly than can be accomplished with electronics. Decision-
making capability is thereby added to the transformation and beam-direction
capabilities of traditional linear optics. The present effort is by one of the
groups which has pioneered the use of optics to do logic operations. Such
efforts it can be hoped will eventually result in optical processing units which
will rival some of the electronic counterparts or processing units with
functions uniquely suited to optics.
