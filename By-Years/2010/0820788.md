This exploratory project involves qualitative research on the impact of green
built technologies on subjective experience of health and well-being of users.
Observations and interviews with residents are conducted on two communities. In
one, buildings were designed with "green" technologies with an objective of
making the community environmentally and socially sustainable. In the other,
social and environmental sustainability are emphasized, but buildings were not
built with green technologies. Through the comparative design, the PI identifies
key differences in people's perception of their health and well-being. This
information will be used to develop a more extensive study of a larger sample of
communities. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its identification of
the pathways through which people are satisfied or unsatisfied with socially and
environmentally sustainable living and the effect that green technology has on
satisfaction. The broader impacts lie in the study's contribution to the design
of environmentally and socially sustainable communities identifying the factors
that create the highest degree of satisfaction among its residents.
