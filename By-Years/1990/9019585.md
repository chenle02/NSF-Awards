The research planned is to analyze specific representative enzymes in the
daunomycin biosynthetic pathway to determine their substrate specificity,
kinetics, and regulation as part of an assessment of possible differential
regulation of the first one-half of the pathway in relation to the second one-
half; such differential regulation may account for the failure of biosynthetic
intermediates to be converted to the end-product antibiotic and, instead, to
accumulate in cells. Molecular biological and genetic approaches will be
employed to determine transcriptional and translational regulation of each
enzyme in the pathway that has been purified, kinetics, etc., determined, so as
to enlarge our understanding of the physiological and molecular genetic aspects
of the regulation of the synthesis of this antibiotic, a product of secondary
metabolite syntheses. Antibiotic synthesis and excretion is a characteristic of
many bacteria and fungi and is a product of their "secondary metabolism"; the
regulation of this type of metabolism is even less well understood than is
central metabolism, and this project is directed at elucidating regulatory
aspects of the secondary metabolism of a bacterium producing the antibiotic,
daunomycin; this antibiotic's precursors accumulate in the producing cells
rather than being converted entirely into the antibiotic; understanding what is
responsible for this inefficiency may permit developments to improve the
conversion and increase effectiveness of antibiotic production.
