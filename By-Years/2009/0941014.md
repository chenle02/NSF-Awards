This project continues the work of the AERA Grants Program, which provides
competitive research grants to both doctoral students and education research
scientists who conduct secondary analyses of large-scale national and
international data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES). The project also will carry out two new strands of work: (1) through a
partnership with the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in
Education Research, managed by the Urban Institute, the project enables access
to and use of state longitudinal data bases for scientific research on student
learning, performance, and achievement in STEM; and (2) a programmatic component
to foster secondary analysis of data emerging from NSF-funded investigator-
initiated STEM projects that have opportunities for further discovery will be
explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AERA Grants Program seeks to increase the
capacity of the STEM education field to conduct high quality research using
large-scale data sets through its grants, the findings from workshops, and the
publications resulting from "think tank" activities that explore critical issues
in STEM education research.
