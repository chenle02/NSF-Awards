Zoos have the opportunity to reach a large audience and to improve public
understanding of biological principles. Zoos can go beyond creating an
appreciation for nature by actively encouraging their visitors to apply these
principles and take action on behalf of the environment. Tropic World: A
Primate's View will improve the interpretation of an existing exhibit at
Brookfield Zoo by encouraging visitors to experience a tropical rainforest from
a non-human primate's perspective. Visitors will be challenged, by interactive
forms of interpretation, to explore the similarities and differences between
themselves and other primates. This experience will provide a framework for
visitors to consider their own relationship with their environment. The project
objectives are: 1. To improve public understanding that , like all organisms,
primates use and depend on their environment. However, humans ar the only
primate species that can choose how they impact their environment over extended
time and space. 2. to motivate people to act on behalf of the natural world
through conservation. 3. To contribute to the body of knowledge of how informal
education affects people's knowledge of natural science topics, as well as the
behavior of people in relation to conservation issues.
