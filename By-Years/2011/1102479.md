During magnetic reconnection, the energy stored in magnetic fields is quickly
tapped and converted into heat and kinetic energy, in a process analogous to a
magnetic explosion. Reconnection is thought to power many astrophysical events
including solar flares and Earth's auroras, as well as play an important role in
laboratory fusion experiments. Although the basic workings of magnetic
reconnection are well-understood, a long-standing puzzle has existed as to the
precise process that provides the spark triggering the explosion. Advances in
computer power have recently made it possible to model magnetic reconnection in
three dimensions and allow this work to answer the
question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By tapping the energy of magnetic fields,
reconnection in the solar corona and solar wind drives space weather, the
changing of environmental conditions in near-Earth space. Space weather, in
turn, has profound influences on topics as diverse as passenger radiation
exposure on polar flights, communications satellite lifetimes, and the stability
of electrical power grids. Exploring the dynamics of reconnection and, in
particular, understanding the processes that allow reconnection to occur thus
has broad importance for society.
