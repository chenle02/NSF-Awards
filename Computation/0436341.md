An interdisciplinary team of investigators carry out an undergraduate training
initiative at Arizona State University. The training plan intimately combines
new cross-disciplinary courses and summer research programs. The former are
constructed to allow maximal participation among undergraduate cadres, and
facilitate life science majors to achieve a minor in mathematics, and, likewise,
mathematics majors to enrich their education with a minor in bioscience. The
summer research program is a competitive enterprise involving at least eight ASU
faculty members from life sciences, mathematics, and biophysics. Research
projects span modeling of ecological and evolutionary processes through the new
lens of stoichiometric constraints, bio-economics, chemostat theory, and
modeling of visual perception.

This project has potential to make broad impact in both local and global
education environs. Regarding the former, the ASU UBM team is truly
interdisciplinary, with members in mathematics, biology and biophysics,
exceptionally well suited for interdisciplinary training for undergraduates in
biological and mathematical sciences. Its collaborative efforts can provide
undergraduate and graduate students of diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds with
first-hand educational experience in cross-disciplinary communication and
exploration. As for global impact, the proposed holistic approach (involving
mathematical biology courses at various levels and summer research projects) in
mathematical biology training can vertically integrate all the components in the
ASU education system. It is therefore expected that this proposed program may
yield many invaluable lessons to serve mathematical bioscience education and
research nationwide, enriching the experience for the next generation of
students in this integrative and interdisciplinary scientific endeavor.
