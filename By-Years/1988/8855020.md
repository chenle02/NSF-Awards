Twenty high school juniors and seniors will each complete four experimental
psychology projects. Each project will have its own preparation and methodology
component, hands-on procedure, data analysis, and written and oral presentation.
Participants will discuss career opportunities in experimental psychology and
related fields with staff and visitors. Ethical and philosophical issues will be
taken up in general sessions, and in the specific environments of the four
experimental projects. Participants will have exclusive use of unusually well-
equipped laboratories.
