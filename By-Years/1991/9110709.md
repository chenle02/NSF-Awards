A well-designed database must balance security-control and operational
efficiency. Consequently, the principal objective is to develop a design theory
for multilevel databases unifying security (access-control and inference-
control) and efficiency aspects in a dynamic environment. This project
identifies the key constraints imposed by these aspects and formulates practical
guidelines for database design. Emphasis is placed on data dependencies
fundamental to inference-control and anomaly- elimination. The approach employed
deals with a lattice-theoretic relational model enforcing database security by
abstracting or clouding sensitive information in user views. The model uses
"contexts" constructed from natural equivalences. Contexts induce multilevel
relations capable of holding abstraction, and support a rich and highly secure
data language. Contexts also incorporate semantics in abstraction; this helps
balance user convenience and database security. The lattice-theoretic framework
simplifies the investigation; classical design issues are also readily mapped to
their multilevel formulations. The investigation also focuses on an Oracle
implementation of the security-control model. Special consideration is given to
implementing the query-handling facility. The results of this research will have
a significant impact on the design of databases handling abstract information,
and particularly those supporting AI and expert systems applications, as robust
and efficient security-control is a critical issue facing database and
knowledge-base designers. //
