0214870&lt;br/&gt;Brantingham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 36-month AWARE
project submitted by Dr. Jeffery Brantingham, Santa Fe Institute with Professor
MA Haizhou, Qinghai Institute of Salt Lakes, Xinning, China, to study the
Pleistocene hunter-gatherers of the Tibetan Plateau, and to provide an REU
training opportunity for six "exceptional" U.S. undergraduate students. This is
an excellent proposal to understand late Pleistocene human colonization and
adaptation to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. This study nicely integrates
archeological, paleo-environmental, and geochronological research strategies to
answer questions of broad importance in the study of evolution of behaviorally
modern humans. This project provides excellent opportunities for U.S.
undergraduate students to be trained in archeology and to learn to carry out
field research in the western part of China. It also develops paleoclimatic
proxy records that can be integrated into regional and global models of climate
variability and change. The NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly
support this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
