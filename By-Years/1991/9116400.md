This grant supports the travel of two minority high school students and their
chaperon from Benjamin Banneker High School in Washington, DC to the Computer
Museum in Boston, MA. The purpose of the trip is to reward the winners of the
NSF/Banneker Computer Contest with an experience which exposes them to
scientists and new technology in the computer and information sciences. Benjamin
Banneker High School is the NSF partnership school. During the six weeks prior
to National Science and Technology Week a computer programming contest was
conducted at Benjamin Banneker High School. The contest was open to all students
and about 20 participated. There were five finalists and two were selected by a
panel of judges from NSF as grand prize winners. Dr. Strimpel of the Computer
Museum will host the visit. The students will be given a tour of the Museum
facilities as well as the Boston University Center for Computational Science,
where they will meet several people working in computational science.//
