A new approach known as the Source Galerkin method for Quantum Field Theory
will be pursued. Source Galerkin, unlike current Monte Carlo based techniques,
explicitly uses spacetime and internal symmetries of a system to pose the
problem of solution so as to allow considerable analytic input. The complexity
of this requires one to use computer algebra to generate the equations coded for
computation on Cray's and CM-2's. Results have been sensationally good with many
orders of magnitude improvement in speed and accuracy compared to Monte Carlo.
Source Galerkin has the property that fermions and bosons can be treated (aside
from commutation) in a symmetric manner. It is not necessary to solve a fermion
problem exactly for any given boson configuration as with Monte Carlo.
Consequently, problems involving dynamical fermions are no harder than those
with bosons. Problems of physical significance will be analyzed with Source
Galerkin methods during this research. We expect to examine Hubbard models for
high temperature superconductivity without a "sign problem". We anticipate
obtaining valid dynamical results in Lattice QCD. While it is certain that
teraflop technology will still allow only a limited class of results for
conventional QCD, it is possible that these new ideas will allow us to obtain
predictive and valid QCD results.
