regimes--defined as democracy, autocracy, and bureaucracy--affect the aggregate
economic size of governments, and 2) whether government size has consequences
for economic performance, measured in terms of growth, consumption, investment,
inflation, and population dynamics. The impact of different types of democratic
institutions, mainly parliamentarism and presidentialism, is also distinguished
The emphasis is placed on the objectives of governments and the mechanisms of
accountability they face under different political institutions. Empirical
predictions concerning the size of government and economic performance are
derived from a formal model. These predictions are tested, using data for 139
countries between 1950 and 1990, by estimating the probability that incumbents
lose office as a result of bad economic performance and by estimating equations
which relate government size to economic performance. The analysis is conducted
separately for each type of political institution, taking account of the fact
that regimes are endogenous with regard to economic performance. The project
will elucidate the impact of political institutions on the accountability of
governments and on their economic behavior. In particular, it will assess
whether democracy can be expected to generate better economic policies and
better performance than different types of dictatorship and whether different
democratic institutions affect policies and performance. These results have
direct consequences for issues of institutional engineering, particularly
applicable to new democracies. ***
