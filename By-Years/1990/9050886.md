This award provides funds to support microcomputer-based instrumentation to
modernize the introductory human physiology laboratory program at San Diego
State University. The specific equipment includes microcomputer stations
equipped with general purpose analog input/output laboratory interfaces and
appropriate commercial software for data acquisition and reduction. The
equipment will be used for acquisition and display of data in on- line
experiments, for interactive graphics simulations of processes which are
difficult or impossible to implement in the laboratory, for reduction and
analysis of data previously acquired or provided by the instructor, and for
software tutorials and instructional supplements dealing with the laboratory
experiments and related lecture materials. This project provides several
enhancements to the conventional introductory physiology laboratory experience:
(1) student focus can be shifted away from monitoring the recording equipment
and analyzing manually plotted data, toward a greater understanding of the
physiological process under investigation, by utilizing modern data acquisition
and reduction methods; (2) interactive animated color graphics simulations offer
a self-paced, interactive alternative to conventional laboratory courses, or the
need for use of live animals and potentially dangerous reagents; and (3) student
comprehension of concepts and principles difficult or impossible to observe
directly at the laboratory bench can be enhanced.
