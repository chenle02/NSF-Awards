The proposed project is on approximation of operator functions, whose prototype
in the case of functions of a scalar argument is the Taylor polynomial
approximation. Values of operator functions do not commute in general, which
makes the analysis of such functions and, in particular, their approximations
much subtler than in the classical case. Under certain assumptions, traces of
the remainders of the first and second order approximations can be represented
via spectral shift functions, which originate from Lifshits' work on the quantum
theory of crystals in 1952. While higher order Taylor-type approximations are
also of interest in applications (for instance, in perturbation theory for
Schrodinger operators with long-range potentials), very little is known about
the structure of their error terms. The project will concentrate on the study of
the higher order Taylor-type approximations, in particular, on testing
Koplienko's conjecture of 1984 on existence of higher order spectral shift
measures.

Perturbation theory has originated as mathematical modeling of some problems of
quantum mechanics, where physical quantities are described by self-adjoint
operators acting on a separable Hilbert space. The change of a value of an
operator function under a perturbation of its argument is reflected in the
spectral shift functions. A comprehensive theory with various applications,
including those to perturbation theory for Schrodinger operators, scattering
theory, and spectral flow, has been constructed for these functions. Finding
higher order analogs of the spectral shift functions is one of the goals of the
project. Many operators can be naturally affiliated with von Neumann algebras
(for instance, the integrated density of states for some operators can be
expressed in terms of the corresponding von Neumann algebras). We will work in
both the original and the von Neumann algebra setting of the perturbation
theory.
