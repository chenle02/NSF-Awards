The Environmental Stress Response (ESR) is a large gene expression program that
is initiated when cells are exposed to stress. Although the response has been
observed in many gene expression studies, the role of the program is still
unknown. It has been hypothesized that the ESR is involved in acquired stress
resistance, in which cells that are exposed to a low dose of stress become
resistant to an otherwise-lethal dose of a second unrelated stress. This project
will test the role of the ESR in acquired stress resistance in yeast. The first
phase of the project will use molecular biology techniques to characterize the
determinants of acquired stress resistance, including the specificity of
acquired resistance, the required doses of initial stress exposure, and the
kinetics of the response. The second phase of the project will use DNA
microarrays and computational analysis to identify gene expression changes that
correlate temporally with the kinetics of acquired stress resistance. Finally,
the role that ESR plays in this phenomenon will be tested by assessing the
ability of a mutant strain defective in ESR initiation to acquire stress
resistance.
