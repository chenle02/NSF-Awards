The development of stronger and tougher structural materials requires a better
understanding between macroscopic measures of ductility and microstructural
mechanisms of the fracture process. This is a research topic which is of growing
importance as the limitations of continuum mechanics in the microscale has been
recognized. The research investigates micromechanical modelling of the fracture
process. The approach involves constitutive descriptions of nucleation, growth
and coalescence of micro voids. Of particular importance in the void nucleation
by particle decohesion and the mechanisms of void coalescence. Large scale
numerical analyses will be employed to carry the micromodelling into the
macroscale where comparisons can be made with observations of ductile behavior
in fracture. The principal investigator has an international reputation for his
work in numerical simulation of ductile fracture. This research program provides
an opportunity to extend the modelling of the fracture process into the
microscale. An award is recommended.
