9508024 Tauxe The PIs will extend their experimental and numerical
characterization of hysteresis loops for geological materials from single
domain/superparamagnetic systems to other paleomagnetically meaningful systems.
In this way they will provide the necessary foundation to allow inversion of
hysteresis loops for the rich treasure of information concerning coercivity and
domain state that lies within the minerals. ****
