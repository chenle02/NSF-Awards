9500289 Okogbaa This research project focuses on the problem of preventive
maintenance for complex systems under transient state. The goal is to develop
models and algorithms useful for operating and characterizing a preventive
maintenance system. In particular, the following objectives are pursued to
realize the set goal: (1) develop techniques for characterizing failures and
renewal process distributions for complex multi-unit systems with emphasis on
systems transient phenomenon and the aging process; (2) construct analytical
models based on transient formulation using renewal and semi-regenerative
processes with maintenance cost consideration; (3) explore the convexity of the
resulting transcendental functions using optimization techniques and heuristics
with the aim of minimizing maintenance costs; (4) develop a set of cost boundary
indices to assist in analyzing the reasonableness and sensitivity of the cost
options; and (5) test and verify the sensitivity and endurance of the models and
the algorithms using discrete event simulation. Actual industrial data will be
used in the testing and validation of the models. Many man-made systems today
are characterized by mechanical, electrical, and electronic components that are
highly integrated to produce a working system. With high integration also comes
increased vulnerability to failure due to the malfunctioning of individual or
groups of components in the system. A reliable and workable preventive
maintenance program ensures a high run time for machines and a more productive
system. Increased productivity is essential for economic competitiveness both
for a company and to a nation. If successful, the tools developed as part of
this research will contribute to the realization of effective preventive
maintenance programs. Given the critical need to keep systems running and
prevent catastrophic failures, research in this area has much to offer to the
industrial world.
