This project defines meaningful notions of confidence in prediction, designs
procedures for computing such notions, and applies these procedures to core
machine learning tasks such as active learning, crowd-sourced learning, and
tracking. In many applications it is helpful to have classifiers that output,
together with each prediction, a rating of the confidence that the prediction is
in fact correct. Existing literature either provides various ad-hoc ways for
computing such ratings which typically lack a rigorous mathematical footing, or
provides mathematically consistent methods (in the Bayesian framework) for
computing confidence ratings under very strong assumptions that are unlikely to
hold in practice. The research team investigates methods of computing measures
of confidence that are mathematically rigorous while making minimal assumptions
on the way data is generated, and use these measures to further develop
solutions to core machine learning tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defining and
computing mathematically sound measures of confidence lies at the heart of
machine learning, pattern recognition and uncertainty in AI. Confidence-rated
prediction, active learning, and tracking are fundamental tasks of machine
learning and statistics that arise repeatedly in large-scale problems; this
project will develop rigorous solutions to these problems. The algorithms
developed in this work are tested and used in the Automatic Cameraman project,
an interactive, audio-visual installation in the UCSD Computer Science
department. The interactive Automatic Cameraman system are used an educational
tool to be extended in many different directions, by teams of students at a
variety of skill levels.
