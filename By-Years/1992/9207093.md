This award supports a conference entitled: "Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their
Representations". The conference will be a series of five seminar weekends, over
the course of the academic year, held at various campuses of the University of
California. The two objectives of the conference project are: 1. Fostering
interactions between institutions separated by significant physical distances;
2. Permitting exchange of ideas between UC faculty and students, on the one
hand, and several distinguished experts in Representation Theory, newly arrived
from the former Soviet Union. This format permits the entire California
mathematical community and its graduate students to take advantage of the
presence of these experts.
