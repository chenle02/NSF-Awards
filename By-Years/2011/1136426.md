Colorado State University-Pueblo (CSU-Pueblo) is strengthening 7-12 mathematics
achievement throughout the region of southeastern Colorado by providing
incentives and support to attract 19 junior and senior mathematics majors and 9
STEM professionals to the teaching profession. A long-standing and highly
effective collaboration among faculty in the Departments of Mathematics/Physics
and Teacher Education at CSU-Pueblo, faculty at 4 area community colleges, 2
local school districts, and 5 community partners is providing the Noyce Scholars
and STEM professionals with the strong content and pedagogical training required
to teach in high needs schools, and to be retained in the teaching profession
beyond their obligatory service period.

CSU-Pueblo, the only federally designated Hispanic serving university in
Colorado, is providing the majority of teachers to its service area. Many school
districts and communities within this service area are facing substantial
challenges, including low levels of family income and education, historically
poor achievement, and graduation rates that lag behind those in other parts of
the state. The enhanced mathematics education in the 7-12 classrooms in this
service area is providing underserved students the opportunity to have academic
success and to find a rewarding career in a STEM area.
