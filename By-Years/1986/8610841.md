The September 19, 1985 Mexico earthquake struck a large city with modern traffic
control systems and sizable car population. Thus, it is important to
investigate, synthesize, and learn from the transportation actions carried out
in Mexico City in the post-impact period of the earthquake. The main focus of
this study will be on transportation actions needed in the immediate, short-
term, and long-term periods after the earthquake in regard to the management and
operations of vehicular traffic, dispatching of emergency vehicles to disaster
sites, returning mass transit to normalcy, and evacuating people trapped in the
disaster areas to safe shelters.
