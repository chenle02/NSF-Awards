*** 9623979 Pestana The importance of a rational approach to understanding the
dynamic behavior of sands has grown with an increased awareness of the
relationship between local conditions and the dynamic loading resulting from
earthquakes. In particular, the experience and data gathered from the 1989 Loma
Prieta and 1995 Hyogoken-Nambu (Kobe) earthquakes clearly indicate that most of
the ground failures appear to have been the result of liquefaction of
cohesionless materials; predominantly loose, saturated hydraulically-placed
fills. Overall, liquefaction played an important role in the extensive damage
experienced by these port facilities. These events, including the October 1995
Mexico earthquake, are ever present and thus the need to quantify potential
damage and assess the risk associated with these natural hazards. The objectives
of this research program are: a) development of an advanced constitutive model
able to describe the observed behavior of cohesionless soils during cyclic
loading, and the evaluation of its performance through selected comparisons with
reliable laboratory data; b) implementation of this advanced soil model into a
finite element formulation with dynamic capabilities; and c) application to the
assessment of the seismic response of cohesionless soils thorough fundamental
parametric studies of soil-structure interaction, such as the performance of
deep foundations. The educational goals are: a) To foster the integration of
research and education; b) increase involvement of undergraduate students in
research; and c) maximize the exchange between education and engineering
practice and design. These goals are approached from the perspective of the
following important factors: a) Trends and innovative thinking in engineering
research; b) innovative instructional techniques; and c) involvement in the
engineering state-of-practice. The research will contribute to the fundamental
understanding and prediction of factors such as volume change, shear modulus,
dampin g and time effects during cyclic loading, and may be applicable to all
liquefiable soils. The incorporation of the constitutive model into a finite
element code to predict soil-structure interaction, including earthquake induced
permanent deformation, represents a significant contribution earthquake hazard
mitigation. The education program will foster the involvement of undergraduate
students in engineering design projects, and will encourage graduate students to
learn the fundamental concepts and make critical use of available tools and
techniques to succeed in their professional practice.***
