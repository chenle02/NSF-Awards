This project develops a new interdisciplinary control systems laboratory in the
Schools of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering at Oklahoma State University. This laboratory will consist of five
test benches networked to five workstations supporting real- time computer aided
software engineering (CASE) tools. Each test bench will have an experimental
control system and an embedded processor. There are several features of the
proposed lab which make it very interesting and unique. . It is
interdisciplinary, bringing together a significant amount of experience in
control and real-time systems from two different departments. . The equipment in
the lab will be state of the art, including real-time kernels, computer-aided-
design tools, and networking. An industrial advisory board will assist the
principal investigators in insuring that the lab maintains high standards in
this area. We want the laboratory experience to be consistent with the latest
industrial practice. . There will be a wide variety of challenging and visually
interesting systems to be controlled. Five such systems will be in the lab in
any one semester, but new systems will be rotated through the lab from one
semester to the next. . All of the systems to be controlled will be designed and
built by student teams from the undergraduate capstone design course. There will
be an on-going relationship between this lab and the capstone design course, as
new systems will be created each semester for the foreseeable future. A test of
this concept was conducted last semester, when a very successful system was
created by a capstone design team. The main idea will be to get students excited
about the design of control systems by giving them interesting and challenging
problems to solve, with the latest technology equipment.
