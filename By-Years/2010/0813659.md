Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0813659&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Frederick Wilhelm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial
support for US participation in a&lt;br/&gt;Workshop in Global Riemannian
Geometry to be held at the&lt;br/&gt;Instituto de Matematicas (Unidad
Cuernavaca) Universidad Nacional&lt;br/&gt;Autonoma de Mexico (IMATE-UNAM
Cuernavaca) in May 2008. The&lt;br/&gt;meeting will consist of two mini-courses
taught by Detlef&lt;br/&gt;Gromoll, Gerard Walschap, and Karsten Grove, plus
approximately&lt;br/&gt;eighteen research talks. The conference will be preceded
by an&lt;br/&gt;additional mini-course reviewing basic Riemannian geometry
to&lt;br/&gt;prepare student participants for the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims to disseminate knowledge of
recent progress&lt;br/&gt;in Riemannian geometry among junior participants, to
promote the&lt;br/&gt;involvement of female and minority researchers in the
subject, to&lt;br/&gt;strengthen the presence of Riemannian geometry in Mexico,
and to&lt;br/&gt;encourage collaborations between geometric researchers in
Mexico,&lt;br/&gt;other countries of Latin America, the United States, Canada,
and&lt;br/&gt;Europe. The workshop is receiving support from the
Clay&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Institute, CIMAT, CONACYT, the
International&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Union, and the IMATE-UNAM, as well as NSF.
