This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to support a
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Rice
University, entitled, "RET Site: Nanotechnology Research Experience for
Teachers", under the direction of Dr. Vicki Colvin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objectives of this RET in Engineering Program include enhancing the science and
engineering content knowledge and teaching skills of 35 Houston, Texas high
school teachers each year for three years. The site will combine a full semester
spring content course (CHEM 570) and summer internship, followed by a set of
school year activities to keep participants engaged with each other and with
Rice University. The participants will improve the quality of secondary school
science education through the development of inquiry-based learning activities
based on laboratory research and create a community of high school and higher
education teachers that can motivate secondary students towards careers in
science and engineering. The program is designed not only to facilitate teacher
professional development but to scale-up the research experience by forming a
network of master teachers that can train new teachers. Since the innovative
developments at the nanoscale are integrated across biology, physics and
chemistry, this program will provide teachers with new insights on basic science
that is also well-aligned with Texas State standards and targets underserved
teachers and schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rice University will work closely
with the Houston Independent School District (HISD), a large, urban, majority
historically underrepresented minority school district in South Texas. This year
long RET is designed to be scalable to have a large impact on science teaching
via community workshops for students and teachers.
