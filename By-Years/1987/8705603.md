This project will address three specific topics in the efficient implementation
of concurrent/distributed systems: - efficient multitasking for embedded on
generalized stack architectures: - using the notion of the global state of a
distributed program as a natural and efficient paradigm for distributed
programming; and - protocols for "eager" service in distributed systems.
