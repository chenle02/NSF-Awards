The proposed research is designed to study the atomic level structures and
dynamic properties of liquids and glasses in the system CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2,
using a combination of NMR and vibrational (IR and Raman) spectroscopies, and
molecular dynamics simulations. The main objective of this work is to
characterize the variation in number and type of atomic configurations,
especially the Si and Al coordinations, and to examine next-nearest neighbor
environments present in the liquids as a function of composition and
temperature. This study should increase understanding of the temperature- and
composition-dependent behavior of natural magmas during igneous processes.
