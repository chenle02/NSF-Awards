Kopell 9706694 The investigator and her colleagues study the dynamics of
networks of neurons, especially networks whose output is rhythmic. The research
uses methods of dynamical systems to understand how properties at the cellular
level (intrinsic membrane dynamics) and the interconnections among the cells
(synaptic properties) affect the network behavior. The research focuses on two
kinds of problems. The first concerns the mechanisms by which networks
synchronize or partially synchronize. These problems mainly concern cortical
networks in which there are large numbers of similar cells. The other class,
motivated mainly by smaller invertebrate networks, is concerned with the
determination and regulation of network frequency and relative phases among
cells in the network. In both classes of problems, the work is motivated by
specific networks of neurons, but the techniques are broad enough to allow
generalization of the results beyond the motivating examples. The dynamical
systems methods to be used and developed exploit the many different times scales
associated with the intrinsic and synaptic dynamical processes of the cells. One
goal is to understand how network behavior is modulated by changing parameters
that alter which subset of dynamical processes is most important in producing
the network output. Networks of neurons producing rhythmic output are found in
neural systems governing motor control, sensory processing, and in both sleeping
and awake states. Rhythmic activity in the nervous system is also seen in
pathological states, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Though there is
much detailed information about the physiology of participating cells, it is not
understood how networks that make use of dynamically complicated components are
constructed to carry out their appropriate tasks. This research aims to identify
mechanisms by which coherence, frequency and phase relationships of the rhythmic
network output are regulated. Such identification can potentially allow
scientists a deeper understanding of how the nervous sytem uses rhythms to
produce appropriate behavior, as well as techniques for removing rhythmic
activity that produces pathological states, including tremor.
