This award funds a conference in Groups and Computation at the Ohio State
University, March 24-28, 2003. The conference focuses on the interplay between
theory and practice in computing with groups, algorithms for computation being
at the heart of the conference. The primary conference goal is to provide a
forum for computational group theorists, both mathematicians and computer
scientists, to meet with colleagues in order to learn of recent research
developments in this area, to learn of and work on new open problems, to further
existing large projects in this area, and to develop software for large computer
systems that handle group computations. A second goal is to give graduate
students and recent Ph.D's an opportunity to learn of new work and of open
problems in the area.

Group theory is often described as the algebraic theory of symmetry in the
abstract. Group theory arises and is used in a wide variety of other fields,
including solid state physics, chemistry (crystallography), coding theory and
cryptography. Understanding the structure of groups is the major task of group
theory. The subject of the conference is the interaction between this
mathematical discipline and algorithmic questions used in extensive computer
computations with these fundamental algebraic objects.
