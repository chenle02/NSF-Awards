This award supports US participants of Thematic Program: Dynamics and Transport
in Disordered Systems at the Fields Institute in Toronto, Canada in the Spring
2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been known for a long time that heat flows
from hot bodies to cold ones, that differences in voltages generate currents.
&lt;br/&gt;Even if macroscopically this is well studied in many contexts, it is
not easy to understand these phenomena at the microscopic
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several mathematical models have been proposed for
the phenomena. Some of them based on probability theory and some of them are
classical and deterministic.&lt;br/&gt;In recent times, there has been very good
progress in both classes of models the mathematical phenomena discovered are
eerily similar sometimes. &lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the special semester is to
bring together specialists in both types of models to find common ground and to
make sure that there are students who get trained in both points of view.
