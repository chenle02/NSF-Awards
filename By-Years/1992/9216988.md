This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support research collaboration by
David Latham of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Luiz da Costa of
the Observatorio Nacional de Brasil in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The project aims
to complete a wide-angle survey of galaxy redshifts in the Southern Hemisphere
and a survey of distances for a sample of early- type galaxies in both galactic
caps. By conducting the wide-angle survey, the collaborators will map out the
large-scale structure of the nearby universe to a magnitude limit of Bo = 15.5.
The survey of distances associated with early-type galaxies will enable the
researchers to map out large-scale velocity flows and density fields in the
nearby universe. Both the US and the Brazilian sides will contribute their
expertise to the processes of observation, data reduction, and analysis of
results. Their research will likely lead to mutual benefits by contributing to
knowledge of large-scale structures and velocity flows in the nearby universe.
