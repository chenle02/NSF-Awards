Long &amp; Medium-Term Research: Isolation and Characterization of Inhibitors
of FOS/JUN DNA-Binding Function This award is under the Long and Medium-Term
Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence Program, which enables U.S. scientists
and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research
centers of proven excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for
joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Carlos Molina-Nazario to work with Dr. Paolo
Sassone- Corsi at the Laboratoire de Genetique Molecularie des Eucaryotes, CNRS
in Strasbourg, France. The purpose of this research project is to find
suppressor(s) of the Fos/Jun transactivating activity. Fos and Jun are
transcriptional activators that belong to the early response gene class. They
mediate the translation of extracellular signals into long term cellular
response such as cell growth and differentiation. They are also defined proto-
oncogenes because they can act as transforming genes if activated. The
transforming activity seems to be related to the transactivating properties.
Therefore factors involved in the suppression of the Fos-Jun transactivating
properties are likely to be involved in the control of the cell proliferation
and transformation. The purpose of the project can be summarized as follows: to
isolate and characterize the factor IP-1 (a specific repressor of Fos/Jun
function) and study its involvement in the control of Fos/Jun transactivating
properties, and to characterize IP-1's role in cell proliferation and
transformation. The learning of these unique methods in molecular biology and
the general systems of molecular carcinogenesis will help Dr. Molina-Nazario for
the future study of the molecular mechanism involved in the onset of cancer. The
award recommendation provides funds to cover a stipend for twelve months, a
dependent allowance and return airfare.
