A Symposium entitled "The biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Beta-
Glucosidases" has been organized and will be held in conjunction with the Annual
Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington, D.C., August 23-28,
1992. The symposium will include three sessions and will last one and one half
days. Eighteen leading research have been invited to review their past and
present their current research on the Beta- glucosidase they are studying.
Topics will include (1) the purification and characterization of Beta-
glucosidases from plants, humans, insects, fungi, and bacteria; (2) the
mechanism of catalysis: (3) isolation, characterization, and manipulation of
Beta-glucosidase genes: and (4) use of Beta-glucosidases for biomass conversion
in industry. Symposium papers will be collected into a book to be published by
the American Chemical Society Books Department. %%% Current research on Beta
glucosidases has significant scientific and economic implications. Plant enzymes
are implicated in growth productivity, food and feed toxicities, fungal and
bacterial enzymes could be used in the industrial conversion of cellulose to
glucose; and human enzyme deficiency is the cause of Gaucher's disease.
