Almost all modern production software is compiled with optimization. Debugging
optimized code is an important part of the software-development process. Perhaps
less known to application developers is that production compilers do contain
bugs, leading to incorrect debug information. Wrong debug information causes
debuggers to either crash or display wrong variable values. This project will
devise novel, effective methodologies, techniques, and tools to validate the
debug information generation in complex, real-world optimizing compilers. The
project's novelties are (1) providing a deeper and more thorough understanding
of the fundamental and practical challenges for validating debug information for
optimizing compilers, and (2) addressing the two most fundamental aspects of
debug-information validation: test-program generation and debug-action
generation. The project's impacts are (1) increasing the capability of
developers to debug optimized code and deployed software, and (2) more reliable
and usable debuggers thereby indirectly improving the quality of
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to explore novel,
practical techniques for validating debug information generated by optimizing
compilers. It focuses on developing a systematic framework to enhance the
correctness of debug information associated with optimized code. This project
explores three main directions: (1) developing new strategies to generate
actionable programs; (2) emitting comprehensive debug sequences for actionable
programs; and (3) generalizing techniques for different programming languages.
The project significantly advances the state-of-the-art in debug information
testing and validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
