The Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) between New
Mexico Highlands University (NMHU), Morehouse College (MC) and the Georgia
Institute of Technology (GT) collaborates on the study and development of
organic photonic materials. GT is a partner in the Science and Technology Center
(STC) located at the University of Washington. The collaborators explore three
areas of organic photonic materials: two-photon absorbing materials, applicable
for biological imaging and photodynamic therapy; crystalline nonlinear-optical
materials, aimed at designing materials for THz generation and electro optical
applications; and the development of new organic polymer materials for solar
cell applications. This PREM also focuses on attracting and increasing the
number of students in the area of photonic materials. High school science
teachers and community college faculty participate in a 4-week summer workshop
to experience bench-top research, design new lab experiments for their classes,
and learn about the latest pedagogical tools. In New Mexico, high school
students from Robertson and West Las Vegas High Schools are engaged in science
education programs like the Dual Credit and GEAR UP programs. Undergraduates
from NMHU, MC, and local community colleges perform hands-on research projects
in NMHU PREM labs as well as participate in the STC?s well-known Hooked-on-
Photonics NSF REU Program. This PREM also provides a summer research experience
for 4 NMHU and MC undergraduates at either Los Alamos or Sandia National
Laboratory. A major goal of the PREM team is the creation of a critical mass of
high school, community college, national laboratory, PREM, and STC faculty
partnership-wide mentoring program for undergraduate and high school students.
