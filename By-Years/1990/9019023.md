The comparison of paleoclimate data with General Circulation Model (GCM)
simulations of past conditions on earth provides one of the best methods to test
model accuracy and sensitivity. Important discrepancies exist between the
results of the models and the existing data. One prominent discrepancy is in the
southeastern US during the early Holocene. For that time, GCMs suggest that
climate was much warmer than is observed in the existing paleoclimate data. The
goal of this research program is to resolve this discrepancy by reanalyzing the
existing paleoclimate data from this region and provide new, independent
measurements of past conditions. The research is important because it will help
to confirm the accuracy of the NCAR GCM, a model that is used quite extensively
to predict the future climatic effects resulting from the introduction of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
