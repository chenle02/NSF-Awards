This proposal will partially support the participant costs to a conference on
Variations on the Likelihood Principle. The meeting will be of two-and-one half
days duration and will feature leading active researchers from a wide range of
subjects within likelihood. One goal of the conference will be to foster
interaction and the dispersion of scientific knowledge among workers linked by
the common thread of likelihood. A second goal is to provide a stimulus to young
researchers and graduate students in this area. This proposal will partial
support the Institute of Mathematical Statistics 225th Special Topics Meeting:
Variations on the Likelihood Principle, to be held in on the Pennsylvania State
University Campus, October 25-28, 1992.
