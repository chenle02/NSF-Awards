This Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project brings together major
companies and universities in the development of a wireless communications
ecosystem to commercialize breakthrough technologies that promise to increase
the capacity of today's wireless cellular networks by over 1000 times.
Specifically, three existing technologies will be relied upon to create a
prototype stage for integration by wireless handset makers and infrastructure
providers as well as incorporation into next-generation cellular standards.
These technologies are: (i) millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems that can
move cellular communication to new bands between 20 and 120 GHz where between 50
and 100 times more spectrum are readily available; (ii) relaying and distributed
coordination techniques to enable ultra low-cost small, self-organizing cells
that increase the numbers of cell sites by orders of magnitude; and (iii) full
duplex communication that can double communication bandwidth and facilitate
beamforming techniques essential for mmWave cellular systems.

Given the enormous market size of the cellular industry ($1 trillion worldwide),
combined with the pressing need for solutions to solve the spectrum crunch, the
breakthrough technologies in this proposal will offer tremendous market value,
return on investment, and opportunities for employment. This AIR project
provides a path for both industry and academia to develop key products and
knowledge that will impact the standard-setting process of the wireless
industry, while bringing massive increases in data throughputs to cellular
networks throughout the U.S.
