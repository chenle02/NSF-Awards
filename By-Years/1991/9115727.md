This is an SGER project. A graphical programming method is proposed for single
and multiphase flows in two and three- dimensions. The flow domain is drawn
using spatial vectors, which provide the input data for any complex flow
situation. The information may be directly visualized on a computer screen by
using a limited set of graphics functions, with single or multiple colors. The
method reduces significantly the programming time, uses much less computer
memory, and allows for modeling with increased localized resolution, easy and
fast interactive access to data. The method particularly useful for multidomain
flow problems, such as multiphase flows. The method is simple, make use of the
existing hardware,a nd may lead to good performances in multidimensional complex
flows. The proposed approach is suitable for the workstation environment.
