This research deals with the dynamics of ripples and dunes on the surface of a
movable bed beneath water flow of finite depth. Theoretical modeling and
experiments in a hydraulic flume will be used to advance the understanding of
the interaction between flow and bed surface configuration. Both two-dimensional
and three- dimensional configurations will be investigated. Results are expected
to advance the reliability and accuracy of methods for predicting erosion,
sediment transport, and bottom topography of rivers and channels.
