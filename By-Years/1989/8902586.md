The objective of this project is to comprehensively study the metagabbroic rocks
drilled from the Atlantis II fracture zone on Southwest Indian Ridge during Leg
118 of the Ocean Drilling Program. The drill core represents of nearly 500
meters of gabbro with 87% recovery. Work will include detailed petrography and
electron microprobe studies of secondary minerals and vein assemblages, stable
isotope studies and fluid inclusion studies. The goal is to understand the
metamorphic history of the rocks and to determine the mass fluxes of various
types of metamorphic fluids that have given rise to different phases of
alteration. %%% This project represents the first attempt to characterize the
metamorphic and tectonic history of rocks from layer three of the oceanic crust
that have been obtained by drilling. This is a unique sample suite. This project
should produce a new understanding of the nature and evolution of the deeper
parts of the oceanic crust. This project complements work to be done on primary
mineral assemblages and bulk chemistry on the same core by other investigators.
