The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an
improvement in motor vehicle safety by providing drivers with critical
navigational information without requiring them to look away from the road. The
project uses novel display technologies to place useful information within the
drivers' fields of view. This innovation also promises greater accessibility to
navigational information for drivers. This project also has the potential to
address the use of novel display devices for industries such as first responders
and in construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops research
into the use of projective augmented reality display devices in the built
environment. Specifically, this project explores the potential of utilizing such
devices to deliver information inside motor vehicles. The technical features of
this innovation overcome limitations of other augmented reality and navigation
display devices, such as head mounted displays and screens. These limitations
include the provision of unnecessary information, the need for user to take
attention away from their real-world settings, and a reduction in the user's
field of view. The project will provide user insights related to the technical
and design constraints for the different use-cases and will explore the
potential value propositions of the technology. These insights will also inform
the engineering design of electronics, casing, and software user interface of
the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
