9532009 JONES Oregon State University (OSU) will operate the R/V WECOMA during
1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF- sponsored projects.
The R/V WECOMA is a 185' general research vessel constructed in 1975 and owned
by the National Science Foundation. The vessel underwent a mid-life refit and
general upgrade in 1994. OSU operates the WECOMA under a charter agreement with
NSF. The ship is scheduled for 180 operating days in 1996, of which 104 days are
in support of NSF-sponsored programs. The remaining 76 days are in support of
Navy programs. The cruises will be mainly in the north pacific off the US west
coast. This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF to support oceanographic
research. Most oceanographic research requires highly specialized equipment that
must be permanently installed on a ship for which the ship must be specifically
designed. This equipment also requires highly trained crew members for
maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as
general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the operation of a
variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are
operated by universities and research institutions around the country.
