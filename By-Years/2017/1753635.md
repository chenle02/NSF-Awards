This award supports a doctoral dissertation research project. The primary aim of
the project is to contribute to understanding how diversity is navigated,
compromised, and negotiated within big data practices. It will bring to light
values and biases that privilege certain groups while marginalizing others,
meaning those values that are unconsciously integrated into the design of
technologies, such as data collection and sorting practices. Such results will
have substantial social significance. They will serve to provide a better
understanding of the various ways in which data can be different for different
people, and of the potential biases that can result in inequity and injustice
for the most vulnerable. The outcomes of this project also have the potential to
address the social aspects of representational compression at the interface of
humans and technology; they can be applied to integrating intersectional
perspectives in technological design and technologically-driven policy
decisions.

The researcher will engage in an ethnographic study of how data may enact
particular formulations and subjectivities of categorization. She grounds her
theoretical approach in Science and Technology Studies to identify instances
where dominant discourses of data come into confrontation with alternative
narratives. Of particular interest are instances where the data produced is
unusual; the data is sometimes referred to as an "outlier" or, in more
derogatory terms, "dirty data" that needs "scrubbing." This project aims to
analyze such "unusual" data through ethnographic investigation of self-tracking
cultures. This approach will contribute to knowledge of how big data practices
encourage and impede certain social positions and subjectivities. It will also
contribute to eliciting the underlying values of big data practices; such values
speak to how data is variously deployed for use in civilian projects, economics,
governance, and knowledge production.
