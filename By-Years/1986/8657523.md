This grant provides support for Prof. Lee under the Foundation's Presidential
Young Investigator (PYI) program. His research concerns VLSI architecture for
real-time digital signal processing. He has developed a programming language
called Synchronous Data Flow which has the potential of relieving the burden of
manual, painstaking hardware design. He is pursuing this concept under this
grant. The PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most
outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are
intended to improve the capability of U. S. academic institutions to respond to
the demand for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic
and industrial research and engineering. This PYI has made significant
contributions to his field of engineering and has potential to become a leader
in academic research and education. The diary note describes the rigorous
selection procedure. As Prof. Lee has obtained industrial matching funds in the
amount of $30000, a grant award of $55000 is highly recommended.
