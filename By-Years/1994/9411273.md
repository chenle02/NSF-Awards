949411273 Gilliam This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project addresses
apparent contradictions in the literature on public opinion and Congressional
responsiveness. That is, while decades of public opinion research indicate that
the voters are ill-informed on issues of public policy, the literature on
Congress demonstrates that legislative behavior accurately reflects the
preferences of their constituents. It seems unlikely that congressmen would
behave as they do unless voters ultimately possessed information to punish those
legislators who were not responsive. Why is it, them, that researchers have
consistently found evidence of congressional responsiveness given the relatively
low levels of information in the electorate? The Ph.D. student addresses this
question arguing that while the electorate may be generally uninformed, there
are a variety of sub-population which devote considerable attention to a
relatively narrow range of issues. The student tests the hypothesis in two ways:
1) by relying on survey data provided by the National Senate Election Study; 2)
through a content analysis of major newspapers. This study promises to
substantially enhance our understanding of the topic.
