International Congress on High Speed Photography and Photonics" which will be
held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on October 27-November 1, l996. Funds from NSF
will be used to partially support costs of travel, accommodations and
registration fees for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from U.S.
Universities to attend the conference. The International Congress on High Speed
Photography and Photonics is the primary international forum for exchange of the
latest knowledge about high speed photography and photonics. NSF, due to its
involvement in both education and in fundamental research in photonics and
imaging, supports this grant to enable graduate students and post-doctoral
fellows to attend the 22nd International Congress on High Speed Photography and
Photonics. ***
