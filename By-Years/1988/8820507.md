Theoretical calculations of elastic and inelastic scattering of electron, by
atoms and ions will be continued. Previous work had focused on hydrogen atoms.
Here the focus will be an extension to atoms with more electrons, utilizing a
complex, nonlocal, energy dependent optical potential to represent the effects
of excitation and ionization channels that cannot be considered explicitly.
Emphasis will be placed on electron helium scattering in view of the large
amount of available experimental information. The objective is to develop
methods for arbitrary atoms and ions, with applications in astrophysics and
plasma physics.
