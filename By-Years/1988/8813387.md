In recent years there has been an explosion in the development and use of
computer based tools to support engineering, design and manufacturing. In most
cases, however, the tools have been developed independently and applications are
implemented in a largely autonomous fashion. To improve engineering productivity
there is a critical need to advance the technology for management of the
information in the analysis, design and manufacturing process. The purpose of
this grant is to hold a workshop with industry, university and government
representatives to help identify critical research issues in engineering
information technology which need solution to support the design of complex
engineering products into the twenty- first century.
