9405659 Porter Neotectonic studies can provide deformational data on
intermediate geologic time scales between historic measurements and the geologic
record as shows by bedrock geology. This project will examine a variety of
neotectonic features a long the Olympic coast of Washington where reconnaissance
studies have indicated broad cost-parallel warping related to the development of
accretionary wedge structures. Rates of deformation will be calculated using
stratigraphic and chronological data, and will be used to differentiate between
elastic and permanent deformation. Results will be of considerable importance to
models of accretionary tectonics and the interplay between sea level and coastal
land form deformation.
