Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the three-dimensional space that we are
living in. A doughnut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-
manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other
natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of
studying them is to cut a complicated three-manifold into simpler three-
dimensional pieces along two-dimensional surfaces. For example, a so-called
Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition. One can also use a technique known
as surgery on a three-manifold that replaces a geometric piece with a different
one. In this project, the PI plans to study various questions on three-manifolds
using Heegaard splitting and surgery. The research targets several central
questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential
impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological
structures of DNA.

In this project, the PI plans to study topology of three-manifolds. The first
part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard
genus and degree-one map. The conjecture can be translated into a study of how
Heegaard genus changes under a special type of surgeries and the PI plans to
study such surgeries. The PI also plans to study several related questions on
Heegaard genus of certain amalgamated three-manifolds. The second part of the
project is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. This
approach is inspired by the PI's observation that if there is a certain
intersection pattern, then one can perform a stabilization and then an
unstabilization, changing a Heegaard splitting of a knot exterior (in a lens
space) into a meridionally primitive splitting. The PI plans to develop new
tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals.
