The project aims to develop new numerical methods for solving optimization
problems that have applications in elasticity theory, fluid filtration in porous
media, constrained heating, cancer therapy, shape optimization, and financial
mathematics. The computational simulations from this project will provide
insights on the understanding of complicated physical models with random
perturbations. Another emphasis of this project will be the training of graduate
students in numerical methods and their analysis while also training the
students in theory. The students will further be trained in the efficient
implementation of the computer codes so that they are better prepared for
careers in industry.

The project is on the design, implementation, and rigorous analysis of a new
class of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for variational inequalities and
optimal control problems with inequality constraints that are fundamental for
the modeling of nonlinear problems arising from applications in materials
science, mechanical engineering, shape optimization, and financial science.
Furthermore, the underlying problems may involve small parameters and random
perturbations such that the complete numerical analyses are more subtle. The
formulations of classical DG methods usually require large positive penalty
parameters that depend on the shape regularity of the mesh and other unknown
constants. The project will design novel DG methods for variational
inequalities, optimal control problems with partial differential equations
constraints, and related singularly perturbed and stochastically perturbed
problems. Another goal of the project is to design robust, reliable, and
efficient a posteriori error estimators for the corresponding deterministic and
stochastic problems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
