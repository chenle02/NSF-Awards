This is a collaborative project between the University of Southern California
(USC) and the California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). It includes
curriculum and course development; institutional development; and teacher
development; provides opportunities for hands-on internships for both
undergraduate and graduate students; and promotes the understanding and
integration of security policy management and enforcement technologies. The
project integrates diverse technologies through the involvement of faculty with
diverse backgrounds, and provides for teams of undergraduate and graduate
students to plan, design, configure, and choose the technology components for
"their secure network and infrastructure for information assurance" in the
project courses. The broader impact of this project includes faculty development
through summer institutes and distance education networks, teacher education for
teachers in grades 8-12, and short courses in industry. In addition, an
introductory, general education course developed at CSULB increases awareness
and reaches non-majors and the general public.
