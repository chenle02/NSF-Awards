9317618 Abraham This project considers the effects of a heterogeneous catalyst
on the oxidation of organic species containing nitrogen in an aqueous medium at
temperatures near the critical point of water. Candidate catalysts include
vanadia, cupric oxide, ceria/magnesia, palladium, and platinum. The stability of
the catalyst in supercritical water and its effects on the oxidation of
nitrogen-containing species, such as ammonia, pyridine, pyrrole, methylpyrrole,
aniline, or benzonitrile, are observed. The heterogeneous and homogeneous
reaction rates for the chosen system are modelled and any partial oxidation
products are identified. The results are described in terms of a consistent set
of reaction pathways. Supercritical water oxidation has been shown to be an
effective method to destroy many hazardous chemicals, but issues remain,
particularly in the possible production of partial oxidation products. This work
explores the use of a catalyst to issue complete destruction for wastes of the
type produced by the fiber, insulation, pesticide, pharmaceutical, and
explosives industries. ***
