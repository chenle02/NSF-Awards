Asparagine synthetase is the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the
amino acid Asparagine, an important component of proteins in all organisms. This
enzyme has been isolated and studied from a variety of sources, and recently the
crystal structure of the bacterial form of the enzyme has been elucidated. The
crystal structure illustrated that there was a channel that kept one of the
highly reactive intermediates of the reaction from interacting and becoming
inactive through reaction with water in the solvent. This mode of protecting
enzyme intermediates from solvent inactivation has been reported for other cases
over the last decade. In none of these cases, however, has the mechanism of the
transport been elucidated. This project will utilize bacterial Asparagine
Synthetase as a model for reactive intermediate transport. It involves an
experimental approach to describe the components of the transport process.
Elucidating the chemical components required for the channeling of intermediates
will enable researchers to understand the chemistry of transport and to allow
for design of novel coupled enzyme activities.
