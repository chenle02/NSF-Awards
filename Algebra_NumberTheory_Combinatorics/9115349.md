Professor Grundman will work on classifying Hilbert modular threefolds from
both the arithmetic and geometric viewpoints. In particular, she intends to
study minimal models for Hilbert modular threefolds with small plurigenera. This
project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that
blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
