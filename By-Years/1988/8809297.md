The purpose of this research planning grant is to (1) extend and apply complex
modular (RNS) algebras to signal processing, (2) develop algorithms for high-
speed systolic implementation, and (3) design optical signal processor
architectures for applications requiring complex arithmetic, extended dynamic
range and high speed. A focus is on the Wigner distribution, a time- frequency
signal representation, for use in a future optical processor.
