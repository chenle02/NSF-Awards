The project involves the development of a facility to enable the design and
prototyping of systems that offer a major increase in functionality and
performance relative to current generation systems. Performance increases are
achieved by developing design tools that apply leading-edge semiconductor and
packaging technologies by incorporating fabrication and testing constraints as
an integral part of the design tradeoff process, and by developing innovative
new hardware/software structures for important classes of systems. The project
exploits the projected increases in both complexity and speed of semiconductor
technologies due to further decreases in feature sizes and utilizes MCM (Multi-
chip Module) packaging technologies to enable system realization .
