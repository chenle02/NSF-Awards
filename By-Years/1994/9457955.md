Technical abstract: Atomic scale structures will be fabricated and studied on
metal and semiconducting surfaces. The structures will be built atom by atom
using a liquid helium cooled, ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope
(STM). The STM chamber will house surface analytic tools, thin film epitaxi
equipment, and a 1 Tesla magnet. The combined abilities of atomic manipulation,
imaging, and spectroscopy will allow study of the electronic structure and
transport properties of nanometer scaled objects. Potentials for device
application will be evaluated. Non-technical abstract: Nanometer scale
structures will be built and studied using a low temperature scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) The structures will be built by sliding individual atoms along
a conducting surface using the tip of an STM. The microscopic structures will be
studied under various conditions, such as in the presence of a flowing current
or in a magnetic field. Solid state phenomena will be studied at the smallest
possible length scales, as well as the potential for device applications.
