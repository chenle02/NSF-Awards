9550433 Melody This project provides funds for an extensive planning process
that includes assessing Florida's global change education needs, isolating
themes, developing a curricular plan, developing an implementation model, and
developing an assessment and evaluation model. Representatives from each of
Florida's 67 school districts are involved in the planning process. Since the
model will be designed within the Qtate's new Science Curriculum Framework, each
district is expected to benefit from access and participation. Cost sharing is
not mentioned, however, senior personnel are not charged to the grant.
