A theoretical investigation of the propagation of ultra- intense radiation in
plasmas will be performed and calculations relating to the phenomena of
propagation will be made using existing or modified computer programs. These
calculations will continue the work already started as a result of the
collaboration between C. K. Rhodes and K. Boyer of the University of Illinois at
Chicago, A. B. Borisov of Moscow State University and A. V. Borovskiy, V. V.
Korobkin and A. M. Prokhorov of the USSR Academy of Science.
