This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project is
directed at training graduate students in the science and technology surrounding
quantum coherent optical and matter systems and related photonic structures and
sources. Such studies intimately relate to the emerging field of quantum
information processing including quantum encrypted communications. Objectives
include training a different kind professional who is cross-trained, flexible,
and better prepared for the evolving needs of information technology, with an
eye toward increasing underrepresented and female students. The latter will be
enhanced through vigorous recruiting and partnering with minority serving
institutions. A central educational feature is that the participating students
take courses in at least three of the four participating departments: Physics,
Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, and Materials Science. Due to the advanced
nature of the targeted research topics, much of the required theory and practice
are not presently taught and thus the faculty advisors will create new courses
that fill the gaps. A new laboratory course featuring modern fiber-optics-based
instrumentation is a central feature of the program. The scientific questions
posed have great potential for revolutionizing information technology based on
the quantum coherence of light and matter fields. Graduate students trained
under this program are expected to lead the next generation of information
technology research and development, which will increasingly involve quantum
coherence. The interaction with U. S. firms and National Laboratories will
enhance the students? ability to compete in the global market place. IGERT is an
NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D.
scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge
in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills
needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze
a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models
for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative
research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
