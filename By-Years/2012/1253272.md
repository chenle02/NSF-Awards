This is an EAGER proposal submitted to OISE for research collaboration between
Prof. Blake of Tulane University and Prof. Merkoçi?s of Nanobioelectronics and
Biosensors Group in the Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology at the Autonomous
University of Barcelona, Spain. The objective of this one-year project is to
develop new peptide tags for quantum dots of specific metal ion compositions.
These peptide tags, when incorporated into engineered antibodies, will permit
the development of integrated, miniaturized electrochemical sensors that can be
multiplexed with minimal sample pretreatment. Such electrochemical sensors,
which will ultimately be miniaturized for rapid, on-site analysis, would have
the capacity for rapid, simultaneous detection of multiple environmental
contaminants, serum biomarkers, or analytes of concern for homeland security.
