This award to Daniel Weitekamp at the California Institute of Technology and
Frank Grunthaner at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is supported by the Advanced
Materials Program in Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the
Division of Materials Research. The collaborative program will deal with the
development of advanced optical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and
their application to the characterization of defects in III-V epitaxially grown
compound semiconductors in microelectronic devices. Specifically, the
application of time-sequenced optical NMR and Larmor beat detection to optical
nuclear polarization methods will be developed and applied to semiconductor
devices. This new technique will non-destructively detect semiconductor defects
at the part-per-billion level, far exceeding the sensitivity of existing
methods. Modeling studies based on a particle-in-a-box model of quantum confined
wave functions will complement experimental measurements. This new
characterization technique will provide an unprecedented microscopic view of the
structure and function of semiconductor quantum well optoelectronic devices,
answering long-standing fundamental questions. The high accuracy of the
information will reduce trial and error, accelerating the large national effort
to realize high performance electronic and photonic devices, particularly those
based on quantum-confined structures.
