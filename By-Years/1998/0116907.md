Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0116907&lt;br/&gt;A. Naguib, Michigan State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to
obtain by experimental means the characteristics of the flow in the
separation/reattachment zone of a three-dimensional boundary layer. Such a flow
is to be generated downstream of a backward facing step on an axisymmetric body.
Surface stresses will be measure by a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
instrument to be developed by the PI. The data will be made available to the
fluid dynamics community as bench marks for the DNS and LES computations and the
testing of turbulence models for such complex flows.
