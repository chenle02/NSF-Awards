&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research will be to test extracts from solid-
substrate fermentation cultures for antifungal activity against Aspergillus
flavus, Fusarium verticillioides and an agriculturally important insect,
Spodoptera frugiperda. Metabolites will be isolated by chromatographic methods,
identified using spectroscopic techniques and tested for biological activity
using established protocols. Results from the project will help to determine
whether ecological rationale can be a useful guide to the discovery of new and
potentially useful bioactive natural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. James B. Gloer of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Iowa. Along with his collaborators, Drs. Patrick F. Dowd and Donald T.
Wicklow, both of the United States Department of Agriculture, Professor Gloer
will focus his research on the chemical study of mycoparasitic/fungicolous fungi
that attack and colonize important long-lived physiological structures by other
fungi in nature. The central hypothesis of the project is that invasion by
fungal colonists frequently involves antibiosis toward the host, and therefore,
such colonists may be valuable, underexplored sources of antifungal agents. The
work has broader impacts in the teaching of both undergraduate and graduate
students and for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.&lt;br/&gt;
