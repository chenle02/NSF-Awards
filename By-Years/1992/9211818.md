Science education in the United States was largely based on models drawn from
Germany. Young Americans interested in pursuing a career in science went to
Germany for advanced education. This practice continued well into the 20th
century--for example, Robert Oppenheimer, "father of the atomic bomb," studied
quantum physics in Germany. Thus, if one wants to understand science education
in America, one must understand its origins in Germany. A central focus in
studies of the development of science in Germany are the scientific institutes
of the universities. Their creation in the last third of the 19th century
sparked an "institutional revolution" that Thomas Kuhn has called the "Second
Scientific Revolution" owing to its importance for providing the organizational
structure that made possible the remarkable intellectual advances of the modern
era. To date, most studies have investigated the institutes of physics,
chemistry, or physiology. Dr. Richmond is presenting a detailed archival study
of the institutionalization of zoology in Munich University. One of the largest
and most important centers of zoology in Germany, Munich harbored all of the
major research programs of this period: Naturphilosophie, "scientific" zoology,
and experimental zoology. By examining the cognitive, institutional, and
socioeconomic factors that influenced the development of zoology in Munich over
the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the study provides new
information about the fine structure of the operation of one institute, and its
findings can be applied more generally to broaden our understanding of the
development of zoology during this critical period in its history.
