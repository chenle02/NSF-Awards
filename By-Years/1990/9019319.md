Mu is a fascinating bacteriophage whose genome replicates as a DNA transposon.
Mu has been extensively studied and now serves as a model system for
transposable elements and viruses. Mu has also became a valuable genetic tool
for many biological applications including insertion mutagenesis, gene
transduction and translocation, chromosome marking and mapping, DNA cloning, DNA
sequencing, and gene fusing for studies of gene expression and regulation. These
genetic applications also serve as models for applications of other transposons
and viruses in different biological systems. Further studies and applications of
Mu and related phage are proposed, with extensions to other bacterial species.
Specifically, 1) the targeting of Mu transposition will be studied with fusions
of the Mu B gene to the DNA binding protein gene lacI, 2) the rfa host receptor
genes for the Mu and related phage will be studied in Escherichia coli and
Salmonella typhimurium to understand their surface requirements for the
lipopolysaccharide receptors and 3) the knowledge of their receptor
specificities will be used to extend the host range of these phage and their
applications to other Enterobacteriaceae.
