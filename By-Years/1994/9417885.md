9417885 Schuh A detailed understanding of the dynamic internal motion of
globular proteins is sought because of its importance to a knowledge of the
structure/function relationships of proteins as they pertain to fundamental
research and to applied aspects of industrial research involving production of
protein pharmaceuticals and the logical design of drugs. The principal
investigator and students have reported that the phosphorescence of
6-bromo-2-naphthyl sulfate (BNS) is quenched specifically by the heme of heme
proteins. The rate constant for quenching, kq, is determined from lifetime
measurements of laser-induced phosphorescence and is used to judge the extent to
which internal motion of heme proteins makes the heme rings accessible. In this
research attempts will be made to substitute larger phosphorescent molecular
probes (e.g. 9-bromo-6- phenanthrene sulfate) in place of BNS. Also kq will be
measured for several enzymatic and non-enzymatic heme proteins as a function of
temperature and solvent conditions. %%% The ultimate goals are to: 1) estimate
the size of transient fluctuations in proteins, 2) determine whether there are
fundamental differences in the dynamics of enzymatic and non- enzymatic heme
proteins, 3) compare the dynamics of native proteins and an important
intermediate in protein folding, called the molten globule, 4) gain insight into
the accessibility of the hemes in heme protein complexes, and 5) determine
whether tertiary structural dynamics of hemoglobin is important to the binding
and release of molecular oxygen. ***
