This project will conduct innovative integration of robotics technologies to
create Marsupial Aerial Robot Teams (MARTs) whereby small uninhabited aircraft
systems (i.e. drones) carry smaller aircraft to provide observations of the
atmosphere. Effective advanced warning systems enabled by the data collected by
MARTs could drastically reduce the loss of life and damage caused by severe
weather. Aerial robotic systems operating in places too dangerous for humans or
expensive single-vehicle systems will need to reason over detailed models and
large amounts of data. This project will create and deploy a team of robots that
will be like an autonomous airborne meteorologist performing online targeted
forecasting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MARTs achieve the National Robotics
Initiativeâ€™s goal to promote the integration of robots to the benefit of humans.
This project will develop an autonomous airborne meteorologist that consists of
teams of aerial robots connected to dispersed users and computing resources. The
effort embodies the theme of innovative integration of robotic technologies by
advancing current practices through new fundamental algorithms integrated,
deployed, and evaluated on marsupial aerial robot teams. Integrated robotic
technologies include: i.) air-launched pseudo-Lagrangian drifters; ii.) ensemble
sensitivity analysis for autonomous targeted observation; iii.) algorithms that
solve online continuous-domain partially-observable Markov decision processes
(POMDPs); iv.) parallelized path planning in uncertain flows; and v.) a
dispersed autonomy architecture for marsupial aerial robot
teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
