Members of the genus Phytophthora cause enormous damage to a wide variety of
plants, such as the important agricultural crop soybean, and are very difficult
to control due to their unique biology. The genome sequence of two species (P.
sojae and P. ramorum) will soon be available and an important challenge is
assigning function to the genes identified. As with many non-model organisms,
there are very few tools or resources for disrupting specific genes in
Phytophthora and there is a need for large-scale strategies to complete
functional genomic analyses. The overall objective of this CAREER project is to
develop a reverse-genetics tool for Phytophthora to isolate gene-specific
mutants. Key aspects of the underlying technology for this project are adapted
from the TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) tool currently in
place for the Arabidopsis community. This tool will have a broad impact on the
Phytophthora research community by generating a wide array of functionally
impaired mutants. Specifically, mutants lacking functional copies of genes
important for spore production, spore germination, spore motility, chemotaxis,
drug resistance, signal transduction, virulence, and avirulence will be
isolated. Phytophthora research groups in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and
Europe will participate in this project and coordination among Phytophthora
researchers worldwide will be facilitated. All of the mutants will be made
freely available to interested scientists and information pertaining to the
mutants will be posted on a web-accessible database. Integrated with the above
research is a reverse genetics educational program using P. sojae as a model.
The core biological concept is mutation. In particular, the impact of small
genetic lesions on the biology of diverse organisms will be presented and the
implications discussed. Training workshop will be offered for local students,
and recruitment efforts will include underrepresented groups and students from
the local HBCU Knoxville College. &lt;br/&gt;
