This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF). With it, Professor Rabi
Musah from SUNY Albany and colleagues acquired a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer. A NMR spectrometer measures weak signals from
atomic nuclei in a sample when stimulated by light. These signals enable
identification of the atoms (for example, hydrogen, carbon, and other elements)
in the chemical or material under study. NMR is a powerful analytical technique
used to characterize reaction products, proteins and other biological species,
or unknown substances which need to be identified. Consequently, NMR
spectrometers are essential to chemistry, biological and environmental research.
The instrument is used to train students in the technique preparing them for
their careers. The spectrometer is a resource available to other institutions in
the greater Albany region including the College of St. Rose and Skidmore
College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at
enhancing research and education at all levels. This instrument may impact
studies synthesizing and characterizing organosulfur and organoselenium
compounds, and organosulfur natural products such as plant chemical defense
molecules. The instrument is used for investigating heterometallic molecular
precursors for the preparation of energy-related materials. Research on carbon-
rich pi-bowls, nanobelts and warped nanographene sheets advance with data from
the instrument. The spectrometer is an integral tool in several projects
exploring the syntheses of biologically active species. These include synthetic
approaches to small-molecule peptide natural products, and the chemical
synthesis of peptides, proteins and glycoproteins. Also under investigation are
the synthesis of naturally modified RNA nucleosides, nucleotides and
oligonucleotides and the determination of their crystal structures.
