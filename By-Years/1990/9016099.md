The proposal is for the acquisition of a scanning confocal microscope (SCM).
Various new software applications allow image planes to be individually
collected, stored and recombined to produce three-dimensional views of
structures. This ability to spatially resolve structures within a sample is
unique to SCMs and is one of the major advantages that they offer over
traditional methods of data acquisition (standard immunofluorescence,
transmission and scanning electron microscopy, DIC microscopy, etc.). The
instrument will be operated and maintained at the Center for Advanced
Ultrastructural Research the SCM and will be easily accessible to researchers at
the University of Georgia and the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta. These
researchers represent a variety of disciplines including agronomy, biochemistry,
botany, chemistry, entomology, genetics, microbiology, physiology, plant
pathology, and zoology, and the projects cover a broad range of cytological
investigations in furgal, plant, and mammalian cells.
