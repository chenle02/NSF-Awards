This project will investigate lateral variation in the polymer autoxidation
reaction mechanism. The first step is a chemiluminescence (very low intensity
light emission) imaging survey of several polymers in the steady state,
autocatalytic and oxygen limited stages of autoxidation. Other laterally
resolved analytical techniques will be used to relate polymer attributes to the
mechanistic heterogeneity. Brief ultraviolet irradiation will be used to
stimulate polymer chemiluminescence. Lateral variations in relaxation of the
stimulated chemiluminescence to steady state intensity will be examined. The
capability for laterally resolved measurement of the glass-to-gel transition
temperature will be developed. The analytical methods used will be related to
polymer aging and used to develop polymer failure prediction models. A potential
new instrument resulting from the research would provide non-destructive field
testing to predict useful service life of polymeric materials.
