The Langlands program is a vast network of ideas, theorems, and conjectures in
number theory, algebra, geometry, and physics. At the heart of the program is a
duality principle (a form of electric-magnetic duality in physics), which
predicts surprising connections between a priori unrelated mathematical objects.
Understanding the nature of this duality is a fundamental problem in mathematics
and physics. Rather than study these phenomena in the traditional contexts of
number fields or algebraic curves, the PI sets the Langlands program in the
realm of 3-dimensional topology - a rich and active area of research in its own
right. In this setting, these deep ideas become much more accessible than was
previously possible. For example, one component of the project is about
observing Langlands phenomena by comparing different ways to count knots in a
given 3-dimensional space. Such methods open up the Langlands program to a wider
mathematical world and provide pathways to involve a new generation of students
in this fundamental research area. This project provides research and training
opportunities for students. In more detail, the PI will define (mathematically)
and study the space of states associated to a 3-manifold in the family of
geometric Langlands topological quantum field theories of Kapustin and Witten.
The proposed research is broadly in the realm of geometric representation
theory, intersecting with concepts and tools from gauge theory, quantum topology
(skein theory), and derived algebraic geometry. Some particular goals of the
research include: formulating a duality conjecture for the dimensions of skein
modules, as well as tools to explicitly verify in a number of important cases; a
proof of the Betti and de Rham geometric Langlands conjecture for elliptic
curves at generic level by developing an elliptic/quantum variant of generalized
Springer theory; a refined construction of the state space of the B-model using
tools from derived algebraic geometry; and a computation of the homology of
gauge groups of 3-manifolds in terms of the Langlands dual spectral Whittaker
theory. This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program
in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Established Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Topology program in the Division of
Mathematical Sciences.
