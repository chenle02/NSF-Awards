In order to meet the demand for workers in the nuclear technology field, Wallace
Community College (WCC) in partnership with local secondary schools, vocational
centers, universities, and Southern Nuclear Power Company offers a high quality
nuclear technology program that incorporates education and training at the
secondary school, vocational, and community college levels. This partnership
generates new talent in the instrumentation and control subsections of nuclear
technology. Southern Nuclear Company has pointed to this skill as a key labor
shortfall area. Project participants are undergoing professional development
that results in an improved quality of education and training received by
students. The new and existing courses at WCC are taught primarily by existing
faculty with additional instruction from subject area experts from Plant Farley.
WCC and partners are educating faculty in order to maintain a nationwide supply
of highly qualified nuclear technicians. The project enhances the skill sets of
instructors in disciplines related to nuclear technology. Existing courses and
new courses are presently taught by faculty members who have a limited knowledge
of the nuclear power industry. These instructors are being provided with
industry related training so that they understand how the skills they are
teaching are applied to the nuclear technology field.
