9412803 Holtz This project involves the recovery of perishable data from the
Northridge earthquake of January 1, 1994, as it relates to the performance of
Geosynthetic Reinforced Slopes (GRS) subjected to seismic loading. Geosynthetic
reinforced slopes are earth slopes (such as road cuttings) which are reinforced
against slope failure (landslides) using geosynthetic materials. The project
involves: (1) the identification of geosynthetic reinforced slopes which were
subjected to substantial shaking by the Northridge earthquake, (2) the
estimation of the ground shaking to which these slopes were subjected and any
pre- earthquake movements of the slopes, (3) photographing the slopes from the
ground and from the air and the measurement of landslide size, head and side
scarps, and reinforcement patterns on the ground, and the collection of soil
samples, and (4) the estimation of slide volumes, distances moved, and slope
angles, and an attempt to correlate soil type, slope angle, type of
reinforcement, reinforcement pattern, slope orientation and magnitude of
displacement, where applicable. ***
