This project is reforming the ECE program at the University of Utah by
developing system-level design projects to be integrated within individual
courses and also spanning multiple courses. This is greatly enhancing the
laboratory component of the program. It is building on a particular strength of
the department, which already has a top-notch industrially-sponsored senior
design sequence and courses with strong system design projects. Through this
change, the project is (1) increasing student recruitment and retention, (2)
increasing student motivation, (3) increasing knowledge acquisition and
retention, and (4) developing system-level design
understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project challenges the students right
from the first day of class, to build a simple but complete system using most of
the concepts they are learning in the class. In some classes, this project is
part of the professor's larger research program, and they are integrated with
graduate students throughout the process. In others, they are helping to build
science discovery units for a new children's science center, often working with
high school students in an outreach environment. At the end of the semester, the
systems are being integrated and tested. The students are excited and motivated,
and if a part didn't work, they are anxiously fixing it. In some cases, systems
from two or more courses are integrated together, reminding the students what it
was that they learned last semester. This is the student experience in a
curriculum that thoroughly integrates system-level design throughout the
curriculum, bringing undergraduate students directly into the excitement of the
research and discovery process, and sharing their natural excitement and
curiosity with others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
