The principal investigator's proposed research has three parts. The first
&lt;br/&gt;constructs representations using tools from topology and symplectic
&lt;br/&gt;geometry, especially the theory of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson, and
&lt;br/&gt;extends those tools to larger classes of varieties. The second
tackles &lt;br/&gt;algebraic and combinatorial projects that solve problems in
the geometry &lt;br/&gt;of the associated varieties. This subject is often
called modern Schubert &lt;br/&gt;calculus; specific projects include
determining multiplication formulas &lt;br/&gt;inside the cohomology ring of
flag varieties and Grassmannians. The third &lt;br/&gt;focuses on computational
and enumerative geometric properties of &lt;br/&gt;varieties, such as Hessenberg
varieties, that arise in areas of &lt;br/&gt;representation theory including the
Langlands program. The projects will &lt;br/&gt;identify fundamental geometric
properties of the varieties, like &lt;br/&gt;pure-dimensionality, that are
critical to advances in representation
&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric representation theory builds
algebraic structures called &lt;br/&gt;representations from geometric objects.
This leads to deep insights &lt;br/&gt;connecting different mathematical
disciplines, including algebra, &lt;br/&gt;geometry, combinatorics, and
mathematical physics. Crucially, a geometric &lt;br/&gt;representation
establishes a table of correspondences between geometry and &lt;br/&gt;algebra.
On one hand, the table answers questions in representation &lt;br/&gt;theory via
geometry; on the other, it answers questions in geometry using
&lt;br/&gt;algebra and combinatorics. The proposal includes projects to foster
&lt;br/&gt;student development at all levels and to provide mentoring for women
and &lt;br/&gt;other underrepresented minorities in mathematics.
