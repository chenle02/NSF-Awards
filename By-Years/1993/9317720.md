9317720 Mierson Several functional properties of receptor cells for taste in
mammals are unknown. Although most of our knowledge of taste behavior, central
anatomy, and nerve physiology comes from mammalian studies, amphibian taste
receptor properties are far better known because these cells are much larger
than those in mammals, and so are more accessible to microelectrodes. This SGER
project develops a new method for measuring the intracellular voltages and ion
concentrations in mammalian taste cells, to explore these unknown properties. An
approach from the basal side of the taste bud makes it possible to visually
identify taste bud cells, and to chemically and electrically manipulate the
tissue from both the basal side facing the nerves, and the apical side facing
the tastant stimuli. Results allow testing a mathematical model of the
biophysics and mechanisms of adaptation in taste receptors. The technological
difficulty of the new approach presents risks, but allows testing the novel
hypothesis that sensory adaptation in mammalian taste occurs within these
receptor cells, rather than in the nerve. The impact of this work extends beyond
taste and chemosensory neurophysiology, to the field of epithelial physiology
where the relation of intracellular to trans-epithelial currents is important,
and to computational modeling in biology. ***
