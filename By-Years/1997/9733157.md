9733157 Wooh This is a Career Award. The objective of the program is twofold:
(1) Research: Develop NDE sensors for high-speed monitoring of defects in rail
tracks and (2) Education: Develop problem-based learning modules and interactive
course materials by bringing exciting research activities into classrooms and
the Internet. This project is outlined as follows: The needs of high-speed
monitoring system for assessing rail condition and integrity are addressed. It
is pointed out that a critical requirement is to develop a sensor system that
does not require contact with the rail surface. Needs of NDE Education: The
needs of introducing innovative and cohesive NDE engineering curricula for
educating today civil engineering students are addressed. The importance of
educating students with multidisciplinary background is pointed out. Also
discussed are the demands of dynamic revision and practice-oriented civil
engineering curricula. Major impact of the project is the development and
transfer of technology to industry, and the potential to address future
engineering education curriculum. ***
