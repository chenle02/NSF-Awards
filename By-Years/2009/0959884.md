Studying the way molecules interact in proteins and polymers, or how stars
interact dynamically in very dense clusters, requires very powerful and very
fast computers. The capabilities of certain kinds of computer processors, called
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) have been expanding rapidly due to a large
commercial market. They are now faster, and cheaper, than conventional Central
Processing Units (CPUs) at the heart of most computers. Dr. Stephen McMillan and
his colleagues at Drexel University are proposing to use these fast, efficient,
and affordable CPUs to speed up the very complicated and lengthy computations
needed in to model the behavior of large collections of stars or molecules.
NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program is funding Dr. McMillan's work
through its Division of Astronomical Sciences.
