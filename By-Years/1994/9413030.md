This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of California--Santa
Barbara in the purchase of Nd:YAG pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO) as
sources of high-brightness, high- resolution tunable radiation. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (a) Electron
Affinity of Carbon and Other Interesting Clusters; (b) Photochemical Properties
of Transition Metal Complexes; (c) Spectroscopic Studies of M+- H2 Complexes
(M=Ca, Sr, and Ba); and (d) Surface Chemistry of State-Selected, Vibrationally
Excited Molecules. A tunable infrared laser can provide important information
about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding
of the properties of reactive and nonreactive of molecules.
