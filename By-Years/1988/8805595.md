The principal investigator will work on two projects in collaboration with many
US and foreign scientist. Both projects relate to stochastic integrals and
stochastic differential equations. The many types of stochastic integrals that
exist at the moment have developed on an ad hoc basis, to fit the particular
needs of the situation. The principal investigator will develop a general
unifying theory based on semi-martingale integrators. It is hoped that in the
process, the traditional assumption of asymptotic quasi-left continuity can be
dropped. This will make the theory much more applicable. A particular
application of interest is in finance theory for the extension of the Black-
Scholes model. The second part of the project will deal with defining stochastic
integrals with anticipating integrands. In traditional definition of stochastic
integrals, the integrand (non-anticipating) is assumed to be dependent only on
the past of the process with respect to which the integral is carried out. This
makes the convergence properties of the integrals easy to prove. However, in
many applications, such as in Volterra equations in Physics, the integrand
cannot be assumed to be non- anticipating. The work will use many technical
results that the principal investigator has developed in the past.
