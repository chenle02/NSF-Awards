9706210 O'Connell The proposed research is to study flow and thermal convection
in the mantle. The work will involve thermal convection calculations for a
spherical Earth model that incorporates the geometry and motions of lithospheric
plates and is constrained by seismic tomographic models of mantle heterogeneity.
The changes of plate geometry and motions over the last 150 My, and the
evolution of the internal heterogeneity and thermal fields are also included in
the model. The work extends recent mantle flow models that predict the motions
of mantle plumes and hot--spots and resolve some problems with plate motions.
The models also predict the motion of the rotation axis, which compares well
with paleomagnetic observations of polar wander. The current work will
incorporate thermal convection effects into the models. This will constitute a
self consistent dynamic investigation of plumes, hotspots, the geoid, and forces
on lithospheric plates. ***
