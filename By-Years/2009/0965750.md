This project is providing need-based scholarships over a five-year span to 20
students who enter engineering degree programs in the area of sustainable energy
at the University of Connecticut. Students are recruited from vocational high
schools based on student scholastic aptitude, financial need, status as a member
of an underrepresented population or the first family member to attend college,
and interest in sustainable energy. Student activities include pre-college
immersive review of math and science subjects; dedicated enrichment and
community-building activities such as workshops, mentoring, industry site
visits, and internships; and advising, tutoring and job placement assistance.
The project offers a novel pipeline for enriching the engineering workforce with
a nontraditional, technically adept, diverse population. An independent
evaluator is involved in project evaluation.
