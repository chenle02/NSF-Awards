Research on conditions that affect the aggregation of particles in water and the
effect of this aggregation on their adsorptive behavior toward substances in
solution is performed. The effects of adsorbate concentrations. solid-liquid
ratios, pH, ionic strength, and particle morphology on the interdependence of
aggregation and adsorption is studied. The results of this research may be
applied to improvement of mathematical models used in environmental engineerng
practice for predicting potential impact of pollutants on natural bodies of
water.
