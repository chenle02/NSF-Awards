The SERYM annual meeting provides a unique opportunity for yeast researchers
from states in the Southeastern region of the U.S. to come together to share
their preliminary research findings, and discuss new research tools and emerging
technologies. Yeasts are an important model for the study of complex molecular,
cellular, biochemical and evolutionary processes. The requested NSF support will
fund the travel expenses of student participants in an effort to maximize the
number of undergraduate and graduate students that can attend this meeting.

Yeast researchers have made significant contributions in areas as diverse as
fungal evolution, DNA damage/repair, gene expression, RNA processing, cell cycle
progression, chromosome segregation, prion propagation, autophagy, and organelle
biogenesis/maintenance.The SERYM 2019 conference organizers are placing
particular emphasis on fostering science discussions during the meeting and
promoting exchange of new ideas among participants, with a particular focus to
stimulate undergraduate and graduate attendees in making presentations during
the meeting and engaging in interactions with more senior scientists. This
meeting,

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
