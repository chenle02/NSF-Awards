McKenzie will investigate algorithmic questions which involve properties of
finite algebras determined by the varieties and quasi-varieties they generate,
and structural questions which involve the necessary algebraic properties that
must be true throughout a locally finite variety or quasi-variety as a
consequence of that class possessing some natural property defined through
logical or set-theoretic means. The outstanding algorithmic questions: Is there
an algorithm to determine if the quasi-equations valid in a finite algebra F are
finitely based? Is there an algorithm to determine if the quasi-variety
generated by F possesses a natural duality? Is the class of finite algebras
possessing a finite equational basis recursively enumerable? Is the class of
finite algebras generating a residually large variety recursively enumerable?
Among the important structural questions: What collection of algebraic
properties is necessary and sufficient for a finitely generated variety to be
finitely decidable, or to have few models? He will work on an algebraic
conjecture that, if proved, would establish an important case of the dichotomy
conjecture for the constraint satisfaction problem of theoretical computer
science: every finite algebra F in a meet semi-distributive variety has finite
relational width.

The principal investigator believes that research into the interplay between,
on the one hand, the existence or nonexistence of algorithms to recognize
fundamental properties of finite algebras, and on the other hand, the levels of
structural complexity manifested in the algebras---what this project is all
about---has the potential not only to expand our understanding of the structural
possibilities in finite algebraic systems (which it has already done), but to
produce fundamental breakthroughs in theoretical computer science. The most
likely place for this to occur soon is in the algebraic approach to the
constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Specific instances of the constraint
satisfaction problem, including graph homomorphism problems, are ubiquitous in
many areas of artificial intelligence, computer science, database theory,
scheduling, networking, hardware verification, etc. The algebraic approach puts
some of the most developed areas of universal algebra, especially the machinery
of tame congruence theory developed by the principal investigator, to work in
the study of combinatorial problems related to the CSP; and it may have
potential applications in the study of other computational paradigms, such as
approximation and randomized algorithms, and quantum computation.
