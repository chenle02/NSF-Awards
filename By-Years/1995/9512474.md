9512474 Hull A focused ion beam (FIB) instrument will be acquired for research
in materials science and biological applications. This instrument produces high
current density, highly collimated beams of positive gallium ions at energies in
the range between 5 and 30 kiloelectron volts. Such beams can be used to
sputter, pattern, or deposit on scales of less than 100 nanometers. These
processes can be viewed dynamically via imaging with secondary electrons or
ions. Specific applications include: (1) micromachining of transmission electron
microscopy samples for electronic device degradation studies; (2) nanoscale
imaging of dopant distribution in semiconductors; (3) mesoscopic lithography for
a wide range of low power and high frequency semiconductor electronic devices
and metal/superconductor heterostructures and tunneling devices; (4) tomographic
imaging of intracellular structure in biological materials. %%% This research
incorporates elements which define broad new applications for focused ion beam
instrumentation such as dopant mapping and tomographic imaging of biological
materials. These novel applications can potentially encourage and accelerate the
development of the technique. In addition, the direct visualization of
sputtering and deposition processes can enhance teaching methods in courses
relating to electronic materials processing and microelectronic device
manufacturing. ***
