Knowledge of the rates of strike-slip motion along plate boundary faults is
important to late Cenozoic tectonism and to earthquake hazard reduction efforts.
This project addresses the Septentrional fault zone in the Dominican Republic
which is the active, on shore extension of the North American- Caribbean plate
boundary. The work will focus on fault trenching at three Quaternary fault
scarps combined with radiocarbon age dating. These data are expected to date the
ages of past earthquakes along the fault and directly determine geologic slip
rates. These results can be used to test conflicting plate motion models and can
be integrated into ongoing marine geophysical survey and GPS experiments along
the plate boundary.
