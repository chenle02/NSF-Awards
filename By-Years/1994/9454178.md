9454178 Kelemanik Dissemination Plan for the Industry Volunteers Model This is a
dissemination/conference project to replicate an "Industry Volunteers in the
Classroom" model developed over the past several years at EDC. The model
involves a collaborative effort between private companies and schools, and can
be made a component of many different kinds of teacher enhancement projects.
Companies in the project target area agree to provide release time for volunteer
employees, so that these employees can take over as substitutes while the
classroom teachers attend teacher enhancement workshops during the regular
school day. The present project has 2 components: (1) "getting the word out" to
potentially interested parties (e.g., PIs of SSIs and USIs; other TE projects,
etc); and (2) providing technical assistance to those seriously interested in
implementing their own Volunteer model. Such assistance includes: providing a
"Handbook" that details how such cooperative ventures can be initiated,
organized, and executed; sending an EDC resource team to the potential
implementation site; telephone conferencing, etc. At the end of the project,
there is a 1-day conference at EDC for those groups who are ready to begin their
implementation. Cost sharing is 5% of the NSF contribution.
