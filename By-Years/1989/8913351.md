The proposal covers four major areas in Stochastic Control. The first concerns
singularly perturbed stochastic systems for both Ito and wide bandwidth noise
driven systems, finite and infinite time problems, parametric singularities and
approximations to the nonlinear filtering problems. The second concerns control,
approximation and limit problems for queues and production systems in heavy
traffic, and associated numerical methods. Special cases includes routing and
singular control, control over an infinite time interval, numerical methods for
scheduling under priorities, and the types of problems which occur in virtual
circuit systems with many lines. The third area is that of efficient numerical
algorithms, where reflected, singular, ergodic, constrained and heavy traffic
problems will be emphasized, since there is relatively little available for
these problems. The last class concerns some promising new approaches to the
efficient and robust monte carlo optimization of parametrized controls of
stochastic systems of high dimension, where the control is based on the actual
observed data.
