This award will support several workshops to catalyze the ecosystem science
community to address research frontiers, opportunities and challenges in
ecosystem science. The effort will be led by a five person steering committee
who will organize and hold a series of workshops and discussion groups at
multiple scientific-society meetings over the next two years, culminating in a
Frontiers of Ecosystem Science Symposium. Relevant target societies include
American Geophysical Union, American Society of Limnology and Oceanography,
American Society of Microbiology, Ecological Society of America, Estuarine
Research Federation, North American Benthological Society, International Society
for Microbial Ecology, International Association of Landscape Ecology,
Association of American Geographers and the Soil Science Society of America.
Project outcomes will include a workshop report, as well one or more peer
reviewed publications that would serve as to guide future directions in
ecosystem science and related disciplines.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;As research is
becoming more interdisciplinary, particularly the science of global
environmental change, ecosystem scientists often find themselves in positions of
intellectual and organizational leadership because of their experience working
across disciplines. Ecosystem science has a long history as a core area of
investigative research, and has never been more relevant to the needs of society
and the nation. All activities in this project will involve a gender-balanced
assemblage of early-career and established investigators, participation by
students and postdoctoral researchers, and members from underrepresented groups
in science.
