This grant supports American students and researchers to participate in the USA-
Sino Summer School in Vision, Learning, and Pattern Recognition. The event
brings together a high-quality team of leading American and Chinese researchers
in computer vision and multimedia to offer a one-week educational and cultural
exchange program to students and junior scholars from both US and China. The
summer school provides a venue for the participants to explore a variety of
aspects and applications on how to address the challenges in large-scale visual
data/media acquisition, processing/computing, understanding, and search. The
international interactions can foster new understanding and new collaborations
in science, education, and culture.
