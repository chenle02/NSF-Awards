9625161 Bayly This CAREER project emphasizes the integration of education and
research in the areas of dynamic system theory and control. In the education
plan, insight into nonlinear systems is enhanced through physical experiments,
undergraduate and graduate course development, and outreach activities. The
research applications deal with two areas: rotorcraft dynamics, and the dynamics
of ventricular fibrillation. Specifically, stabilization of periodic orbits in
rotocrafts is investigated providing a theoretical basis for an autopilot that
stabilizes underlying unstable or neutrally stable periodic behavior. In the
area of dynamics and control of ventricular fibrillation, an experimental
project is carried out in collaboration with a medical team from the University
of Alabama at Birmingham and Cardiac Pace Makers, Inc. Emphases is on the
development of quantitative methods to characterize the dynamics of ventricular
fibrillation, algorithms to predict and control nonlinear dynamics, and clinical
methods to improve regional capture of ventricular fibrillation by pacing
stimuli.***
