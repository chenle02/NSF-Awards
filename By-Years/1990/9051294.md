This instrumentation for Thermogravimetric Analysis and Diffrential Scanning
Calorimetry will equip undergraduate laboratories in analytical, physical, and
polymer chemistry at the University of Florida. It will be used to characterize
and quantify mixtures of inorganic materials in an instrumental analysis
laboratory incorporating physical chemistry and physical polymer students.
