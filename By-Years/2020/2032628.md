Establishing Open Science as the default practice in the academic community is
critical. Reporting a research result is more than just the manuscript. It is
the actual process undertaken, the data (and metadata), the implemented software
(and environment), and more. It is also important to ask questions pertaining to
transparency and reproducibility, such as those regarding their reviews,
publishing metadata, and, in particular, Where are the data and software that
underlie their reported results? By making the connections between these
artifacts through Open Science practices, it democratizes research by lowering
the barrier of entry to understanding (and replicating) cutting edge research,
while simultaneously accelerating novel research by reducing the need to re-
implement software or re-collect data. Connecting these components and data in a
useful and understandable way is a core mission of Semantic Web research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to leverage the leadership and reputation
of the Semantic Web journal by IOS Press to demonstrate that the open sharing of
data underlying publications can be done without significant overhead and
provides significant added value. The PIs will, for this journal, require
authors to sustainably publish the data and software underlying their results,
include software and data provision as part of the peer review assessment, and
publish rich metadata for the supplementary data and software. The PIs will
develop technology in support of open science and will work with the community
to refine the software and policies that enhance open science for the Semantic
Web journal. The approach can serve as a model for other journal editors who
seek a blueprint for adopting similar Open Science Data
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
