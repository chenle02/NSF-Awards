This study investigates the nature of ecological interactions of two
taxonomically disparate organisms sharing refuge habitats during early life
history stages. Laboratory and field experiments will examine interspecific
processes of competition and predation and their interactions between
populations of larval fish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and postlarval grass shrimp
(Palaemonetes pugio) which co-occur on vegetated saltmarsh surfaces in shallow
aquatic microhabitats. Both species exhibit rapid declines in numbers following
concurrent peak recruitment of juveniles onto intertidal marshes. Density-
dependent intraspecific and interspecific effects on survivorship and growth
rates will be the focus of this research. Interspecific competition, resource
depletion, and indirect effects on meiofauna will be examined in laboratory
microcosms. Field experiments using enclosures on the vegetated intertidal marsh
will assess predation and interspecific competitive effects. Understanding
biotic interactions in this system should contribute to a broader understanding
and appreciation of the role of interspecific interactions on recruitment
variability affecting critical early life history stages of organisms.
