They will complete investigations of how finite size scaling bahavior and the
reduction in spin-freezing temperature Tg with decreasing sample thickness L in
copper manganese depend upon different manganese concentrations, different
interlayer materials, and different sample preparation conditions. They will
begin studies of how reducing L affects dynamical properties such as
irreversibility and relaxation phenomena in copper manganese below Tg and begin
studies of the 3D to 2D crossover in spin-glasses other than copper manganese.
They will also measure ac susceptibility in collaboration with L.P. Levy.
