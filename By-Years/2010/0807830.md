AST-0807830&lt;br/&gt;Baragiola&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses
radiation effects on surface ices in outer solar system objects using laboratory
techniques. Effects that alter the appearance of the ices are of special
interest because they are significant for remote sensing of icy satellites,
planetary rings and trans-Neptunian objects. Effects being explored include: a)
the stability of molecules trapped in ice subject to ultraviolet solar radiation
and magnetospheric ion impact; b) the relative efficiency of photons, electrons,
light and heavy ions in affecting crystalline ice; and c) the electrostatic
charging of surface ice by energetic particle impact. The research will use a
unique combination of experimental techniques: exposure to ion, electron and
laser beams and vacuum ultraviolet light, optical spectroscopy and
interferometry, and microgravimetry and mass spectrometry at cryogenic
temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include
inspiring students and educating them in the characteristics needed for quality
research, professional development of early career scientists, and increased
participation of under-represented groups. The work also brings techniques from
surface science into laboratory astronomy.
