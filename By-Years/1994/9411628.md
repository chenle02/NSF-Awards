This mechanical testing system with controlled atmosphere for experiments on
advanced materials will permit studies of creep, fatigue, and quasi-static
mechanical testing in inert and oxidizing environments at temperatures up to
1700 Centigrade. Research areas include high-temperature deformation of fiber-
reinforced metal and ceramic composites, superplasticity and creep of fine-
grained ceramics, metals and composites, stress corrosion in metals and metal
matrix composites, and deformation twining in intermetallic alloys. This system
will help establish a center for composites research, which is a major new
initiative at the University of Southern California.The system will also be used
in materials-related research projects such as fatigue durability of dental
composite restoratives, and solid mechanics of advanced structural materials.
