A series of projects in nuclear astrophysics will be undertaken. These include
studies of nuclear reactions with electron screening taking into account, an
analysis of the light curves and long term evolution of novae, nucleosynthesis
in nova explosions, nucleosynthesis in the explosion of massive stars, abundance
history of light elements in the galaxy, the formation of globular clusters and
the collapse history of the Milky Way galaxy.
