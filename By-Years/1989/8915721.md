This research will continue the operation of the neutron monitor at Mt.
Washington, to use cosmic ray data from the IMP8, Voyager 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10
spacecraft to investigate the cosmic ray intensity at the various heliocentric
distances (1 &lt; R &lt; 51 AU ) and to study the acceleration, injection and
propagation of solar protons for a few selected solar cosmic ray events. It will
concentrate on the following tasks: 1) onset of the new modulation cycle in
1987-1988 as a function of heliocentric radius; 2) heliospheric boundary
modulation; 3) theoretical boundary; 4) integral latitudinal and radial cosmic
ray gradients in the outer heliosphere; 5) effects of the wavy current sheet
upon the cosmic ray modulation; 6) other studies: a) acceleration, injection and
transport of protons in selected solar cosmic ray events; and b) cosmic ray
modulation during Forbush decreases. ***//
