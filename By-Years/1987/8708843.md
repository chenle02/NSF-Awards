As much as 50-80 percent of the surface of a typical blade of a gas turbine is
covered by flow undergoing transition from the laminar regime to the turbulent
regime. The insufficiency of current models for predicting heat transfer at the
surface of gas turbine blades can be traced to the present inability to predict
the onset of transition and to model the energy transport in a boundary layer
undergoing transition. The proposed research will experimentally investigate the
effect on transition of the following three parameters: (a) freestream
turbulence intensity, (b) surface curvature, and (c) streamwise pressure
gradient.
