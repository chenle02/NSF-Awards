This proposal requests support for automated equipment for use in assembling
and testing state-of-the-art silicon detectors and custom designed VLSI
electronics to be used in several high priority experiments in the EPP program.
This in-house facility will replace contractual work which cannot now meet the
custom requirements of these detectors. Students and post-doctoral researchers
will receive valuable training in the advanced techniques that are necessary in
this project.
