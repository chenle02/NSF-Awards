Signals that are recorded on the earth's surface from earthquake and/or man-made
source generated waves have encoded within their character information about the
subsurface the waves have experienced. Recent advances in exploration seismology
allow for both removal of reverberant events and mapping of the physical
characteristics of subsurface targets without knowledge of the medium above
those reflectors. This project investigates the feasibility of using an inverse
scattering series approach to perform direct imaging of deeper subsurface
structure with elastic waves recorded by passive seismic arrays. High
performance computation at a level beyond that in current three dimensional
seismic processing will be employed; ultimately, this extension and application
of new seismic imaging and inversion concepts and algorithms will significantly
advance understanding and knowledge of deep earth processes and
structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to extend and
adapt recently developed seismic methods designed for hydrocarbon exploration
and production, in the relatively shallow subsurface, to investigate and define
much deeper earth structure using both earthquakes and man-made energy sources
on or near the surface.&lt;br/&gt;
