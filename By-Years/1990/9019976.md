This study proposes to develop a theory of heterogeneous poroelastic media whose
material properties are characterized by several distinct length scales (e.g.
grains, layers, global). The modern mathematical techniques of homogenization
theory, so far developed for composite media will be extended. The constitutive
coefficients for quasi static thermal consolidation, and dynamic poroelasticity
will be studied. Explicit calculations for a simple but versatile 3-D micro
structure (Wigner-Seitz polyhedron) will be performed. The transversely
isotropic macroscale equations will be solved for several physical problems such
as the rising geothermal plume, the submerged point sink, etc., and seismic wave
propagation.
