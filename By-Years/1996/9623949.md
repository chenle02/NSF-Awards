9623949 Schultz This project will focus on the development of advanced
instrumentation in two areas. In the first, we will utilize a 50nm plasmon
resonant particle as the optical transducer to achieve scanning near-field
microscopy in the fluorescent, luminescent, and Raman modes. We expect this
development to have significant applications in the electronics, chemical, and
bio-medical research and industrial communities. In the second area, we will
apply the most sensitive technique for the efficient detection of
superconductivity to a systematic search for new high Tc alloys using phase
spread samples. %%% This project will focus on the development of advanced
instrumentation for commercial application in two important areas. The first is
a new type of optical microscope which will offer a breakthrough in resolution
and sensitivity of detection for many bio-medical tests and research needs. The
second will utilize the most sensitive and economical screening procedure which
we have developed for the discovery of new high temperature superconductors.
Rapid technology transfer in both areas can be expected via subsequent
cooperative SBIR projects. ***
