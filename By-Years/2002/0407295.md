AST-0407295&lt;br/&gt;Urry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an investigation
of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies, with the aim of
understanding the AGN-galaxy connection. Host galaxies will be compared with
their non-active counterparts, using stellar velocity dispersions and sub-
arcsecond imaging. Different methods of estimating central black hole mass
(including reverberation mapping) will be compared, in work that should increase
the present sample size by an order of magnitude. Mass accretion rates will be
estimated from AGN spectra, and the relation of these rates and of the black
hole mass to other AGN properties will be studied. This should allow the
construction of a self-consistent evolutionary picture for black holes and
galaxies combined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study involves student research,
comprising the major part of one graduate thesis, and since the public interest
in black holes remains high, the results can be expected to have noticeable
impact on a non-specialist audience.
