The team will assemble optical and infrared observations of hundreds of
thousands of galaxies. The observations pick out galaxies about 10 to 12 billion
years back in time. This period is known to be one of hectic change for
galaxies. The team will study how these changes depend on whether a galaxy has
many neighbors, or no neighbors at all. This important topic could not be
studied before because not enough observations were available. The team will
release their assembled catalog to the public. Senior team members will train
junior members. The team will give public talks, offer residential workshops to
teachers and develop a three-dimensional show for a children's science museum.

In a tour de force, the team will combine data from five deep, wide-area galaxy
surveys that include both photometry and integral-field-unit spectroscopy. They
will use the combined data to study galaxy evolution over the full range of
galactic environments at redshifts z ~ 1.9 to 3.5. These are key redshifts for
galaxy evolution, as they probe the assembly of massive galaxies, the peaks in
star formation and black-hole accretion, and the collapse of the largest proto-
clusters of galaxies. The team will amass photometry for about 600,000 galaxies
and spectroscopy for about 260,000 galaxies. Using this dataset, the team will
conduct statistically meaningful analyses that were heretofore impossible.
