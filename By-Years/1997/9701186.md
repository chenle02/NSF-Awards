9701186 Barnes The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) will operate
the R/V URRAC'A during 1997 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-
sponsored research projects. The URRAC'A is a 96' general research vessel
operated by STRI. The vessel is scheduled for 128 operating days in 1997, of
which 33 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. The ship operates
primarily in the coastal waters of the Panama Canal zone, including the
Caribbean and Pacific. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National
Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institutions around the country.
