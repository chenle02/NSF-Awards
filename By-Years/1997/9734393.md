Jordan 9734393 This proposal is concerned with integrating a research program
in the mechanics of swimming with a teaching program in biomechanics to generate
an atmosphere where undergraduate students can team about the physics of biology
and the processes of science. The research aspect of this proposal focuses on
the swimming performance consequences of morphological and physiological
variation in aquatic animals. At issue is the idea that the muscles which
generate force do so in a way that depends upon their speed of shortening which
in turn determines the hydrodynamic force produced by the muscle. Thus, a
complete analysis of swimming would solve, simultaneously, the force-velocity
relationships for both muscle and fluid-dynamic forces. The proposed work will
attack this "force balance" with both experimental and theoretical approaches
for analyses of swimming in anuran tadpoles. As a model system, tadpoles are
ideal for studies of scale effects on swimming performance. These animals propel
themselves by an retrograde bending wave on the tail, show a dramatic
ontogenetic size variation, and an intriguing predator-induced morphological
variation which appears to confer a swimming performance advantage over non-
induced forms. This research program will be integrated into a teaching program
by bringing the experimental techniques of biomechanics into the classroom.
Through demonstrations, laboratory exercises and independent research projects,
students will be able to apply what they have learned in their biomechanics
coursework, as well as other biology and engineering courses, in an effort to
understand the physical constraints and determinants of swimming performance.
