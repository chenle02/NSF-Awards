A laser Raman spectrometer is being acquired. This instrument will provide
capabilities for conducting research in heterogeneous catalysis. These
capabilities cannot be matched with any of the available facilities.
Incorporation of the laser Raman spectroscopy technique to the ongoing research
programs on selective oxidation of lower molecular weight hydrocarbons and on
catalytic incineration of organic air pollutants will open up new avenues for
research such as in situ characterization of the catalyst synthesis process,
characterization of catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions, investigation
of adsorbent-adsorbate interactions, in situ characterization of catalyst
deactivation process and identification of active catalytic sites by use of
isotopically labelled reactants. Since in situ characterization of catalyst
surfaces is the key to acquiring an indepth understanding of the catalysis
phenomenon, availability of this technique will help us answer several
fundamental questions regarding catalytic activity, selectivity and reaction
schemes. Only such fundamental understanding will make the solid state design of
active and selective catalysts possible.
