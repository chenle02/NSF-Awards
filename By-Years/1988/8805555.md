The eggshells of the African Ostrich (Struthio camelus) are frequently found in
association with cultural remains in sites throughout Africa, the Near East and
Asia. Proteinaceous material involved in secretion of the calcite matrix of the
eggshells is retained with almost no loss over time spans in excess of 100,000
years, despite nearly complete hydrolysis into the constituent amino acids.
Laboratory simulation of extreme- leaching environments confirms that
effectively no leaching of amino acids from the eggshells occurs. Ostrich
eggshells thus offer the closest approximation to a perfect closed system of any
material yet studied. The method has potential to provide chronological control
for the critical period in hominid development beyond the range of radiocarbon
dating back to approximately 200,000 years or more. The PI will evaluate the
isoleucine epimerization reaction in ostrich eggshells by measuring D/L ratios
in eggshell from stratified sites and in independently-dated material, as well
as in a series of elevated- temperature experiments, and will use these data to
refine a computer-simulation of non-linear epimerization kinetics. The
construction of a reliable model to convert D/L ratios into absolute age, and
the development of a rapid procedure for the isolation of milligram quantities
of amino acids from carbonate fossils will provide significant improvements in
the dating of Old World hominid sites.
