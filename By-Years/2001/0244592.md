ABSTRACT CTS-0244592 K. Stebe, Johns Hopkins University

The behavior of thin liquid films, with suspended nanoparticles, on
energetically non-uniform solid substrates will be investigated in the proposed
project. The research is proposed in two steps. The first part is to harness
interfacial interactions, which dominate at small scales, in evaporating water
films to direct the formation of new fluid microstructures. The second part is
to study methods for depositing nanoparticles on surfaces by dispersion of
nanoparticles in the liquid layer and systematic evaporation using surfactants
in the liquid surface. If successful, this research could have significant
impact on many applications including storage devices, biosensors, and MEMS
devices.
