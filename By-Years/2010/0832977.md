The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Western Alliance to Expand
Student Opportunities (WAESO) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program, under the
leadership of Arizona State University, incorporates a sequence of supervised
program activities in which selected fellows will participate under the unifying
themes of Biodesigned and Sustainable Bridges to the Doctorate. The activities
involve, in addition to traditional departments, the interdisciplinary Biodesign
Institute, the Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI) and the
urbanization research effort within the Global Institute of Sustainability
(GIS). Program activities are designed to assist students in progressing forward
in their research and in obtaining an early realization of the many benefits
that materialize after obtaining the doctorate. There will also be a program
emphasis in mentoring these students to apply for Sloan, Ford, NASA and NSF
Graduate Fellowships for support as they continue in their studies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the program is to bridge the number of
underrepresented minority students pursuing doctoral degrees in STEM
disciplines. This two-year fellowship-research program involves a cohort of 12
selected students from all STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
