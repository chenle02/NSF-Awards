The American Psychological Association, a non-profit scientific organization,
was awarded funds to make individual travel awards to US psychologists and other
social scientists. The awards will defray a portion of their travel expenses
connected with participation in the XXVI Inter-American Congress of Psychology
in Sao Paolo, Brazil, in July, 1997. By sponsoring the attendance of US
researchers at the international meeting, the travel award program contributes
to greater understanding and cooperation between psychological researchers in
the US, and those in Central and South America.
