On the wake of Hurricane Hugo two issues will be examined in this study: the
effect that shelter near or around buildings has on the survivability of the
structures; and the degree of wind engineering knowledge being applied to
reconstruction. A survey of damaged and destroyed buildings in South Carolina
and of the reconstruction process will be conducted and recorded, and a
preliminary analysis will be carried out that will be of great benefit to the
wind engineering community.
