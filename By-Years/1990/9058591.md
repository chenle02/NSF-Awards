This award provides funds for a PYI award to an outstanding young scientist
interested in the development of new technologies to facilitate separation and
isolation of very large DNA molecules. His planned activities include the
development of new methods for enhancing the size resolution in separating very
large DNA's, the application of fluorescence light microscopy for image analysis
of single DNA molecules, and the study of biological functions of very large DNA
pieces, such as centromeres. The ultimate goal of Dr. Schwartz's research is to
increase our understanding of physical chemistry of biological macromolecules,
which will enable molecular biologists to isolate and characterize intact
biological macromolecules such as genes, antibodies, and viruses. As such, the
proposed research has potential for an immediate application to the development
of new analytical technologies as well as implications to fundamental biology.
