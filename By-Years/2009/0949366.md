This grant supports acquisition of equipment to establish a sedimentology lab at
Coastal Carolina University (CCU). Equipment that will be acquired includes a
laser diffraction particle size analyzer, stereomicroscope, purified water
system, microbalance, benchtop centrifuge, laboratory oven, sample microsplitter
and vortex mixer. Characterization of grain size, shape, particle distribution,
and mineralogy will aid in determination of sediment provenance and the
hydrodynamic conditions of deposition for studies of barrier beach evolution and
dynamics, coastal sediment transport processes and studies of sea level history
as recorded in coastal sediments. Particle size analysis will also aid studies
in benthic ecology, environmental water quality and geoarchaeology. The
equipment will support faculty and student research and research training
including two early career PIs. CCU boasts the largest undergraduate Marine
Science program on the east coast and has recently developed and
interdisciplinary Masters graduate program in Coastal Marine and Wetland
Studies. The equipment will support student training in modern sedimentary
analysis methods.
