In this project, the P.I. will carry out laboratory experiments and numerical
studies of unsteady two-layer strait and sill flow. Analysis of such flows
typically uses steady or quasi-steady two- layer hydraulic theory, the validity
of which has not been adequately tested for time-dependent flows, such as
barotropic tidal forcing. The first approach to this problem will be a
laboratory experiment on the effect of unsteady barotropic forcing on the
classic lock-exchange problem, focusing on issues of control establishment and
maximal exchange. The second approach will be a numerical study of the
generation of long nonlinear- dispersive waves by time dependent transcritical
forcing.
