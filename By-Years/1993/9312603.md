This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research in support of the Intelligent
Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Initiative. In an unprecedented world wide effort,
numerous commercial organizations and universities have joined together under
the aegis of the IMS test case for rapid prototyping to conduct a one year
feasibility study. This grant provides partial support for a student to work in
this effort. This support is important in that it provides student involvement
in a project that may be the forerunner of a new paradigm for the way research
is to be performed. //
