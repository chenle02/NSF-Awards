This project is concerned with the study of the effects of natural selection
and diffusion on a population consisting of a single evolving species with a
genetic system of one locus with two alleles. The model is an example from
evolutionary ecology, which is a fusion of population ecology with population
genetics. The model is more realistic than those encountered in the classical
theory of population genetics because it allows density dependent selection. It
is assumed that increase in population size decreases the fitness of the
individuals in the population. A future goal will be to study the case of
several interacting species, or coevolutionary theory with diffusion.
Mathematically, this is a system of reaction-diffusion equations. It is
necessary to prove the existence of travelling waves connecting two rest points
lying on different invariant manifolds. Each of these manifolds corresponds to
the absence of one allele. The stability of these waves will be examined. The
results will give a more complete picture of what has been shown by the
principal investigator on the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the reaction-
diffusion system. It will give insight into the ways to handle systems where the
maximum principle is hard to apply.
