This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to apply
the polarization properties of light reflected from vegetation to examine
environmental stress and species-specific identifiers by remote sensing. The
research will impact science by creating a body of experimental data on the
diffuse reflectance spectra of plant species. The proposed methods could be used
to optimize fertilizer use and to detect invasive species that can cause huge
crop losses.

The primary commercial application for these sensors will be in agriculture,
especially in large-scale precision farming. The relatively low cost of these
sensors and large markets in which they could be used, should promote prompt
commercialization of the technology following successful demonstration.
