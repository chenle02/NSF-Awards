Students are using a computer laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2 Model 50
microcomputers. Graphing and symbol manipulating software packages are being
used in calculus, and some other, courses to allow students to perform
experiments. This will enhance student's ability to understand the underlying
concepts. The institution will provide funds to match this grant.
