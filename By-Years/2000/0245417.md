ABSTRACT. This conference on Partial Differential Equations and Applications to
be held at the University of Notre Dame in August 2003 will bring together
experts from nonlinear elliptic, parabolic, and evolution equations and their
applications, numerical methods in electromagnetics and acoustics, and reaction-
diffusion equations in biological modeling, to share their research results,
ideas, and insight regarding future directions. The conference is of
interdisciplinary character with strong connections to sciences and engineering.
There is a multitude of challenging, open problems where progress could be of
great interest to a wider scientific community. Such progress requires expert
knowledge of advanced and technically difficult mathematics as well as an
understanding of current problems and methods of physics, chemistry, biology,
and engineering. Young researchers and graduate students, in particular women
and minorities, are especially invited to participate in this conference and
interact with specialists in diverse areas, thus helping them enhance their
scientific development in mathematics the sciences and engineering.
