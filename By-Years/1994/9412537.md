Jochim With national Science Foundation support, Drs. Michael Jochim and
Margaret Glass will continue their archaeological study of an area of Southern
Germany which runs from the Swabian Alb, across the Danube River to the Alps. It
thus includes a variety of environmental zones. Archaeological evidence
indicates that human prehistoric occupation was extensive and ranged across time
to include Paleolithic hunters and gatherers, specialist Mesolithic collectors
and Neolithic agriculturalists. Drs. Jochim and Glass want to understand how
humans adapted to this region under the different climatic conditions which
include both the terminal Ice Age and warmer postglacial times. To accomplish
this, they will compile a data base which contains both environmental and
cultural information and will integrate these materials through use of a
geographic information system (GIS). Known sites will be recorded and overlain
on an environmental base. Both surface and subsurface survey will then be
employed to locate additional archaeological occurrences. The GIS will permit
the team to relate behavior to environment and to determine how behavior changed
in different subregions, in different climatic regimes, and at different levels
of technological development. This research is important because it will provide
insight into how humans adapt to and interact with their environment. This
process is dynamic, not static and archaeological data, which covers long
periods of time provide unique insight into this issue. The project will also
produce data of interest to many archaeologists and will assist in the training
of graduate students.
