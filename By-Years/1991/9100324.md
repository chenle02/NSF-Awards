The principal investigator will continue studying the relationship between
symmetries of various fundamental partial differential equations and
q-difference equations, the coordinate systems in which it is possible to
separate variables and the properties of the special functions that solve the
separated equations. In particular, the principal investigator will determine a
practical definition of variable separation that applies to all systems of
partial differential equations. Next he will attack the problem of intrinsic
characterization of separable coordinates. Finally he will determine the special
functions that arise as solutions of the sets of separated equations and study
their properties.
