Every surface can be approximated by a space obtained by gluing together
triangles. This fact is used, for example, in computer graphics where animated
figures are represented by moving polyhedra. Similarly, curved spaces in three
dimensions, which are important in Einstein's relativity theory, can be
represented by spaces obtained by gluing together tetrahedra. This project will
study abstract properties of a space by using the concrete combinatorics of the
gluing pattern. This approach is well suited for computer experimentation, and
students participating in the research can perform experiments without fully
understanding the abstract theory. The investigator and his students will
explore new structures, derive new formulas for invariants, perform extensive
computer experiments, and extend the underlying theory to higher
dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study certain configuration
spaces of flags introduced by Fock and Goncharov. These configuration spaces
have concrete coordinates and very interesting structures. The coordinates give
rise to explicit coordinates on higher Teichmuller spaces for triangulated
surfaces, and to coordinates on the (decorated) character variety of
triangulated 3-manifolds. The cluster structure of the coordinates also gives
rise to explicit formulas for invariants such as the Chern-Simons invariant. The
work will investigate the structure of the configuration spaces and explore
their relationship to polylogarithms. The project aims to derive new formulas
for invariants and extend the theory to higher dimensions.
