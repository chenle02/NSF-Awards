In this project, the investigator investigates two kinds of moduli spaces in
algebraic geometry, one is the moduli of stable morphisms and the other is the
moduli of stable sheaves. Both moduli spaces are closely related to the research
in Super- String theories. Specifically, the investigator works on four research
directions. The first is on the effective construction of virtual moduli cycles.
The second is to continue working on degeneration of the moduli spaces,
including the moduli of stable sheaves and stable morphisms. The third is to
study open string theory in Calabi-Yau manifolds and the last to study some new
conjectures on the moduli of stable sheaves.

This project is a research in algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematical
science. The investigator studies the properties of certain spaces (called
moduli space in mathematics) that consist of objects that can be characterized
by algebraic properties. (An example is the roots of polynomials). These spaces
are important because they are part of the building blocks of the Super-String
theory in high energy physics, a theory devoted to unify quantum mechanic and
gravity. In the last decade, research in Super-String theory raised many
challenging questions about these spaces, some remains open. This research
project will address some of these challenge.
