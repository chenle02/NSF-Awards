Instrumentation will be provided by this grant that will establish a tunable CW
laser facility in the Physics Department at the University of Washington. This
will make possible new range of precision experiments in atomic physics using
the trapping of single atoms to establish more stable time and frequency
standards, as well as new tests of atomic parity and time reversal symmetry
violation. In addition, this new facility will aid in the study of condensed
matter interfaces and heterostructures. The facility will provide cw laser
operation from the ultraviolet region through the near infrared.
