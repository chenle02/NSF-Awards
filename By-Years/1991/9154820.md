This proposal requests partial funding for the development of a new
paleobiology hall at the University of Nebraska State Museum. This project will
give students and the general public a dynamic view of the period of time known
as the Age of Reptiles. It emphasizes experience with interactive exhibits that
focus on concepts of geologic time, how species adapt and change, relative size,
scale and time, the activities of scientists as role models, and it provides
reinforcement of these experiences for students in the classroom. This project
includes the first use in a museum of SemNet, a software program designed for
concept mapping and the representation of knowledge networks, which will be used
with a videodisc. Prototypes of all interactive exhibits will undergo formative
evaluation to establish maximal audience accessibility, ease of use and
educational effectiveness. The exhibit concepts will be disseminated throughout
the state of Nebraska through mini- versions, teachers in-service training, and
scientist-in- residence programs. This project will also be used as a teaching
laboratory for the University of Nebraska's graduate program in Museum Studies.
