This award provides support for the Geographical and Geospatial Sciences
Committee (GGSC). The GGSC is a standing committee of the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, a non-governmental institution that
provides independent, objective advice to inform policy with evidence, spark
progress and innovation, and confront challenging issues for the benefit of
society. The GGSC provides an important convening function for discussion and
sharing of knowledge among academia, government, non-governmental organizations,
and the private sector. The committeeâ€™s meetings, workshops, and lectures bring
together geographers, spatial data scientists, and practitioners in relevant
fields to exchange ideas and knowledge. The GGSC increases the impact of
geography, mapping science, and geographic information science within the
National Academies and among federal agencies and other
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GGSC supports and informs science-based
policy efforts and decision-making on issues important to the geographical and
geospatial sciences community, which helps to ensure that these fields remain an
important area of growth for the nation. This award allows the GGSC to explore
the following themes in its meetings and activities: anticipating and responding
to environmental disruptions such as climate change or drought, remote sensing
to assist humanitarian response to crises, advancing analysis of mixed
quantitative and qualitative data, geographic and geospatial dataset uncertainty
and bias, sovereignty and ethics of data collection and use, and mapping the
future. These are areas where near-term input and engagement from the
geographical and geospatial sciences community are critical and can help the
nation with future policy decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
