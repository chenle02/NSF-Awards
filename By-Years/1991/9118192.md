A multidisciplinary study will examine certain important adaptations of the
Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) which have made it a champion diver able
to reach great depths (500m) for long periods (over an hour) in the Antarctic
Ocean. Scientists will focus on mechanisms of gas transport in the free diving
seal, using non-invasive ultrasonography to evaluate the oxygen storage capacity
of the seal's spleen and continuous laser spectrophotometry to study during free
diving the role of oxymyoglobin in skeletal muscle oxygen stores. The diversion
of oxyhemoglobin to the heart and brain in lieu of the peripheral circulation
will be examined. A velocity meter will be perfected to enable an estimate of
the metabolic demands in diving seals. These pioneering techniques of
microprocessor monitoring of free diving seals were developed by this team on
previous Antarctic expeditions. In parallel studies, the heart rate alterations
of fetal seals which allow this Antarctic seal to tolerate prolonged periods of
hypoxia during diving will be studied. This research project will advance an
understanding of how adult and fetal marine mammals dive for prolonged periods.
