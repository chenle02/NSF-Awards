Efficient communication is at the very heart of extracting performance from a
parallel or distributed system. The design of a parallel or distributed network
involves a number of complex design choices. This research aims at providing a
sound theoretical basis for making these choices and help meet the challenges of
the evolving National Information Infrastructure (NII). This project will study
important theoretical issues in the design of parallel or distributed networks
that guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) performance metrics. Further, this
effort will focus on simple implementable protocols for store-and-forward,
wormhole, and deflection routing. This project will investigate theoretical
aspects of wireless communication, including call admission algorithms, and
algorithms for mobility management. The education plan includes activities
involving research into novel teaching methodologies, participating in teaching
seminars, and consulting with experienced educators. A new core undergraduate
course in algorithms will be developed with the aim of integrating algorithmic
theory with algorithmic practice. The course will focus on a number of teaching
innovations. ***
