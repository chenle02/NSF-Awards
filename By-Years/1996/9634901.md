This research develops a generalized methodology for modeling, simulation and
design of systems that intentionally or inherently involve switching phenomena.
Physical switches are ubiquitous in physical and engineering problems, and their
effects are realized in stick-slip friction, clutching processes, power
electronic switching, hydraulic valving, and other critical processes. The
research methodology integrates bond-graph representations and wave-scattering
formalisms. The wave-scattering approach makes possible a formulation for a
physical switching element that includes the ideal switch behavior as a special
case. Further, integration of switching system representations with distributed-
parameter elements and thermodynamic considerations is made possible as well.
Because the scattering formulation can be integrated seamlessly with a bond
graph approach, a methodology can be developed for representing the physical
topology of a wide class of multi-energy domain systems. The results from this
work will make a significant impact on computer-aided modeling, simulation, and
design of a large class of systems and physical processes. Small-scale
laboratory testing will be used to qualify and evaluate the approach and
methods. In addition, a collaboration with the Center for Electromechanics at
the University of Texas at Austin and the center's industrial and federal
partners will make available experimental and research development resources for
testing these techniques in high- performance switching controllers for traction
motors. Ongoing collaboration with research personnel in the automotive industry
provides another opportunity to tailor and assess the capability of the research
results to industrially significant problems.
