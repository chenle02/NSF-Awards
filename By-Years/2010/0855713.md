Building off geometric constructions of Beilinson, Lusztig, and MacPherson, the
PI in collaboration with Mikhail Khovanov categorified quantum sl(n), as well as
the quantum deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of the ``lower-
triangular'' subalgebra for an arbitrary Kac-Moody Lie algebra. While these
categorifications are completely combinatorial, they utilize various
diagrammatic calculi emphasizing a new interplay between topology and algebra.
The proposal aims to further develop the theory of categorified quantum groups,
study their Hopf structure (comultiplication and antipode), further develop
their representation theory, categorify the entire quantum enveloping algebra
for other Kac-Moody Lie algebras, and understand the relationship to geometric
representation theory. Potential applications of categorified of quantum groups
include the study of positivity properties for quantum enveloping algebras, a
representation theoretic explanation of Khovanov homology and a categorification
of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum 3-manifold invariants.

Quantum groups are prevalent throughout mathematics and theoretical physics.
These Hopf algebras provide the representation theoretic framework for
understanding quantum link invariants such as the Jones polynomial, Kauffman and
HOMFLY-PT polynomial, as well as the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum
3-manifold invariants. They also relate to statistical mechanics, quantum field
theory, and affine Lie algebras. Recent work suggests that the representation
theory of quantum groups, and the quantum groups themselves, are shadows of a
much richer algebraic structure known as categorified quantum groups. These
structures were conjectured to exist by Crane and Frenkel and form the focal
point of this proposal.
