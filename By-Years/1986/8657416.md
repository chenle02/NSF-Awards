This Presidential Young Investigator Award will fund research focusing on the
study of supervisory control for a biped walking robot. This will provide robot
operators with a convenient software environment for programming motion of the
robot. The long-term goal is to enable design and implementation of practically-
useful biped robots to replace humans in hostile environments and automated
factories.
