9703527 DaSilva The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiaae to produce proteins is
limited by the narrow choice of vectors available for gene delivery. Currently,
plasmids can be employed to introduce single genes at low copy number. When
multiple copies are delivered by delta mediated delivery, the multiple sets are
inserted in tandem leading to instability. There is no method available
currently that can be used for the controlled addition of multiple genes or
multiple, non- tandem copies to S. cerevisiae. This SGER proposal will test the
feasibility of using yeast transposes, mobile segments of DNA that replicate by
a retrovirus-like mechanism, to act as vectors for foreign genes. A cassette
will be constructed that contains the gene of interest (in this case the gene
for beta- galactosidase for ease of assay) plus a selection gene that can be
used to select transposed yeast cells and latter deleted by a "popping out"
mechanism so the cassette and same marker can be used to insert another gene.
The URA3 gene flanked by two direct bacterial his G repeats will be used as the
on-off switch. The transposed cells will be selected on uracil-deficient plates
and then the cells that have been "popped-out" will be selected on 5-FOA which
allows only those cells without the URA3 gene to grow. ***
