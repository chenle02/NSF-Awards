The central aim of this proposed research is to provide a critical reappraisal
of so-called empirical laws of trophic structure in real ecosystems. In
collaboration with researchers at the University of Wisconsin Trout Lake
Station, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the first whole-
system data base designed specifically to represent the trophic structure of a
large-scale ecosystem will be assembled. Because aquatic environments represent
the largest fraction of systems upon which the food web laws are based, this
effort will focus on Little Rock Lake, a long-term study site which has been
extensively studied as part of an ongoing experimental acid rain monitoring
project, and which promises to yield a suite of 24 highly detailed food web data
sets. A pilot study confirmed the availability of a surprisingly large amount of
trophic information here and the relatively high degree of taxonomic and
temporal resolution that could be attempted. Amount the details that will be
included in this study are: a full and more even- handed resolution of the
species involved and their feeding intensities; temporal variability in food web
structure with season and ontogeny; the effects on food web patterns of studying
incomplete subsystems; and the variation in food web structure introduced by
systematically changing the resolution of the data through aggregation and the
incorporation of major to minor interactions. The following are some of the
questions being asked. How representative of real systems ar ethe data upon
which many food web generalizations are based? How dependent are food web
properties on the temporal and taxonomic resolution of the data? When is a
property such as food chain length truly limited by the environment or simply by
the quality of the data?
