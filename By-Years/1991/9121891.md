This project will produce current information on the demographic and employment
characteristics of doctoral scientists, engineers, and humanists in the U. S. To
accomplish this, the contractor will conduct the 1991 Survey of Doctorate
Recipients, develop a longitudinal file of information (the Doctorate Work
History File), and prepare a variety of cross-tabulations from the 1991 survey.
The survey response rate will be greatly enhanced by extensive use of Computer
assisted telephone interviews (CATI). The Foundation is responsible for
developing and maintaining a data base of demographic, educational, and
employment information on scientists and engineers. This data base, the
Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System, requires input from three survey
series: The National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers, the
Survey of Natural and Social Scientist and Engineering Graduates, and the Survey
of Doctorate Recipients. Data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients are
frequently used to determine the status of various aspects of U.S. science and
engineering , e.g., changes in research and development activities, and are also
used in conjunction with data from the other surveys for analytical and policy
purposes. Cosponsoring agencies are National Endowment for the Humanities,
National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, and Nuclear Regulatory
Agency.
