Past studies of global changes in the middle atmosphere have predicted dramatic
changes in thermal regime, structure, and composition with doubled carbon
dioxide. The PI responds to these preliminary findings by examining the thermal
and dynamical response to doubling carbon dioxide in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere (MLT), using a three-dimensional Spectral Mesosphere/Lower
Thermosphere Model. Recently extended into the thermosphere and tested on
empirical climatologies, the model is applied to a wide range of carbon dioxide
concentrations through a parameterization of infrared radiative transfer for the
middle and upper atmosphere. The PI also modifies this model to account for
radiative, dynamical, and chemical feedback important for MLT global change
studies. Because of the associated thermal contraction of the upper atmosphere,
data gathered from the research can eventually be applied to the revision of
life time and trajectory calculations of orbiting and re-entry space vehicles.
