This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the
development of a commercially viable continuous process for bioethanol recovery.
The proposed process will integrate a novel permeate condensation approach with
the energy-efficient pervaporation technology. Due to increased interest in
renewable fuels, domestic use of bioethanol is expected to grow steadily over
the next decade. The primary processing steps, fermentation and ethanol recovery
and purification are a significant component of the total cost of bioethanol
production. Process improvements, such as incorporation of continuous
fermentation and development of energy-efficient ethanol recovery technologies
would reduce the production cost significantly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful
completion of the project objective will lead to a reduction in the sizes of the
fermentor and elimination of the distillation step, and consequently reduce the
cost and enhance the energy efficiency of&lt;br/&gt;the entire bioethanol
production process. The primary customers of the proposed technology will be the
ethanol producers, but the technology has potential applications in the recovery
of other fermentation-derived organic solvents as well.&lt;br/&gt;
