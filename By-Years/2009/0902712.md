This research project, in close collaboration with Chinese partners, considers
the ways in which evolving public interest practices in China are meeting the
legal needs of the 900 million farmers in the countryside. Specifically, the
project examines how rural legal aid centers address certain externalities of
China's economic development and its concomitants of urbanization and migration,
namely, the legal consequences of changing policies toward real property and its
regulation. Transitional China shows the emergence of new privatized actors
operating within socialist administrative systems. These relationships are both
produced by and productive of valuations of land, its use, ownership, and
transfer, which differ markedly from those of just a generation ago. Emergent
markets in rural land complicate views of land value held by local social groups
defined by region, religion, and ethnicity. Land laws, as the product of
compromise and calculation, may create a set of conditions preferable to the
realization of certain types of value of land over others. The leading question
of this research, therefore, is: what role do legal aid centers play in
mediating the different modalities of land ownership held by diverse actors in
transitional societies?

To address this question, the project compares the operation of different legal
aid centers in rural China to examine the capacity of such institutions to
address differences in views toward the use, value, and meaning of land. The
methodology employed is on-site participation in client counseling and
observation of claimants' visits to legal aid centers and their interaction with
legal aid personnel. Further, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with
members of the local community as to the wider impact of the legal aid center.
The project uses the case of China to build theory about the role of public
interest law in transitional economies.
