The plant hormones ethylene and auxin are key regulators of many physiological
processes, including plant growth, fruit ripening, defense against pathogens,
and aging. This research is directed at understanding the mechanisms of action
of ethylene and its interactions with auxin. Such knowledge is crucial to the
ability to manipulate plant responses to the environment for the purpose of
improving agricultural production, forestry and horticulture. In this project,
genetic and molecular tools will be employed to clone three novel mutants that
possess reduced sensitivity to ethylene, as well as to dissect the role of the
corresponding genes in the interaction between ethylene and auxin. Preliminary
data imply the involvement of the new ethylene genes in the regulation of the
biosynthesis of auxin precursors. These studies are expected to shed light on
the cross-talk between the two hormones. The education and training components
will be an integral part of this project. Graduate, undergraduate and high-
school students will have the opportunity to directly participate in this
scientific effort and get "hands-on" research experience in the exciting field
of molecular genetics in the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. This
project will allow Dr. Alonso to continue with his ongoing participation in
several graduate and undergraduate training programs. The programs will serve to
attract and encourage students from ethnic minorities, especially Hispanics, to
become interested in science and to further pursue their aspirations for higher
education and experimental research.
