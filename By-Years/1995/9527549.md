9527549 Johnson This award suuports US participation in the Second International
Conference on Pelagic Biogeography to be held near Armsterdam, The Netherlands,
9-15 July 1995. This conference grows out of the results of the first
International Conference on Pelagic Biogeography successfully held in 1985. The
first conference sought to define the unique problems and opportunities afforded
by study of pelagic organism distributions and to explore ways in which Pelagic
Biogeography could better incorporate modern biogeopraphic concepts and advanced
approaches to the study of the maintenance and history of open-ocean
distribution patterns. The second conference will focus on how Pelagic
Biogeography can contribute to a better understanding of marine ecosystems, and
will particularly focus on its potential contribution to assessing and
understanding global change and marine biodiversity studies. ***
