Until recently, one could expect the proof that a problem has a polynomial time
solution to include an algorithm that could be used to obtain the solution. Now,
however, a number of problems, including many from the VLSI domain, are known to
have low degree polynomial-time decision algorithms, yet the algorithms
themselves are not known. These algorithms depend on the existence of a finite
but unknown number of forbidden graphs (an obstruction set). This research
examines the question of whether full knowledge of an obstruction set is really
required to solve problems in practice. This research focuses on the gate matrix
layout problem. Since some obstruction sets for the problem are known, the
feasibility of designing algorithms that utilize only part of those sets of
graphs will be studied. This will include identification of those obstructions
likely to be found in practice and the design and implementation of algorithms
to test for containment of those graphs. It also examines which techniques used
to isolate the ostructions for gate matrix layout can be applied to other layout
permutation problems as well.
