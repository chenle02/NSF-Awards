Dr. Darrell J. Woodman and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Washington are being supported to continue a Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, ten
undergraduate students will spend nine weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Participants select projects from a broad range of
fields including analytical, bioorganic, biophysical, environmental, inorganic,
organic, organometallic, and nuclear chemistry and chemical physics. The
participants, half of whom are from smaller schools in the region, also enjoy a
special seminar series, `Contemporary Issues in Chemistry.`
