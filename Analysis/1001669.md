The project features new approaches to long-standing problems in quasiconformal
analysis. Quasiconformal maps have played a pivotal role in the development of
classical function theory. Quasisymmetric maps have recently found important
applications in geometric group theory, structure of manifolds and analysis on
fractals. However a large number of fundamental questions remain: quasisymmetric
parametrization of metric spaces by Euclidean spaces; extension of
quasisymmetric maps to an ambient space; factorization of quasiconformal maps
into maps of small dilatation. Extension and smoothing are simpler when the
dilatation is small; a manifold carrying a quasiconformal structure of small
dilatation is smoothable; if a quasiconformal map can be factored into maps of
small dilatation, then the factors can be extended,then smoothed. The PI
proposes to study this circle of problems. Classical geometric topology is rich
with examples of spaces which were proved homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces only
with great ingenuity, e.g., the double suspension of homology 3-spheres and
certain decomposition spaces. This project deals with quasisymmetric
parametrization of such spaces, which resemble the Euclidean spaces not only
topologically, but also geometrically and measure-theoretically. The findings
will lead to a better understanding of the general theory.



Quasiconformal and quasisymmetric maps have been studied for their mathematical
beauty as well as potential scientific applications to objects lacking a smooth
structure that occur naturally in physics and biology. Recently, there have been
exciting discoveries in applying quasiconformal mappings to study images of
brain cortical surfaces, to determine the conductivity of a body, and to study
percolation and crystal growth. This proposal deals with intrinsic properties of
these mappings at the interface of geometric function theory and classical
geometric topology. In addition to theoretical advances, the findings will shed
light on some of these more practical problems. The richness of the examples
from topology will broaden the participation of graduate students in research
activities in geometric analysis.
