Research focuses on development of models for performance evaluation of the
following types of queueing systems: (i) polling systems, where a central
computer polls terminals that share a single transmission channel (such as a
token ring LAN) and (ii) database systems, where records are inserted into and
deleted from file structures called buckets. The study will include both the
development of the underlying mathematical theory of queues (such as the
fundamental M/G/1 model, vacation models, cyclic- service models and multiserver
systems with ordered hunt) and the practical application to the performance
analysis for real systems.
