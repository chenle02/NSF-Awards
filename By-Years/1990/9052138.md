A series of lab exercises are being developed that will enhance the students'
understanding of cell function. These complement previously existing exercises
on cell structure. To isolate and purify cell components, an ultracentrifuge and
rotors are being purchased. The instrument, the Beckman TL-100, has small sample
volumes and high centrifugal forces to effect rapid and exact separations of
cell constituents, making pure samples available for study within the time limit
of a laboratory period. This makes it possible for the students to explore the
molecular mechanisms of cell function by experimenting with purified components
rather than crude fractions obtained by lower-speed centrifugations. The
proposed exercises will help students understand how we have come to understand
the complex interactions that coordinate cell processes. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
