9451620 Newman Life science and pre-medical students at Union College have
studied physics in a traditional two-term calculus-based sequence designed for
engineering and physical science students. Representing about 20% of our
undergraduates, these students have been ill-served in their introductory
courses in physics. A newly developed two-term sequence of courses will provide
a modern introduction to the applications of physics to biology (mostly at the
molecular and cellular level) by spending roughly 25% of the time on such
applications in a lecture/discussion format. These courses will present
fundamental physics in a challenging and relevant manner, will use calculus, and
will stress both conceptual thinking and quantitative reasoning throughout. It
is proposed to develop laboratory experiences which are focused on life science
themes for these students. A totally new laboratory curriculum will be developed
to relate physical principles to the structure, function, and the study of
biological systems. Examples of experiments include the study of the motion of
bacteria, the stress/strain relations in bone, the flow of fluids through
arteries, model electric circuits for nerves, feedback loops representing the
pupil of the eye, and chaotic circuits of importance in the interpretation of
heart rate and EKG, laser absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy as applied to
biological samples, and depth perception and binocular vision. These novel
experiments fit well with the themes developed in the courses and should
stimulate student enthusiasm and interest in the underlying physics. ***y
