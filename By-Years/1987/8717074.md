Field and laboratory studies will be conducted to test the hypothesis that
ciliates and rotifers will be more abundant in freshwater zooplandton
communities with only small cladoceran species than in those with large
cladoceran species. In situ enclosure experiments will test this hypothesis by
adding no cladocerans, small cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris), or large
cladocerans (Daphnia pulex) to natural communities of ciliates and rotifers.
These experiments will be supplemented by: 1) laboratory competition experiments
to test the ability of the rotifer Keratella cochlearis to coexist with
different-sized cladoceran species; and 2) laboratory experiments and
observations on the susceptibilities of a variety of different- sized ciliate
species to mechanical interference (damage, predation) from different-sized
cladoceran species. The results of this research should be useful in
understanding variation in the importance of ciliates and rotifers in natural
communities and secondary effects of zooplanktivorous fish, which prey
selectively on large cladocerans in natural communities. This study will be the
first to extensively investigate interactions between cladocerans and ciliates,
and to assess the impact of cladocerans on ciliates in natural communities.
