Binghamton University, State University of New York, is increasing the number of
diverse, economically disadvantaged students pursuing careers in science and
engineering disciplines. This program recruits economically disadvantaged
students graduating from community colleges and prepares them for STEM careers
with activities focused on nanofabrication technology. The goal is to increase
the number of students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields.
Recruiting activities include partnerships with regional community college and
high school counselors and recruiting visits to community colleges and high
schools. Scholarships are provided for 32 transfer students in their junior or
senior years at Binghamton University. The program provides support for students
through activities focused on skill development in the Binghamton University
nanofabrication facility, the development of peer support networks, and
mentoring. The program includes opportunities for 'learning by teaching' and
'learning by research' and investigates a new approach to improve student
performance and interest. The program is testing a model for encouraging
community college students to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering
disciplines. In addition, through outreach efforts and campus summer camps, this
program engages younger students and high-school students in the exciting field
of nanotechnology.
