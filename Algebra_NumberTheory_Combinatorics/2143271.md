Algebraic geometry is the study of the spaces of solutions to polynomial
equations, known as algebraic varieties. A central goal of the subject is the
classification of algebraic varieties, involving questions such as how to
determine when one variety can be transformed into another, or how to construct
varieties with specified geometric properties. In this pursuit, a recurring
theme is to translate the problem into a more tractable one using an algebraic
invariant, like cohomology (which measures the "holes" in a space). This project
focuses on the use of a more refined invariant, the derived category, which
provides a powerful window into the geometry of algebraic varieties, and also
connects with other subjects, for example symplectic geometry, representation
theory, and theoretical physics. This project includes training and research
opportunities for students and early-career researchers in this area, through
seminars, workshops, and other activities. In more detail, the project builds on
the influential idea that derived categories should be studied by breaking them
into smaller pieces, called semiorthogonal components, which can fruitfully be
regarded as noncommutative algebraic varieties. First, the PI will develop tools
from birational geometry for these noncommutative varieties, with a view toward
applications. Second, the PI will exploit the Hodge theory of noncommutative
varieties to make progress on open problems about cycles, Brauer groups, and
Fano varieties. Third, the PI will study conjectural descriptions of
hyperkaehler varieties and their derived categories in terms of noncommutative
K3 surfaces.
