This research concerns character sum analogues for hypergeometric series over
finite fields. The principal investigator will systematically study an analogue
of the Bailey transform in an attempt to derive analogues for higher order
hpergeometric series identities. He will also study "pseudo" hypergeometric
series, that is, functions which due to the nature of the finite field can not
be written as a character sum hypergeometric series but are closely related.
Also the principal investigator will investigate the relationship between
hypergeometric series and representation theory. The purpose of the first two
problems is to complete the theory of hypergeometric series over finite fields
and to increase its computational power as a tool for character sum evaluation.
The goal of the last problem is to develop an interplay between the two areas of
mathematics, to bring representation theoretic tools to bear on character sum
problems and to determine representation theoretic interpretations for known
character sum identities.
