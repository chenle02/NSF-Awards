The Stevens Institute of Technology is offering a three-year teacher
enhancement program to provide intensive training and support during summer and
academic year workshops for 40 mentor teachers from 13 New Jersey school
districts, who will in turn provide inservice programs for more than 300
teachers in their local schools. The purpose of the project is to improve
student achievement in pre-algebra, and geometry in grades seven through ten.
The project will utilize state-of-the-art software as a catalyst for teacher
change toward a more constructivist and active learning environment. The project
is built on four years of research and development. Cost share provided by the
university and the schools is 687% of the award.//
