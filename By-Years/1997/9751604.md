This project enhances the chemistry curricula by incorporating the theory and
practice of gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis in the general
chemistry, analytical chemistry, and organic chemistry courses. The college has
previously had access to outdated GC instrumentation but no access to MS
instrumentation of any type. Incorporating a GC/MS instrument enhances the
curricula by reinforcing lecture topics, upgrading existing experiments, and
allowing the introduction of new experiments. The new GC/MS is the Hewlett-
Packard G1800A GCD system. This state-of-the-art instrumentation greatly
benefits the students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the
operation of an instrument that is widely used in university, government, and
industrial laboratories. Lectures in the respective courses introduce students
to various levels of complexity in regard to the theory of GC/MS. The students
gain experience in sample preparation, analyzing data, and fundamental
operations of the instrument. *
