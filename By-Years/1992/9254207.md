Spatial visualization is known to be a valuable and often essential skill for
engineers in all of the disciplines. The purpose of this project is to design a
three credit course in three-dimensional spatial visualization and to develop
the necessary materials from which the course can be taught. These materials
will include a written textbook and a laboratory manual. The laboratory
exercises will involve sketching and computer graphics and will also utilize the
visualization capabilities of IDEAS software. Freshmen engineering students with
weak 3-D visualization skills are the target audience for this course. Women
have been found to be approximately three times less likely than men to have
well-developed spatial visualization skills. Thus, it is expected that the
proposed course will increase the accessibility of engineering studies to women.
The goal of this course is to provide the prerequisite spatial visualization
skills needed by students to succeed in their subsequent engineering design
graphics courses and in their later study and work.
