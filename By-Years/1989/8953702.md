This workshop elicits the views and insights of interested experts from a
variety of backgrounds -- engineering, industry, education, government -- on the
directions that the character of engineering, engineers and engineering
education may take in the next several decades. Bold new insights are sought,
without presumption assessments of the ideas and without an expectation of
concensus. The resulting collection of views provokes reaction and stimulates
discussions in the wider professional community.//
