The proposed research will assess the interannual variability of Arctic Ocean
landfast ice and its long-term contribution to the Arctic freshwater budget.
Goals are to examine variability for the entire Arctic Basin, investigate
spatial and temporal changes in fast ice growth, melt and brine fluxes, and
analyze long-term ice volume change in terms of freshwater storage and in
response to climate-scale variation in precipitation, surface air temperatures,
winds and river discharge. The research approach will be to combine a 26-year
landfast ice record, available from ice charts recently released by the National
Ice Center, with a 1-D thermodynamic model. The work will emphasize a time
series approach focussed on decadal change associated with the Arctic
Oscillation and spatial variation among different sub-regions within the Arctic.
Results on interannual variations in landfast ice will benefit both other
investigators of the Arctic Freshwater Cycle and populations dwelling adjacent
to Arctic water bodies.
