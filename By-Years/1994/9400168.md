9400168 Michael F. A'Hearn Dr. A'Hearn and his colleagues plan to expand their
normal observational program on comets and asteroids in order to carry out an
extensive effort for Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 and its impact onto Jupiter. They
are emphasizing the study of the dust grains in the coma and tail, which
together are a system much larger than the entire Jovian system. Observations
will be conducted during the spring of 1994 to elucidate the properties of the
grains. The investigators will then carry out a program of coronagraphic imaging
and spectroscopy during the several weeks surrounding the period when the major
fragments will impact the planet. This will be aimed at determining the
interaction of the grains (and any gas) with the magnetosphere and ring and
torus of Jupiter.
