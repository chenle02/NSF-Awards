This SBIR Phase I project will develop a novel microfiltration system which uses
cross-flow filtration, swirl flow patterns, oscillated and periodically
interrupted flow, periodic back-flush, and particle recuperation to deal with
the treatment of paint sludges generated from spray paint booths. It is aimed
primarily at the automotive industry, but could be equally successfully applied
to any large spray painting operation such as train carriages, planes, etc. The
project will explore various membranes, and test module configurations and
operational parameters in order to optimize the system. The project will test
synthetic paint mixtures as well as real paint sludges on the most promising
configuration, and they will use CFD simulations and modeling to improve the
design and to predict Phase II performance. The combination of original reactor
configurations and particular choices of membrane has not previously been tested
with paint sludges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of the
proposed project will include a reduction in the release of paints and paint
sludges into the environment, reduction in the energy needed to achieve this in
comparison with existing technologies, and the possibility of recycling the
paint itself. There are 75 million pounds of paint sludges generated annually in
the U.S. by the automotive industry alone.&lt;br/&gt;
