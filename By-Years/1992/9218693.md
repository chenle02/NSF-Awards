This research will study three widely separated areas of the earth with a
common thread of theoretical waveform modeling that has been developed by
earlier studies. Seismic body waves will be synthesized using approximate high
frequency and hybrid approximate/finite difference techniques and compared to
data waveforms to investigate characteristics from three zones: 1) the
thickness, mantle penetration, and stratification of descending lithospheric
slabs; 2) the heterospectrum of the lowermost D" region of the mantle and
topography of the core-mantle boundary; and 3) the lateral variation and
anisotropy of the elastic and anelastic structure of the inner core. The results
of this research will include evidence for the existence or nature of slab
penetration below 650 km; a test of the origin of a high frequency waveguide
along the top of some slabs; a test of the applicability of the Born
approximation to the study of PKIKP precursors and the importance of strong
scattering within D"; and a test of an anelastic model of the inner core as an
explanation for the observed amplitude, travel time, and frequency content for
PKIKP.
