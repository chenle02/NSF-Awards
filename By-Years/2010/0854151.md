0854151&lt;br/&gt;Frey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the
Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work by Professor Douglas
Frey at the University of Maryland Baltimore County to develop new
chromatographic methods for purifying biological macromolecules that incorporate
focusing effects. In addition, new college-level bioseparations educational
material and new high-school-level educational and outreach material will be
developed in the biotechnology area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of the
scientific portion of this work is to develop several new chromatofocusing
methods for purifying proteins that use interacting operating modes, such as
methods that exploit the simultaneous use of electrostatic repulsive forces and
hydrophobic attractive forces, or methods that simultaneously use retained and
unretained chemical composition gradients that travel through a chromatographic
column. Due to the complexity of these hybrid techniques, computer-aided-design
methods will also be developed so that their performance can be fully optimized.
By using this approach, the synergism that exists between these different
operating modes can be exploited to develop new techniques for separating
proteins that are superior to existing ones in terms of their ability to
simultaneously purify and concentrate individual species present in a complex
starting mixture. The results of this work will have a broad impact in several
areas of national importance, such as in the development of efficient large-
scale methods for purifying proteins that reduce pharmaceutical manufacturing
costs, and in the development of more effective analytical methods for quality
control during pharmaceutical drug manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
further enhance the broader impact of this project, innovative undergraduate-
level educational material in the bioseparations area will be developed that can
be readily incorporated into the traditional chemical engineering curriculum. In
addition, novel outreach material based on the concept of Archimedes principle
will be developed that educates high-school students about the field of
biotechnology.
