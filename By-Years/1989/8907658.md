8907658 Lipton This project will apply recent advances in the mathematical
analysis of composite materials to obtain the effective elastic properties of
transversely isotropic composite materials. The goal is to obtain new bounds
that correlate the six elastic moduli for transverse isotropic composites made
from two isotropic elastic materials in prescribed proportions. The overall plan
of attack is twofold: the set of all finite rank laminates exhibiting transverse
isotropy will be characterized. Then bounds will be derived using the fact that
laminates are extremal in the set of composites. The behavior of composite
materials is of fundamental technological importance. Composites have been
widely used in structural optimization to design strong but lightweight
components for use in aerospace and aviation.
