Dr. Chan plans a program of research which exploits a novel experimental
technique developed in his laboratory. It combines a diamond anvil high pressure
cell and microwave technology in high pressure magnetic resonance experiments.
He intends to investigate the effect of pressure on molecular properties of
photoexcited triplet organic molecules, such as electronic structure, spin-spin
and spin-orbit coupling and dimeric interactions, and to employ pressure as a
well-controlled experimental parameter in elucidating dynamical processes in
molecular crystals. Magnetic resonance will be detected optically and both
steady-state and coherent transient methods, including the newly developed spin-
echo envelope modulation technique will be employed. This work is important
because it involves the development of a new technique to perform experiments to
examine the effect of high external pressure on the structural and dynamical
aspects of organic crystals. The technique opens up a new area of research in
magnetic resonance.
