9309461 Long This research is for the development of a family of joints called
kinematic modules, which are singularity free and provide three Cartesian
degrees of freedom for a terminal link. Singularity avoidance is achieved by the
use of redundant actuators, the redundancy also being potentially useful for
obstacle avoidance and fault tolerant manipulation. Screw theory is used as the
analytical tool to characterize screw groups, and is complemented by notions
from group theory and algebraic surfaces. Fuzzy inference techniques are used to
assist in actuator selection and partitioning. Kinematic modules such as those
described above can be configured into machines optimized for specific
applications. Potential applications include hazardous waste removal, building
construction, space and undersea exploration, and rehabilitative aids for the
handicapped.
