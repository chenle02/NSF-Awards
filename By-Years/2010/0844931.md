"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)". This project is directed toward the discovery of new
chemistry for S-nitrosothiols, which are important nitric oxide metabolites. The
lability of the sulfur-nitrogen bonds often makes S-nitrosothiols in proteins
cumbersome to measure accurately. In this project, the PI plans to develop new
reactions that can selectively convert unstable S-nitrosothiols to stable
conjugates. Preliminary studies have uncovered a new reductive ligation of
S-nitrosothiols using phosphine-ester substrates. It can convert S-nitrosothiols
to stable sulfenamide products in high yields under mild conditions. The PI
plans to further optimize the reductive ligation and explore other alternative
ligation processes using phosphine-based substrates. Studies to elucidate the
mechanisms of the transformation will also be performed. These fundamental
studies will advance the understanding of the chemical and biological properties
of S-nitrosothiols and permit studies of S-nitrosothiol related NO signal
transduction in biological systems. With this CAREER award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Ming
Xian of the Department of Chemistry at Washington State University. Professor
Xian's research efforts revolve around the development of new reactions of
nitric oxide metabolites. These reactions are expected to be transformative,
with the potential to impact free radical biology. In addition, the education
portion of this project will provide a unique experience in multidisciplinary
research for highly motivated undergraduate and graduate students. It will bring
those young people into the laboratory for their first encounter with scientific
research and better prepare them for their future endeavors in science.
