The central notion of this project is the Haagerup property which, in recent
years, has found applications ranging from K-theory of C*-algebras, to rigidity
theory, to geometric group theory. A group is said to have the Haagerup property
if it admits a proper affine action on a Hilbert space, and a deep result of
Higson and Kasparov asserts that a Haagerup group satisfies the Baum Connes
conjecture. In this project, Lp generalizations of this concept will be studied
quantitatively, together with cohomological aspects of the theory. It is for
instance planned to attack a Gromov conjecture about the vanishing of reduced
Lp-cohomology on amenable groups. More generally, it is proposed to determine
for which amenable groups the first reduced cohomology with values in mixing
(resp. weakly mixing) Lp-representation vanishes. In particular, this will
produce new geometric invariants for a large class of groups.

Looking for quantities that remain invariant under certain transformations is
one the main objectives in mathematics as in many scientific fields like for
example, physics, information theory or finance. The principle behind geometric
group theory is that many properties of a space, such as its topology or its
geometry, can be revealed by studying its set of symmetries. This set has a
mathematical structure called a group structure. The wealth of this approach
results from the interactions between the algebraic properties of this structure
and its geometric properties. In this project, it is proposed to study new
geometric invariants of groups, and to relate them with their algebraic
structure. Groups of matrices, that appear as fundamental objects in physics,
will have a central position in this study.
