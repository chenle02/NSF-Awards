This project focuses on the interaction of low-energy positrons with atoms and
molecules, using a high-resolution, trap-based positron beam and complementary
techniques to study scattering and annihilation processes. Positron-impact
scattering processes to be studied include the vibrational excitation of
molecules, and electronic excitation, ionization, positronium formation, and
resonance phenomena in both atoms and molecules. Emphasis will be placed upon
high energy-resolution measurements and studies at low values of positron
energy, including the investigation of a variety of near-threshold processes.
While focusing on research in atomic physics, this project has broader impacts
in a number of areas. This research actively involves graduate students and
post-doctoral researchers, including members of underrepresented groups, at all
levels from the planning of experiments to the dissemination of research
results.
