9315578 Bodenheimer The PI will continue his studies of the role of disks in
the formation of stars and planetary systems. With this grant, the PI will
investigate whether convection plays an important role in the long standing
problem of viscosity in disks surrounding stars and will study the effect of
density waves induced in a protostellar disk by the tides from a companion star.
The generation, structure and evolution of a disk surrounding a protoplanetary
core will be explored. ***
