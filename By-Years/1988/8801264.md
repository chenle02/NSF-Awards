A quasilinear system of partial differential equations is shown to be a general
model for diffusion in heterogeneous media. The system to be studied may contain
very nonlinear singular or degenerate coefficients and include certain free-
boundary problems that arise in various applications. The objective is to find
sufficient conditions to guarantee the initial-boundary- value problem is well-
posed, to investigate and compare the properties of solutions in relevant
special cases, and to study the dependence of solutions on parameters or
functions in the equations.
