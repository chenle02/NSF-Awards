An important characteristic of particle laden, supersonic gas jets issuing from
convergent nozzles is that the particles can be strongly focused at axial
distances which depend on particle (aerodynamic) size. This research will
investigate experimentally the potential of this phenomenon for detecting and
sizing particles of 1 to 100 nm diameter. Particle concentration profiles in the
jets will be measured using small diameter probes. The research will include a
theoretical study of gas and particle motion in supersonic jets for the
technologically important jet Reynolds number range 5 to 500. If time permits,
the generation of ultrafine monodisperse particles by electrospraying low
conductivity, dilute solutions will be examined experimentally. The particle
focusing characteristics of supersonic jets make them an attractive tool for
rapid detection and sizing of submicron particles. Such jets may also be
attractive for "writing" with small particles on substrates.
