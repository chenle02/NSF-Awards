This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented but financially-
disadvantaged graduate students pursuing interdisciplinary research in the
Departments of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering,
and Physics at Rice University. The scholarships are supporting 26 students
through the first two years of study, at which point students are transitioning
to faculty research funding. Recruiting efforts are targeting women and
underrepresented minorities. Students are recruited at conferences sponsored by
the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science, the
National Society of Black Engineers, the American Indian Science and Engineering
Society, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, as well as at the
Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students. Support structures
include strong faculty mentoring for students in their first two years of
graduate study, the use of senior graduate student ambassadors to mentor
entering students, and seminar courses on communication and on interdisciplinary
research for each cohort of eight to nine students. The goals of the program
include increasing the proportion of minorities and women enrolled in the four
graduate departments, supporting students through their first two years of
graduate study, and building students' confidence in their research abilities.
