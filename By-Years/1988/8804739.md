This grant proposal requests partial funding for a vertical bore, high field
NMR spectrometer for high resolution spectroscopy in molecular biology. The
instrument will consist of the highest proven field magnet (11.75T), sufficient
homogeneous volume for 10mm tubes, and a console with all features necessary for
advanced techniques such as multidimensional and multiple quantum experiments,
proton detection of heteronuclei, spin locking, and capability of generating
pulse sequences of complex pulse phase. The spectrometer will be utilized by a
core group of six investigators (Primary users) as well as several minor users.
The individual projects of the investigators cover a wide range of fundamental
research in molecular biology. Every investigator has an established program of
NMR research with spectrometers of lesser capability and the proposal documents
the additional knowledge to be gained by the new capabilities of the proposed
instrument. The proposed instrument will come under the auspices of the UCD NMR
Facility. The Facility has a proven record over ten years in enabling
investigators to implement state of the art NMR techniques, and in spectrometer
maintenance and modification.
