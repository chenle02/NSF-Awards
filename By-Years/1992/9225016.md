9225016 Olson This study investigates the impact of different arbitration
systems, the role of uncertainty, and the impact of bargaining information on
negotiator behavior and dispute rates. The study consists of bargaining
experiments where pairs of negotiators bargain over the division of a sum of
money for a fixed number of periods. The experiments vary the type of
arbitration procedure used if an agreement is not reached and the information
available to the negotiator about the arbitration process. One experiment
compares negotiator behavior under final offer and two types of conventional
arbitration. The conventional arbitration treatments differ in the relative
weight the arbitrator places on the offers of the parties and the facts of the
case. The subjects' uncertainty about the beliefs of the arbitrator is also
manipulated. A second experiment focuses on the role of new information and
post-offer bargaining under final offer arbitration. The results of these
studies will contribute to our understanding of disputes across a variety of
settings and the role of dispute settlement procedures in the resolution of
disputes. ***
