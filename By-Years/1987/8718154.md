This investigation will carry out controlled crystallization of superconductive
phases of the Ba-A-Cu-O type (A = trivalent rare earth element) from a Ba-A-Cu-
R-O molten mass where R is a glass network forming element such as B, Si, or P.
This glass-ceramic route could be employed to obtain strong, uniform grain-sized
superconductor with nearly zero porosity. Conventional glass- ceramic technology
is used to obtain pressed and blown shapes, canes and wires.
