9353075 Stoebe The University of Washington seeks to initiate a 4-week, summer
commuter, Young Scholars program focused on the Physics of Robotics. The program
will be for 40 Seattle Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA)
minority students in grades 7th and 8th. The program provides students with an
opportunity to engage in classroom, laboratory, field trips, and research
activities with University faculty during the summer. The project terminates
during the academic year with the design and construction of a complex
engineering system involving a robot.
