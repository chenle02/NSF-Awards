This project supports the dissertation research of a student from Emory
University. The project involves an ethnographic study of fertility decision
making in sub-Saharan Africa. The main objective is to understand the complex
processes of how men and women decide to have children. The role of men in
family planning has been largely overlooked in programs promoting contraception.
This research will test the hypothesis that men play an important role in
reproductive decision-making, part of a complex calculation and negotiation
between actors carried out under the constraints within which they live. Through
structured and semi-structured interviews, individual case studies and intensive
observation of family planning program implementation, they study will explore
the nature of human decisions about fertility. This research is important
because it will advance the nation's expertise about this important region of
the world, as well as improve our understanding of the fundamental causes of
population growth in this area. Africa is a region of intense poverty and high
population growth, and advances in our understanding of the causes of variations
in fertility among particular populations will be of immense utility in
designing programs to improve the balance between population and resources.
