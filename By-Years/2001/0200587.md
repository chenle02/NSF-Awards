0200587&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of this
proposal is to systematically study certain &lt;br/&gt;interactions between
holomorphic function spaces and operator &lt;br/&gt;theory. These holomorphic
spaces include Dirichlet spaces, &lt;br/&gt;potential capacity related scale
space which covers Bloch space &lt;br/&gt;and BMOA, and the analytic Morrey
spaces. The operators are &lt;br/&gt;multipliers, bilinear forms, such as Hankel
operators and &lt;br/&gt;Toeplitz operators, and commutators. The study involves
the &lt;br/&gt;following objects: the orthogonal projection, the point
&lt;br/&gt;evaluation operator, mean value operator, the differential
&lt;br/&gt;operator such as d-bar, Laplacian and Dirac operators, Clifford
&lt;br/&gt;analysis, atomic decomposition, approximation numbers, predual,
&lt;br/&gt;intermediate spaces, Carleson measures and potential capacity.
&lt;br/&gt;Techniques in harmonic analysis, complex analysis and operator
&lt;br/&gt;theory will bebe used and developed in this study.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beside its own charm in pure mathematical research, the
&lt;br/&gt;interaction between holomorphic function spaces and operator
&lt;br/&gt;theory has many applications in several fields of applied
&lt;br/&gt;sciences. Automatic control, navigation and system design in
&lt;br/&gt;engineering are examples of the applications. Operator theory
&lt;br/&gt;has its roots in the rigorization of quantum mechanics and it
&lt;br/&gt;is now widely used in control
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
