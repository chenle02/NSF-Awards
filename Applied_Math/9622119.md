9622119 Vogel The primary goal of this project is to develop robust, efficient
computational methods for the solution of regularized inverse problems. Also to
be addressed are regularization parameter selection schemes, and the development
of improved regularization functionals. Applications will be carried out for
important problems in image reconstruction and parameter identification. Inverse
problems arise in a number of important applications. Perhaps the most well know
of these is biomedical imaging, e.g., CAT scans and Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI). Other examples include satellite- based (remote) sensing of the earth and
seismic data processing. These problems tend to be highly unstable, i.e., small
errors in the data may give rise to enormous errors in the solution. They also
tend to be very large--- involving thousands or even millions of unknowns. The
goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to solve such
problems which are both stable and efficient. The attainment of this goal will
greatly enhance a number of important technologies.
