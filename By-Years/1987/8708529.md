This represents a continuation of support for research previously funded by NSF
grant EAR 8408168 and amendments, involving the use of transmission electron
microscopy to study local regions of structural and chemical disorder in
minerals. Specific studies include: high- resolution imaging of illite/smectite
to determine details of intercalations and ordering, of defects in perovskite
synthesised at high pressures, of stacking sequences and disorder in graphite,
of interralationships among iron-rich silicates in iron formations, of series of
manganese oxides and silicates, and of the nature of gold occurrence in sulfide
minerals. Detailed observation of such regions can provide data on chemical and
physical properties of the host minerals and can give insights into their origin
and history.
