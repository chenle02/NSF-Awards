This grant is to fund a research project to develop multicolor thin film
electroluminescent devices. The key to achieving high brightness and efficiency
is the use of a new class of luminescent organometallic lanthanide complexes as
emitter materials. Band widths as narrow as 10 nm csan be achieved using Tb+3
and Eu+3 complexes. Efficient injection type thin film electroluminescent
devices require electron and hole injecting materials with low and high work
functions respectively. By using organic hole conductors and alkali metal alloys
as electron injectors, it will be possible to develop electroluminescent devices
of high rightness and contrast for multicolor flat plate displays.
