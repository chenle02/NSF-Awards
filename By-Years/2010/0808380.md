Prof. Scott McLuckey at Purdue University is supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program for investigations aimed at expanding analytical
capabilities for the rapid, specific, and sensitive characterization of RNA/DNA
oligomers with up to several hundred residues using instrumentation that can be
widely available. This work seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in
oligonucleotide characterization by mass spectrometry with particular emphasis
placed on ion trap and time-of-flight mass analysis. Ion/ion chemistry plays a
major role in this work as a means for ion transformation and structural
characterization. Single proton transfer, metal ion transfer, and charge
inversion are examples of reactions that can transform analyte ions from one
form to another for subsequent analysis. Electron transfer reactions are
examples of reactions that can play a direct role in primary structure
characterization. Both beam-type and ion trap collisional activation of a wide
range of parent ion types are explored using multidimensional MS to maximize
structural information. The combination of ion/ion reactions with these
activation methods will provide an unusually wide range of possibilities for the
characterization of RNA/DNA oligomers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry
currently plays a critical role in modern molecular biology research,
particularly in the areas such as proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and
other large-scale measurement challenges. The strengths of mass spectrometry for
characterizing post-transcriptional modifications of nucleic acids, however,
have not yet been developed to the extent that they have for proteins, for
example. This work, therefore, has significant potential for advancing nucleic
acids research. A diverse set of graduate and undergraduate students engaged in
this project will be exposed to a highly multi-disciplinary line of inquiry
involving ion physics, ion chemistry, instrumentation, and analytical chemistry,
in addition to molecular biology.
