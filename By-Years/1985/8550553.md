This project will deliver in-service training to 40 secondary teachers of
mathematics, 20 participants attending each of two years. The participants will
be selected from the greater Philadelphia area. The two-year project will
provide courses in computer science, instructional design practicums, a series
of workshops, and a series of networking sessions. A series of 1/2 day workshops
for principals, presidents of the local parent support group, and teachers will
be held prior to the beginning of the courses. Three courses in computer science
will be taught for each group of participants. These courses will be: (1) A
First Course in Computer Science (2) Structured Programming with Pascal, and (3)
Advanced Programming Concepts. The Instructional Design course will allow the
participants the opportunity to design and develop learning resources which they
will use in their classrooms. The courses will be offered during the summer and
the academic year. During the school year, monthly meetings will be held for the
participants and those already teaching computer science courses. The meetings
will provide further instruction and support for those teaching computer
science.
