This project will study parabolic partial differential equations in domains
with rough boundaries. Using as a frame of reference recent results on the heat
equation, efforts will be made to establish regularity properties of solutions
to higher order parabolic equations and noncylindrical domains. Main issues to
be dealt with are the spectral properties of the domains and properties of the
trace semigroup. In addition to solving basic questions in differential
equations, the result of this project have implications to applied areas such as
probability, physics and engineering. In particular problems in colloids and
furtive materials might benefit from this investment.
