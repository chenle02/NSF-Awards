9815742&lt;br/&gt;Gaudiot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-
France cooperative research in high performance computing involves Jean-Luc
Gaudiot of the University of Southern California, Guang Gao of the University of
Delaware and Christine Eisenbeis at the French National Institute for Research
in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) at Rocquencourt. The objective of
their research is simulation of multithreaded multiprocessors for high
performance computing. The project adds an international dimension to an active
NSF grant on functional programming of multithreaded systems. The US-France
collaboration focuses on simulation. The investigators propose to specify,
design and implement a trace simulator and to identify the sources of
parallelism within a computer program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US investigators
bring to this collaboration expertise in processor architecture design,
multithreaded architecture design and application. This is complemented by
French expertise in parallel compilation, code analysis and optimization. The
research addresses the development of more efficient memory for large-scale
parallel scientific computing.&lt;br/&gt;
