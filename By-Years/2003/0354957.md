The PI will investigate areas of harmonic analysis concerned with multi-
dimensional wavelet and wave packet expansions. In particular, he will study
when collections of dilations, translations and modulations can be used to
decompose square integrable functions into discrete data sets with perfect
reconstruction; both with and without good time-frequency localization. This
proposal relates the existence of functions useful for decomposing functions
into discrete data sets to concrete geometric and algebraic questions that are
of independent interest; in particular, tiling questions and the approximation
of irrational numbers by rationals. Moreover, the proposer wishes to study the
following phenomenon: to date, the most popular systems of the type being
studied are the wavelet system (dilations and translations) and the Gabor system
(dilations and modulations). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wavelets and wave packet
expansions have been useful both in pure mathematics and
in&lt;br/&gt;engineering. Wavelets are used, for example, in the FBI fingerprint
compression scheme&lt;br/&gt;and in JPEG 2000. Wave packets have been used, for
example, to give elegant proofs of&lt;br/&gt;the almost everywhere convergence
of Fourier series. The research in this proposal will&lt;br/&gt;provide a better
understanding of the theory behind these applications (both to math
and&lt;br/&gt;signal processing) of wavelets and wave packets, and will
potentially impact other signal&lt;br/&gt;processing applications and
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
