9354089 Semper This planning project will take advantage of the acquisition of
the Presidio facilities which have been transferred from the Department of
Defense to the Exploratorium. One objective of the planning activities is to
develop a collaboration among the teacher training institutions in the San
Francisco Bay area and from that collaboration develop an in-service and pre-
service center which will serve that section of the state. Another objective of
the project is to develop, through the combination of in-service and pre-service
activities, an innovative approach to the preparation of new teachers and the
professional development of active teachers. The final outcome will be a
comprehensive resource center for teachers at all levels.
