The principal investigator will investigate problems in functional analysis,
specifically on the geometry of Banach and metric spaces. The proposal keeps its
focus on the asymptotic version of the Ribe program. The PI is interested in
general metric spaces and seeks to identify classes of Banach spaces that are
closed under specific sets of maps. The PI has done some interesting work and
much more is expected from this project. These constitute the intellectual merit
of the proposal.

The topics treated in this project make contact with many areas of analysis and
areas outside of analysis, including operator theory, group theory, geometric
analysis, and theoretical computer science, and these constitute part of the
broader impacts of the proposal. Furthermore, the principal investigator is a
member of various committees who goals is to either create a dialogue with
undergraduate students or help improve their learning condition.
