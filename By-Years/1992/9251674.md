The Department of Chemistry is acquiring aFourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrometer to use in a variety of courses in the chemistry program. Students
in Organic Chemistry II and III, Physical Chemistry III, Instrumental Analysis,
and Physical Biochemistry are using the instrument in experiments involving
solids, liquids, gases, and solutions, and particular emphasis is being placed
on having the students discover the differences between the kinds of experiments
and results which can be obtained on dispersive versus Fourier-transform
instruments. A major use of the instrument is by undergraduates involved in
three different ongoing research programs in the department.
