This project investigates the dynamic behavior of a flexible cantilever beam
which is subjected to disturbances along its axis. Both analytical as well as
experimental studies are conducted to understand the nonlinear response of the
beam. Preliminary experimental study has shown some unusual and potentially
dangerous phenomena. Understanding these phenomena is important to structural
designers and engineers. For example, results of this study would be beneficial
to the designers of large structures envisioned for use in a space environment.
Recent theoretical developments in nonlinear dynamics are brought to bear in
this study.
