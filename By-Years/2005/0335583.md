Broadband electrostatic noise (BEN) is often observed by satellites traversing
the earth's magnetotail. This project will build on the preliminary results of a
new model for the generation of BEN. The model has both source region trapped-
particle solitary waves as well as a much larger region of broadband non-
solitary waves. The new work will develop the theory of the nonlinear solitary
waves. The project will also synthesize unique theoretical explanations for each
of the wave varieties. There are three primary tasks. (1) Elucidate the non-
solitary, beam-driven plasma instabilities observed by the ISEE-1 satellite. The
roles of plasma inhomogeneities and instability saturation will be examined. (2)
Analyze the influences of the magnetic field on nonlinear modes created by
particle trapping in waves driven by the beams. The dynamics of trapped
particles in the solitary waves will be analyzed for a generalized Bernstein-
Green-Kruskal (BGK) model. (3) Synthesis the results from the first two tasks
into a unified picture for the origin, evolution and dynamics of BEN.
