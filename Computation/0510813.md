The investigators develop tools and techniques to facilitate the accurate
reconstruction of spectral data from compressed images. Such reconstruction
typically aims at recreating gray-scale functions from their Fourier or spectral
coefficients, and necessarily requires both precise information of the location
of the jump discontinuities of the images, as well as an appropriate conversion,
usually via projection, so that the image can be viewed in the regions of
smoothness. Current techniques for edge detection and projection reconstruction
are somewhat successful in avoiding Gibbs oscillations without compromising the
integrity of the the images around the edges (i.e. smearing). They also can
retrieve information of small scale features which arise in many scientific
applications. However, the success is seemingly function dependent, and it is
difficult to choose parameters that are robust to be effective in all cases,
especially when noise is present in the given data fields. Furthermore, they are
difficult to extend to higher dimensions. The investigators study new ways to
improve both edge detection and projection methods and ultimately create an
automated robust, user-friendly, computationally efficient, and inherently
multi-dimensional image reconstruction method. The study tests the resulting
procedures against current image reconstruction methods on a range of
applications.

Image reconstruction is of critical importance in many scientific fields. The
development of high order reconstruction techniques requires both mathematical
rigor to prove theoretical results and computational robustness to ensure
practical usage. The proposed activities address how to obtain images
efficiently and with high accuracy when small scale features are of extreme
interest in an increasingly image--oriented society. These methods can, for
example, enhance the diagnostic ability in medical imaging applications. They
can also be used to better identify the small scale features in solar activity
such as those in connection with Lockheed Martin's Solar Imaging Suite. This
research is also useful for weather forecasting models, earthquake and tsunami
prediction, and any other fields in which visualization is critical. Finally,
this study stands to significantly enhance the ability to compress data, as it
it will be possible to optimize the reconstruction parameters when particular
compression requirements are proposed.
