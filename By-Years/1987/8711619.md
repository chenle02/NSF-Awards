This proposal plans to integrate two avenues of research that bear on our
understanding of deposit - feeders, namely the clarification of the sedimentary
food sources used by deposit feeders, and the development of the theoretical
underpinning for explaining their foraging behavior. The specific objectives
include: 1) clarifying the relationship of absorption rates of sedimentary
organic matter and several of its important components, including microbes,
microbal mucus, and adsorbed small molecules, in terms of feeding rates, gut
turnover times, and absorption time constants; 2) determining the effects of
body size and body shape on specific absorption rates and specific metabolic
rates; and 3) determining the combined effects of intrinsic (size and shape
related) and extrinsic (size related feeding position in the sediment) factors
on the net energy gain during the developmental history of a head-down deposit
feeder. The most significant aspect of the proposed research is that is
integrates aspects of two exciting, but disparate, avenues of benthic research,
one on the geochemical control of food availability, the other on an
understanding of foraging behavior.
