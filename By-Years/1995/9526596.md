9526596 Essene This project involves petrological, geochemical, and isotopic
studies of granulitic rock from different tectonic settings within the Sesia-
Lanzo Zone (Western Alps) that record various degrees od transformations.
Specific tasks include: (1) thermobarometric studies on eclogites, blueschists
and greenschists to constrain the depths to which the rocks have been buried;
(2) evaluation of the role of fluids in triggering the transformations between
the facies; (3) reevaluation of thermodynamic data for typical
eclogite/blueschist minerals and derivation of a new internally consistent
petrogenic grid for blueschists and eclogites; (4) radiogenic isotopic studies
(Sm-Nd and U-Pb) to establish the timing of the events and the influence of
metamorphic transitions on the behavior of these systems. The results of this
study will be important to evaluate discrepancies in the age of high pressure
metamorphism in the Western Alps and will lead to a better understanding of deep
crustal processes occurring during mountain building events in convergent
tectonic zones.
