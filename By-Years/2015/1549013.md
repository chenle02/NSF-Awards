This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to develop
software and use the CONSTRUKTS smart hands-on learning platform for education
relevant to manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical part of the
proposal centers around two main goals: 1) Optimization of the CONSTRUKTS
wireless sensor network hardware platform; and 2) Design-Build toolkit
supporting transformation of physical models to virtual representations for
additive manufacturing. Broader Impacts for this project include hands-on
workshops with youth from the local community that explore the design of complex
systems.
