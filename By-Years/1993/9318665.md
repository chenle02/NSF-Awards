9318665 Duncan An International Radiophysics Consortium is initiating long-range
facility, making use of existing and upgraded high-power HF transmitting and
receiving systems in Russia and Ukraine. The goal of this multinational
collaborative effort is to develop a high- power HF backscatter radar designed
for unique observations of the near-earth magnetosphere, the mid-latitude
ionosphere, and the middle and lower atmosphere. Preliminary design and
development work for the necessary facility modifications has been completed by
staff of the Radiophysical Research Institute (NIRFI) in Nizhny Novgorod,
Russia. The present proposal requests support for a Small Grant for Exploratory
research (SGER) to permit the immediate commencement of construction of the
required new transmitting antenna, to be located at the existing Sura HF
facility in Vasilsursk, Russia (56.13oN,46.10oE). It is extremely critical that
construction of the antenna begin in Summer, 1993; otherwise, NIRFI personnel,
equipment, and government support for this effort will be reassigned to other
activities and not be available for future application to this project. ***
