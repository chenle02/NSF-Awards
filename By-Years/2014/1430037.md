This proposal provides support for the 2014 Workshop on the Economics of
Information Security (WEIS). WEIS fosters cross-disciplinary, cross-sector
(i.e., academia, industry, nonprofit, and government), and cross-national
discussion on information security. The focus on the economics of information
security was chosen not only because of its intrinsic importance, but also
because of its basis for bringing together social, computer, and information
scientists and engineers to share knowledge, information and methods from their
respective domains. WEIS covers issues that are core to the NSF's Secure and
Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, and spans both the Computer and
Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences (SBE) Directorates within the Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All
funds from this grant will go towards supporting undergraduate and graduate
student attendance at the WEIS conference, to be held at Penn State University
in University Park, Pennsylvania, on June 23-24 2014.
