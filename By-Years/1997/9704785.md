The main goal of this project is to develop an image thesaurus to facilitate
content based search of large digital image/video libraries. As computers and
communications technology advance, limitations of current information processing
tools are becoming more apparent, and is particularly visible in the context of
media rich data such as satellite and medical imagery databases. The image or
visual thesaurus provides a conceptual framework for similarity search and
indexing of such multimedia data. At the time of data ingest, image features of
interest, such as color, texture, spatial location and shape, are computed and
clustered to give a feature code book. Application specific information and user
requirements are used to make this code book construction adaptive. The mapping
to code words is hierarchical and groupings of several basic features can be
used to represent high level structured visual concepts. Key components in this
thesaurus construction include new spatio-temporal segmentation algorithms, and
dimensionality reduction and learning algorithms for efficient search and
indexing in the feature space. Potential applications of this thesaurus include
geographic information systems, medical imagery, searching on the Internet using
image content, and in new image/video coding standards such as MPEG-7. A
prototype retrieval system incorporating an image thesaurus will be developed
and its effectiveness will be demonstrated on searching airphoto databases and
stock photo galleries.
