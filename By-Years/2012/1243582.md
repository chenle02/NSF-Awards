The project is integrating two geodetic technologies--Global Positioning Systems
(GPS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)--into the undergraduate geoscience
curriculum by 1) creating a new upper-level applications course at the
University of Houston, 2) augmenting an existing field-methods course at the
Yellowstone Bighorn Research Association field camp with GPS and LiDAR
applications, and 3) conducting professional-development workshops for college
faculty to incorporate GPS and LiDAR into their own courses at different levels
of the curriculum. The pedagogical approach scaffolds inquiry-based cases and
uses freely available online software to overcome complex data-processing
challenges, allowing students to focus on applications and problem-solving.
Project assessment is addressing the efficacy of the curriculum on undergraduate
learning of high-precision GPS and LiDAR methodologies, the extent to which GPS
and LiDAR integration augments geoscience problem solving more broadly, and
effective strategies for faculty development to incorporate GPS and LiDAR into
other undergradaute geoscience courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the project lies in its infusion of cutting-edge high-precision
technologies, increasingly used by geoscience professionals, into the
undergraduate curriculum for application to a host of compelling geoscience
topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include professional development
and dissemination of four modules which, together with the underlying
strategies, enable use at other institutions and/or levels of the curriculum.
The project also uses GPS and LiDAR to increase engagement and impart workforce-
relevant skills to geoscience majors, including a high proportion of students
from underrepresented minorities at the University of Houston.
