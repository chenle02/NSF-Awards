This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist in
highland Bolivia. The research will examine Andean land-use focusing on the
field fallowing choices of households and local resource management
institutions. The study examines sectoral fallowing systems, which balance
community control over agricultural decisions with individual farmer's
decisions. The project will examine the soil on a sample of farms to relate
decisions about fallow strategies to soil quality. Methods include participant
observation, a sample survey of 130 farm families, and soil samples and analysis
from the interviewed farms and a sample of 30 fields in different agro-
ecological zones. This research is important because this area of the world has
well-defined traditional community resource management institutions.
Understanding how specific institutions succeed or fail in managing fundamental
resources like soil is important to help design conservation policies for other
areas.
