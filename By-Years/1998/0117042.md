0117042 Cutright The objective of this research is to provide the fundamentals
needed for the construction of multi-enzyme systems that will affect degradation
of organic waste streams containing mixed pollutants such as trichloroethylene,
toluene, dichloroethylene and chlorophenols. The specific objectives of this
research include: (1) development of the microbial consortium for isolating the
multi-enzymatic catalytic system for the treatment of polluted wastewater, and
(2) demonstrating the feasibility of immobilized multi-enzyme systems for
degrading chlorinated solvents. This research will also contribute to
understanding the interactions among enzymes and cofactors involved in the
biodegradation pathways. ***
