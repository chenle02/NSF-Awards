This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of Michael Leyton at
Rutgers University. Leyton's research centers on perceptual organization.
Perceptual organization is modeled as representing the environment as
hierarchies of deterministic machines, i.e. as nested systems of control, where
these hierarchies have a common mathematical structure, especially adapted to
the function of planning. The sponsored work includes deeper investigations of
the mathematical structure of this model, connections with information theory,
and pilot studies of auditory perceptual organization. The significance of this
research is that an understanding of perception, by a structured and principled
approach, may contribute to major advances in computer systems capable of
independently dealing with their environment by seeing, hearing, and other forms
of perception. The Presidential Young Investigator Awards provide research
funding to attract and support young researchers of the highest quality in the
university environment.
