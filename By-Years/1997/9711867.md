James N. Gregory Robert O. Self University of Washington The doctoral
dissertation research will examine the ways in which class and race shaped the
reorganization of work, residence and political economy in Oakland, California
between 1945 and 1977. The analysis focuses on two historical factors that
reconstituted Oakland's urban working class, dramatically shifted labor markets,
and reshaped the appearance of the city's industrial and residential
neighborhoods. These were the shift to services production and the in-migration
of African-American workers. The research methodology consists of a review of
the secondary literature on Oakland and the theoretical literature on race,
class and urban morphology. In addition an examination of archival records will
be undertaken. Finally a series of oral histories with members of Oakland's
economic development council and other similar organizations will be
accomplished. The research will contribute to a deeper understanding of race,
class in a changing urban milieu.
