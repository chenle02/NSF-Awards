The present award will support continued community planning for the RIDGE
initiative ( Ridge InterDisciplinary Global Experiments). The key scientific
objectives of this initiative are set forth in the National Academy of Sciences
Report, "The Mid-Ocean Ridge - A Dynamic Global System". The major goal of RIDGE
is to understand the geophysical, geochemical, and geobiological causes and
consequences of the energy transfer associated with the global ridge system and
the creation of new oceanic crust. Six high priority problem areas have been
defined for the RIDGE Program: *The flow of mantle,the generation of melt, and
the transport of magmas beneath mid-ocean ridges *The processes which transform
magma into oceanic crust *The processes that control the segmentation and
episodicity of lithosphere accretion *The physical, chemical, and biological
processes involved in the interactions between circulating seawater and the
solid lithosphere *The interactions of organisms with the physical and chemical
environments in submarine hydrothermal systems *The distribution and intensity
of mid-ocean hydrothermal venting and the influence which vents have on the
ocean environment The objective of the next two years of planning is to
translate the recommendations of the National Academy report into a
scientifically focused research program. The planning activity will involve both
U.S. and international marine scientists and will be coordinated through a U.S.
planning office at the University of Washington.
