Systems of interconnected populations (metapopulations) are likely to be the
rule rather than the exception in nature. Nevertheless, the study of natural
systems of interconnected populations has lagged behind theoretical
demonstrations of their potential importance. Coloniation, extinction, and
population interconnectedness play an important role in the dynamics of the
Silence alba/Ustilago violacea plant-fungal pathosystem. This system is
experimentally tractable and shows host genetic variation in resistance and
susceptibility,. The proposed research will continue the long-term monitoring of
metapopulation processes in natural populations, assess the effect of population
connectedness on local dynamics using experimental populations, and investigate
empirically and theoretically the effects of genetic compostion on
metapopulation dynamics of host-pathogen systems. The results will provide
information on the degree to which metapopulation processes influence host-
pathogen systems and how genetic variation in the component species affects
these processes. This system is of general interest because the metapopulation
concept provides a framework for understanding the consequences of habitat
fragmentation.
