In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Sharp will develop techniques to measure electron spin-
related properties of transition metal ions with total spin greater than one.
The electron spin physics will be probed indirectly by NMR spectroscopy. New
methods of orienting paramagnetic molecules in flow-stretched hydrogels will be
developed. Proof of concept experiments will be performed on paramagnetic
complexes with spin S = 1, 3/2 and 5/2 and used to test the underlying theory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological and biochemical systems often contain ions that
are characterized by electron spin. The total electron spin of these units plays
an important role in the behavior of these systems. While the theory for systems
with just one unbalanced electron spin is well developed, this is usually not
the case when transition metal ions are present. The goals of the present
project are to perform proof of concept experiments and thereby aid in the
development of a satisfactory theory. Students will participate in this
research. They will gain experience in one of the forefront areas of
contemporary physical chemistry and thereby prepare them for entry into the
scientific/technological workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
