Die casting is the most effective process to mass produce complex metal parts to
tight tolerance at low cost. However, the traditional die-casting process can
only produce near-net-shape, and always requires a secondary operation to trim
off overflows and gates. Further, a more serious problem (particularly for
complex parts) is the uncertainty of having porosity somewhere in the part
caused by turbulent flow during the process, which is difficult to detect. This
inherent disadvantage may have been a major factor in the slow growth of the
seven-billion-dollar industry which is facing stiff competition from other
processes like injection molding of plastics as well as foreign die-casting
producers, due to lack of technical edge. It is necessary to develop a process
that can produce net-shape parts akin to such processes as injection or transfer
molding of polymers. The idea is to make use of the so-called "semi-solid alloy"
(a slurry of solid particles suspended in a molten metal matrix) which has high
viscosity and can be processed in the laminar-flow regime. The main objectives
are to study the rheology of such materials, develop simulation models for flow
and solidification, and design a new machine for experiments. Successful
completion of this research would have a potential to revolutionize the die-
casting technology and provide our industry an edge over foreign competition in
this area.
