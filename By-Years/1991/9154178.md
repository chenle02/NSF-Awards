The Chautauqua Program is providing an annual series of workshops in which
scholars at the frontiers of various sciences and engineering meet for several
days with undergraduate college science and engineering faculty. These workshops
are providing an opportunity for invited scholars to communicate new knowledge,
concepts, and techniques directly to college faculty in ways which are
immediately beneficial to their teaching. The primary aim is to enable
undergraduate faculty in the sciences and engineering to keep their teaching
current and relevant.Date:Contact: Nicholas G. Eror, Dept. of Materials Science
