This award is for the support of the "Molecular and Genetic Organization of
Plant Chromosomes" symposium to be held August 16 at the Botanical Society of
America meeting at Davis, California. This short symposium has been held for
several years in order to expose non-molecular botanists to advances in plant
molecular research. Although the impact cannot be immediatly measured, the
exposure, particularly for young botanists could be extremely important.
