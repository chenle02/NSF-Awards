The objective of this work is to utilize the self-assembly and metal-binding
properties of a biological nanostructure, the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), in the
development of novel functional materials and fabrication processes for small-
scale energy microsystems applications. The TMV is a high aspect ratio
cylindrical plant virus that can be genetically engineered to include amino
acids with enhanced metal-binding properties. These genetic modifications
facilitate electroless plating of the molecules as well as self-assembly onto
various substrates. Particular emphasis will be placed on integrating the TMV
biofabrication into standard micromachining through the combination of bottom-up
and top-down approaches such as DNA-directed patterning, molecular self-
assembly, photolithography and thin-film deposition. The developed processes
will be readily incorporated in the fabrication of nanostructured small-scale
energy storage devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this proposal will
result in the realization of novel strategies for nanomanufacturing that
alleviate several limitations currently involved in the integration of
nanostructures into microsystems fabrication. The envisioned results are not
limited only in the field of energy, but can be used by researchers to develop
other types of devices where nanomaterials can mark a significant improvement,
such as sensors with high selectivity and sensitivity and miniaturized heat
dissipation components that can be integrated with commercial electronic
products. The wide range of scientific matters involved in this investigation
provides an ideal interdisciplinary "training matrix" for students from diverse
backgrounds interested in research and education careers by bringing together
aspects of science and engineering previously distinct from one
another.&lt;br/&gt;
