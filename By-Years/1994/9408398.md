9408398 Stoneking/ Stone The recovery of ancient DNA from human remains has
great potential to address anthropological issues concerning migration,
residence patterns and genetic relationships of ancient human populations. To
date, however, only a few researchers have applied these techniques to
archaeological questions. The technical issues are very difficult to resolve.
This project on a completely excavated cemetery, the Norris Farms #36 site in
Illinois, integrates genetcis, archaeology, and osteology in a new and powerful
way to analyze the social organization and genetics of pre- Columbian
poulations. It dates to 1300 A.D. and represents a "frontier" society of the
Oneonta cultural tradition. The DNA extracted from the skeletons will be used to
determine the sex and genetic relatedness of members of this society to clarify
aspects of social organization such as post- marital residence patterns, status
and cemetery organization. The project will also result in the effective
training of an excellent young researcher in this exciting area of research.
