This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the complex
networking challenge presented by the emerging cloud computing model. Cloud
providers must run a diverse set of client applications, each with potentially
different networking demands, on shared data-center facilities. Traditionally, a
datacenter network is configured to use the same routing process to choose the
"best" route for each flow in a datacenter, regardless of the application. For
example, Ethernet frequently performs shortest-path routing along a single
spanning tree. Yet data center networks typically exhibit significant
redundancy; routing along a single tree leaves many paths unused, sacrificing
potential gains in reliability, isolation and
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology switching moves beyond
this one-size-fits-all approach providing an architecture for fine-grained
multi-topology networking. It allows applications to create custom routing
systems within a data center; they can configure multiple logical topologies
that, together, are tailored to their reliability and performance requirements.
From a cloud provider's perspective, a topology-switched network increases
efficiency by multiplexing potentially hundreds of topologies across the same
shared physical network. The PIs are designing a scalable topology-switched
routing platform that facilitates the exploration of application interfaces,
management challenges, novel routing strategies, and performance benefits of
this approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the project aims to
develop a flexible topology management primitive that improves administrators'
ability to effectively manage extremely large datacenter deployments. The
research is also analyzing the benefits and costs of multi-topology networking.
Additional outcomes of this proposal include a public release of the topology
switching platform, enabling academic and industrial feedback and
adoption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
