Beasley/Abstract The objective of this research is an optical examination of
green thunderstorms using a spectral photometer to evalutate two competing
theories about the transmission, absorption and scattering of (visible) light in
and near thunderstorms. The observations will be made in Oklahoma during a
meteorological field experiment (VORTEX) designed to investigate tornados.
