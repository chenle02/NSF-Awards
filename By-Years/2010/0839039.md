"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interdisciplinary team of
researchers will focus on describing the high productivity patchiness observed
in phytoplankton blooms in the mid to late summer in the Ross Sea, Antarctica.
Key hypotheses to be tested and extended are that intrusions of nutrient and
micro nutrient (e.g. Fe) rich water masses of the Antarctic modified circumpolar
deep water (CDW) up onto continental shelves act to control the biogeochemical
response of a large area of the productive Ross Sea coastal region. It is
believed that this enhanced productivity may be a significant contributing
factor to the global carbon cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A novel sampling
strategy to be used to test the above hypotheses will employ a remotely
controlled deep (1000m) glider (AUV) to locate and map CDW in near real time
measuring C (conductivity), T (temperature), D (pressure) and apparent optical
properties, and which will serve to direct further ship-based sampling.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adaptive coordination of a polar research vessel with
an AUV additionally provides an opportunity to engage in formal and informal
education and public outreach on issues in polar research.
