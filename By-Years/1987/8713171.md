This proposal is for funding to cover partial cost of conducting the conference
"Global Manufacturing: Technological and Economic Opportunities, and Research
Issues" to be held at PRI in October 1987. The purpose of this conference is to
foster an awareness of the technical, managerial and policy issues, both
national and international, that are involved in global manufacturing and to
delineate a research agenda that will contribute to our understanding of the
complexities inherent in global manufacturing. To achieve this goal, scholars
actively engaged in research on the selected topics will be invited to be
speakers. The topics to be addressed will focus on the technical, economic and
public policy issues relating to the future of automated manufacturing, advances
in communications and computer technologies, management of human resources, and
national and international competition and cooperation. The speakers will be
from key industrial nations. Discussion of each topic will be led by a panel
composed of 3 to 5 individuals including a U.S. industrialist, a foreign
manufacturer, an academic, and a discussant/rapporteur who will prepare a
written synopsis of the panel proceedings, focusing on needs for research. The
proceedings of this conference will be published.
