Asian and North American summer monsoons play an important role in transporting
chemical constituents such as water vapor and pollutants into the upper
troposphere lower stratosphere (UTLS). The research objective of this CAREER
grant is to advance the understanding of the summer monsoon and its interaction
with the UTLS using observations and model hierarchies. The research component
will improve the understanding of the dynamical coupling of the troposphere and
stratosphere and its impact for surface extremes. It would provide new insights
into the troposphere-stratosphere exchange of chemical constituents. The
educational objective is to improve math and data analytics proficiency in both
high school and undergraduate education. The educational activities will involve
collaborations with local high school teachers and geoscience educators. The PI
will develop new learning activities for high school math classes by integrating
real-world atmospheric data and prompt active learning activities through data
analytics and visualizations in undergraduate courses in climate
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities will improve
the scientific understanding of the chemical, radiative and dynamical effects of
the UTLS on the climate system, and lead to improved understanding and
prediction of extreme weather events such as wind gust and extreme rainfall in
populated regions like Asia and North America. The educational activities will
improve high school students' capability in formulating and solving math
problems in real-world situations, and increase college students' performance in
classes and their completion of bachelor's degree in STEM. The educational
activities are along the lines with the Common Framework for Earth-Observation
Data, which was recently released by the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy to improve the public access to find, evaluate, understand,
and utilize Earth observations.
