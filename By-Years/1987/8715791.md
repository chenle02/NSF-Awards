This work is the continuation of solar seismology measurements using intensity
variarion techniques with a telescope based at the South Pole. These new
measurements will be made within the unprecidented angular resolution of 4 arc
seconds, and this combined with the long periods of continuous observations,
uncontaminatedby diurnal effects, promise fundamental advances in the
understanding of the sun's interior. The proposers are world leaders in
measurements of this nature, as are their institutions.
