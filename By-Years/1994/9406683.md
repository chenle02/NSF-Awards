9406683 Brown This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of an automated heating and freezing stage to be used for the
microscopic examination of fluid inclusions in geological samples. The
microscope stage will be used in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison. The University of Wisconsin is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition of the equipment.
The research of the Principal Investigator, colleagues, and students require
accurate and programmable temperature control of small samples under the
microscope. The Principal Investigator's research projects focus on the study of
fluid inclusions found in rocks containing gold deposits and are aimed at
understanding the chemical and physical processes that operate during the
formation of gold deposits. ***
