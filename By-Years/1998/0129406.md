This project will bring together knowledge and technology and refine them into
an Assessment Design and Delivery System (ADDS) for science learning. ADDS
provides both a set of tools and a testbed to investigate factors the impact
implementation, effectiveness, and scale-up. Specifically, ADDS provides (1)
utilities for individual teachers or teams of teachers to become designers and
users of assessments that actionable information to guide their practice and
student learning; (2) embeds content, assessment and pedagogical knowledge to
assist teachers in both designing assessments and interpreting student progress;
and (3) valid results for classroom-based inferences with the potential for
aggregation of results for policy uses.
