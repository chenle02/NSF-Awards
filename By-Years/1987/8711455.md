Symbioses between hermit crabs and sea anemones will be studied to determine
the interactions and adaptations that have evolved. Experiments will determine:
1) whether the numbers and locations of anemones on the gastropod shell affect
the survival of hermit crabs subjected to predation. 2) whether altering the
shell's center of gravity alters the placement of anemones by the hermit crabs.
3) whether hermit crabs will take anemones from another crab more often when a
predator is present. 4) whether hermit crabs will select shells with anemones
more often when a predator is present. 5) the chemosensory abilities of the
hermit crabs towards various predators and the anemone. 6) whether the anemone
is protected from starfish predation by being transported with the hermit crabs.
Such protection would demonstrate that this association represents mutualism.
