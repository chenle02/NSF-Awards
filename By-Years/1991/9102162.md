This award provides funds to coordinate the optical CEDAR community, in
particular experts in optical interferometry and spectroscopy, in order to
recommend instrumentations for the optical component of the Polar Cap
Observatory (PCO). The selection of instrumentations will be based upon a
consensus reached through workshops attended by experts in this field addressing
the need to 1) evaluate parameters and requirements for the interferometers and
spectrometers at the PCO, 2) indicate the current capabilities of present state
of the art instrumentation, and 3) estimate the costs for outfitting the PCO
with an appropriate complement of Class I interferometers and spectrometers.***
