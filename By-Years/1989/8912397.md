The focus of this research is on the adaptive identification and control of
complex nonlinear dynamical systems using neural networks. From the theoretical
point of view the main aim is to generate stable adaptive laws for the
adjustment of the parameters of the system. From the practical viewpoint the aim
is to generate control methods which yield high performance in complex
environments. The nonlinear nature of the neural networks makes stability
analysis of the overall system and extremely difficult task. Hence, it is
essential to confine our attention to a class of systems which have been shown
at least empirically to perform successfully. The research will consequently be
carried out in the following four stages: (i) determination of suitable dynamic
structures for identification and control models which are applicable to a wide
class of nonlinear plants, (ii) development of dynamic back propagation methods
for adjusting controller parameters, (iii) use of such methods to carry out
extensive computer simulations on the identification and control of complex
systems (iv) stability analysis of the class of systems which prove efficient in
(iii).
