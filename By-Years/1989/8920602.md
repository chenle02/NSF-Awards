The primary goad of this project is the development of signal processing
algorithms that reliably detect and image targets embedded in a medium of
stationary and randomly distributed scatterers. The major contribution of this
work is a detailed study of the relationship between scattering structures and
the phase behavior of back-scattered signals with respect to frequency and
space. Analytical investigations and computer simulations are being developed
for predicting the resultant signal features for noise and target echoes by
integrating the deterministic and statistical relationships between the signal
wavelength, scatterer size, and scatterer spatial distribution. Experimental
investigations are being carried out in parallel with the analytical analysis
and computer simulations. Data collected from various material samples with
known flaws, and statistical characterizations of the phase and amplitude
behavior over frequency and spatial variations are used to validate theoretical
predictions. In addition, design procedures are being examined for developing
adaptive nonlinear detectors that utilize frequency-diverse properties of the
signals. The results of this study will identify critical signal features for
the development of enhanced signal imaging and detection algorithms.
