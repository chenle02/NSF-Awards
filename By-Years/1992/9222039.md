This proposal seeks to explain movements of the body of the leech, Hirudo
medicinalis, in terms of the forces generated by its muscles and by the
arrangement of these muscles in the body wall. In addition to moving the animal,
these muscles also produce a stiff tube which constitutes a "hydrostatic
skeleton". There is no general theory for such a skeleton that would allow us to
predict the shape of the animal's body from the activity pattern of its motor
neurons. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to use a combination of
experimental measurements and numerical simulations to derive a quantitative
description of hydrostatic skeletons in general and of the leech in particular.
This study will proceed in three steps: 1. Describing leech movements in
biomechanical terms. Segmental volumes, muscular tensions, geometric
relationships of the muscles, internal pressures, and fluid flows will be
determined. 2. Developing an analytical model of hydrodynamic skeletons. The
current best model will be expanded to produce more realistic body forms, using
the physical measurements obtained above. 3. Refining the model by comparing its
performance to behaviors. Measurements during the production of simpler
behaviors (bending and shortening) will be used to determine parameters which
will tested by the model's ability to produce the more global behaviors
(swimming and shortening). Such a model should be applicable to other
hydroskeletons as well.***
