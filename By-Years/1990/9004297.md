This award provides approximately one-third the funding for the acquisition of
an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer to be installed in the
Department of Geology at Washington State University. Washington State
University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed. The
instrument's analytical capabilities for trace element and isotopic analysis are
well-suited to the study of various rock types as well as groundwater quality
problems. Housed in the Geoanalytical Laboratory at Washington State, the
facility will be used by a wide range of research projects in these areas of the
earth sciences and will serve as a regional resource for northwest scientists
from a number of research institutions.
