Bacterivory is a key process in understanding the flux of matter and energy
through the microbial loop and the control of bacterial abundance in the oceans.
Of the various approaches to measuring grazing impact on bacteria, three of the
most promising and widely used methods - inhibitors, dilution, and fluorescent
particles - rest on tenuous assumptions regarding the effects of experimental
manipulations on the behaviors on bacterial consumers. The primary objective of
this study is to develop recombination-deficient, UV sensitive strains of marine
bacteria (i.e. cells that will continue to function but cannot divide following
brief exposure to UV light). These cells will be used to test the assumptions of
the field methods and elucidate feeding behaviors (e.g. size selection) of
bacterivorous protozoa. Bacteria are ubiquitous in the marine environment and
range in concentration from hundreds of thousands to millions per cubic
centimeter. However, our understanding of the nature and impact of marine
bacteria on marine biological systems is limited. For example, the degree to
which bacteria are eaten by larger marine organisms and fuel production in the
marine food web is unclear. This is mainly due to the difficulty in quantifying
grazing rates on these minute organisms. This work will apply a novel
application of biotechnology to the study of bacterial grazing. Bacteria will be
genetically altered so that after exposure to a small amount of a certain kind
of light (called ultraviolet), the bacteria will not be able to divide, although
they will continue to function. Thus, such altered bacteria can serve as analogs
for normal bacteria and grazing rates can be estimated from their rate of
disappearance. In addition to the importance of making better measurements of
such rates, this type of biotechnology may prove useful in a variety of other
oceanographic applications.
