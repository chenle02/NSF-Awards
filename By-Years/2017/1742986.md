NSF actively promotes the inclusion of students in technical conferences and in
the advancement of scientific research. To this affect the PI requests that the
CCSS program, within the ECCS Division of the Engineering Directorate at the
NSF, sponsor a select number of students to participate in the 7th IEEE
International Conference on Nanotechnology, to be held in Pittsburgh, PA on July
25-28, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student Travel Fellowship is requested for the
2017 IEEE Nanotechnology Conference for domestic student (undergraduate and
graduate) participants and presenters. The conference, which has been held
sixteen times previously, brings together researchers and educators focused on
developing nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to space,
electronic, magnetic, sensor, and photonic devices and systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested support will be used to provide partial
travel stipends for student participants at the conference, specifically student
presenters in an organized session. NSF funding will be used to support travel,
of domestic graduate and undergraduate students in the form of hotel
accommodation. Fifteen (15) student participants will receive funding to support
their participation in the 7th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology.
