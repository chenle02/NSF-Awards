9414434 Narayan Pulsed laser and ion-assisted pulsed laser deposition techniques
will be developed to deposit coatings of hydrogen-free diamondlike carbon, cubic
boron nitride, and carbon nitride on 52100 steel, silicon, and intermetallic
compounds. The films will be fully characterized by various surface analysis
techniques and by TEM, and their hardness, adhesion, and tribological properties
will be determined ***
