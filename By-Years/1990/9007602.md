The project has three parts: Efficient algorithms for random sampling from
convex sets in Euclidean space using the theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains
and the applications of such algorithms. Lattice relaxations of Integer
Programming problems that produce better bounding procedures and related lattice
questions. Strongly polynomial time algorithms for the greatest common divisor
and genealizations.
