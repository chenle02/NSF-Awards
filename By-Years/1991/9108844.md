The Computer Aided Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE)Center For Electronic
Packaging is presently an NSF/IUCRC, with an annual budget of over $900,000. The
activities of the existing Center will be expanded to conduct research and
development of high volume, highly-reliable and internationally competitive
commercial electronic products. The program will incorporate cost effectiveness,
producibility and supportability as well as high reliability, into a concurrent
product development process to enhance the economic development and
competitiveness of the electronic industry in the United States.
Manufacturability, product yield, quality, reliability and life cycle costs will
be addressed concurrently during the design phase, and there will be rapid
transfer of improved methods, technologies and logistics into product
development. To accomplish this, the Center research is organized into four
interdisciplinary research thrust areas, each with defined core and non-core
activities: (1) design development for product performance; (2) product
producibility and supportability; (3) life cycle modeling and assessment; and
(4) experimentation and validation. The results will be transferred directly to
the industrial members through developed software, guidelines and standards. New
technologies will be incorporated directly into software through improved
algorithms and enhanced databases which will in turn aid industry's capability
to achieve designs for improved producibility, reliability and supportability.
Technology transfer activities include workshops, short courses, training and
consulting sessions at local community colleges and state-sponsored
organizations for small-business initiatives, in addition to current technology
transfer activities at the CALCE Center and at member sites. The State of
Maryland, industry and NSF will provide matching funds totalling $750,000 in the
first year.
