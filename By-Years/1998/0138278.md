AST-0138278&lt;br/&gt;Persson, Sven E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical
development and acquisition of six 2048x2048 HAWAII-2RG detectors for the
Carnegie's DEEPSIX instrument to be used at Las Campanas will be completed. This
is a large format near infrared camera for the F5.4 focus of the Magellan II 6.5
meter telescope. A significant fraction of the observing time is dedicated to
large area deep surveys, including a number of programs carried out in concert
with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. A broad cross-section of the US
community of astronomers will be engaged with this work. &lt;br/&gt;***
