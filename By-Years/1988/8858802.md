This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of Bruce Porter at
the University of Texas at Austin. Porter's research is focused on the
construction and use of computer programs which are capable of learning and
solving problems with considerable autonomy. Such programs are capable of
acquiring significant knowledge and evolving into effective "expert systems."
The significance of this research is that effective computer systems in a wide
variety of applications must utilize extensive and specific knowledge about the
application - not just general algorithmic or problem solving techniques.
Computer systems such as those developed by Porter, capable of learning and
acquiring knowledge independently, will play a key role. The Presidential Young
Investigator Awards provide research funding to attract and support young
researchers of the highest quality in the university environment.
