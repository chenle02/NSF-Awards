To meet future needs for a convenient simulation environment with higher
computing speed and large problem size, this Small Grant for Exploratory
Research (SGER) will combine a direct-executing language with a new low cost
multi-processor environment. The multi-processor system is based on AT-type
single-board computers. This will: 1. permit solution of large problems 2.
increase execution speed with parallel processing, and 3. give a group of
graduate student new insight into multi-processor hardware and software
problems, including dynamic model partitioning.
