In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven J. Sibener of The University
of Chicago addresses several key issues in surface reaction dynamics, leading to
advances in the fundamental understanding of molecular reactivity at interfaces.
This scientific program has direct implications for advanced materials
fabrication, heterogeneous catalysis, combustion, and the design of protective
thin film coatings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on surface
chemical dynamics that include site specific reactivity, adiabatic and non-
adiabatic gas-surface interactions such as dissociative chemisorption including
energy dissipation and surface mobility, directionally-controlled deposition and
film growth, and geometry-constrained and stereo-specific reaction studies in
which energetic atomic species react with molecules that are pre-aligned due to
the nature of their bonding and film structure. This is being accomplished using
a combination of supersonic molecular beams, scanning tunneling/atomic force
microscopy, and surface spectroscopies. Comparisons with theory and numerical
simulations provide precision tests of calculated reaction potential energy
surfaces and mechanistic reaction pathways. Direct visualization of reacting
interfaces helps to reveal site-specific reactivity and spatio-temporal
correlations as a function of local structure and reaction extent. In these
studies, precise control over reagent energy, incident angle, intensity, and
quantum state are applied. Interfacial chemistry is examined under non-
equilibrium conditions. Societal broader impact occurs via outreach to the local
minority community, including local public, charter, and private schools, and
museum science activities that have substantial representation from
underrepresented south-side Chicago populations.
