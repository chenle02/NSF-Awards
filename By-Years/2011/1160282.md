The grant will support student travel to the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on
Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI'12) and a pre-conference
workshop on discussing collaboration in research and education between US and
Chinese researchers, titled Trends in Concurrency (TiC'12). The main conference,
PLDI, is being held in Beijing, China. PLDI is a top conference in the field of
programming language and compiler technology. Supporting student travel to
attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the
NSF. Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this
research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a
globally-aware workforce.
