Research at the highly mathematical end of theoretical elementary particle
physics will focus on string theory, conformal quantum field theories,
integrable systems, quantum symmetries, and related topics. String theory is a
promising framework for the consistent unified description of all particles and
forces, including gravity. Conformal field theories provide the ground (i.e.,
"normal") states of the world for string theory. String theory raises numerous
highly mathematical issues, and studies of the type to be undertaken here will
aid in addressing them, and thus facilitate the progress of the field.
