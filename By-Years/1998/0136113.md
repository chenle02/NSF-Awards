0136113&lt;br/&gt;Holton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce a
lexical database and associated dictionary of Tanacross, an Athabascan language
spoken in eastern interior Alaska. Tanacross is among the least documented of
the Alaska Athabascan languages, and no previous lexical documentation project
has been undertaken. Data will be collected both via elicitation and from
recorded texts and compiled into a lexical database. This database will be used
to generate a printed dictionary and will serve as the basis for an electronic
version of the dictionary. The resulting dictionary and database will contribute
both to our understanding of the Athabascan family of languages and to ongoing
Tanacross language revitalization efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
