In many species of flowering plants, rates of outcrossing and gen dispersal
vary markedly across a range of spatial scales. Researchers have often
attributed this variation to ecological factors that influence pollinator
movements. However, very little is known about the ways in which these variables
affect the mating system of individual plants. The proposed research
investigates the influence of population density on patterns of paternity in
Mimulus ringens. This native perennial is readily cloned, facilitating the
establishment of replicate populations of genetically distinct individuals. All
plants in each experimental population will have unique enzyme phenotypes,
permitting assignment of paternity to all sampled offspring. Studies of
pollinator movements, flowering phenology, and seed yield will be combined with
detailed paternity data to test a series of predictions derived from ecological
and evolutionary theory. In addition, this study will provide an exceptionally
detailed description of individual variation in outcrossing rates, gene
dispersal, and male fertility and will document the influence of ecological
factors on the patterns observed.
