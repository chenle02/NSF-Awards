This continuing grant supports U.S.-France cooperative research in astronomy
between Kevin Prendergast of Columbia University and Evangelie Athanassoula of
the Marseille Observatory. The objective of their research is to develop
numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies using a three-
fluid model for the stars, the gas and dark matter. Star formation, mass loss,
wind and supernova heating, and radiative cooling of gas are included in their
numerical code. The investigators propose to continue their research on dwarf
ellipticals and to extend the numerical code to spiral and giant elliptical
galaxies. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his expertise in
numerical simulations. This is complemented by the French investigator's
experience in coding, debugging and production. The project takes advantages of
French facilities, which include Cray, Sun, Vax and Microvax computers, and
utilizes French software for running these programs. This research project will
advance understanding of the formation of galaxies and the structure of the
universe. The proposed numerical techniques are unique and may be used for other
problems in astrophysics.
