Large-scale data analytics is essential to the National Strategic Computing
Initiative (NSCI) and NSF's scientific discovery mission. Data-intensive
supercomputing applications are increasingly important for high performance
computing workloads. Current benchmarks and performance metrics do not provide
useful information on suitability of computing systems for data-intensive
applications. &lt;br/&gt;This research effort will produce a new Stream500
benchmark, complementary to Graph500, that replicates streaming analytics
workload. The current benchmark capabilities will be expanded by enabling the
exiting web-based infrastructure to accept submissions for multiple benchmarks.
