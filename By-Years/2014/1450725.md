The objective of this project is to conduct a feasibility study on a new type of
optical switch. If the proposed technique is successful this EAGER project will
impact a key component in optical communication, and data centers in particular.
By harnessing a radically different switching mechanism, the electric field
induced dynamic waveguiding effect in nanodisordered potassium tantalate niobate
(KTN) crystals, the PI hopes to obtain optical switching performance that cannot
be achieved through current technologies.

Traditional optical switches designed for data center and optical communication,
and based on changing the phase in the travelling path, produce an interference
that switches from constructive to destructive as the phase is varied. Such a
switch is limited in that it operates at a specific wavelength of light. In the
proposed research the on-off switching could be efficiently achieved with very
low switching power, and for a broad range of wavelengths. The project will
check the feasibility of such a concept by fabricating and characterizing a 1x2
switch. Since data centers (in particular) require a growing number of switches,
and are faced with growing power consumption limitations there is a critical
need for such a technology. With the selection of nanocrystal potassium
tantalate niobate (KTN) the proposed work has the potential to produce ultra-
fast switching with low power consumption, in a broadband transmission, while
maintaining low cross talk, high extinction ratio and small footprint.
